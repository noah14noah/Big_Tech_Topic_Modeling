But the statement is notable not so much for its content as for what it reveals about how U.S. CEOs think. Apparently, the U.S.'s corporate leaders believe they can decide freely whom they serve. But as agents, rather than principals, that decision really isn't theirs to make.</p><p>The fact that American CEOs think they can choose their own masters attests not just to their own sense of entitlement, but also to the state of Corporate America, where power over globe-spanning business empires is concentrated in the hands of just a few men (and far fewer women). As a matter of corporate law, CEOs are appointed by a company's directors, who in turn are elected by that company's shareholders every year. In practical terms, though, most directors remain on the board for years on end, as do the officers they appoint.</p><p>For example, Jamie Dimon, the chairman of the Business Roundtable's own board of directors, has been at the helm of JPMorgan Chase for more than 15 years. During most of that time, he has served as both CEO and chairman of the board of directors, in contravention of corporate-governance principles that recommend separating these two positions.</p><p>By capturing the process to which they owe their own positions, American CEOs have made a mockery of shareholder control. The Business Roundtable itself has long favoured plurality over majority voting, which means that incumbent board members need only receive more votes than anybody else, rather than a majority. At the same time, the organization has fought the Securities and Exchange Commission tooth and nail to block a rule that would allow shareholders to write in their own candidates when votes are solicited. And it continues to try to weaken shareholders' ability to propose agenda items for shareholder meetings.</p><p>In short, for the Business Roundtable and the CEOs it represents, shareholder primacy has never meant shareholder democracy. Instead, the shareholdervalue model has given CEOs cover to avoid discussing corporate strategy, especially when it comes to considering alternatives to the share price as a metric for corporate performance.</p><p>For CEOs, the share price is everything, because it protects the company from takeovers (the greatest threat to incumbent managers), and it increases their own remuneration.</p><p>Why, then, would CEOs come out against a status quo that has allowed them to reign almost unchallenged, in favour of a stakeholder-governance model that puts employees and the environment on an equal footing with shareholders? The answer is that revolutions often devour their children. Share-price primacy has not only ceased to protect CEOs in the way it once did; it has become a threat.</p><p>After all, it is one thing to champion shareholders when they are too dispersed to organize themselves. It is quite a different matter when shareholders have assembled into blocs with effective veto power and the ability to co-ordinate in pursuit of common goals. Some 74 per cent of JPMorgan Chase's shares are held by institutional investors, five of which - including Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street - control one-third of total shares. And JPMorgan isn't alone.</p><p>Recent research in the U.S. shows that the same few global asset managers are top shareholders at almost all of the largest financial intermediaries, Big Tech firms and airline companies.</p><p>For CEOs, the emergence of powerful shareholder blocs has changed the corporate-governance game. With trillions of dollars of savings that need to be invested, institutional investors simply cannot be ignored. Even if asset managers do not actively involve themselves in corporate governance, they can still send a powerful signal to the market simply by dumping shares.</p><p>For years, the shareholder-primacy model led CEOs to eke out profits through outsourcing or labour-force downsizing, regulatory and tax arbitrage, and stock buybacks that shower cash on shareholders at the expense of investing in their companies' future. But now, they have finally realized that these strategies are better for institutional investors than they are for the sustainability of firms.</p><p>Confronted with the headwinds they themselves generated, American CEOs seem to have concluded that the best defence is a good offence. But if they are serious about abandoning the shareholder-primacy model, public statements will not suffice. They must also support legal reforms, particularly the measures needed to hold corporate directors and officers accountable to the principals they serve.</p><p>That could mean extending board representation to employees and other stakeholders, or it could take the form of special audits, along the lines of those to which public benefit corporations submit.</p><p>Either way, if the new stakeholder model is going to amount to more than the old charade of \"shareholder democracy,\" the principals themselves must be involved in setting up the new regime. If we leave it for the agents to decide for themselves, we will end up right back where we started.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20190827sbrbcopistorshareholders</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WX6-7G01-F06S-31B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"895\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

The report spoke of what the board is aimed at, how it is structured, and provided an analysis of Facebook's record on free speech. Separately funded, the board is not supposed to be under Facebook's control. It will provide independent reviews of content and act as a \"supreme court\" for people appealing against its internal review processes for taking down objectionable content. It can override decisions taken by Facebook's own internal watchdogs and committees. This won't include sovereign government requests, for which it has a separate process.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The board will now have over 20 members from across the globe, including Sudhir Krishnaswamy, vice-chancellor of National Law School of India University in Bangalore, human rights advocates, a former US judge, a former prime minister of Denmark and a Yemeni Nobel laureate.</p><p>For now, the board will focus only on Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram. Its aegis may expand to include its other platforms, like WhatsApp, but the real story lies in the impact it is likely to have on the internet per se. For some time now, a debate has been raging on whether online social networks are just conduits for free speech or whether they are reporters of news, which would call for stricter governmental control and make them liable for acts of defamation and libel. Plus, such platforms have also been acting as conduits for actual news, often without acknowledging or paying news organizations for content. This has put Facebook, Google's YouTube, and others in the crosshairs of regulators in many countries. In Europe, they recently ruled that Google needs to pay news organizations for showing their content on its searches.</p><p>Facebook's move is smart. Firms with immense market power are better-off self-regulating, before official bodies impose fines or clamp down. At the extreme end, large companies may possibly be broken up, as happened in the past to firms such as AT&amp;T and IBM. But it seems likely to me that other governments will see Facebook's model as a good way to introduce legislation that requires internet companies to form similar oversight devices. The danger of it lies in the creation of yet another layer of red tape and reporting requirements before the internet has a chance to truly discover how such mechanisms could self-correct.</p><p>If internet platforms with contentious content, such as YouTube, Snapchat and TikTok, see that governmental regulation could take a course that their lobbying cannot stop, they will look for another way to head off regulation. Investing in Facebook's oversight board and submitting to its authority could be just the opportunity they are looking for.</p><p>This would leave the policing of internet content in private hands, just as the internet domain system was privatized in 1998. This was originally run by the US Department of Commerce, until it realized that website name control was a global issue best left in private hands.</p><p>All this noise about a global oversight organization should not take our attention away from the front line in the war against reprehensible content. People with sick minds are everywhere, including on the internet, and routinely post hate speech, child pornography, crime videos, and live streams of the torture, maiming and killing of animals and humans online. Facebook, YouTube and others, in representations, have argued that artificial intelligence (AI) will be able to police such content and not allow it onto their platforms.</p><p>The sad truth is that AI is nowhere near being able to vet and keep out objectionable content the way it needs to be. And this is where the true travesty of Big Tech's Janus-like approach lies. Last year, a disturbing report on theverge.com pointed to the underbelly of policing content in the world of social networks online.</p><p>Facebook and other social network firms allegedly do not pay much attention to their workers-or those of contracted firms-who monitor their gigantic sites for objectionable content.</p><p>The aforementioned report presented a chilling and disturbing view of the operations of an information technology service provider retained by Facebook to monitor content on its platform. Evidently, at least one employee died of a heart attack suffered while he was at work. These guardians of our mental health are poorly paid and frequently have to endure audio-visual content that graphically depicts people's inhumanity towards fellow humans and other sentient beings. The job of the censors who must see all this is unenviable, for it is they who must expunge the horrors that twisted human beings put up online and whose decisions Facebook's new \"supreme court\" will now sit in judgment of.</p><p>It may be true that advances in AI will relieve workers of the trauma that these jobs could inflict, and the sooner such technology can help the process of filtering out stuff that should not be available to anyone in the world, the better.</p><p>But we cannot let vague promises about the future of AI, and the politically strategic but still sanctimonious setting up of independent oversight boards, give social media platforms a pretext to turn a blind eye to the mental torture faced by real human beings who are toiling on the front line of internet content control.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

Very excited to have founder and Chief Executive Officer of Opower, Daniel Yates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DANIEL YATES, CO-FOUNDER, CEO, OPOWER INC.: Thanks for having me.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GREG DUNHAM: Well, thank you. Opower-- brand new public company; came public early in 2014. Don't know if the audience is very familiar with kind of what you guys do. But maybe give us the two- to three-minute overview of why you founded the Company, what problems are you trying to solve, and how we should think about the opportunity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DANIEL YATES: Absolutely. Definitely see some familiar faces here in the audience. So there's some who know this story well; others may be hearing it for the same time.</p><p>I co-founded this Company about eight years ago with my good friend and Opower's President, Alex Laskey. And we at the time had a simple vision, or idea, which was that people didn't know enough about their energy use. And if we could give people better information, we could help people save energy.</p><p>And that's how the Company started. It started with a product focused around using the power of information to drive large-scale reductions in energy consumption. And we've had great success with that. We ended this last year delivering 2.7 terawatt hours of energy savings, significantly exceeding all of our utilities clients' energy efficiency mandated goals, on average.</p><p>So really delivering for our clients. And I would put this in perspective. Solar City customer, a company many of us know well, one of -- the largest residential solar installer, by my calculations is generating less than half that amount of energy compared to the amount that we've saved. So we have really delivered on our goal of being a significant contributor to emissions reduction while building a big business. That was the first chapter of the Company.</p><p>Welcome Thomas Kramer, our CFO, who (inaudible) the mic as we speak.</p><p>What I'm excited about today is how much further we've taken the Company since that idea in 2007. In the position that we've been in in the market we've been able now to work with nearly 100 utilities, mostly in the US but all over the globe, out of the 100 utilities worldwide. And we're working with many of the largest utilities on earth. So our customers, our utility clients, they serve 135 million end customers, which represents about 20% of the overall market. So we're working with many of the leaders globally.</p><p>And in working with them, and as we've developed new applications and have expanded our technology platform, they've come back to us over and over again, saying, how can you take what you have, this capability and behavior change in a mass market engagement, and apply it to all of our other customer touch points? Because let's face it, we haven't historically been customer-focused. We don't really know how to get things done in that domain and we are under increasing pressure to do so.</p><p>And that's one of the exciting and perhaps not obvious dynamics in the energy industry, is that utilities are really becoming globally much more customer-focused, and it's a secular trend that's driving a lot of their investment and their attention.</p><p>And so what we've done now is take this starting position and evolved it, and this is our ambition now -- to be the company that leads the transformation of how utilities serve their customers for everything, ranging from billing to outage to call center activities to customer life cycle move-in move-out. And continuing to expand from this center of strength with demand management.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: And let's hit on that a little bit. Why haven't the utilities focused on the consumers as customers historically? What is driving the change, and what's the technology that they're using today to interact with their customers, and what's going to cause them to change?</p><p>DANIEL YATES: Yes. The 1980 utility paradigm was very simple. It was demand is going up as a critical starting assumption, and so I need to build new stuff. And when I build stuff, whether it's a power plant or new transmission lines or distribution lines, I get to rate-base that, which means I get to charge my customers for that infrastructure and get a return on investments.</p><p>And what's happened now is all across the developed world, demand isn't going up. So utilities can't just keep building stuff. Environmental mandates, some of which include what drives our efficiency business but others that are totally unrelated, are shutting down coal plants and driving up the cost to provide electricity at the current stable not-growing levels that it's at.</p><p>And increasingly across the globe, whether here in the US, and particularly here at PG&amp;E, where you're seeing customers switch to Solar City from their utility, or in other parts of the world where you can compete and actually people can choose their provider just like they choose their bank or their cell phone carrier, they're facing competition.</p><p>So it's earnings pressure from no growth in demand. It's the environmental mandates that are driving this cost up even further. And then, it's this competitive threat, that all combined utilities are realizing they have to switch.</p><p>Let me give you an anecdote. So I was just with Bob Powers, the CEO of AEP, which is American Electric Power. It serves almost, I think, 11 states in the Midwest. This is a coal-burning meat-eating utility. He has no interest in energy efficiency and previous meetings I've had with him, he has been somewhat like this as I've talked to him about our efficiency programs.</p><p>And I sat down with him last week because he had -- I'd talked to him about our new capabilities that we're exploring around customer engagement and helping [redo] costs to serve. And he lit up. His No. 1 priority -- and this guy has got this religion the last two years -- is around JD Powers scores. Because in his words, he said, I've always been an engineer and I always figured my customers will love me if I just keep the lights on. And it's come home to roost, and I admit it now -- have the highest reliability scores in the country and my customers hate me. It's not just about reliability; I've got to serve them better. And this is what I'm focused on -- how can you help me drive up customer sat?</p><p>And that was just, like, when AEP and Bob Powers is focused on this, it means that our industry, writ large, is focused on these issues.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: And then from a technology perspective, what are they doing today? I think a lot of investors, they see the output -- what Opowerdoes. But they don't understand the technology underneath for what enables that output. So help investors understand why this is difficult, to do what you do. Why can't somebody else just kind of -- why can't the utilities invest and have a [best CRM] analytic solution that does this?</p><p>DANIEL YATES: And a lot of investors I talk to have experienced our very first product, which has wide distribution and it is, by design, very memorable, which is our paper home energy report. And by dint of how we focused our business, a lot of what we've developed since then may or may not be as -- not visible by the consumer per se. Because we are building a real enterprise software technology suite here and the consumer touch points are the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Our platform sits on top of these legacy back-end systems and it sucks in data from them -- the billing system, the meter data management system, call center data -- and we integrate that on an ongoing basis as frequently as every few hours. We get data flows from each of our 100 utilities and we have 400 billion rows of smart meter data that we can run analytics on.</p><p>And then, we have a whole suite of utility-facing interfaces. So we have business intelligence, we have sophisticated segmentation and targeting and customer subscription capabilities to decide who gets which communications.</p><p>And then on top of that, we have all of the digital communications -- the Web, the mobile, the outbound, the triggered emails. And then of course, the paper reports.</p><p>It's kind of like some mix of GRM and Marketo that has a lot of advanced capabilities now. And again, it sits on top of these legacy systems, extending their life cycle.</p><p>So there's just a lot of tech there. I'll add a couple of other data points. There's a bunch of APIs and service-[oriented] architecture. And some of our deals we've won recently -- we announced one in Q3 -- we have other partners, actually, deploying their capabilities on our platform where one of them, for example in this latest deal, needs data to serve to provide their features, and all of the data -- their customer data they're getting -- is through a secure authenticated API access through our platform.</p><p>So we've enabled those kind of capabilities, and we've enabled tremendous pro-serve enhancement capabilities, which is strengthening our relationships with Accenture and other SIs.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: So when you don't win a deal, who -- is it that you lose to somebody or is it more status quo?</p><p>DANIEL YATES: We don't lose very often, so we don't have a lot of -- competitive threats is not a major concern of mine on a daily basis. What we have focused on, and part of why I'm so excited about this new -- or, this clarified three -- five-year technology vision -- is that we want to have more products to sell to more customers more quickly. And for us, status quo is when we're set back; not competitive loss.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: One of the things that immediately jumps to investors' minds is they hear the 130 million, and they think, holy cow, these guys are already in -- already have big penetration. Can you talk about when you win and a customer says, we've developed -- the penetration in that existing utility may be actually pretty small. What's the governor to you expanding?</p><p>And what's the range of outcomes? Can you get to 50%, 70%? How do you get the penetration rate up?</p><p>DANIEL YATES: Yes. Let me start with, actually the simplest view. We calculate our TAM to be about $11 billion, and that is a mix of energy efficiency, demand response, and customer care funding. We're only looking at residential and small, medium business.</p><p>Now within that, then, the question comes, what is our total serviceable market? I will, in a moment, go into it in sort of a line-by-line basis. But I actually think the easiest way to look at this is we have solutions like efficiency that price between $7 and $10 a home a year. We have demand response at $4 to $5. And then our customer engagement solution today is typically between $1 and $1.50. (I'm really emotional about the last $0.50.)</p><p>We're about to launch another product which we're announcing next week at PowerUp, our customer conference, which will also be in that kind of $1 to $1.50 range; will be certainly $1.50 or more. And those last two solutions will be applicable to absolutely every utility on earth.</p><p>So I'd say that in contrast to the demand response energy efficiency, there are some penetration questions within a utility as well as within regions.</p><p>So putting that aside for a moment, if you just take all of that and say -- gross underestimate, let's just call it $3 per home per year. I've got 700 million addressable home and small business customers. I've got 1200 utilities. If I take even just the top 600 utilities and I say those are the guys I'm going after, and I look at -- so first of all, they've got a $2 billion total serviceable market.</p><p>Then if I look at them and say, what's the replacement cycle on this customer stuff? Let's call it five to seven years. Okay, so average that at six -- 600 utilities -- I've got 100 a year, $3 a home, a million homes utility in this group -- I've got about $300 million of opportunity every year to go after. That is plenty of space to go after.</p><p>Now with that as a backdrop, let's go talk about efficiency and demand response. The reality is the efficiency market is very robust in the US. It's about $6 billion a year in the US alone. That includes some stuff that we can't touch, but we have 30 states in the US that have efficiency mandates, and that's where we get to play.</p><p>And within those, with our most penetrated customers we are 100% penetrated. On average, we're still only 10% penetrated. I don't think we will get to 100% penetrated, but we have a tremendous amount of headroom ahead of us.</p><p>So what drives the efficiency dynamics specifically -- and it's worth discussing because it's 70% of our business -- is really the goals that are set by the utility commissions. They're not buying penetration, what they're buying is gigawatt hours. And so on a per-utility basis we work with them and their portfolio manager, their efficiency portfolio manager, to figure out how big of an allocation we can get. And then we sell that, and we do that year in and year out.</p><p>I'll stop there.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: Well, one of the examples was the Maryland utility that you announced earlier this year that moved up their penetration rate dramatically.</p><p>DANIEL YATES: That's right.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: And so you have some data points.</p><p>DANIEL YATES: We've had a big efficiency expansion every quarter last year. So we had ComEd in Q1, we had PepCo in Q2, we had a big EE deal in Q3 that -- the utility hasn't been named. We'll be announcing another one in Q4, and we expect to see the same trajectory through 2015. And we're actually now excited to say we're getting -- we're starting to sign some efficiency deals overseas, too. So we'll be announcing some of those.</p><p>So that business is thriving and we have a lot of up side there.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: And I want to ask Thomas a question, but before we get to that, one of the questions that we've gotten with Opowerand the falling oil prices -- and even natural gas has been volatile, too. How does that affect you? How does that affect the energy mandates? And help investors understand your --</p><p>DANIEL YATES: It's just a misunderstanding. Oil comprises less than 1% of the fuel for generating energy in the US. It's just a no-op. It has no impact on our business.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: And what about natural gas?</p><p>DANIEL YATES: Natural gas prices came down something like three years ago now and it had also, effectively, no impact on our business. And we've been playing in that market, in that environment.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: Okay. Switching gears a little bit, the other question I get is, what's the business model? You actually have a very recurring revenue business. Talk to me -- when you do contract with utilities, how is it typically structured? What's the invoicing cycle?</p><p>Because one of the points of confusion from some investors is, well, should I look at billing at the leading indicator on the business? What's the metric that I should look at to judge how growth is progressing?</p><p>THOMAS KRAMER, CFO, OPOWER INC.: That's an excellent point. Also going back to what Dan just said, the $300 million, which is the opportunity per year, is an incremental opportunity. Because when we sell it once, we go back and get the same revenue the next year on a subscription basis. Which means that there really is a lot of room for us to grow.</p><p>And the way we grow is that we will go to a utility and sell them in a pilot. A pilot is typically 20,000 to 50,000 households; get around $0.5 million on that first year. Once we have shown that this works, we will go back and sell them additional households on the energy efficiency solution, and we'll also extend the contract for several years.</p><p>Our average contract is about 24 months in length and about $1 million in size. And so this is very important for us because we know -- we have very good visibility into our future revenue, which is also -- when we announce guidance we know, to a very strong degree, where we're going to end up. We have about 87% 12-month forward visibility, which is exceedingly high.</p><p>And then, when it comes to -- what you should look at billing and invoicing is, it is different to sell $10 million deals and $7,000 deals. If you sell a small ticket item the terms are very standard deal to deal, and you have enough of it and it will average out.</p><p>We sell large contracts, and when we go in and we talk to the utilities, we agree on a price and we also agree on billing terms, and they will differ from contract to contract. Which means that you will have lumpiness, not just in our bookings but also in our billings.</p><p>So when you look at, for instance, the largest deal we sold in Q1 was billed partially in Q1 and then again in Q2. Now, the largest deal we sold in Q2, we actually billed first in Q2 and then it skipped a quarter and it billed again in Q4.</p><p>And so what you will see is that in normal smaller ticket item sales, you will just have a very flat billings curve. But we will have situations where you will see that we will have a large billings quarter and then we will have a quarter that isn't large. And so if you looked at our Q3, for instance, you would have seen a drop in billings and in deferred. And what we said was, this is completely -- actually every earnings call we've had, we've said, don't look at our deferred because you will see variability.</p><p>And you saw it in Q3 -- we also announced it's going to come back up to normal. And it will. And in the future it will also have another dip, and it will come back.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: Okay; helpful. What do you typically see on renewal from a pricing perspective? We talked about this expansion -- how about a like-for-like pricing dynamic to date?</p><p>DANIEL YATES: We've seen -- like solid price, the ability to maintain price solidly writ large. And that's increasingly important with our increasingly largest customers. And what's driving it is actually a lot of the stuff that I just described; we're giving them more and more value. And then, what we're actually seeing in essentially every one of those conversations is additional expansion.</p><p>I was just walking through -- we have a slide from our IPO deck that we had three large clients and showed their history of expansion, where they were all starting at $0.5 million or down -- between $200,000 and $2 million four years ago. At the IPO, we were showing they had expanded to between $6 million and $12 million. A year later now -- these are some of our largest customers -- each of those have expanded again, and the $12 million one is up at $16 million per year. So these are, like $50 million, $60 million deals. The $10 million one's at $12.8 million. The $6.2 million one's gone up to $7 million. So we're not just renewing, we're renewing and increasing.</p><p>THOMAS KRAMER: When I walk into renewal discussions, I like to walk out of there with more money than I walked in with. And we're doing that with all of our customers, pretty much.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: The other dynamic that was kind of noteworthy in 2014 was you ramped up your sales capacity investment. Can you talk about why? And what's the timing of when those reps are going to actually drive bookings? And where are you targeting some of those capacity investments?</p><p>DANIEL YATES: Yes. We had 20 reps at the beginning of 2014 and we targeted 37 reps for the end of the year. In Q3, really, where we last reported, we were on track and it's been a smooth process to get great reps on the team.</p><p>It takes about 18 months from the time you hire a rep till you start to see billings from that rep. And that's aggressive because it takes them months to ramp up and just get up to speed. Then we have a long sales cycle and then it takes, on average, between three and nine months to implement depending on the complexity of a project. So reps you hire mid-2014 are going to be delivering you billings in 2016.</p><p>That has been going very well. The quality of the reps and our ability to train them -- we invested a ton in sales support and in sales training, and I feel really good about and proud of the quality of the team that we've hired.</p><p>Where we've hired them -- I think -- we were talking about this earlier today. I think about 25% of our reps now are international. So there has been I think about 10 quota-carrying reps overseas. We have also added heads; obviously the balance in the US, or in North America.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: I do want to open up to questions from the audience. If you have a question, feel free to raise your hand. Why don't we go right there?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes, thanks for taking the question. As I look at your customer base, the majority of it's investor-owned utilities who are principally monopolies. So obviously there's sort of aesthetic benefits to having efficiency measures in place, but a lot of these guys have a lot of influence over the rate base. What real economic motivation do they really have to put in these efficiency measures? Because really, they want to sell more kilowatt hours, not less, at a higher price, not lower.</p><p>DANIEL YATES: Yes. So specifically with motivating energy efficiency, there's a 50-year history now of this regulatory construct where utilities are mandated and incentivized to deliver energy efficiency programs. And it's, again, about $6 billion in the US each year that is spent on energy efficiency.</p><p>The way it works is the utilities are given goals to hit and then the goals are funded by a tax on the utility bill. And then the utilities run these programs, and then they automatically as a calculation recoup their lost earnings from those programs. So they are made whole.</p><p>There are a few rare exceptions where they aren't, but in almost every case, and in every large efficiency market, utilities do not lose earnings from running these programs.</p><p>In many of them, like in Massachusetts and California, etc., they actually earn a preferred rate of return. Michigan, Minnesota. And these utilities covet these programs, in fact, because they get substantially higher rate of return on their efficiency quote, unquote investment than they would on building a new power plant. And this has been going for a long time. We've had nothing to do with it; we've just been a beneficiary of it.</p><p>At the same time, it is a mandated market. So the CEO of First Energy doesn't wake up in the morning and try and run around to drive up the efficiency market size. But it has happened to him and he is compliant. And that is a much bigger game that's happened on a scale that we don't play with and we deliver against it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: They become more efficient but then they end up capturing back the profits lost anyways to do with rate case. So in the end, does the greater whole end up with the more efficient?</p><p>DANIEL YATES: Yes. Because the key thing is 90% of the spend is fuel costs, and those go away. So that's the thing that comes out of the -- that's what disappears and allows for savings and earnings.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thanks. What percentage of business is IOU versus co-ops or munis? Do you know?</p><p>DANIEL YATES: I don't know the exact number, but the significant majority of our business is IOUs.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: When you think about the cost to roll out your programs versus some of these other alternatives, how do you position -- a software versus hardware? And the decision for that utility.</p><p>DANIEL YATES: Yes, I think that's actually -- the way to think about the efficiency part of the business is this is a fact of life for these utilities. And while on the margins there are some places where efficiency is increasing, and there have been rare exceptions where it has decreased, for the most part it's a status quo component of being in the utility business.</p><p>So consequently their attention goes to, well, what do I pick? And we afford a very compelling option for utilities to meet their efficiency goals. First of all, we are very cost-competitive. So from a pure achieving their goals perspective, the only program in the residential sector typically that outperforms us are compact fluorescent light bulb subsidies, and those have already seen their heyday. So there's been increasing space for us.</p><p>Secondly, we're one of the few programs -- actually, we're the only program that affords the utility any ancillary benefits. So we give them customer sat improvements. We give them the ability to cross-promote other programs and other non-utility programs. And we even give them cost to serve benefits.</p><p>And as we're now entrenching more deeply into the core operating offerings of the utilities and looking at things like billing and outage, we're finding very compelling synergies. Inserting energy efficiency features on a bill is actually one of the most cost-effective ways to deliver efficiency, and it helps to -- simultaneously the utility benefits with a better bill.</p><p>So given that there's all this efficiency out there, we are well and increasingly well positioned to be the company they want to spend the money on.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: Is the opportunity internationally much different than the opportunity in the US, and can you talk about which regions you make them your best and lessons learned at 18 months.</p><p>DANIEL YATES: So there are big differences. I'd highlight a couple. One is a larger part of the non-US market is competitive markets. And there their No. 1 focus is on churn reduction, reduction in their customer churn, or customer retention. And consequently they're very focused on customer satisfaction and self-service, etc.</p><p>The second difference is that the efficiency markets are less mature. So both point in the same direction, which is they are an accelerant for us to sell our customer engagement solution overseas, which is where we now focus almost all of our energy.</p><p>It also is -- what I'm very excited about as we start to roll out these new products, and the one we'd launch next week, in particular, is going to be very hot internationally because it just speaks to these problems and helps the utility offer a stickier, better service to their customers.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: And what -- do you have a question?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>DANIEL YATES: Does our data give us benefit for the next incremental customer? Yes, significantly. And the ways in which it helps us is -- it's a similar dynamic in each product we roll out.</p><p>So with energy efficiency, we have become tremendously more efficient at achieving the efficiency, which has enabled us to not reduce our per-unit pricing and to help our customers identify the lowest-hanging fruit in the right order.</p><p>And that's entirely on account of our forecast. We have this multivariate predictive model that uses a host of different demographic and geographic weather-based and energy usage data feeds to identify which sub-population will be most receptive to our communications.</p><p>We have then begun to develop that same model for demand response. And we are now building</p><p>the same capabilities around cost to serve. So we're beginning to identify which customers are most responsive to which kinds of services and which kinds of subscriptions for our new offerings.</p><p>And this stuff is -- there's a high noise-to-signal ratio here. So having large populations where we can run concurrent tests gives us a huge advantage.</p><p>I'll give you one specific -- the longest-running stuff on the efficiency stuff -- we've been able to achieve 30% better per-unit results in efficiency based upon the forecast model and the program designs that emerge from it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>DANIEL YATES: Yes. So that doesn't affect us because we've never been taking a -- the whole challenge there is utilities saying, and power (inaudible) saying, we love ER but we want to do it. And that's our go-to-market is through them. So we've never been interested in a third party approach.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: When you look at your interactions with consumers, how much of it is digital today and how has that evolved over the years? And what does that mean for margins?</p><p>DANIEL YATES: Yes. So two years ago was the first year that we had more digital touch points than paper touch points because our odd history -- we started off, first product, paper mailed report. This last year, two-thirds of our touch points were digital. So we continue to very quickly accelerate, grow, the non-paper part of the business.</p><p>And that's going to be -- that's not going to stop. And Thomas can talk --</p><p>THOMAS KRAMER: Yes, the impact of that, obviously, is that as paper goes away, our costs go up, which will have an upward pressure on the gross margin in the long term. In the immediate term what we will see is that the gross margin will actually vary based on us entering new markets where the investment costs are higher.</p><p>But that will actually be recognized immediately and as we are fully scaled into the market, and as we go over to more and more renewals, costs will go down and you should see an increased gross margin where we have a target model of 68% to 72%. We've already touched upon the lower end of that and we feel confident that we can reach that.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: And who else is going after this opportunity in this way? And what are going to be the challenges for them to kind of -- if you buy into, hey, utilities totally need to change the way they interact with consumers because having all this data on their consumers, whether it's smart meters, whether it's billing information, all these metrics is going to demand that they have software solutions that take advantage of the data.</p><p>Who else is going after this opportunity and why is Opowergoing to win?</p><p>DANIEL YATES: So nobody's where we are today and it doesn't appear to me that there are any [BCs] funding companies in this space anymore. And I think they're probably right not to do so. We have a clear leadership position in the market. We have nearly 100 referenceable customers. We have many of the largest ones. We have an eight-year track record of results.</p><p>In these parts of the business that we work in, you cannot have that good of results until you put in the years generating the results. We have a data asset where we have 40% of all US energy data in our system today, 400 billion rows and counting of smart meter data.</p><p>And we have this big tech platform. The tech platform is giving us -- is the latest thing that's really giving us accelerating advantage. Because so much of the costs that utilities spend in this part of their business are systems integration costs to tie together crummy horizontal solutions to try to approximate something like what we can deliver for them.</p><p>I'll give you an example of a utility in the north Midwest who is spending $25 million on a digital customer experience project, and all they're getting out of it is a horizontal CMS that they're going to use for their website kind of management system. A rudimentary outage communication app from a small company, like a 20-person company. And a horizontal payment processing app, Paymentus, that they're then going to tie together to try and offer a small subset of what we could bring to them over time.</p><p>And they're paying $25 million for this because of all the system integration costs. So when you look at that and you look at what we can now because we have so many of these pieces and we're going to have even more put together, it's just -- it gives us a really significant lead over anybody else who's going to try and come in.</p><p>Even if they have a great point solution, it's just not -- besides the point.</p><p>GREG DUNHAM: Well Dan, on that note we'll close there. Thank you so much Thomas, thank you so much.</p><p>DANIEL YATES: Greg, thanks a lot.

The government has increased sovereign debt levels to fund its response, while stringent lockdown regulations have eroded tax revenue.</p><p>The resultant funding shortfall, coupled with SA's legacy structural challenges, will likely dampen the pace of the country's economic recovery. The rationale for local investors to boost offshore allocations and build globalised portfolios is more compelling than ever.</p><p>However, differences in country-specific pandemic responses mean that the global economic recovery will not be uniform. Particular sectors will also benefit more than others.</p><p>Accordingly, offshore investors who apply a geographic and thematic lens to their investment decisions stand to benefit from more robust recoveries.</p><p>&amp; North Asia has experienced a stronger recovery and has suppressed the virus more successfully than other regions. In the absence of a meaningful second wave, this gives North Asia a head start, which makes it more likely that this region will lead a recovery,&amp; says Dorian Carrell, fund manager, multi-asset, at Schroders.</p><p>A vaccine will likely change the global dynamic. In this scenario, the US looks well placed, says Carrell, as it has secured more doses of a potential vaccine per capita than other regions.</p><p>&amp; Conversely, Europe's swiftly implemented employment furlough schemes left the region less vulnerable to economic scarring and will likely provide a boost should a vaccine become widely available.&amp; Hein Klee, head of international at Nedbank Private Wealth, adds that the EU's commitment to a \u20ac750bn stimulus package will support the region's recovery.</p><p>&amp; The US is looking more vulnerable, which is starting to reflect in a weakening dollar.&amp; Diversification across sectors and geographies remains prudent.</p><p>&amp; We think that global emerging markets [EM] are attractive, with their low valuations and 'cheap' currencies. While specific EM economies have their issues, with some more pronounced than others, as a collective, they offer the best long-term growth prospects,&amp; says Klee.</p><p>Regionally speaking, Klee says it is hard to ignore Asia, with China at its centre. &amp; However, it is important to gain broad EM exposure, rather than trying to pick which region will perform best.&amp; Pieter Koekemoer, head of personal investments at Coronation Fund Managers, highlights sector-specific EM opportunities.</p><p>&amp; The biggest concern is that the big five tech stocks did all the running in the strong US and China equity market recovery. In this narrow market, the Faang stocks [Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet, Google's parent company] grew by more than 70% while the overall market is flat.&amp; Koekemoer believes that investors should be circumspect in how they allocate their offshore investments.</p><p>&amp; All the good things driving these tech stocks are known and already reflected in their prices. It becomes debatable whether investors can expect that performance to continue.&amp; But not all global tech stocks are overbought. With strong fundamentals driving the technology theme, such as the e-commerce boom and the shift to working from home, Koekemoer sees attractive opportunities in selective big tech assets in Asian EMs such as China, India and Russia.</p><p>&amp; In China, equivalent big tech and media companies to US peers are more attractively valued and are well positioned to benefit from these trends. That is why we hold more EM exposure than normal, but these positions are stock-specific and often in niche tech.&amp; Outside of tech stocks, Koekemoer suggests investors identify strong cyclical businesses hit by the pandemic.</p><p>&amp; It's hard to predict how the recovery will unfold, which makes picking individual winners and losers a tough proposition. For instance, we believe the travel sector offers a strong recovery play. However, we prefer Airbus, rather than specific airlines.

The Trump Administration has aggressively teamed up with Big Tech billionaires to diversify their fortunes into 'underserved areas' by allowing tax deferment on realized capital gains derived from liquidation of their core investments. This is a massive Public-Private Partnership operation that could push as much as $6 trillion of 'unlocked capital' into areas that would be turned upside down, and worse, inundated with Smart City technology designed to create a data extraction extravaganza for years to come. </p><p>In short, this is an operation of Big Tech, for Big Tech and by Big Tech, but President Trump has aided and abetted their efforts to manipulate government rules for their own self-interest. Undesired consequences will most certainly follow. IntroductionWhen President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in December 2017, few read or understood the small print authorizing the creation of Opportunity Zones. One year later on December 12, 2018, Trump created and signed an Executive Order titled, Executive Order on Establishing the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council[2], which created a highest-level committee that includes the very top leadership of the Administration: the Secretaries of the Treasury, Agriculture, Interior, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, Transportation, Energy and Education; the Administrators of the EPA and the Small Business Administration; the Chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisers and the Council on Environmental Quality and a few other assorted big-wigs. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/poverty-map-usa-777x437.jpg\">https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/poverty-map-usa-777x437.jpg</url> The EO instructs the Council to 'work across agencies' to 'assess the actions each agency can take under existing authorities to prioritize or focus Federal investments and programs on urban and economically distressed communities, including qualified Opportunity Zones.' The object is to 'minimize all regulatory and administrative costs and burdens.' Furthermore, the EO uses the phrase 'public and private investment' no less than six times and then stresses that the Council must evaluate, whether and how Federal technical assistance, planning, financing tools, and implementation strategies can be coordinated across agencies to assist communities in addressing economic problems, engaging in comprehensive planning, and advancing regional collaboration. There are three immediate problems with this Executive Order. First, Public-Private Partnerships have developed over the years as a mainstay of the United Nations to finance Sustainable Development and in particular, infrastructure that supports its Sustainable Development Goals. Second, blanket cross-agency coordination can be a dangerous vehicle to create policies that represent no agency in particular, and that no single agency would ever create by itself. Third, the term collaboration is a buzzword for collaborative governance that brings many types of stakeholders to the table to make binding decisions outside of traditional citizen representation or accountability. Furthermore, regional collaboration adds an additional dimension that promotes regionalism, which is patently unconstitutional. Article 4, Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution states that 'The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.' Regionalism is not a Republican Form of Government, period.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017Opportunity Zones were created[3] in Section 13823 of this 131 page bill, the summary of which states: This section authorizes the designation of opportunity zones in low-income communities and provides various tax incentives for investments in the zones. Taxpayers may temporarily defer the recognition of capital gains that are invested in opportunity zones. Investments in opportunity zones or opportunity funds that are held for at least five years are eligible for capital gains tax reductions or exemptions, depending on how long the investment is held. The governor of each state is given authority to define the Opportunity Zones within their state boundaries, which are then submitted to the Department of the Treasury for automatic certification. Zones are supposed to be low income or under-advantaged communities, but several governors have stretched the definition to include prime development areas as well. Thus far, over 8,700 of these Zones have been established nationwide. (An interactive map can be seen here[4] and the IRS Q...age is here[5].) Obviously, this is no small undertaking. According to Smart Growth America[6], currently designated OZs represent 10 percent of America's landmass, containing 30 million people. It adds[7], The newly created Opportunity Zones program will likely go down as the largest and most significant federal community development initiative in U.S. history, with trillions of dollars in new private investment about to start flowing into pre-designated low-income communities around the country. It is noteworthy that one survey[8] of state Opportunity Zone designation procedures revealed that less than 10 percent of states published their draft selections for public comment and only one-quarter of states formed a citizen advisory panel. Thus, the public has been largely left in the dark. The IRS issued its first set of rules in early 2018 with little fanfare or public interest. However, when the second set of rules were released in October 2018, the barn doors were thrown open and the free-for-all began. The New Orleans Advocate noted on May 19 that 'It's like the Wild West out there now'. The article elaborated: It's not only the last-minute rules-setting that has given the Opportunity Zone scheme a sense of anarchy: Literally anyone can set up a qualifying OZ fund, and there is no formal way yet for the government to track them and determine if they're directing investment to truly deprived areas as intended.The Economic Innovation GroupThe brains and lobby effort behind the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 is now known to be The Economic Innovation Group (EIG[9]), which, by its own admission, was the original creator of the Opportunity Zone concept in a 2015 paper titled Unlocking Private Capital to Facilitate Economic Growth in Distressed Areas[10]. EIG boasts that 'the idea has since been championed by a wide-ranging coalition of investors, entrepreneurs, community developers, economists, and other stakeholders.' Subsequently, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) introduced Senate bill S.293, the Investing in Opportunity Act into the 115th Congress on February 2, 2017. Matching legislation was introduced in the House by Rep. Patrick Tiberi (R-OH). While both bills were stuck in committee, the key provisions were slipped into the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which was passed and then signed into law by President Trump. Such a skillful, persistent and successful lobbyist effort begs the question, 'Who are these people, anyway?' I'm glad you asked. The Founder and Executive Chairman of EIG is Sean Parker, a well-known black-hat hacker in his youth who co-founded Napster at age 18 to illegally share copyrighted music for free, without authorization from the creators. At age 25, Parker joined Mark Zuckerberg in 2004 when Facebook was only 5 months old, and became its first President shortly thereafter. Parker is credited with convincing Zuckerberg that Facebook could one day be something 'really big'. Forbes Magazine lists Parker as a venture capital investor and philanthropist. Other members of EIG's Founders Circle include: Ted Ullyot - General Council of Facebook from 2008 to 2013 Ron Conway - Founder of SV Angel and included in 2010's Vanity Fair 100 most influential people in the Information Age Dan Gilbert - Founder and Chairman of Quicken Loans, Inc. And a leading venture capitalist specializing in technology companies Rebecca Lynn - Ranked #23 out of 100 top tech investors on Forbes 2015 Midas List Joseph Sanberg - Private and public-sector entrepreneur and investor; he is a board member of the Sierra Club Foundation Dana Settle - Former investment banker at Lehman Brothers, she is a leading venture capitalist specializing in high-tech startups. In short, every one of these people are key players in the Big Tech/venture capital world, especially on the West Coast. Furthermore, they have close connections with some top economists who are listed on their Economic Advisory Board[11]: Jared Bernstein, PhD - Chief Economist and Economic Adviser to Vice President Joe Biden, executive director of the White House Task Force on the Middle Class, and a member of President Obama's economic team. Austan Goolsbee - Former chairman of President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, cabinet member and chief economist for the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board Kenneth Rogoff - Former Chief Economist at the International Monetary Fund Matthew Slaughter, PhD - Professor of International Business at Dartmouth, Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, advisory committee member of the Export-Import Bank of the United States and advisor to the McKinsey Global Institute. The EIG Policy Council generally follows the same lines as the Founders Circle but for this discussion, it has one noteworthy member: Chris Camacho of Phoenix, Arizona. Camacho is President and CEO of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council (GPEC), which he has used to spearhead a public-private partnership called Smart Region Initiative (SRI). This is a three-way collaboration between Arizona State University[12], GPEC[13] and the managing partner Arizona Institute for Digital Progress[14]. Camacho is a hard-nosed business development expert and an unequalled promoter of unconstitutional regionalism. One Phoenix journal reported[15] Camacho as saying, No one market across the country has unified multiple jurisdictions. There's been strategies to do smart cities in various places, but we're talking about, 'how do we connect the entire region.' Indeed, the Smart Region Initiative is being billed as the very first national attempt to create a regional authority to implement uniform smart city technology across 22 cities and 4.2 million people. National and even global eyes are watching to see what happens next in the Valley of the Sun, and if this regionalism takeover is successful here, it will be used as a model for similar public-private partnerships all across across America and around the world. While this writer intends to thoroughly cover the Smart Region Initiative movement in a separate report, it is important to see the potential connection between Opportunity Zones and Smart Region Initiatives. Both are full of venture capitalists specializing in Big Tech initiatives like the Internet of Things, Smart City surveillance technology and most importantly, data, which many are calling the 'new oil' of the 21st century. Both are new, riddled with Public-Private Partnerships and promote similar unconstitutional practices.The Counter-ArgumentSome will undoubtedly argue that these billionaires and venture capitalists are simply acting as benevolent benefactors who are sharing their wealth with poor communities; or that they are merely seeking to diversify their investments. This is a logical absurdity and terribly naive. For high-velocity money extracted from Big Tech, there is no return on buying real estate or starting businesses in poor communities. Investors always put their capital into the areas of highest possible returns. On the other hand, if data collection is the target, which is high-return, then Opportunity Zones fit the bill perfectly.Who will manage the OZ Funds?For the most part, every Opportunity Zone Fund will typically have a managing partner that makes all decisions for investment, structuring and accounting. Investors will simply pick a fund or fund manager in which to invest. Who are these fund managers? One needs to look no further than EIG's Opportunity Zones Coalition[16] page to get the idea: This page lists 49 such would-be managers with names like Reinvestment Fund, Riaz Capital, Newark Venture Partners, Ur Opportunity, KeyBank, Institute for Portfolio Alternatives, Fund for Our Economic Future, Calvert Impact Capital, Bridge Investment Group, etc. Some of these will very likely end up with tens of billions under their direct management.Case Study: How Erie, PA Uses Opportunity Zones To Fund Its Smart City MakeoverOn March 4, 2019, Government Technology reported[17] that Erie, Pa., Wants to Overlay Security Tech into Its Smart City. The article states, Eight 'opportunity zones' throughout the city could soon see new smart city technology equipped with license plate-reading cameras and facial recognition capabilities. Officials say the goal is to boost safety and spur investment. Additional security cameras, LED lighting and free public Wi-Fi were introduced to downtown Erie in 2018 as part of a pilot program for what's known as smart city technology. Mayor Joe Schember's administration and other local officials want to bring the same technology to local neighborhoods targeted for reinvestment under the federal Opportunity Zone program. Schember, in an interview last week, said his administration \u2014 working with the Erie Innovation District and others \u2014 is working to bring 'secure smart city' equipment and technology over the next 12 months to the eight Opportunity Zones in the Erie region that have been designated by Gov. Tom Wolf's office and certified by the U.S. Treasury Department. According to Schember, that would include security cameras that could read license plates and have facial-recognition capabilities; energy-efficient LED street lights; and free Wi-Fi in public spaces throughout the Opportunity Zone tracts. The intent is to make those areas safer and more attractive for investment. 'It's kind of an aggressive goal. But let's get these areas done and within the next three years, I'd like to see that technology throughout the entire city,' Schember said.Needless to say, Erie got the message of how Opportunity Zones could best serve its pressing need to get someone else to pay for its Smart City makeover. Once a beachhead is established in a lower-income area, which can hardly protest anything the city does, rolling out to the rest of the city will be a cake-walk. Furthermore, the early city 'partners' (tech providers and investors) will have their foot in the door and will be eager participants. But, why would anyone be eager to pour money into low income or underserved areas? There are three good reasons. First and foremost, the value of data collection is found in all living human beings, regardless of their socio-economic status. Second, the early-bird gets the worm for the rest of the data plundering operation in other parts of the city or region. Third, once embedded, the data stream continues to pump into the coffers of those who 'own' the collection infrastructure.ConclusionIt's time to face the dark reality of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The promised tax cut for individuals was largely a myth. Conversely, tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations were ostentatious. A just-released report[18] by the Congressional Research Service confirms this: 'the main consequence was that real tax rates for corporations fell by nearly half while individual income taxes barely budged.' The key sentence in the report states,From 2017 to 2018, the estimated average corporate tax rate fell from 23.4% to 12.1% and individual income taxes as a percentage of personal income fell slightly from 9.6% to 9.2%.Thus, a Republican-led Congress betrayed the American people, and President Trump offered no rebuke to get it right. Instead, he eagerly signed the Jobs Act into law and subsequently created an Executive Order to insure the streamlining of its provisions throughout all levels of government agencies. It should be duly noted and with alarm that this kind of globalization transcends the ideological labels of Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, left-wing or right-wing, etc. Technocrats are apolitical on one hand, but will use or manipulate any convenient political platform to advance their own goals. After realizing that the door was open for the rich to get richer with the Jobs Act, one can almost picture the resulting feeding frenzy of lobbyists to get their favorite loophole into the text. The Economic Innovation Group was able to claw their way into the mix to ensconce Opportunity Zones on behalf of their super-rich Big Tech/venture capitalist cronies. To repeat the question, how much more financial plundering can Americans endure before America is declared an outright Oligarchy and the middle class declared dead?

Gopalakrishnan, joint secretary to the IT Ministry. He was referring to a recent proposal (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b16fd228-ea72-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55\">https://www.ft.com/content/b16fd228-ea72-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55</url>) by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to expand the governments' rights to tax MNCs - especially big internet firms such as Google and Facebook - by releasing a methodology for such taxation.</p><p>Gopalakrishnan was speaking at a panel discussion on 'Data Localisation and Global India' at the India Mobile Congress 2019. He also said that the draft Personal Data Protection Bill is very likely to be tabled in the upcoming Winter Session of the Parliament.</p><p>Data embassies/zones to manage Indian data</p><p>The government may think about creating data zones/embassies in other countries to manage Indian data outside of India, Gopalakrishnan said. He further noted that the draft PDP bill requires a framework for localising critical data, and \"not the trivial non-personal data\".</p><p>\"There is a lag between the coming of the law and the implementation since the regulator would then work out the nitty-gritty of what comprises critical data and thus needs to be stored only in the country\", he said, adding that the entire process would take all the stakeholder views into consideration.</p><p>US is framing privacy laws, so India's law shouldn't come as a shock</p><p>Speaking on opposition by big tech firms on the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, Gopalakrishnan said, \"the global tech companies have so far operated in a regime without specific privacy laws in the US but are now facing a situation where there are six states [in the US] have come out with privacy laws and [a] federal privacy law is expected.\"</p><p>Under such circumstances, the legislation of privacy law in India should not come as a surprise or a shock to them\". He also said that the biggest beneficiaries of the data localisation in India will be the \"citizens of the country\", as this will protect their data from being misused.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0049965190</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X95-44G1-DXMP-K47N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"355\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 17, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION &amp;

However, expensing options might cause such a drag on the profitability of some companies that the lower stock prices greatly reduce the attractiveness of options as a form of compensation.</p><p>If all companies must expense options, the impact on employees at old-line companies, like those mentioned above, would not be as great as at smaller companies. New companies without much cash depend on stock options to reward employees, and loudly claim that if they are required to expense the options they will no longer be able to afford them. </p><p>CPA Michael Gray's San Jose, Calif., office is in the heart of a start-up capital of the world. \"Stock forms of compensation have been important in my area,\" he said. \"In the recent tech heyday, even the secretary at the front desk received stock options.\"</p><p>Not only are options a critical source of compensation for smaller companies, but, when counted as an expense, they are a larger drag on earnings. Big tech companies like Cisco and Inteldisclose the potential option expense in the required footnotes. Cisco's earnings would drop by $1.21 billion, or 28 percent, if the accounting standards change; Intel's would drop by $991 million, or 16 percent. \"Even some of the big winners from the tech boom may well have not had any earnings at all if they had had to record expenses related to options,\" Gray said.</p><p>As the impact would be less for big companies than for small, the expensing requirement will affect executives less than other employees. \"Even start-ups are still going to do whatever it takes to attract talent,\" said Gray. \"But it's less likely that options will be offered to employees outside the key group under the new rules.\"</p><p>From a financial planning perspective, the larger task is often diversifying out of the position of assets concentrated in one stock. Tanager Financial recently raised minimums for new accounts to $2 million, and deals only with the key group of executives that are less likely to be affected by any accounting changes on their employer's income statements. \"We look at stock options from the micro view, or how to advise our clients once the awards have been made,\" said manager Glenn Frank, CPA, PFS, CFP. \"From the investor's point of view, the biggest decision is whether to exercise.\"</p><p>Uncertainty surrounding options and the future of the stock price, as well as the tax treatment of the incentive stock options, make the decision difficult. \"There's so much misinformation out there that encourages them not to exercise,\" said Frank. \"So many people get paralyzed about their options and do nothing.\"</p><p>Tanager's concept of the financial floor helps their clients pull the trigger. During the planning process, clients work with advisors to determine how much is enough to meet their financial goals. \"What's insane is that people's net worth can fluctuate so wildly,\" said Frank. \"Investors need to learn to pull the trigger on what is enough.\"</p><p>The tax treatment of incentive stock options adds to the paralysis on the part of many clients. When exercised, the option becomes a preference item and investors must pay up to the Internal Revenue Service even if the stock is not sold. The new accounting rules at the employer would not change the personal tax rules, but if expensing options becomes a drag on earnings, stock price volatility could increase.</p><p>For investors, price volatility confuses the decision to exercise. \"We tell clients it's illogical not to exercise as soon as they can,\" says Frank. \"And while they don't like to hear it, we make the point that even the top executives do not know where the stock price is ultimately going to go.\"</p><p>Frank's goal is to reduce volatility throughout the holdings. \"Some of these clients own the options as well as company stock in other plans, on top of having their job tied up in one source,\" he said. \"They question how any new investments might perform, but mathematically a diversified portfolio will be less volatile than a single stock.\"</p><p>When the employer is a small company, however, the volatility could be greatly increased by a move to expensing stock options. \"Companies had a free ride using non-qualified options,\" said Gray. \"They could use them to pay for something of value, but they didn't have to record the expense.\"</p><p>In addition to the confusion of company-level accounting changes, the IRS is tinkering with the investor's tax regulations. Specifically troubling Gray is Treasury Decision 9144, which changes the treatment of options exercised before vesting. Some pre-initial public offering companies allow employees to exercise early if the stock issue is imminent. The new ruling does not allow the favorable election under Section 83(b), and investors who sell before a two-year holding period get hit with ordinary income.</p><p>Part of Gray's practice is to assist other advisors on the changes in stock option laws through his newsletter, Michael Gray CPA Option Alert, which can be accessed at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockoptionadvisors.com\">www.stockoptionadvisors.com</url>.</p><p>Big companies can also swallow the ongoing costs of accounting for options, making it easier to continue to reward employees, but the costs may be too high for smaller companies. \"Start-ups are hit on several levels, with options accounting as well as Sarbanes-Oxley compliance,\" said Gray. </p><p>Copyright 2004 Thomson Media Inc.

However, expensing options might cause such a drag on the profitability of some companies that the lower stock prices greatly reduce the attractiveness of options as a form of compensation.</p><p>If all companies must expense options, the impact on employees at old-line companies, like those mentioned above, would not be as great as at smaller companies. New companies without much cash depend on stock options to reward employees, and loudly claim that if they are required to expense the options they will no longer be able to afford them.</p><p>CPA Michael Gray's San Jose, Calif., office is in the heart of a start-up capital of the world. \"Stock forms of compensation have been important in my area,\" he said. \"In the recent tech heyday, even the secretary at the front desk received stock options.\"</p><p>Not only are options a critical source of compensation for smaller companies, but, when counted as an expense, they are a larger drag on earnings. Big tech companies like Cisco and Inteldisclose the potential option expense in the required footnotes. Cisco's earnings would drop by $1.21 billion, or 28 percent, if the accounting standards change Intel's would drop by $991 million, or 16 percent. \"Even some of the big winners from the tech boom may well have not had any earnings at all if they had had to record expenses related to options,\" Gray said.</p><p>As the impact would be less for big companies than for small, the expensing requirement will affect executives less than other employees. \"Even start-ups are still going to do whatever it takes to attract talent,\" said Gray. \"But it's less likely that options will be offered to employees outside the key group under the new rules.\"</p><p>From a financial planning perspective, the larger task is often diversifying out of the position of assets concentrated in one stock. Tanager Financial recently raised minimums for new accounts to $2 million, and deals only with the key group of executives that are less likely to be affected by any accounting changes on their employer's income statements. \"We look at stock options from the micro view, or how to advise our clients once the awards have been made,\" said manager Glenn Frank, CPA, PFS, CFP. \"From the investor's point of view, the biggest decision is whether to exercise.\"</p><p>Uncertainty surrounding options and the future of the stock price, as well as the tax treatment of the incentive stock options, make the decision difficult. \"There's so much misinformation out there that encourages them not to exercise,\" said Frank. \"So many people get paralyzed about their options and do nothing.\"</p><p>Tanager's concept of the financial floor helps their clients pull the trigger. During the planning process, clients work with advisors to determine how much is enough to meet their financial goals. \"What's insane is that people's net worth can fluctuate so wildly,\" said Frank. \"Investors need to learn to pull the trigger on what is enough.\"</p><p>The tax treatment of incentive stock options adds to the paralysis on the part of many clients. When exercised, the option becomes a preference item and investors must pay up to the Internal Revenue Service even if the stock is not sold. The new accounting rules at the employer would not change the personal tax rules, but if expensing options becomes a drag on earnings, stock price volatility could increase.</p><p>For investors, price volatility confuses the decision to exercise. \"We tell clients it's illogical not to exercise as soon as they can,\" says Frank. \"And while they don't like to hear it, we make the point that even the top executives do not know where the stock price is ultimately going to go.\"</p><p>Frank's goal is to reduce volatility throughout the holdings. \"Some of these clients own the options as well as company stock in other plans, on top of having their job tied up in one source,\" he said. \"They question how any new investments might perform, but mathematically a diversified portfolio will be less volatile than a single stock.\"</p><p>When the employer is a small company, however, the volatility could be greatly increased by a move to expensing stock options. \"Companies had a free ride using non-qualified options,\" said Gray. \"They could use them to pay for something of value, but they didn't have to record the expense.\"</p><p>In addition to the confusion of company-level accounting changes, the IRS is tinkering with the investor's tax regulations. Specifically troubling Gray is Treasury Decision 9144, which changes the treatment of options exercised before vesting. Some pre-initial public offering companies allow employees to exercise early if the stock issue is imminent. The new ruling does not allow the favorable election under Section 83(b), and investors who sell before a two-year holding period get hit with ordinary income.</p><p>Part of Gray's practice is to assist other advisors on the changes in stock option laws through his newsletter, Michael Gray CPA Option Alert, which can be accessed at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockoptionadvisors.com\">www.stockoptionadvisors.com</url>.</p><p>Big companies can also swallow the ongoing costs of accounting for options, making it easier to continue to reward employees, but the costs may be too high for smaller companies. \"Start-ups are hit on several levels, with options accounting as well as Sarbanes-Oxley compliance,\" said Gray.</p><p>Copyright 2004 Thomson Media Inc.

More than 5,000 tech pros meet in sessions with names like,  Regulatory Compliance Is in Your NDA Is it Part of Your DNA?  or  Leverage Robotic Process Automation to Meet Your Business Objectives.  There are a thousand such sessions over four days and nights.</p><p> One of the things I want to learn about at Collaborate is managing trade compliance using artificial intelligence,  says Hans Kolbe, who helps manage technology investments for multinational companies and is part of an Emerging Tech Special Interest Group (SIG), which meets face to face at the meeting.  Others in our group are looking to wrap their heads around blockchain by hearing true business cases. </p><p>Jerry Ward is deeper in the weeds on the database side of things and wants to  brush up on Cloud ERP options and deepen my knowledge of<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>autonomous database</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>technologies.  Plus, Ward, a fellow Emerging Tech SIG member, plans to lead sessions.</p><p> People who come to my session will see how we re using the<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Internet of Things</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>on the farm  to measure animal health, he says. The project uses tiny sensors in a cow s stomach to catch health problems early.  We get information off the device and stream it through Oracle s data hub and into an      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>Autonomous Data Warehouse</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>so we can do reporting and some predictive analytics,  he says.  Then we feed that into the ERP solution so we can do scheduling and collect all the billing information and pass that all through in an automated fashion.  Ward s  Digital Farm  session will appeal to people who are looking for interesting and useful business cases for IoT.</p><p>The Emerging Tech SIG that Ward chairs with Kolbe will be one of a hundred such SIG groups on everything from human resources to aerospace to analytics getting together that week. Several SIGs are sponsoring happy hours, says Kolbe, and this where the magic often happens, when random conversations open opportunities or solve technical problems from unforeseen angles.</p><p> Our SIG will hold an open mic night,  says Ward,  where everyone gets a few minutes on stage and no slides will be allowed.  People can do a quick demo or lead a discussion about an interesting project they re doing at work.  Everyone is going to get up and brag a little bit,  adds Kolbe.</p><p>And that s fine with Kolbe and Ward, because that s how the information gets passed on. That s how the technology world moves forward, inexorably, one conversation at a time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRBCOM-5c91fb1bbbafb24c5fdb1656</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRBCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP3-2K91-JBCM-F0C2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"480\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Forbes LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 20, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC7379 COMPUTER RELATED SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC7371 COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>ORCL (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Innovation</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DMVO</classCode><className>EMERGING TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000155</classCode><className>BACK OFFICE OPERATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000233</classCode><className>BUSINESS SOFTWARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

Clearly Oracle found that Eloqua plugs a big gap in their product offering. I also predict that Salesforce.com will acquire Marketo within the first quarter of 2013.</p><p><br/> Jeff Ogden of Find New Customers[1] and the host of Marketing Made Simple TV[2] congratulates both Eloqua and Oracle. (Please note that in the new year, Find New Customers will become part of the revenue marketing firm, The Pedowitz Group.)<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fearlesscompetitor.com/2012/10/08/a-great-place-to-learn-marketing-and-get-awesome-content-from-eloqua-marketing-made-simple-tv/eloqualogo-redgreynotag/\">http://www.fearlesscompetitor.com/2012/10/08/a-great-place-to-learn-marketing-and-get-awesome-content-from-eloqua-marketing-made-simple-tv/eloqualogo-redgreynotag/</url><br/> I reached out to the former CMO of Eloqua, Brian Kardon, now CMO of Lattice Engines (Brian is a guest on Marketing Made Simple TV, premiering December 27th) what he thought. Here's what he said:<br/> Hi Jeff -<br/> It was inevitable, that Eloqua would be bought. I am surpassed (sic) at how soon.<br/>The big tech companies have tons of cash (Oracle, SFDC, Adobe, SAS, etc) Mktg automation was a piece missing from their Marketing offerings Eloqua is the only company of size + focused on the enterprise<br/>All good news for the industry.<br/> Best<br/> Brian<br/> Here's the letter Eloqua CEO Joe Payne shared with customers and partners.<br/>A letter from Eloqua CEO, Joe Payne<br/>Eloqua Customers and Partners,<br/> On December 20, 2012, we announced that we have signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Oracle. The proposed transaction is subject to stockholder approval, certain regulatory approvals, and customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first half of 2013. Until the deal closes, each company will continue to operate independently, and will operate its business as usual.<br/> Today is a significant milestone for Eloqua. We are excited to join forces with Oracle because we believe that together we can accelerate the pace of the modern marketing revolution. The combination of our best-in-class modern marketing platform with Oracle's Customer Experience suite will create a comprehensive Customer Experience Cloud that offers customers the ability to transform the way they market, sell, support and serve their customers.<br/>Oracle plans to make Eloqua the centerpiece of its marketing cloud offering. This means our customers can expect to continue receiving the same world class expertise, vision and passion that they receive from us today and our efforts will be supported by the global reach and infrastructure of the Oracle organization. Oracle plans to invest in Eloqua products which will result in exciting new features and innovations for our customers. These investments will include leveraging key Oracle technology assets, such as Big Data and Business Intelligence.<br/>Eloqua's management team and employees are expected to join Oracle and continue their focus facilitating excellence in marketing. We expect that joining Oracle will provide significant benefits for both our customer and partner communities.<br/> For additional details about the transaction, please visit eloqua.com/oracle[3].<br/> Thank you for your continued support and for being part of the Eloqua community.<br/> Best regards,<br/> Joe Payne<br/>CEO, Eloqua<br/> What do you think of this news?<br/> The post Oracle buys Eloqua.

BONASIA</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Oracle CEO <person><nameText>Larry Ellison, </nameText></person>never shy, has a clear response to those who insist his company is buying Sun Microsystems solely for Sun's Java and other noncomputer assets: Wrong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At a Silicon Valley event late Monday, Ellison emphasized that Oracle will use Sun's servers to compete head-on against IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Cisco Systems in selling complete business computing systems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ellison wants Oracle to emulate the early days of IBM, when Big Blue dominated the tech industry.</p><p>\"We are not interested in being a hardware company,\" Ellison said of his vision. \"We want to be a great systems company.\"</p><p>The world's second-largest software maker behind Microsoft has never competed in hardware. That's about to change, Ellison said. He spoke at an event staged by the Churchill Club, a public affairs forum. Under the event's format, Ellison chatted on-stage with <person><nameText>Ed Zander, </nameText></person>once the No. 2 executive at Sun but most recently the former chairman of Motorola.</p><p>Oracle's $7.4 billion purchase of Sun is pending antitrust approval from European regulators. U.S. regulators have given the OK.</p><p>The European Commission is trying to determine if Oracle getting Sun's MySQL open source database software would hurt competition in the database market.</p><p>Oracle wants to close the deal. Sun is losing $100 million a month as the approval drags on, Ellison says. He says further delays will likely result in more layoffs for Sun employees.</p><p>\"The longer this takes, the more money Sun is going to lose and we don't think that's good for anyone,\" he said.</p><p>Zander loosely joked with Ellison, who Forbes magazine ranks as the world's fourth richest person.</p><p>\"Can I get a ride on the boat?\" Zander asked Ellison, who sponsors a high-tech yacht for the BMW Oracle racing team. The boat is set to compete for the America's Cup on behalf of the U.S. in February. Ellison says he wanted to name the boat \"Death Star 1\" but was talked out of it by his wife, Melanie Craft, and Oracle President <person><nameText>Safra Catz.</nameText></person></p><p>Ellison got big laughs for his critique of the hot trend known as cloud computing, in which users access software and data remotely over the Web.</p><p>Many companies have jumped on this bandwagon, but Ellison says the cloud term is sorely misplaced as the latest fashionable metaphor for network computing.</p><p>\"The cloud is water vapor,\" he said with a grin. \"Cloud computing is not the future of computing, it is the past and present of computing.\"</p><p>Ellison grew more serious when asked about the economy. He said he expects an L-shaped recovery from the recession, in which the economy bottoms out and then stays down for an extended period. He says U.S. consumers have far too much debt, which now must be paid down.</p><p>\"I believe we're going through some fundamental changes,\" Ellison said. \"This (economy) is not going to come back for five years.\"</p><p>Ellison said he voted for President Obama, but said he's been surprised by the extent of the big-ticket spending programs under the current administration.</p><p>He also said he has no interest in running for political office, such as for governor of California.</p><p>Sun Chairman and co-founder Scott McNealy, a longtime friend of Ellison, kicked off a question-and-answer session from the audience by asking Zander for some advice on how to become an ex-chairman of a big tech company. Ellison quipped that McNealy should work on his golf handicap after he retires.</p><p>McNealy asked Ellison to buy the San Jose Sharks hockey team. He said HP Pavilion -- the Sharks' home arena nicknamed the Shark Tank -- could then be renamed the Sparc Tank, in a reference to Sun's Sparc computer chips.</p><p>When Ellison was asked how he has managed to run Oracle for 32 years, he said the one constant in all that time has been his focus on overseeing the engineering team, not marketing or sales. He says Oracle is the world's largest employer of software engineering grads from Caltech, MIT and Stanford.</p><p>\"The company,\" he said, \"is all about engineering.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-13657</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7WPP-JSX1-2R6K-F1T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"654\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

It's the one you all come for every year. You're going to see this slide repeated throughout today's presentation. Just a couple of reminders about it. First is that the information that we're presenting today is for informational purposes only. Secondly is that each presenter is sharing this slide with you, they won't be reading out the slide or anything like that, they'll be referring to this part of the presentation, where I actually will read this out.</p><p>So statements in this presentation relating to Oracle's future plans, expectations, beliefs, intentions and prospects are forward-looking statements and are subject to material risks and uncertainties. A detailed discussion of these factors and other risks that affect our business is contained in SEC's filings with Oracle, including our most recent report on Form 10-K and 10-Q under the heading of Risk Factors. These filings are available on the SEC's website or on the Oracle IR website. All information in this presentation is current as of September 19, 2019, today, and Oracle undertakes no duty to update any statement in light of new information or future events. Thank you for that.</p><p>So what we will be covering today. In just a moment here, we'll bring Safra up on stage to have a little talk with you all, and she's got a surprise guest. Following that, Steve Miranda will come up and speak with you all about our applications portfolio, an update there. Subsequently, Juan Loaiza will come up and speak with you about engineered systems as well as autonomous database, and then Don Johnson will be coming up and talking to you about Oracle cloud infrastructure. We'll take a break shortly before 3:00, and then at 3:00, Larry will come on up, and we'll have a Q&amp;A with Larry.</p><p>So with that, let me bring up on stage, CEO, Safra Catz.</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, ORACLE CORPORATION: Thank you. Thanks, Ken. Thank you, and welcome. I'm thrilled you're all here today.</p><p>I thought what I would do today is, first, I would take the opportunity to sum up everything we were showing and things that were happening at Oracle that, if you were here during the week, you would see and things you would hear from our customers.</p><p>I'm going to invite Doug Kehring, Executive Vice President. He's going to talk to you about the Oracle@Oracle Experience. It's something new we did this year to share our own experiences with our customers. He'll go into detail. And then I'm going to come back up and take questions. To the extent that you don't get an opportunity to ask all your questions, I'll be here, both before Larry speaks and afterwards, to cover anything you've got.</p><p>I hope you got an opportunity to walk around Oracle OpenWorld, because if you did, you would have gotten the opportunity to see that we have been putting together all the pieces we need for our customers to be successful in the cloud, and what you would be coming out with off of that is a feeling of enthusiasm that we all very much have.</p><p>I do -- even before I get started, I want to mention to you that we believe that this year, we will have revenue acceleration over last year. I think in the rush to get our earnings announcement out on Wednesday instead of Thursday, and to do that to announce Mark's leave of absence at the same time as we did earnings, I have a feeling that, that sentence might have dropped off my regular script. So I want to make sure you understand that right out of the box, okay? We think it's going to be a killer year, and now I'm going to tell you why.</p><p>First of all, we are, without a doubt, the only company that can provide a fully integrated stack, which is something we've been known for in the on-premise world. And now we can provide a secure, performant and enterprise-grade stack all the way from the infrastructure through the database with autonomous database to the applications and embedded AI in those applications and in the analytics. It is absolutely true that other companies do different parts of these things, but none of them does what we do. And if you walked around and talked to end user customers, you would have heard them say what many of them said to me, \"Gee, I was here 2 years ago. I wasn't here last year. It seems like a whole new Oracle.\" It's not only how we look, but it is the fact that we have all the pieces and that we have references for our customers. Most of the enterprise customers have been trying to do parts in the cloud, but many of them have been waiting for us to have some of the critical parts.</p><p>First of all, let's spend a little bit of time on autonomous database. I know this is an area that I think there've been a lot of talk about the Oracle Database versus all sorts of open-source pieces that are offered by other cloud providers or commercial software. Now the reality is that the Oracle Database is where all enterprises hold their most critical data. That has been true for decades. And though some of them have tried to put a little here or a little there to try or to rewrite an application, we're talking about billions, possibly trillions of dollars of investment in applications that can only operate at the performance and security level required for those enterprise applications. Those can only be on Oracle, okay?</p><p>Historically and still today, Oracle has more market share in the database than all of our competitors combined. And why is that? Because the enterprise customers must secure massive amounts of data. They must secure it. They must process it instantaneously. And that is only possible in the Oracle Database. This is well known. And this would also be a reasonable explanation for why Microsoft, who has done a very nice job in the cloud with their applications, Excel, Office, PowerPoint, SQL Server and some of their infrastructure, why is it they would want to partner up with us? Because they want to be able to have some of their products work with the databases -- the database in our cloud.</p><p>And what is that? That's the Oracle Autonomous Database service. And no one, no one is even trying to have a database that both self-secures, self-patches and keeps on running. And it's not only the database. I'm going to work my way down and then work my way up. It's the underlying operating system with the Oracle Enterprise Linux, Oracle Autonomous Linux. This is the only Linux that is actually running in a cloud. This is a Linux that you can upgrade and patch and not take down. That's a capability. Again, these are the types of capabilities that enterprise customers demand. That's what our target audience is.</p><p>At Oracle, we do the hard stuff, okay? As I've told you before, sometimes jokingly, we don't focus on cat videos. And I don't want to exclude dogs. We don't want to exclude -- we don't focus on dog videos. If you want to bring your cat and dog videos to our infrastructure, we'll take them. But you know what we really, really focus on, massive amounts of calculations that must not only be so fast they are instantaneous but have to be right every time. Our users cannot, like some of you Netflix viewers, all of a sudden be watching something and see that round circle start going in front of you. That's just not our target audience. Our target audience is it's got to be right. It's got to be exactly right. Not close. Exactly right, and it's got to be secure.</p><p>I'm going to take a step lower. I'd like to talk a little bit, and the team will talk much better than I could, but again, on why Oracle Cloud Infrastructure is completely unique. It is absolutely true that we came to the infrastructure business after everyone else. So at first, we started with what I could only refer to as a me-too infrastructure. But we've realized that was not good enough. And in fact, simultaneously, Larry and the team and Don is actually going to talk with you, Clay, the entire team, they were working on the second-generation cloud, the next-gen cloud, and this cloud is architected completely differently.</p><p>If you heard Larry's keynote on Monday night -- and I encourage you, sometime when you're sitting, eating lunch at your desk, flip on Larry's keynote and listen, and you will see a completely different architecture. You will see an architecture that is focused on security. You will see an architecture that is focused on performance. You will see an architecture that is focused on doing the hard stuff really fast. The architecture -- again, our network runs on a totally different processor than our customers' workload. Our customers' workload are often encapsulated entirely, so they are not at risk of either nosy or noisy neighbors. This is the architecture that is absolutely critical for enterprise workloads, and it is the architecture that our customers have been waiting for. They've literally been waiting for us. And what we see now and what you -- no doubt, if you talk to customers, you saw this enthusiasm. They're not asking, \"Gee, should I do this or that?\" They're actually thinking, when do I do it? How do I do it? Come show me how to do this. How do I move to the cloud? Finally, a cloud that is ready for those workloads. That's now.</p><p>On the application side, let's talk a little bit about that. I know Larry covered it yesterday, and we will -- Steve, I think, is covering it here today.</p><p>There -- these applications -- first of all, I covered the underlying infrastructure and the database. These applications sit directly on that, okay? Built, integrated to work together. I know those of you who have followed Oracle for a long time understand that this is a message and a capability that we have focused on, frankly, for decades. This makes it significantly easier for our customers to use our products because when they use the application, no doubt, they have their own custom applications they want to write or they want to have work together with the applications. We provide a completely secure platform for them to extend, one.</p><p>Two, we provide the security infrastructure. They inherit that. They build additional security, by the way, in the applications, but they don't have a vulnerability from the bottom up.</p><p>And finally, those applications have embedded AI in them. Because they can handle enormous amounts of data, they can recognize patterns, whether it's in approvals, in procurement, in expenses, in financial transactions of all sorts, journal entries, all sorts of things that can be of value. But it's not only that they benefit from the platform and have embedded AI, but they are also the broadest, broadest, it's over 100 modules of capabilities that no single SaaS vendor can even put on the field.</p><p>We have the entire ERP side of the business. We have all the parts, including the most recent final addition, the supply chain pieces and process and discrete and hybrid process/discrete manufacturing. No one has anything like this. And we have the entire front office: front office that is not only sales, service, field service, but also the data necessary to better understand customers. All of it integrated, built to work together. So it works together this way, works together that way, and then above that and really built in, analytics to give our customers insight.</p><p>Now you say, \"Well, I've been hearing that. Okay. It's great.\" Well, the reality is when you look at what we have, I challenge you to point to another company that has that. And so it is absolutely true. We are now finally on the field with all those capabilities, something we did not have before. And more and more of our customers, they started with something small and now are expanding. It is because of that, that we believe we will see revenue acceleration this year and even more so next year because we're confident as our customers continue to deploy and ramp-up usage of our products that we will see a market improvement in the business. And you'll see it. You'll look back on it. You'll remember today. And oh, by the way, and of course, double-digit earnings growth goes without saying. I think I said it on the earnings call. I want to make sure there's no confusion. We expect that again this year.</p><p>All right. I've gone half my time. I'm going to ask, at this point, for Doug Kehring to join. Don't feel I won't answer questions. I can't wait to get your questions. I won't leave without answering them. But let me introduce Doug Kehring, Executive Vice President. In his 20th year at Oracle, been very centrally involved in the -- well, in a lot of things but also in shaping and creating the Oracle@Oracle Experience. Thanks, Doug.</p><p>DOUGLAS A. KEHRING, EXECUTIVE VP OF CORPORATE OPERATIONS &amp; HEAD OF CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT, ORACLE CORPORATION: Okay. Thank you, Safra. All right. I'll stay standing here. I think -- not a lot of you or at least if you've been to past analyst meetings, you may have heard my talk, and that's because I'm dealing with all of Oracle behind the scenes and not on the technology front, as much as you'll hear from all of our leaders later this afternoon, but on the business process side of things, how do we move our business to take advantage of the cloud. And we've really reached a critical point of no return at this stage. And I just wanted to give you a little bit of flavor on what that is and what a lot of our customers then saw as a result at OpenWorld this year.</p><p>Just referring back to Ken Bond's safe harbor statement.</p><p>So to recap what we're trying to do on the process side is, is this whole movement is really around moving from a product company to a service company. And as a result of this move, beyond just the technology front, it's been a complete transformation internally about how to actually achieve it. And a lot of what I work with all of the teams inside Oracle around is what are the experiences we want to deliver for our customers, our employees, the audiences we're trying to serve in order to be effective in this new world? And that's really the driver behind all of the transformation that we've done.</p><p>No surprise, because I know you guys are all familiar with these models around what the license model will look like versus what a subscription model will look like. The reality is for us underlying this is it really forced us to change almost everything that was going on inside the company, and I relook at what we are doing, and with a sense of urgency, get to the other side.</p><p>The beautiful thing is we've had this wonderful platform around the cloud applications to help us enable it. So we essentially partner between our line of businesses and the folks that are trying to change the processes to meet the needs of our customers in the service-oriented world, along with the IT infrastructure that will enable us to do it. And I say we're sort of at that point of no return where we are nearly 100% having moved all of our applications to the cloud across ERP, supply chain, HCM, CX and EPM. It's all up and running inside Oracle. And it is the platform that's powering these new business processes.</p><p>And the beauty of having met with a lot of customers this week is they're all asking us the same question, which is, \"I understand I should move to the cloud, but why? What are the benefits that I get?\" And having done it for us internally at Oracle, I've boiled it down into kind of 4 basic areas that I articulate.</p><p>The first is just around efficiency and effectiveness. We're no different internally at Oracle from any one of our customers relative to this idea that in the old world, we had to buy data centers and buy servers and storage and build the entire stack of things that sat underneath the application in order to power whatever automation or business process we are trying to accomplish. All of a sudden now, we can go to the cloud operations team at Oracle and they can deploy us, easily just like they deploy a net new customer, and it's significantly less expensive for us on that front. It's also -- allows us to free up money to go invest in more things. So when we look at all of these transformational activities, we've got a ton of budget to enable us to go after new opportunities.</p><p>The second is around just making smarter decisions. The cloud has enabled us to think differently. As opposed to just being a transactional system, now we're thinking about being a decision-making system, and I'll give you a quick example of where that's already at work within Oracle.</p><p>Employee expenses. One of the simplest things that all of us do on a daily basis, and yet as a manager, for anyone that has to actually review expenses, it's probably one of the most tedious and least-liked activities in the world. Mainly because your employee submits an expense and it gets sent to you as the manager, and it's got all the things on there that they did. Now you -- hopefully, you sent them wherever that person went and they're doing work on your behalf, and you can validate that. But the rest of it, I got no idea what the business rules are within Oracle. I can't remember the hundreds of things around how much wine should -- can I spend on if I have a customer? Or how much can I spend per employee if I'm at an employee meeting? Whatever it might be, all of these things are business rules that I have to remember, and yet I'm presented with the entire haystack and said, find the needle, find what's wrong with this expense. And most people, they just hit approve. And so all of a sudden, you've lost all the value.</p><p>Well, now with cloud expenses, it's the opposite, which is we actually send to the manager the expense report and it says, \"We've reviewed the expense using the business rules, and it's okay for you to approve.\" Or, \"We'd like to highlight the issues that are anomalies that you need to look further at.\" So again, making smarter decisions is number two.</p><p>Third is just outpacing change. The amount of effort we're going through in order to get ahead of our competition, just like our customers, is no different, and we've got to continuously innovate internally around these processes. And the fact that we get these new releases every 90 days enable us to keep shifting and keep improving constantly.</p><p>And then the fourth is just around how do we delight our users. The idea of the old world where everyone just is satisfied that it's just good enough and enterprise apps or technologies are not that interesting no longer exist because everyone has a consumer-grade world. They're all using their iPhone. They all want a great experience. So I'll give you an example again internally of how we're doing it differently.</p><p>We not only have moved relative to expenses, but we're actually now rolling out in Oracle a chatbot for expenses. So if I want to delight my employees as opposed to having them go into the application when they're able to find a computer, go through their process of trying to scan in receipts, get them all loaded, attach them to the application, delineate what's on there, blah, blah, blah, now all they need to do is each time they get a receipt, they take a picture. The Oracle character -- the optical character recognition looks at it, breaks it down, says, \"Hey, is this what you want to submit?\" You say, \"Yes.\" You're done. Never have to go into the application. You move on, and you keep going about your business. Huge improvement as you think about how you delight users. That's only enabled by the cloud.</p><p>So this has really been a culmination as a result of our entire move of all these processes to being service-centric powered by the cloud, where we realized we're in a great position to share our story. We've always believed that we should, at Oracle, use our own technologies. And obviously, we've done that throughout our history. But more than that, we want to be our #1 reference. We want to be the best customer inside Oracle. We adopt first so that we can learn. We can learn and we can help the development team continuously improve. But the reality is our customers are demanding to understand, \"Hey, how do you do it well? How do you do it effectively? How -- give me some insight into how this works,\" and that led to the Oracle@Oracle Experience, something we launched this year.</p><p>The mission of Oracle@Oracle is to educate not just external users like our customers but also our internal audiences, both for awareness as well as to help RMR field about what the benefits are that can be achieved by leveraging the Oracle Cloud.</p><p>We built a ton of content that we've now introduced in internal and external websites. You can go and find it at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:oracle.com/Oracle@Oracle\">oracle.com/Oracle@Oracle</email> You'll see the stories. You'll understand what it is, and you'll hear from our folks. It's a bunch of, again, content we put together. And it's not just about technical content. This is about business content. It's this idea that our Chief Accounting Officer gets on and explains how we are able to close the books in 11 days, what is it that, that cloud can do and what do we have to change from an internal process standpoint in order to achieve those types of success. Because in every case where you're adopting these cloud applications, if -- as we tell our customers, all you do is lift and shift, you take your on-prem, you pick it up and you put it in the cloud, it's not going to -- it's -- you've lost a huge opportunity to improve your operations. So how can you improve your operations? It's all around those business processes.</p><p>We got videos from everyone inside the company around the executive team, Joyce Westerdahl, Head of HR; Ivgen Guner, Head of FP&amp;A. Everyone has put the time in to explain how we've done this at Oracle. That -- as I mentioned, it culminated in the Oracle@Oracle experience at OpenWorld. It was over at Moscone West. It happened for 3 days. There were 4 theaters around finance and supply chain, human resources, customer experience and business transformation. We had 80 sessions and 50 speakers from Oracle -- from the Oracle executive team. It was wildly successful.</p><p>These are just a couple of pictures that I had taken of some of the sessions, where customers came to -- sat in at. 30% of all of our badge scans for application attendees all came from the Oracle@Oracle Experience. It was -- every one of the sessions was over-attended, and we realized that there's just a huge demand for people to get to know. And we also made it very informal. As you can see, there's couches, there's stools. The idea is they can come and sit and listen, and then afterward, they can come talk to us and have an interactive dialogue. So they really, really learn as opposed to sit there and just try to listen to a talking head.</p><p>This is a quick example of the finance and supply chain on Tuesday. Again, we packed it in with stuff and put it in between all the keynotes, and then we tried to then explain to the attendees what type of things they can learn, whether that's how to reduce supply chain cycles from 1 week to 48 hours, how do we do a global, single, scalable chart of accounts, things like that. It was -- again, it was real-world business information that they could go and sink their teeth into whether they were a CFO all the way down to a Director of Financial Planning.</p><p>Same thing happened on the human resources, again, how do you reimagine talent, do a better hiring experience. All things that underlying was selling more Oracle Cloud, but on top of it was around getting access to our people.</p><p>Finally, the Oracle@Oracle Experience is going to go on the road. So we've seen such success that we're going to now start taking this out to all of the other events around OpenWorld in other parts of the world and the modern business experience. So I think you'll see more and more of this, and we found that it's a very powerful selling adjunct to -- that our field can leverage and customers can get access to us. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>KEN BOND: And we've got -- Louise and Eva will be running around. If you have a question, please just raise your hand and wait for the microphone to come to you. Who would like to go first? Here we go. Karl?</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: And tell everyone who you are.</p><p>KARL EMIL KEIRSTEAD, DIRECTOR AND SENIOR EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, RESEARCH DIVISION: Karl Keirstead at Deutsche Bank. Safra, thank you for the week. I did roam around a little bit. And I wanted to ask you something that I noticed that actually wasn't really about Oracle technology but rather the branding, where I felt like it was very different this year at OpenWorld. It was toned down and subdued almost, words that I frankly wouldn't normally use with Oracle, where even the logo was just an O. The -- it wasn't red everywhere. Just -- and I'm wondering there must be a method to that, and I'd love to hear a perspective because maybe it hints at more of a cultural change.</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: Yes. Well, there's a few things. First of all, we feel that natural colors and -- seriously, natural colors sort of are much more approachable. Because the reality is, we have to move from just a product company to a service company. And when you're a service company, you have to have a much more approachable feel to you. And so we've really internalized that in every way. Our own move to the cloud meant -- so let's just talk about a few things that are very different.</p><p>We had to move to the cloud because in our old business, we would sell you a license and you would implement it, and maybe wouldn't even implement it with Oracle consulting. You would implement it with someone. And then once in a while, you would inquire if you needed support, either online or by phone or in some way.</p><p>In the cloud, we have to serve you. And to do that, we have to be much more approachable. We have to really partner. And our own move to the cloud, though, by the way, also meant that the number of transactions and the continuous serving of you means the volumes in our system went way up. So we had to bring in a larger self-service autonomous or automatic or automated approach to everything we did. I could never have a back office big enough to handle 10 to 100x volumes and still touch every transaction. So we had to reengineer all our processes, as Doug was talking about, so that many, many of them were done automatically, but that we also kept a personalized feel to it. And so we decided this was really the year we were going to launch an entirely new look that really we fade to some extent into the background of all of our customers. Instead of overwhelming them with our branding, we are subsumed as part of theirs. And that's really our whole feel. It's much more natural, much more modern, hopefully appealing to -- not only appealing to an older demographic but also appealing to a younger, environmentally sensitive demographic. So that's what we did. And we thought this was the year to do it because we got all the parts. Thank you for noticing.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN, MD AND HEAD OF SOFTWARE, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH, RESEARCH DIVISION: Safra, Kash Rangan of Bank of America. How are you?</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: Yes. How are you?</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Red is okay, I guess. I love this, but red's okay.</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: I like red, too. We're kind of orangey.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Yes, exactly. I'm colorblind so don't take my word for it.</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: You're in red, just letting you know. It's not blue.</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: With you taking on more responsibilities, how are you approaching your job differently because you're taking on functions that are pretty massive. I know it's probably been addressed on the conference call, but just wanted to, in this forum, hear you out. What are you going to be doing differently? And also, are you planning to bring on a CFO?</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: Okay. Sure. I'll cover all this. So I think many of you who actually do know how we operate at Oracle, Larry, Mark and I are a team. We work on a lot of things together, and that's really known. I, myself, never want to work on anything alone. I have a well-known saying, \"Why should I suffer alone?\" So I'm always dragging Larry and Mark into everything. And we are all very interspersed into each other's -- Larry's development meetings, Mark and I are nearly always there. In the sales organization, even though Mark runs the sales organization, salespeople don't get the entire design of their comp plans and the whole structure of the sales force. All of that, if you think that's done without Larry's or even my input, you would be wrong. It has always been done as a team.</p><p>The reality is that it is a very, very big organization. Luckily, we have a lot of very talented folks. I'm not considering taking on a CFO because the CFO office is the way we've worked now for quite a long time. My tax person is way better in tax than any CFO could ever be. My Chief Accounting Officer is better at accounting than any CFO could ever be. They're all, of course, significantly better than me, I can assure you. My General Counsel, my Head of HR, of course, they're specialists. And we operate as a group together. And frankly, right now, though I remain the Principal Financial Officer, the bulk of the work is, of course, done and directed by real professionals. And the same in FP&amp;A, all the groups. I don't need to list them all. All of the groups are run by people who are much better than any CFO could ever be, and they work together beautifully.</p><p>As far as how Larry and I are handling the work with Mark on leave, as I said, plenty of folks, very senior folks in the organization are helping us. But of course, Mark's shoes are very, very hard to fill in the interim.</p><p>So we will -- we're doing our best. I'm spending a lot more time with customers and the field. Larry is spending a lot more time with the support organization. And we continue to move into this DevOps model for the cloud, and it's what we believe. So it's actually a good fit for us. I think I answered the whole question. Thanks.</p><p>RAIMO LENSCHOW, MD &amp; ANALYST, BARCLAYS BANK PLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. I walked the floor as well, and Don will probably talk about it in more detail later about Gen2. But can you talk about where you are with your application portfolio and moving that over to Gen2? And then the question then comes, what does it do to your gross margins?</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: Yes. So I want to talk about this. So -- and this also, by the way, covers the -- any questions you might have about CapEx, right, because -- just so that you understand what we've been dealing with sort of within the envelope of our capital expenditure and gross margin envelope. Let me explain what's been going on.</p><p>First of all, we've had the GBUs, which are our global business units, they've been on all sorts of different underlying infrastructures, okay? So I've had to deal with all these different cloud situations, okay? I just want to tell you where it's been. Actually, a whole bunch has already moved to OCI. The SaaS underlying infrastructure was its own cloud. It had its own structure, okay? We had OCI Gen1, which is OCIC, and we had a number of database services and middleware services on that. There's a third one. And now we have OCI Gen2. Okay. Getting rid all of those. Everybody moves to 1. Think how much cheaper that is to operate, okay? We're closing all these at a record rate or sometimes we're redeploying it. We're taking the square footage. We're putting OCI there. And of course, we're expanding out OCI globally.</p><p>So what happens? That means that our SaaS infrastructure, which as you know has incredible gross margins already, now allows us to actually get scale in OCI -- for OCI. And so one -- I mean this is not a complicated concept. We all know. One, way cheaper than -- I would like to have referred to it as 4, but it wasn't 4 because many of the GBUs and the acquired entities were on all sorts of combos. So everything's moving on OCI, some faster than others. All new SaaS stuff is going on OCI, and we're moving as quickly as possible the older stuff. There are some certifications we've needed for different requirements, and we are rushing to those. We've gotten a number of the government ones. They're either we got them or they're already -- we've built it out. We've done it. We're just waiting for some of the paperwork. And so we've got, I think Clay will probably know -- PCI compliance, all of these different requirements. This is going to make both my capital spending much more performant. And it's just better and easier, and I have massive economies of scale.</p><p>I will admit, though, that some of our rollouts are going a little bit quicker than we thought. We just -- we have not officially launched our India data center, and we filled it. So we had to very quickly send more kit into it, which is what you call a win-win proposition. I do think we will be fine in our $2.2 billion CapEx, and we'll be within there because I'm going to be able to not make any more investments in all that other stuff.</p><p>So I hope I've covered it. I tried to also cover additional questions while I was at it. I know there -- I got 5 more. Whoever wants to go, you're in charge, go.</p><p>STEWART KIRK MATERNE, SENIOR MD, EVERCORE ISI INSTITUTIONAL EQUITIES, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Kirk Materne at Evercore. Safra, partner commentary, I thought, around the ERP product set this week was particularly upbeat. And partners are making, I think, pretty big commitments in terms of their own growth around your product set. ERP has been slower than CRM or HR in terms of moving to the cloud for sure. I was just kind of curious, why do you see that -- why is that inflection maybe happening now with your partners?</p><p>And then secondly, I think you and Mark have talked historically about the base hasn't even moved on the application side of the equation. Is the base starting to move because of where the products are?</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: Yes. So let me tell you what I have always believed, and maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong. But until our customers saw that we had moved everything, a whole bunch of them were just kind of like waiting. Because it's one thing to move HR. It's one thing to move your front office. But you and me, we know, the most conservative group is the finance operations. These are the folks that file quarterly filings. We all sign them, and they are not necessarily the ones loving change. How do you build confidence with those?</p><p>Well, first of all, a number of them did not want to move in our base until they had a good supply chain. If they're going to move -- remember, if you're an E-Business Suite user, the operative word is suite, okay? We sold you last time on having the whole thing work together. You've covered Oracle long enough, you remember. And they -- really, they don't want to move until they move the whole thing together. They'll fool around on the edges, but the big thing, they wanted to see others do it, and they wanted to know that we had done it. We have done it. We implemented supply chain. Okay. Now they're good to go. Little by little, our base is moving. They're very excited about moving. At any one moment, there are hundreds, hundreds of simultaneous moves by our partners. They're -- just talking to a couple of our partners that I actually happened to introduce their speaker, they had 400 of our clients moving simultaneously, so 800 together, nearly 1,000.</p><p>And this momentum builds because -- and then once they're on the other side -- I was sitting at Modern Finance Experience, which is a lunch we -- I was at the lunch at this table, so a few E-Business Suite users moving because they realize it's time. And so that -- and ERP, for us, is growing 30-something percent. And that's just Fusion ERP. Obviously, NetSuite continues to grow. Those are smaller companies. This is -- and as ERP gets bigger, this is causing rapid acceleration in the apps world.</p><p>We do have some negatives in our SaaS number, by the way, which we called out before, which is when Facebook and Google, some of the big platforms, didn't want to permit Data as a Service from anybody but themselves, that's had a negative on our numbers. That's going to become irrelevant very soon because just of the size will be dwarfed by the growth in ERP. And by the way, we're finally on deck with the front office offering, which of course we have a competitor with Salesforce.com, but I will tell you that what they don't have is 2 things. One is they don't have the other pieces that anyone doing a complete front office would need, including product life cycle management, a full configure price quote that then connects to -- into a manufacturing suite. And they don't have a full platform. So that's starting -- that's going to be a much longer haul.</p><p>So -- but little by little, we have an excellent management team that's really put together a message, and we've got a bunch of customers starting there. But that's a longer-term job. The big thing that's pushing our SaaS number is obviously the growth in ERP.</p><p>MARK L. MOERDLER, SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST, SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN &amp; CO., LLC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Excellent. Mark Moerdler, Bernstein. You talked about how you're now live on your own...</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: Supply chain, yes.</p><p>MARK L. MOERDLER: And the whole business, and that you'll be able to accelerate the rate of being able to close the books. What does that do -- and now you're automating all of it. What does that do for the underlying cost structure of the Oracle business, especially if you accelerate the revenue growth?</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: So first of all, had we not done it -- understand I don't know how I could have afforded to run the operation with such massive volume increases. It simply would not have been manageable. So first of all, it's avoided growth in costs.</p><p>Secondly, it's released resources to be able -- because even though I can't remember the exact percentage, very, very high percentage of our transaction by volume are, I think, what we called touchless. Is that the lingo we use? Touchless, no touch, something like that. Okay. So that means nobody touches it.</p><p>However, there are transactions that are -- somehow require special teams to work on those. A, I couldn't have afforded to have teams work on those. So now we can have people focus on the complicated, the weird, the unique, the lots of moving parts, something that's not regular without raising my cost structure. Now as revenue accelerates -- this has happened to us before, by the way. If you think way, way back in our original first transformation when Larry took over operations of Oracle when I first came in 1999, you know what happened, we started growing, and our expenses didn't go up. And it -- and that is how we ended up with the massive increases in our margin.</p><p>Our back-office as a percentage of our overall business already is a very small spend compared to other companies. But now as it accelerates, we expect that this will give us additional value. Additionally though, we redeployed some of those resources in completely different areas, and ultimately get even some savings back to that.</p><p>Okay, so let me make a deal with you guys. We're on a schedule here, so I'm going to let the other folks do their talking, and then I will come up and take more questions afterwards, if that's okay. Are we good with that plan? Excellent. Thank you. Who's next?(presentation)</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Please welcome to the stage, Executive Vice President, Steve Miranda.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA, EVP OF APPLICATIONS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, ORACLE CORPORATION: Thank you. Do I have to leave this up for a set period of time? No? Can I call it the Miranda Rights next year for -- okay. All right. Let me go and do this.</p><p>So my name is Steve Miranda. I'm going to cover -- try to get some color on a few key differentiated points in our applications. So I'm going to cover the completeness of the suite. I'll cover the advantage that we have from the technology of the suite, and I'll give you a little bit of flavor of the customers that are updating to our SaaS applications.</p><p>So first, we talk about the benefit of having a complete suite of SaaS applications, and both parts of that commentary is critical: complete and SaaS. Why is that the case? So when we talk about complete, it's financials, it's core HR, it's supply chain and manufacturing, sales and service, including field service, marketing and data. Now let me try to give you examples of why they're both -- all of that is critical.</p><p>This is a sampling of new feature functions we've added since last year, and there's a couple of key aspects of it. First, the SaaS component. So we update every single one of our customers over 19,000 pods quarterly. Every quarter, every one of those applications average a little bit over 100 features that we add to it. And a very, very simple test to figure out whether a company is a SaaS application or a hosted cloud application is a pretty simple set of questions. Just ask them how many code lines do they have and are all their customers on the same exact code line. With all their customers I'm going to show you, one single code line, all on the same exact code line.</p><p>The second question is how often do they up those -- update those customers? At Oracle, SaaS applications, we update all the customers 4 times a year, all to the identical function. Why is that important? Without doing that speed and that cadence, we can't add as much feature functions to each and every application. Without doing that speed and cadence to every single one of the customers, it is impossible for us to get feedback on what's being used, what isn't being used. And hold that thought because when I get to machine learning, that becomes critical on what we do.</p><p>So frankly, having been at Oracle for a little over 2 decades, if we were put in a competitive situation trying to do our older model of the E-Business Suite, which we've worked on for a while, I'm proud of working on that, there's just no way we could compete. Updates of 1, 2, 5, 7, 10 years, you cannot add the feature functions, you can't learn from the feature functions, you can't compete against a rapid delivery model or step date with technology.</p><p>Now you'll notice, so we add a lot, but we say of our complete suite, what have we added? Well, the vast, vast, vast majority of our customer base can update to the cloud today. You have seen us add things like, we added Vocado in financials for student financial aid planning, extending to a smaller market for higher education and student planning. We added labor distribution for specific parts of higher ed and public sector. We added joint venture accounting for oil and gas, very specific capabilities going forward. The vast majority of our customer base won't even use these things, were now at the outer edges.</p><p>In supply chain, we've added process manufacturing to our discrete manufacturing. We added project manufacturing. And we added one key feature, which I'll highlight was also to the benefit of the suite, it's called services supply chain. And what is services supply chain? Basically, can you call up for service and schedule that service person to arrive at the right time?</p><p>So let's take a pretty simple example. You have an issue. You need a repair. You need to have that scheduling, which you need field service and field service scheduling. We have that in our suite. You need an HR system because that person you might schedule may need to have a particular skill set to do that repair. So not only do you have to put the person at the right place at the right time, you need to make sure the right person is there.</p><p>But in addition to that, you need a supply chain and inventory application because if you have a repair part that needs to be done, you'd better make sure you have the part and you need transportation planning because that part better be at the right place at the right time with that person with the right skill. And oh, by the way, if you happen to manufacture the spare parts yourself, you may actually need to manufacture that part which may in fact have lead time, which may require you to buy raw materials to produce that activity.</p><p>So when we say a simple new feature, it showcases the power of the suite. You need a service application, field service scheduling, core inventory, HR and manufacturing, to enable that feature. And we believe we're unique in [enabling this in SaaS].</p><p>Investments in CX. We added a brand new application called CX Unity, which really is not only a blending of the CX properties of sales, service, marketing but also blending our data. So the general idea is, can you get a central view of your customer not only based on what you know about the customer but also the data that's happening in the real world about that customer? And use that information in your engagement with the customer, whether it's sales, service or marketing. So the analogy is quite simple on this. In the old world of just using the information you know, it's a little bit like automating a map. So you take a map and now you have a phone and you have an online phone, and it can tell you now online how to get from place A to place B. That's just the information you know.</p><p>But today's world, you have information that's happening real time, and it's out there and available. So of course, when you have a map now, you don't just use the directional. You know traffic patterns. You know change in traffic patterns. You know road closures. You know detours. And you have that same thing. CX Unity is not just a 360-degree view of the customer. It's your 360-degree view combined with external data, combined with machine learning, which helps you dictate how to best engage with the customer. So those are just a few samples of the completeness of the suite and the speed of adding to the suite.</p><p>In addition to that, not only do we have the Fusion application, but we continue to make great progress in our NetSuite application, along the same themes that you've been hearing. So since combining with Oracle, we've added a host of countries for NetSuite for our middle market or smaller customers. Those include 30-plus countries including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Singapore and the U.K. NetSuite has also added a host of verticals, and they've added that to accelerate their existing SuiteSuccess, getting 50 new SuiteSuccess industries across the NetSuite platform. They, much like Fusion applications, have 100-plus updates or 100-plus features to the core modules in each and every quarterly update that they do. And by nature of the global nature of Oracle, they leverage that and now have over 3,500 partners to help grow their infrastructure across the board for NetSuite. So just a sample on the NetSuite side, similar benefit, similar scale, similar completeness of suite. So that whether you're a large customer or a smaller organization, you can run a complete SaaS application from Oracle.</p><p>So now let me move on to the technology base, and we feel we have a significant advantage over every one of our application competitors because of our investment in the technology and because, frankly, for my team's component, a lot of it we get automatically. And I'll just cover 2 samples. Sometimes, our customers will see parts of the technology that actually surface and improve the way the applications look and feel and are used. Other times, the applications, you won't even see it. So a lot of what Clay and Don are going to talk about, a lot of what Andy and Juan have talked about, things like security, things like scale, things like network reliability. As we are in the Oracle SaaS application suite, we inherit all the benefit of the Gen2 infrastructure. And our customers just see it, it's more secure, it's faster, it's more reliable, automatic, all the benefits of all that engineering effort that we put into the cloud.</p><p>Now let me get into a few more specifics, and then what I'm going to highlight here is machine learning. So we leverage the underlying tech stack, Oracle's underlying investment in machine learning to add machine learning features across the board. This takes a flavor of recommendations within the applications or, in fact, a brand new UI called digital assistants or bots, if you will, across the board. So every single area, whether it's sales, marketing, supply chain, financials and HR, we're applying data, which I spoke of before. We're applying the technology of machine learning. We're issuing a recommendation through the application. We're measuring that for accuracy, and then we're improving that machine learning and recommendation.</p><p>So one example in the HR space, we have machine learning around best candidate matching. So what we do is basically take attributes of a candidate, again, not only your internal information, but external information like LinkedIn and attributes, we compare that against people within your own organization who have those same attributes and skills in that position and people who've succeeded in that position, and then we use machine learning to recommend who to interview, who to hire and go forward. But then we measure that in the applications, and by measuring that, we determine whether that algorithm was good or bad, and we fine-tune it and improve it day by day going forward. So again, what I talked about before being SaaS and that speed of innovation, that speed of turning, with machine learning in particular, really impossible to do without measurement and speed of constant improvement that the SaaS application provides.</p><p>And you'll see this just in different samples. In field service, we've done over 600 million recommended routes for our total applications. In our e-commerce, we've made 50-plus million product recommendations and e-mail campaigns. We've done 4 million-plus recommendations for next best actions in sales. And literally, off of every one of those bullet points I showed in the previous side, we're getting better and better and better as the numbers go up, the machine learning validates and goes forward.</p><p>So those are one example of things you see from technology. What our customers may not see directly is the value of Oracle SaaS applications moving to the autonomous database, and all the things that you hear about the autonomous database basically make it easier for us to manage and develop the SaaS applications. It makes us better -- easier to develop, we go faster into development. Since it's self-driving even in a SaaS application, though our customers don't have DBAs, Oracle has DBAs, but now much of the functions that they perform go away and are completely automated. What does that result in for our customer? More reliability, faster performance, and by nature of lower overall cost for Oracle to operate it on their behalf allows us to go even faster and then give more investment on their behalf to further improve our application products, not just spend the dollars, keeping their systems up and running through the SaaS system.</p><p>So all -- I picked out 2 examples, but the entirety of the stack investment -- I get asked sometimes in the competitive deals, what our development investment is in HR, for example. I really have no way of answering that because HR investment is way more than our HR development team because we inherit all of the infrastructure, which none of our competitors do.</p><p>Next, let me get into customers. Let me get some -- add some customers. But I just want to add to what Doug and Safra have already covered with the Oracle@Oracle story. We work a lot on it. We're pretty proud of it, and we have a great team that use the applications. But let me just give you guys some color when we say we run it at Oracle. It'll be pretty obvious, but I like saying it anyway. So we are roughly $39 billion-plus organization. We run all of our financials. We are [130-plus] employees around the globe. We run all of our HR. We are also a professional service organization through Oracle Consulting, a reasonably large professional services organization. We run our project management and project accounting through Oracle. We are a manufacturing business. Actually, we are sort of 2 manufacturing business. We have our engineered-to-order Exadata systems, but we also have more commodity systems through our MICROS business for the point of sale. We run all of those through our manufacturing system. We have tens of thousands of salespeople within the organization who runs all our sales, forecasting, lead management, marketing all through the same system.</p><p>So when we talk about running Oracle@Oracle, and I think one of you who asked during the last earnings call about the earnings speed, all of that, we run in our cloud all in one instance, all on the same version that all of our customers get, all in the same data center, same security, all with those 4-times-a-year update, that's what we use to run Oracle. So we have a slight advantage because we run our own software. But let me tell you, it's very slight. We have to run that entire business, and I think that serves as a proof point for what our cloud applications can do.</p><p>But now it also gave me the benefit of pausing on this slide, we're just extremely proud of the -- it's really a who's who of logos of customers who've converted to the cloud. And the best way I can try to simplify it is we had a pretty hard matrix to go to customers, to show them comparisons or references, if you will. Because we had to show customers who migrated from financials. You had to show customers who migrated from HR. You had to show customers who migrated from CRM. But in addition to that, because of our installed base, we have large customers, multinationals, domestic and smaller customers. You have customers who came from an SAP background, a PeopleSoft background, a JD Edwards background and an EBS background. And you have customers across many industries. And as you look at this slide, that's basically what's represented here. It's that cross matrix of different starting point, of different size organization, some public sector, some commercial, all have migrated to our financials.</p><p>In case -- and then what you'll start to see is when I flip forward to HR, you see some repeats. Hearst is one example. They spoke at my keynote. They did a great job. I'd advise you to hear -- to listen to their story. They started live off a variety of legacy systems, non-Oracle mostly, to the Oracle cloud of financials. Subsequent to the financials, they added HR. Subsequent to HR, they added payroll. After payroll, they added talent management for reviews and appraisals, and now they've added learning.</p><p>You have AXA. AXA started in Asia for the HR application talent management, added core HR. Marched around the globe, Asia, Europe. Now they have it globally.</p><p>You have Cummins, used to run HR from EBS. You have others. You had YRC Worldwide Freight, who used to run PeopleSoft HR. And then I gave you some examples who run non-Oracle systems as well.</p><p>We have it now in CRM. And in CRM, I'll call out 2 in particular, Veritas and Symantec. Though they run Oracle EBS largely on the back end, those are Salesforce.com replacements. So going directly from Salesforce.com to Oracle SaaS suite in Salesforce automation, not just in marketing, not just in service, but in the core of what Salesforce's strength is. In the case of Veritas, they had extended the application, not just core Salesforce.com, but extended the application with over 9,000, either third-party or custom extensions, to the Salesforce.com platform using Force.com, all migrated to these Oracle SaaS applications.</p><p>So hopefully, I gave you a flavor of the big differentiators we see in SaaS.</p><p>First, the most complete suite and going faster than anybody in the SaaS application to extend to that suite.</p><p>Second, we get a tremendous leverage in technology, things you see like machine learning and digital assistants or bots; and things you don't see, infrastructure updates, reliability, security going forward. The notion of technical [debt] in the Oracle Cloud has basically disappeared because we sit on top of that investment that we have going forward.</p><p>And third, and what some of you probably saw at this conference and commented about, we now have reference customers live achieving business value across all those dimensions I talked about, finance, supply chain, HR, CX, but also Siebel background, PeopleSoft background, EBS background, JD Edwards background, SAP background and other third-party backgrounds and applications.</p><p>With that, I hand over to Ken. Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Please welcome to the stage, Executive Vice President, Juan Loaiza.</p><p>JUAN R. LOAIZA, EVP OF MISSION-CRITICAL DATABASE TECHNOLOGIES, ORACLE CORPORATION: Okay. So I'm going to go through what we're doing in the database world. So we have our safe harbor that Ken showed you earlier.</p><p>So for database, we have a very simple strategy. We've been doing database for a very long time. So we have a very simple strategy: Be the best database on the best database platform, have the best database cloud and give customers the way they want it. So that's it. Those are the 4 things that we're doing. So I'm going to go through this very quickly one at a time.</p><p>So best database. We've been in the database market for a very long time, and we have a reputation we've earned for mission-critical database technology. So we continue all that. There's 2 things we're focusing a lot lately in database. One is bring all the latest cutting-edge technology into our database. So at this OpenWorld, we talked about a lot stuff, like for example, native multi-tenant technology in the database, native in-memory technology in the database, native IoT technology in the database, documents, hyperscale.</p><p>Two kind of new, cool things. For the first time at this OpenWorld, we talked about bringing Blockchain technology directly into the Oracle -- Somebody looked up. Blockchain, yes. Financial guys kind of like Blockchain. So we're bringing Blockchain technology directly into the Oracle Database. We've also brought machine learning technology directly into the Oracle Database, and a lot of data lake technology directly into Oracle Database.</p><p>So all the cutting-edge technology -- most of this was already out, and there's a few things that will be coming out next year. So all the cutting-edge technology in the Oracle Database and make it a seamless experience with everything that's already out there. So that's our other big part of the database strategy or something we're calling converged database. So like on a smartphone, it's not just a phone, you have all sorts of other stuff. You have music. You have Internet. You have maps. You have everything in the world. Same thing with the database. We're bringing all this technology into one database, and that has a ton of advantages, simplicity advantages, availability, performance. One of the ones that I like to call out is you get synergy. Like on the phone, it's a music device and it's an Internet device. So it's 2 things. But you also get synergies. So some of you can do streaming music, which you could never do before when these things were separate. So it's not just, hey, we're cramming it all into one thing. They actually play together. They help each other. So we can run analytics on unstructured data. We can run mission-critical OTP with Blockchain technology. We can run Blockchain with unstructured data and structured data. So it's not just putting them together. You also get a lot of synergy. Okay. So that's best database. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on that, okay?</p><p>Second, best database platform. So by the way, we have the best database platform. So let me just say that. Now best database platform. So how do we run the database? This is something we put a lot of work into. And we have our engineered systems, specifically Exadata. It's been on the market for about 10 years, extraordinarily successfully. We have most of the largest companies in the world running on Exadata now, very successfully across all sorts of workloads, everything from super mission-critical to giant data warehouses, to the most complex applications in the world. A lot of consolidation.</p><p>When we first came out with Exadata, the biggest users were actually telecoms. Now the biggest users are you guys, the financial companies. So practically, every big bank in the world is heavily invested in Exadata. There's a very few number of large banks that have not bought Exadata. I just talked to one 2 hours ago who's about to go big into Exadata. So it's very successful. Why? Because it's super mission-critical, super fast, super available, great price performance. So all those things put together runs all the different workloads, very flexible.</p><p>So let me just say a little about what we're doing at this front. So at this OpenWorld, we announced a new version of Exadata, and this kind of takes it to the next level. So there's a couple of different things here. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail, but we've -- we're using a latest cutting-edge, what's called RDMA network, inside our Exadata platform. So we've moved to a new 2.5x faster network.</p><p>More interestingly, we're using what's called persistent memory. Those of you that cover tech known that this is a brand-new semiconductor technology that just came out. It's from Intel. We've been working with them for 5 years to get this working and get it to market, and we're getting tremendous performance from that. We get about 10 times faster transaction processing latency. 10 times, not 10%, 10 times. And that's a big deal. And we do that because we've integrated our database software and our Exadata through all the way to the persistent memory in a very unique way that nobody else can do. So this is something that we've announced, and we started shipping immediately.</p><p>I can tell you, I've talked to a lot of customers at OpenWorld. And if you go talk to people, go talk to your own people, this has our customer base very excited. 10 times latency benefit. Doesn't come around very often. It's kind of a sea change in the technology world. Okay. Best database platform, most proven and the latest and greatest technology.</p><p>All right. So let's move on to best database cloud, third part of the strategy. You've probably heard that we have this thing called Oracle Autonomous Database. So that's our strategy for the best database cloud. Now it's very simple. At some level, it's all about automating, self-provisioning, self-scaling, all that kind of stuff. It's really more than that because the simple way to think about autonomous database, kind of like a self-driving car, right? Everything's automated. It does it all. You don't have to have all these people doing it for you. But as usually happens when there's a technology change like this, that's kind of the most straightforward benefit, but there's more that comes with it. So for example, when people talk about self-driving cars, you're like, \"Hey, I no longer have to drive. That's nice.\" But that's not the only thing. Like, \"Hey, you can just send your card to pick up your kid at the soccer game. That's nice.\" But you get ideas floating around, \"Hey, I can have my car that's running around making money for me while I'm at work by driving other people around.\"</p><p>So there's -- so technology changes actually create bigger opportunities, and it's the same thing with autonomous database. It's self-driving, but the other big benefits are the whole security. Security is a giant pain point for companies. Securing database is very difficult. So we take on that thing, and we do a much better job of securing the data than practically every single customer in the world is doing. The scaling. So it used to be things were very static, systems were very static. With our autonomous database, it expands and contracts dynamically. So it brings in a whole generation of better scaling, better cost performance than ever existed before. The availability, much better. Some of the machine learning technology, much better.</p><p>So it's not just the self-driving part. Because when you have a big technology change, it's not -- there is the straightforward part like, \"Hey, I get 2 things on my phone.\" But then the synergies come together, and you get a much bigger whole than just the sum of the parts. So we've been production with autonomous database for a little over a year. We -- these numbers are taken straight from our Q4 report. We have thousands now of paying customers. Many trials. We just launched our free autonomous database trial. So that's something Larry talked about on Monday. We, in the last couple of days, have gotten thousands of sign-ups for free autonomous database. So it's really kind of starting to pick up speed, pick up momentum.</p><p>Okay. I want to point out a couple of things. When we talk about autonomous database, we say the word database, but it's really the whole stack. So traditionally, customers built their whole thing. They bought servers, storage, network, OS, back-up, all that stuff, they put it together themselves. When a customer gets an autonomous database from us, they get the whole stack. So that increases our addressable market quite substantially. It's one thing.</p><p>Second, again, autonomous database is self-driving. That's nice. Oracle has not been known to be the easiest-to-use database in the world. That hasn't been our reputation. It's been known as the most mission-critical database in the world. Now actually, we're the simplest-to-use database in the world. That opens up new markets. So people like developers were scared to use Oracle before. Smaller businesses were scared to use Oracle before. Lines of businesses within companies were scared to use Oracle before. Data scientists, so these guys out there with their -- they're trying to do all this machine learning data science, were scared to use Oracle. Why? Because it was kind of complicated to use Oracle.</p><p>Now with autonomous database, we're the -- we're literally the simplest database in the world.</p><p>So what used to be our biggest weakness, we've completely flipped it. We are the easiest database to use in the world. It opens up whole new addressable market, a whole new range of users that can get it. And that's what we're seeing with a lot of our autonomous database adoption. Okay.</p><p>So I'm going to flip through a couple of slides on some of the things that we're seeing. So we're seeing a lot of -- Oracle, again, traditionally, you think of as large companies, the Fortune 500. We address the Fortune 500. We're also getting, with autonomous database in particular, a lot of small, midsized companies. The bulk of the companies. Now most companies in the world are not part of the Fortune 500. It turns out there's only 500 of those. But over 90% of our users for autonomous database or early users are small companies. So it's growing that market. The market that wasn't traditionally Oracle's market, there were other people that were strong in that market, we're going to grow very fast in that market.</p><p>Developers, again, I talked about this. About 1/4 of the users are developers. Again, developers were kind of scared of Oracle. Now it's super easy to use Oracle.</p><p>New workloads versus migrated workloads. So there's a ton of new workloads. So when you look at our autonomous database, a little less than half are brand-new workloads. And the other half is workloads that existed that people are migrating onto autonomous database. So a lot of new workloads it's bringing in.</p><p>Industry. So this is actually kind of interesting. So there's generally early adopters and late adopters, okay? And what we usually see is things like professional services and technology. Those are the early adopters. Tech companies, they like cool, new stuff. Professional services, they like cool, new stuff. Who doesn't generally like cool, new stuff? Actually, public sector is not normally an early adopter. So I actually just saw this chart last week and I was like, wow, that's interesting. Why? Because if you're in the public sector, you have -- you struggle with getting talented IT, right? And so when we provide an autonomous database, suddenly, they're like, \"Hey, this enables me to do things I couldn't do before because I couldn't get the talent in my public sector to do the kind of mission-critical database technology.\" And actually, the one here that's interesting is financial because, again, financial is not normally an early adopter. They usually kind of hang back a little bit. But it's interesting, the #1 highest adopting for autonomous database is financials sector. Now that one, I don't have as easy an explanation for. Like public sector is kind of a no-brainer, but financials is an interesting one.</p><p>Okay. So we came out with autonomous database about a year ago, and we first started with autonomous data warehouse, which is aimed at things like data markets, analytics. Then we came out with autonomous transaction processing. So these have both been in production for a little over a year. Initially, most of the customers were autonomous data warehouse in the first quarter we headed out. But as you can see, transaction processing is growing over time.</p><p>Now data warehouse analytics, obviously, lower risk, right? If your analytic system is down or you have a problem, the company doesn't shut down, so as we bring in transaction processing, that's higher risk. So they're going to be a little bit behind. But it's growing very nicely, and again, it grows the addressable market.</p><p>I'm not going to go through all this stuff. I do have a customer that's going to come talk to you about their experience. So we have a lot of customers, very, very happy. And you've seen some of this stuff.</p><p>I'll talk briefly about this. When we first came out with autonomous database, we came out with something called serverless autonomous database. We just -- last month -- about a month ago, introduced in production something called Dedicated. So the idea of serverless, very simple, very elastic. Dedicated is aimed more at large IT. So serverless, super elastic, super simple. It's meant for customers that don't want to know or care about database. So line of business, data centers, they don't want to know, are we on patch 121456 or 121457? They don't know. They don't care. They just, you guys deal with it, you guys do all your best practices. That's what's serverless. So it's aimed at labs, departments, SMBs, developers, that kind of people.</p><p>About a month ago, we released what's called Dedicated. That's much more targeted at the enterprise and at people like CIOs, CTOs, architects, people that want a level of control; people that say, \"Hey, I want to make sure any new software that comes into this goes into my test system before it goes into my production system, I want to make sure that nobody messes with anything near my quarter close.\" So they wanted to find some policies. They want to have a level of control over the policies that we're implementing in the back end. That's what Dedicated is targeted at. So it's a brand new thing. We'll expand our appeal to large enterprises, in particular, the IT department. So we're addressing both the people that hate IT and the people that are IT.</p><p>Okay. So that's Database Cloud. Your way is very simple again. We have -- we offer our autonomous database, our database technology, both on-premises, in the public cloud and in something we call Cloud at Customer. We've now released our second generation of Cloud at Customer, and what it basically means, it's pretty simple. It's take our public cloud technology, deploy it in the customer's database -- data center. We have hundreds of customers running this. It's very popular.</p><p>Okay. And the last step, really kind of the last step to complete the whole picture is bring our Autonomous Database to Cloud at Customer. So today, we have Autonomous Database in the public cloud. We brought our cloud technology into the data center. The very last step, which we'll complete next year, is bring the Autonomous Database technology into customers' data centers. So that's coming.</p><p>Okay. So that's it. This is -- this has a lot of appeal. What CIOs want, they want to modernize the cloud in a safe fashion, knowing that it's going to work, that they're not going to have a problem. They need to modernize everything. Just taking a few new applications, putting them into the cloud isn't going to move the needle. They want to secure the enterprise, innovate more, spend less. We address all these pain points directly, so that's why this is so appealing to our customers.</p><p>Okay. Now what I want to do is bring up Craig Wilensky. He's the CEO of a SaaS company called JASCI Software, and he's going to tell us a little bit about his use of Autonomous Database because he's gone all in on Autonomous Database.</p><p>CRAIG A. WILENSKY, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CEO, JASCI LLC: I have.</p><p>JUAN R. LOAIZA: So thanks, Craig, for joining us. Maybe start by telling us a little bit about your company.</p><p>CRAIG A. WILENSKY: Sure. So JASCI is a SaaS software application for logistics. So we drive e-commerce operations, retail, consumer goods at the warehouse level, inventory level. So we're the ones facilitating that. I know there's a lot of different definitions of SaaS. So we're a SaaS multi-tenant system, so one logical system that controls all the customers. So it was a big task. It's some of the reasons why I'm here today.</p><p>JUAN R. LOAIZA: Right. And when he means warehouse -- you don't mean data warehouse.</p><p>CRAIG A. WILENSKY: No, no, I mean moving physical...</p><p>JUAN R. LOAIZA: Real warehouse.</p><p>CRAIG A. WILENSKY: You order something over the Internet, magically shows up at your door. I'm controlling that inventory. I'm controlling all the labor, robotics, everything in real time.</p><p>JUAN R. LOAIZA: Right. And so tell us what some of the challenges were and why you decided to look at our Autonomous Database technology.</p><p>CRAIG A. WILENSKY: Well, we work with varied customers, anything from small, medium and very large. And we're one logical system. We realized, as we were onboarding customers and sizable ones, that our main limitation was going to be the database. So we're a born in the cloud system. It's -- and I look at it at 3 layers. So we're the SaaS application, and I look at the cloud as the Platform as a Service and I look at the database as a Database as a Service. So we were looking for a partner that would give us that capability to scale our application.</p><p>We really had 3 -- really 4 things we were looking at. Our customers really want speed. I mean if any -- if I take a second or more to do stuff at the warehouse level with all the labor and robotics, they may have to double their workforce, they will not hit service levels or anything like that. So speed was really paramount.</p><p>Second thing was reliability. As you're running people's supply chains, that's their company. That's the heart of their company. So reliability, they want 7 by 24 uptime. They want 100% availability all the time.</p><p>The other thing they wanted was security. I mean I'm housing all their corporate data. And I mean I'm housing all their customers, what they ship, all their products, pricing, everything within the platform, so security was also paramount.</p><p>And the last thing was the ability to scale, so they may have back to school; they may have Cyber Monday; they may have Black Friday and maybe Chinese Single's Day, 11/11. And their -- the scale just goes tremendously large. So we needed a partner and a platform that was really going to size with us and really allow us to grow with our customer base.</p><p>JUAN R. LOAIZA: What's the scale of a very large customer for you?</p><p>CRAIG A. WILENSKY: We just got selected by one that does 100 million orders a year. These are large-scale customers. The average one, you have customers ranging from doing 2,000 orders a day to 100,000 orders a day on e-commerce. And there's a lot of focus on e-commerce today because people aren't building out new facilities for store fulfillment. But they will transform those, and that will be part of the formula as well. But these generate billions of transactions in a day. You look at it as I just ordered 1 thing or I ordered 2 things, you don't even realize the amount of transactions that does on our side. We're a machine learning platform, so our system is a little bit different than what was traditionally out there. So we developed a system that actually makes decisions in real time. So we don't really -- the data is just flying so fast. These systems, even though you had software in the past, people would manually mine data and decide what they were going to do, and that's no longer feasible. So our customers are competing with tech giants. I think you know who they are. They don't have the wherewithal and the software capability to compete with them, so we built the platform really to level the playing field.</p><p>JUAN R. LOAIZA: All right. Great. So your experience?</p><p>CRAIG A. WILENSKY: It's been great for us. So I'll go through -- we were one of the early adopters. The reason why we were one of the early adopters is I saw that I wouldn't be able to grow my company or handle my customers' requirements unless I had a platform like this.</p><p>Secondly, we didn't want to be in the database business. We wanted the benefits of a database, but we didn't want to be database experts, if you will. Yes, we do know databases and we work with them continuously, but it's not our job to maintain platforms. We're building vertical software for them.</p><p>So we were one of the early adopters in the platform, so we learned a lot about it. And we've grown with this platform. So the venture for us -- we started about 9 months ago on this venture, and now we're just onboarding customers. I'm going live this weekend with 1aauto.com, a big automotive parts on the web, a massive site, hundreds of people in a distribution center. And they go live this weekend, and I'm not worried about it.</p><p>So as we did this venture, the whole part was to have a centralized database that scales, auto scales, because as our customers grow, where they have their peak periods, we didn't want to be having to hit a button or have someone sitting there and go, \"Oh, ramp it up. Ramp it back down.\" Also for 3 things: one is the storage, we may need storage on demand; we may need memory on demand; and compute power on demand. So as we started the venture, we started loading and we took our software and loaded it on the platform, and it really worked.</p><p>So I know Larry had a lot of points that he talked about in the keynote. We're all nervous about it when you first do it. So Larry had all these key points, but it's actually true. I mean we are doing the things he was talking about today in live production. So our database, we went through Autonomous Database in the cloud, the one where you manage. So I say, it's on them. So all the patches, all the security updates, everything they're doing to keep me up full time, I don't know how they do it, but you have like automatic mirrored systems. And then every 2 weeks they're patching, and they're doing the things they need to do. And they switch, and that switch is in like milliseconds when that happens. And we even worked around some things, even those milliseconds, we need -- we're pounding transactions. So we added some things in our code to be more resilient knowing that, that happens, but it happens in milliseconds. My customers are still up and running. I'm not worried about it. I don't have to be a security expert. I don't have to have people that are dedicated to it. And even if I hire people, I'm nervous about what they would do. There's manual errors that could happen, and I did have that happen on our prior database where they were indexing while customers were live, and they deleted a table that was primary in the system. And it took us weeks to recover. Customers went down, and that's really when I made the call.</p><p>JUAN R. LOAIZA: All right. Great. Well thanks, Craig. Thanks for your experience.</p><p>CRAIG A. WILENSKY: Thank you.</p><p>JUAN R. LOAIZA: Thanks for coming.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Please welcome to the stage Executive Vice President, Don Johnson.</p><p>DON JOHNSON, EVP OF CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE, ORACLE CORPORATION: Hey, everyone. Thank you. My most professional-looking slide is Ken's, never gets old. Well, I have a little bit of technical content to cover, but strangely, Safra already covered it. And she did it really well. Little known fact, she's Co-CTO at Oracle.</p><p>So I want to talk mostly about the business of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. So Safra covered how we're an integrated business in the cloud of applications and infrastructure, though really, I think the way to think about that is -- just it aligns directly with our traditional business of applications and data. And this is a direct extrapolation from our traditional On-Premise License software business. Our customers trust us for the biggest, hardest, most gnarly and mission-critical applications and the underlying data.</p><p>That's what our business looks like. Shocker, that's what our business looks like in -- on cloud. It's what our business looks like overall. I really draw the Gen2 cloud bucket around the entire business. They're 2 halves of a whole. They're not really -- they're not separate businesses. That's the wrong way to think about it. But even in the Cloud Infrastructure business, what does our business look like? It looks like apps and it looks like data.</p><p>So breaking out the box a little bit, I'm going to talk very quickly about some of the underlying and surrounding aspects of security, infrastructure, developer tools and horizontal integrations with partners that we've done.</p><p>So a quick gauge of progress and growth. An easy metric is where we have regions. And how many regions we have. So this is a little bit of history. This is us a year ago. Actually, I am talking only about our Gen2 infrastructure. So this is the new OCI, our Gen2 infrastructure. I'm not talking about any of the stuff that, as Safra said, we are ruthlessly getting off of and going and killing and scrapping it for parts and not paying for anymore.</p><p>So Gen2 infrastructure, if you go back 3 years, that's when we launched it. It had bare metal compute, it was only one region. It was interesting but not actually useful for a lot of customers. Fast forward 12 months to 2 years ago, we were in 3 regions. We have a lot more features. It was much more interesting to many more customers. Fast forward 12 months from then, get to this picture. We had 4 regions, a lot more features, and it was very, very interesting to a broad set of customers.</p><p>Sometime in there, say, over the last 18, 20 months, we achieved what the start-up kids call product market fit. We had a good product. It did real things for real customers, solved real problems that are not addressed elsewhere. They came. They used it. They were happy and they grew. And if we took it away, they would be sad.</p><p>So at this point, we had like in the -- in the scheme of nail and scale it, we knew it was time to scale it. And we could look at the basic metrics of health and it told us and reinforced that -- that view, that we actually had the right platform and then it was time to grow it and get big as quickly as possible. Largely, what we'd look at is we look at usage. We look at new customers, new workloads. But really everything in the cloud world is defined by usage. You need happy, successful customers, and those customers look like ones who actually use it, and they grow when they're using it.</p><p>So what happened? So that was 12 months ago. This is right now. So between the end and now, we added 12 regions. For those doing the math, that's about a region per month. And candidly, a lot of these actually came in just in the last 3 or 4 months, in particular the ones in other continents in Asia and in South America.</p><p>Interesting phenomenon is that in the new places where we've launched, say, in Japan and Korea and in India, as Safra indicated, they're actually growing much, much faster out the gate than our older -- the places where we've been for more time. That's a function of the maturity of the platform, the fact we have references, the fact that we have more knowledge in the market about our offering and also the fact that we've kind of got our stuff together when it comes to go to market. We actually pipeline the stuff, and we're able to grow it.</p><p>So let's extrapolate forward. On this picture -- Larry showed this slide on Monday. So I've rounded out to the end of 2020, so this is maybe 15 calendar months. We're adding 20 more regions. We're going to be at 36 regions. So we are going global as soon we can, and we're just -- we're growing like wildfire around the world. So you will say, \"Wow, that's a lot of regions. Can you actually do that?\" Yes, we can. Why can we do that? Because we automate it to be able to do that. This is one of the second mover advantages. If you set your mind on doing something, you can do the right engineering and make it possible, both to build them and to operate them.</p><p>A couple of interesting points. So first, why are we doing this? Why are we doing this big level push? Why are we doing it now? As I said, we have the right product and we need to -- we are in fact playing catch up in the infrastructure space we need to get to market where our customers are and go to them. This is the beginning of what we see is a trend. If I project forward in the future when cloud is a $1 trillion business, which it will be, my belief is easily half of that is going to be local. All of the big workloads are going to be governed by data jurisdiction, data sovereignty. They're going to need to be served in country. And all of these are very material big workloads, and if something bad happens, you need to recover. So all of them require disaster recovery.</p><p>You'll note on the previous slide, we had a lot of duplicate regions amongst the 36. We will have 11 geographies, 11 regions where we have in-country DR. This is our basic philosophy. This is what an enterprise platform needs to do to meet people where they're at. You have to go in. Typically, you have to go in with 2 and you have to be there. We think that this is -- honestly, this is what the extrapolation of cloud for enterprise, around the world is going to look like. And we basically [dual] for it. So this is a thing that we're very agile at and that we're able to do.</p><p>As Steve and Safra noted, SaaS is fully integrated onto our Gen2 infrastructure. This means, if you launch Fusion apps in North America -- if you're a Fusion apps customer, new fusion apps customer in North America or in Europe today, you launch an OCI, all of those regions that I've just described at launch out the gate are going to have Fusion apps and NetSuite included in them. And the map that I didn't show you was the map of all the data centers that we're in the process of killing. It's honestly like a giant cleanse that we're doing corporate-wide, and I couldn't be happier about just like the end-state simplicity and the speed at which we're getting there.</p><p>So fully integrated. An interesting side effect of our ability to build this many regions so quickly is that, well, we've made it fairly modular and we have T-shirt sizes. We can go super big and extra-large and down to small. We'll get to extra-small. But this gives us the ability actually to build things that are commercially viable for what we call dedicated OCI regions, which are just like the other OCI regions but for one customer. Who would be interested in this? Well, say, a nation state that wants the ability to kind of fund geographical ability -- geographical availability in their region. Or, say, a very large footprint, a very large customer that's regulated that the regulations say they can't go to a multi-tenant public cloud. They may have a very large on-premise footprint that they don't plan on moving and requires very low latency, say like a millisecond or 2 from any workloads that they want to move to the cloud. This might look like, say, a stock exchange or a telco or a government agency or a military or a big bank. This is a thing that we have and that we're going to push. And what I'm saying in a coded fashion is my personal belief is when we tell you we're going to have 36 regions, we're actually going to have more, but we can't tell you about them.</p><p>So who uses our cloud? Where have we seen growth? Like I said, there's a trope here. There's apps and there's data. 70% of what we see is running on Oracle tech, and data as enterprise, lift and shift. And maybe 50% of them are running on Oracle Database. This is a mix across, \"Plain old database\", autonomous and Exadata. There's actually a ton of Exadata.</p><p>Why are they coming? Safra said they couldn't go anywhere else. They've been waiting for us. We're here now. Maybe 20% is Oracle applications, big ERP systems, packaged apps, E-Business Suite, JD Edwards. This is the customers who are not yet moving to SaaS. We believe eventually everybody is going to move to SaaS. SaaS eats the world. But this is complex, and it can take a long time. So we see a lot of this stuff come across, and all of it, surprisingly, runs on Oracle Database, runs on Exadata. Those 2 things have a very similar outline and shape. So unsurprisingly, we designed a cloud to be good at this. We're good at this. This is where much of our business comes in.</p><p>Slightly different, 25% of what we see on OCI are actually workloads that don't look anything like the first 2 things other than that they are big and they run on -- they run well on the same infrastructure. So they're really taking advantage. This is sort of, I wouldn't say accidental advantage, but it is the advantage of the way in which we built our infrastructure. It is very good at what I call infrastructure-intensive applications, infrastructure workloads. This includes HPC. Think computational fluid dynamics. We built out a clustered network, have high clock HPC systems. We have the latest and greatest GPUs. There are things that run in this environment that can't run elsewhere in the cloud. Honestly, in HPC, we're not really competing with other cloud vendors. We're competing with on-prem and the trade-off's between just buying a whole -- spending $100 million on computers or running this in the cloud.</p><p>This infrastructure-intensive bucket also includes just like big iron workloads, a variety of kinds, a bunch of AI, ML, data-intensive. It also includes big SaaS providers that are looking for either bare-metal security or bare-metal performance, and they're very price performance sensitive. I have some interesting examples that may surprise you in this category.</p><p>I'm going to go through these very quickly. Let's look at some of our customers and some of our workloads. So Cisco is one of the SaaS providers. Cisco Tetration, they're a security SaaS provider. They are a security company, so they're very, very -- it's a security business. They're very, very security sensitive. They require bare metal for physical isolation, and they need the price performance that it provides them. They run on bare metal.</p><p>FireEye, similar but different, security SaaS provider. They run on bare metal, big workload, very price performance sensitive.</p><p>Booster Fuels is an innovative startup that will like drive fuel to your car. It's very modern, not based on Oracle tech in general, and it's a containers, Kubernetes, MySQL workload.</p><p>CERN, they discovered the Higgs Boson. That's cool. They're also a giant user of OCI, and they have a very modern workload.</p><p>Siemens, they built a new IoT SaaS business, it runs on Oracle DB.</p><p>State of Texas, this is actually my favorite one in these examples. This is a big ERP system, a general ledger system. This was my favorite deployment because it was the most boring deployment ever. I got like 500 e-mails the weekend before. I was like nervous Nellie, hand-wringing stuff like, oh my God, everybody's all hands on deck. It went great. Nothing happened. It simply just launched. It coincided with the day of launch on a Monday. Some dude in Texas IT decided that was the right time to do a scale test of their system, and all of a sudden, they got like way more simultaneous users. Everything went great. There was not a blip. Like $92 billion of money runs through the system. I would also say I speculate there's easily thousands of things across the United States that look just like that. The fact that I'm showing this slide means reference.</p><p>7-Eleven, big database workload, big ERP system. Big ERP system, big ERP system, big ERP system. So you get the point.</p><p>We set out to be good at the cloud that excels and unlocks moving big enterprise workloads, big ERP systems, big Oracle DB application workloads, which is a trapped, latent, unsatisfied market. They're coming over. It's a lot of what we see.</p><p>I'm going to go -- so Safra already covered my security talking points. I'm going to fast forward through my [awesome] build the stack slides to the end slide and just kind of land a simple concrete point. So security is a complex topic. We talk about it a lot. At the end of the day, I think the point here is actually very, very simple. To be secure, you need to be automated. Not only do you need to be automated, it needs to cover everything. You are as strong as your weakest link. Not only does it need to be automated and pervasive, very frequently, it needs to be mandatory. You're giving bazookas to children if you just give them a pile of tools and let them manage it themselves. You need to do this for them and with them. You need to keep them safe. So behind just the technology and what we've done here, there's also a philosophy and a point of view.</p><p>So we have taken a comprehensive stack-based approach. We've provided at the foundational level things you only get at the foundational level, either do or don't have somebody else on your box with physical isolation. You do or don't need to trust somebody not to pick your memory and look at your data registers.</p><p>Autonomous Linux, like this sounds like magic. I'm a client of that. Ed Screven's team delivered it. We run our cloud on that. Larry had an anecdote, which is, true fact, a year ago, on Spectre and Meltdown, we had to go do like millions of patches in OCI. We did them around the globe in 4 hours, completely automated, didn't reboot a system, not a blip, nothing went down, nobody noticed. It's magic technology. Bringing this to customers is revolutionary. Autonomous DB, everybody knows and loves it. It is revolutionary.</p><p>The other stuff I won't go into a lot of detail. But say maximum security zone, what is this in simplicity? This is a place where we have maximum security by default and it is mandatory. And we've done this. Basically, we're taking the concepts of highly secure systems, compartmentalized information systems, hierarchical security systems like you see the Intel folks do or like you see in high-security OS, and doing at data center level scale for all of your stuff. So for instance, we'll insist everything is encrypted, has all of the right permissions. There's mandatory access controls, has the right network architecture. So for instance, this would be a place where we would not let you, say, take all of your confidential customer IP, put it in an unencrypted file, stick it in object storage, fat finger the wrong [ACL] and fat finger the wrong, say, WAF system in front of it. we wouldn't let you do that. We are protecting you.</p><p>Behind that, apart from just the technical capability, is the philosophy. We think this is our job. So there's 2 points. Customers can't do this on their own. They can't build stuff like this. They couldn't deploy it if we gave it to them. Also, like it's fundamentally a cloud system. This is not only what they demand from the cloud. This is a big part of the reason why they're going to the cloud. So this is our expectations. For enterprise customers, this is what they want in the cloud.</p><p>The other observation is, well can the other vendors -- what do they do? Do they do something like this? Well, in principle, I think in technical capability, they can. They've even got lots of smart people, but they don't. Fundamentally, what they have done to date is they've given you complicated set of tools, like here you go. Here's a side arm and a chocolate bar. Jump out of the plane. And that -- you know, it's very enabling but it's frightening, and in some sense, it makes it worse. It gives you more complexity, more options. Oh, this is different than that other place. Now all of a sudden, you've introduced a ton of risk into your system. So we have not only a stack that we think others aren't going to match up to anytime soon, but they don't even seem to want to or believe that it's their job.</p><p>So Safra also covered my infrastructure slides. What makes our actual infrastructure in Gen2 cloud do the things that I said that it does? It's actually very, very simple. All of the workloads that I described, say, talking about the lift and shift \"enterprise mission-critical big workloads,\" they require our big performance envelope. They require a lot of resources. They require a lot of stability. They're very, very cost sensitive. So what do we do? We give them a lot of resources. We have the best performance. Our pricing methodology is charge less than the other guys. Big performance, low price, excellent price performance makes it cost-effective. We give different resources than others have that are not available elsewhere. We give you Exadata. For niche workloads like HPC, we give you a clustered network in HPC systems that you can't get anywhere. We literally have stuff that others don't.</p><p>And we give you very reliable systems, and we stand behind them. So we have SLAs. This is basically a table stakes requirement. If you want to get like the state of Texas moving a ERP system and you tell them, \"Oh, sometimes stuff will go down. It's okay.\" No, they need to have an SLA, and we have categorically better and broader and more pervasive SLAs than any other vendor. Not only data plane availability like the other guys have but control plane availability. The APIs that you use to provision systems, we guarantee that they're going to be available. So if you're in a recovery event, you can call the API and get more stuff. And we guarantee the performance. These things are really table stakes for meeting the enterprise requirements for moving workloads over.</p><p>Also, we actually, in the way in which we have designed and delivered the infrastructure, and this is where it kind of gets techy and esoteric and I'm going to go super deep in it, we have truly elastic infrastructure in a way that I think is fundamentally novel in the industry. For instance, we give the ability in compute to specify how many cores you want, how much memory you want; in storage, how much storage you want, how much performance you want. But that can look a little bit like the provisioning systems in other clouds, but we give it to you dynamically, and we let you change it on the fly. So for instance, you could put, say, a data store on top of block storage. And if 29 days of the month you have little demand and then 1 day of the month you have this much demand, you can simply just add more performance at the end of the month and slide it back down. Why does this matter? I'm going to fast forward through to -- yes, this is blah, blah, blah, tastes great, less filling, costs less. Look, if you're on AWS, 90% of your money gets spent on computers, storage, database and then 10% on the fairly cool kids [blow] stuff. The things that dominate your bill are the traditional infrastructure. Part of the reason it dominates your bill is you don't really get all the benefits of elasticity. You can scale out and get more computers, but you can't really adjust the size of a computer. And so people end up over-provisioning and underutilizing.</p><p>The elasticity I just described lets you actually rightsize your stuff and gives you the advantages that the cloud promises of true elasticity, pay only for what you use for traditional workload. So you don't need to be born in the cloud. You could say, move a pokey old ERP system on top, rightsize your stuff. If you got it wrong, upsize it. You can optimize your cost.</p><p>So partnerships. We have a couple of big partner announcements -- I'm running long. A couple of big partner announcements in the recent past, Microsoft and VMware. Now that Larry's here, you guys tell me if I'm getting the hook. Okay. I'll -- Larry, I'll run fast, I promise. So we're very, very proud of our partner announcements.</p><p>Why did we do these first of all? Well, think about the business that I described. We're doing lots of lift and shift from an on-premise environment into the cloud. What do all of our customers look like? Like what's the chalk outline of a typical customer? The have a lot of Oracle. They have a lot of Microsoft. They virtualize their infrastructure on VMware. What are they looking to do when they move it over? Maybe they have eventual high aspirations, but they want to change as little as possible. And we want to give them -- really what they need is the ability to put the right workload in the right place and bring as much of their tooling with them.</p><p>So for Microsoft, for many customers, the best landing spot for a lot of their Microsoft apps is in Azure. The best landing spot for a lot of their Oracle apps is in Oracle. We put a very simple proposition in front of Microsoft, and they thought it was great. Hey, what if we had 2 clouds that work together and we just make them really close, like make the data centers a millisecond apart so then you could run one foot of your application over here and another foot over there? You can literally split an application between them. You can have apps talk to apps. You can have services talk to services. We'll move up the stack. Everything composes. That's it. It's very customer centric. Customers love it. We've rolled this out in Virginia. It's live now in London. We're going to take this around the world. We're going to bring this to U.S. gov. And also interestingly, this actually -- remember I said we're building 36 regions. This factors in deciding decisions. We decided, as part of this, to serve North America. We're doing our U.S. West region here in the San Francisco area specifically to be close to Azure.</p><p>Second big partnership announcement, we're very, very proud of this. As I said, VMware, a lot of our customers -- a lot of our workloads that are coming over, they look like, run an application stack, Oracle packaged apps or not, middleware virtualized on top of VMware with an Oracle DB. What we enable customers to do is lift and shift and bring that whole thing over.</p><p>Our VMware implementation, what we're rolling out in a couple of months with VMware on OCI is actually very, very different than what other vendors have done in the cloud with VMware integrations. It's directly integrated into our compute, into the compute provisioning experience. You launch an instance and you could run Oracle Linux or Microsoft Windows or other Linuxes or you can run VMware. You get the full VCF stack. You can pick amongst the versions, and you can run them on bare metal.</p><p>This allows you to basically lift and shift literally with high fidelity the environment that you have. You can move the versions over. You can move the configuration over. You can use the same set of tools. You can use all the features. Under the covers, you're doing fancy stuff with layer 2 virtualization, et cetera, to make it work. But literally, it looks like a complete lift and shift of a complete VMware environment into a full OCI environment.</p><p>You're cheek by jowl with an autonomous DB. You can call that Kubernetes cluster over there, or that HPC cluster over there. You can call OAC. You can do anything inside of this environment because it's completely integrated. You can manage your cloud VMware environment from on-prem and your on-prem environment from the cloud. You can use VMotion to burst in. It looks like an elastic extension of what you have. Basically, a bunch of customers told us, who own a VMware, that they could run in our infrastructure just like they do and we gave it to them. Others have not. So we're very, very proud of this. We think it's phenomenal, and we have had tremendously positive customer feedback on both of these partnerships.</p><p>In addition to the big bang things, we had some medium bang things but did it at scale. So a big announcement in -- or a big achievement for us in the partner space was integrated billing under UCM, under universal credits, under our agreement, like standard agreement, you can simply just click an app store, enterprise app store running an OCI, where we provide first tier support.</p><p>All right. I'm going to talk about this for all of 30 seconds. And the ironic thing is probably this represents about 50% of our actual service portfolio. So everything we've talked about, thus far, enables us to lift and shift big enterprise apps, Oracle apps. And that is the obvious thing for us to do, and it is very necessary for our business growth and to serve our customers. But in my view, it's not sufficient because most of the customers that are moving that stuff over are moving to the cloud, not just to get cost advantages but ultimately, to transform themselves, and go digital, modernize, et cetera. Pithy summary of this is bring your present, build your future.</p><p>We need to have a general-purpose cloud to serve them and we do. We have built a full, complete stack of container-native, developer-facing tools to give those developers in those businesses the ability to build their future and do what they need to do. In doing that, we have taken an open standards posture because we think proprietary lock-in is evil. And in the cloud, we have chosen every open standard in every Open Source interface that we could find available. Our streaming is Kafka. Our orchestration is Terraform. Where we have introduced new technology like functions as a service, we've Open-Sourced it. You can run it on your laptop or run it under the cloud.</p><p>And to get things into the hands of developers -- and I should say, so to date, we have not focused much on marketing to developers and most of the developers that we anticipate using our platform will come in with a workload, like their business will move one of those big workloads and then we'll need to expand it because usually that's a beachhead for a very large expansion. So as I like to say, you come for the database, but you stay for all the awesomeness.</p><p>At this point, we want to get this across the world and in front of as many developers as we can. So we announced Free Tier, and we have had really a rush of sign-ups. So we're very excited about all this.</p><p>Larry, we have a customer? It will be about 5 minutes if that's okay.</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CTO, ORACLE CORPORATION: [Of course].</p><p>DON JOHNSON: Okay, sorry.</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: Everybody's [down here, down there].</p><p>DON JOHNSON: So now for something completely different. So I've talked a lot about big enterprise workloads, big ERP systems. And I don't think it takes a ton of imagination to know what those look like. What about an application that connects hundreds of millions of users that are a rabid fan base of a certain sport? So I am very, very pleased and excited to bring up Gaurav Duggal from Reliance Jio, who is a big part of the reason why I immediately ran out of capacity in Mumbai at launch.</p><p>So Gaurav, welcome. It is -- thank you very much for coming here. It's truly an honor to have you as a customer.</p><p>So can you tell us a bit about Reliance Jio and the application that you have?</p><p>GAURAV DUGGAL, VP, RELIANCE JIO INFOCOMM LIMITED: Yes. So Jio is the largest telecom operator in India. It serves around 350-plus million users, which is I think 10% more than total U.S. population. And my team heads a lot of [innovative] solution. So one of them is Play Along, using which we had served around 155 million users in the last cricket fanatic country, Indian premier league, in a 50-day period, and we had served around 10 million users per day. We keep doing a lot of such engagements, and our application is 100 million active users per month.</p><p>There are other applications also apart from that. There is a video bot, which is a intent classification bot, which all of that is built on Open Source and which serves around 300 million utterances a year. There's another videoconferencing solution, which is connect anywhere, anytime, any meeting. And yes, so this is -- these are the 3 main applications we offer.</p><p>DON JOHNSON: Yes, that's amazing. Just the scale of having that many simultaneous users using an app and interacting with one another, the scale is very, very impressive. So it sounds like, under the covers, there is a few workloads. You have a massive mobile back end to serve that many users during match day. You're doing a bunch of video stuff for video streaming, transcoding. And for the chat bot, my understanding is you're doing complex machine learning across, I don't know, 10, a dozen Indian languages to be able to interact. Can you tell us more about what your architecture looks like as deployed on OCI?</p><p>GAURAV DUGGAL: Yes. So the first application, which is engagement application, which is highly concurrent users, HR proxies in the middle layer, which connects to hundreds of web socket cluster and we have caching -- Redis -- Redis is being used as caching and persistent layer is backed by MongoDB, so all Open Source.</p><p>And with respect to the other application, which is videoconferencing we have VMware-based transcoding services, and then all of it is built on WinStack.</p><p>The third application, which is a video bot, which uses [Spark ML] to orchestrate all the APIs. And we have a bidirectional LSTM and bot to classify our intents, which converts, I think, tens of Indian languages. We are vernacular in nature. And if you come to India, unlike English or European languages, people mix languages. Like somebody will speak Hindi and English -- English and various Indian languages. It's very complex.</p><p>DON JOHNSON: Awesome. The layman's translation is it's badass and it's very modern. And it runs at very high scale. They have a very big footprint in OCI. If you don't mind my asking, where did this run before you deployed it on OCI?</p><p>GAURAV DUGGAL: Yes. We were running in Amazon before.</p><p>DON JOHNSON: And what were the factors that led you to choose to deploy this on OCI?</p><p>GAURAV DUGGAL: Yes. So we evaluated OCI. We were waiting for Indian data center to come up, which has come up lately. And obviously, the total cost of ownership is quite low. And second is the IOPS is very high for block storage, which helps us achieve more from the same machine-type ship. And the GPUs, which are connected with NIC 50 Gbps Ethernet is excellent to have a cluster training, which reduces our time by 50%. These are the 3 main reasons.</p><p>DON JOHNSON: Awesome. Well, we are truly honored to have you on our platform and that you've chosen us. What's next? What do you plan on doing in the cloud next?</p><p>GAURAV DUGGAL: Yes. So we are evaluating various other workloads, and we will, with your great customer excellence team and Clay promising us a lot more features, we would be moving a lot more workloads going forward. But yes, we are waiting for the DR capability also to come up in next quarter in India itself.</p><p>DON JOHNSON: Awesome. Well, Gaurav, thank you so much. We loved having you as a customer. We appreciate it.</p><p>A very quick closing comment. Apologize, Larry.</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: Don't apologize. That was fantastic.</p><p>DON JOHNSON: So to tie some things together, we're executing on what we believe is a big, phenomenal, fantastic business across the globe for a latent untapped market and move of enterprise workloads. And that's what we accentuate. That's what we're built for. And if we do one thing exceptionally well and get A pluses, it's that. But that's not all that we do.</p><p>So we believe the core things that we have that enable that business, which fundamentally it's the apps and it's the database and it's all the customers who run in our apps and our database, the reliance that they have, those are things that -- I don't mean to brag, but fundamentally, they're untouchable. Nobody can build that. All of the things that underlie Internet scale applications and the flash mobs and sorry, Safra, even the Angry Birds of the world, we can build that. They cannot build what we have, but we can build what they have. And we've actually built a phenomenal general-purpose platform. And what you're going to see over time is a change in complexion. We're going to grow big fast I believe. It's a opinionated forward-looking statement. We're going to grow big fast in the enterprise segment, which we more or less own, and complementing that and increasing over time is going to be general-purpose workloads in a gen-purpose cloud. Thanks.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And now please welcome to the stage Oracle's Chairman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison.</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: That was interesting. I guess if we left that empty chair up here, you might stare at that rather than at me so -- or actually, we're paying by the hour. It's a gig economy, so all of the furniture's rented, and we're going to save money by sending them back right away.</p><p>So again, I'll make -- I just want to reemphasize what Don said, which is we have some franchise properties, some franchise technologies that we've developed that would be very difficult for anyone else to reproduce. We've been working on Fusion, the Fusion application suite, especially Fusion area, the back-office portion of it. We've been working on that for 14 years now, something like that. And if someone wants to reproduce it, they start now and 14 years later, they'll be where we are today. We put a lot of people on this. We have a lot of expertise. It would be very, very hard to copy that technology.</p><p>The database, I think, we even have a bigger lead over the different databases that are around. There are a lot of database properties -- there are a lot of Open Source database properties, and we support them all on our cloud. In fact, we are the primary developer of MySQL. We develop not only the Oracle Database but we develop -- we own the MySQL brand. Amazon Aurora, of course, as you know, is MySQL. We support Mongo. You name it. By the way, we support it not only in our cloud but our analytics work with it. Our big data SQL allows you to access, not only our block storage but also virtually any other storage. So we allow you to bring whatever database you want. The thing that differentiates us is there are lots and lots of existing Oracle databases and we run Oracle way better than anybody else. So -- and the Oracle Database is, we think, way ahead of any other database around.</p><p>So the Fusion application suite, NetSuite, the Oracle Database, very difficult technologies for anyone else to build.</p><p>As far as the Open Source database, can we support MongoDB better than Amazon? I think we can. I think you can have a better MongoDB experience, a better MySQL experience coming to OCI, coming to the Oracle Cloud, than you can by going to the Amazon Cloud or the Azure cloud or the Google Cloud. So we think we can be very competitive there. We think we can differentiate ourselves there, deliver better performance, better reliability, lower cost, all of those things for the OpenStack, Open Source technologies and also bring customers who want to take advantage of the Oracle Database and our applications.</p><p>Again, I'll close with this and then I'll open it up to questions. We are the only infrastructure company that has enterprise applications. We're the only company in the world that offers things like accounting to the largest -- financial accounting to the largest companies in the world and also offers compute and block storage and archive storage. There's no one else in the infrastructure -- Google does not offer enterprise applications.</p><p>I've seen Microsoft sometimes listed -- I saw an analysis that had us as #3, the third largest enterprise apps company with Microsoft with #2, Salesforce #1 and us #3. That's something -- Microsoft doesn't have enterprise apps unless you say Office is an enterprise app, that Word's an enterprise app, but we don't compete with Word. Our competitors in the enterprise application business, we only have 3 of significance, 2 in the cloud, Salesforce and Workday and 1 on -- 1 that never moved to the cloud and has no plan to move to the cloud and that's SAP. Those are all the enterprise apps companies.</p><p>None of those companies have -- offer an infrastructure cloud, a complete cloud. We think that gives us a huge advantage over other application companies because when you run the Oracle manufacturing system and accounting system and sales system and service system, you come for that, you -- big companies make lots of extensions and build lots of bespoke, lots of custom applications to work with those applications that they're renting from us. Well, Workday has no infrastructure. They have no underlying platform. There's no way they can do that with Workday. There's no real -- it's -- Salesforce has a thing called Force.com, but it's very primitive. We offer full development environments, full block storage, full -- we have the whole deal. They have a very simple system for extending and integrating Salesforce applications to other applications. They're not really an infrastructure business. They don't have an infrastructure cloud. SAP has no cloud. Workday has no platform for extensions and all of that.</p><p>So we think the fact that we're in the infrastructure business gives us a huge advantage in the enterprise applications business. And that's why we're growing much faster in the enterprise application business than anybody else. I mean Salesforce, to grow, is making a lot of acquisitions. We haven't made a significant acquisition in a very long time. Our app -- our ERP systems, the combined growth of our -- of Fusion ERP and NetSuite ERP is well over 30%, growing much faster than Salesforce has grown. It's all organic. And I mean they can go out and buy an analytics company and say, \"Look, Salesforce is growing really fast,\" but in fact, Salesforce is not growing really fast. We're growing much faster than they are, and it will very soon when we will pass them in enterprise applications.</p><p>And they're going to have a hard time. They don't have backhaul. We have all the applications they have in the front office. They don't have any of the applications we have in the back office. We believe that suites win. We believe having an infrastructure to allow you to extend your applications is very, very important in the applications business. So we see ourselves moving into the #1 position, passing Salesforce, very, very quickly.</p><p>As far as infrastructure is concerned, most of the Oracle databases, virtually all the Oracle databases still run either on-premise or in what we call Cloud at Customer. Very little of those mission-critical applications have been moved into the cloud. Now we're beginning to see just the tip of the iceberg of some of those people are moving those workloads, moving that data into our cloud. And they are getting better performance, better availability and saving money all at the same time. And we think this is very, very early days, but we think that's going to be an enormous business for us on the infrastructure side.</p><p>So we're very optimistic about the 2 businesses that we're in, in the enterprise applications in the cloud, infrastructure in the cloud, everything from our unique technology in terms of the Oracle Database to the fact that we deliver the Open Source stack in a more performant and lower cost way and more reliability than -- and more scalability than any other cloud.</p><p>Obviously, we believe it because we will, when we meet again next year, have more regions around the world than Amazon.</p><p>Okay? That's it. Who have you got? Yes?</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>WALTER H PRITCHARD, MD AND U.S. SOFTWARE ANALYST, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Walter Pritchard from Citi. Larry, I think we all agree we're in a pretty unprecedented time of change in the industry and we're seeing some of your tech peers, Microsoft, but probably a broader group as well, that are growing their operating expenses much faster than Oracle has. I think it's been about 1% per year or so over the last 5 years. I'm wondering if you feel like you spent enough there. And then the message seems like, going forward, you can keep the investment relatively flat. And why not sort of step on the gas or invest faster in the business, given the share that's up for grabs over the next, say, 5 years?</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: I think we're investing as fast as we can other than building data centers that are empty. So we manufacture our own hardware. We have a just-in-time replenishment model, so we expand our data centers based on our forecast of usage. So we're growing -- we might increase our expenses, but when we increase our expenses, it will be because the top line is growing very rapidly and profitability is growing very rapidly. So we have all -- we're building all of the regions out, and as those regions grow, based on demand, we can get hardware there in very short order.</p><p>We have -- we make this stuff ourselves. We have it in inventory. We ship it very quickly based on demand. We have a very different model than anybody else. We don't believe in shipping SUVs to dealers. We believe in the Tesla model, someone orders an SUV, build an SUV. We think -- we don't want to have an inventory problem.</p><p>Yes, sir?</p><p>TRIPATINDER S. CHOWDHRY, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH &amp; SENIOR ANALYST, GLOBAL EQUITIES RESEARCH, LLC: Trip Chowdhry from Global Equities Research. Two quick questions following up on Don's presentation. Of course, Don was the person who created AWS Amazon. I was wondering, Gen2, how long will it take for Amazon to catch up to Gen2 cloud from Oracle?</p><p>And secondly, in the presentation that Don presented, you have 2 government Gen2 data centers in Ashburn and I think your [heartbeat] is in Oregon, at least that's what the slide showed. This is a no brainer for Project JEDI to work on Gen2 cloud rather than an old generation AWS cloud. Any thoughts on that?</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: Well, okay. So how long -- I'm going to focus on the question, how long before Amazon builds an autonomous database. That's really asking how long before Amazon catches up to -- what is our Gen2 cloud? The Gen2 cloud has lots and lots of components. And what makes our Gen2 cloud generation 2 is a technology called machine learning. And specifically a manifestation of machine learning, where I use machine learning to build autonomous systems, whether they're autonomous driving systems, autonomous database. We just announced an autonomous operating system. So -- and more -- and lots more autonomous features we're building right now.</p><p>So how long before Amazon catches up to the Oracle Autonomous Database? Well, let's look at what you got to be able to do. When you've got to actually autonomously discover a security threat, their robots have to monitor for security threats. And then when a security threat is found -- and I'm presuming there's actually a fix for the threat already in place, but if not, the fix has to be built. But the moment the fix is built, it's then the entire fleet of databases are patched without any downtime, no scheduling, no having to notify customers, \"Hey, we're going to have to take you down for this period of time\". None of that. We automatically detect a threat. We immediately remediate the threat while the system is still running.</p><p>How long before they can do that with any of their data base? Now keep in mind, Amazon is saying, \"Well, we have a special database for transactions. It's called Aurora, but if you're doing queries and analytics, you use Redshift. But then if you want elasticity, you use DynamoDB.\" And they believe -- and I can keep going. They have lots and lots of databases they support at Amazon.</p><p>So while we had to make Oracle autonomous, they have to make Redshift autonomous. They got to make DynamoDB autonomous. They got to make Aurora, Redshift, DynamoDB, they have to build all the -- because they have a dozen databases. How long before -- they're not going to get 1 in the next 10 years. I don't think they can do it. This is what Don said. We think we can build what they have, and in fact, we think we can build the next generation of what they have. We think we can build what they have but do a little bit better job. We should. We know what they've done. We know what Google's done, and we think we can deliver kind of a better version of that for OpenStack stuff. But for any of these databases to patch themselves while running without downtime, for any of these databases to automatically configure themselves without any human intervention, when does Amazon catch up to that? Certainly not in the next decade.</p><p>By the way, they're not even trying. They haven't started a project to do that. They're not trying to do that. That's not something they've announced and they're working towards. By the way, we also -- and we're putting autonomous characteristics and full autonomy into as many modules as we can. We've just announced our operating system, Linux, that our version of Linux -- now there's lots of Linuxes out there and Red Hat's very, very popular. And it so happens that we have -- our version of the operating system is compatible with Red Hat, but it's not the same code. Red Hat applications run unchanged. Any Red Hat application runs unchanged on Oracle. We've had that capability for 13 years, not a single incompatibility bug has ever been filed, okay?</p><p>But our version of Linux is much faster. Our version of Linux is much more reliable, and our version of Linux can be patched while it's still running. So if there's a security flaw -- and by the way, there was a massive security flaw. They were -- the Spectre and Meltdown bugs, which were bugs in the Intel microprocessor that allowed one user of that machine to look at the data of another user, this big Spectre and Meltdown. We put in -- in a 4-hour period, we patched our entire cloud, 150 million patches in 4 hours, While everyone was still running, all of our users were completely unaware of it, completely unaware of those patches. When does Amazon get that?</p><p>Let me tell you what Amazon has got. They got a great support policy. Their support policy is if you misconfigure one of our systems because we're not autonomous, you manually configure our systems, you make this mistake and lose all your data, we don't pay, you pay.</p><p>So our systems are designed to prevent you from making big -- are autonomous, which prevent you from making configuration errors. They don't have that ability. So they have a support policy that says, if you make a configuration -- I can put it up, I think it says, you maintain complete control of your data and you can figure Amazon services. That's you. So if you make a mistake, don't blame us. That's on you.</p><p>I mean these are huge differences between us and AWS. Listen, AWS was the first mover. They have the idea, the rent -- to go ahead and rent computers. It was brilliant, and it's been enormously successful, and it's really -- they fundamentally have changed computing, but they really -- I mean they don't develop databases. They don't develop programming languages. We developed Java. We developed the Oracle Database. We developed Fusion applications. They don't do anything like that. In fact, they are a huge user of Oracle. They run their entire business on Oracle.</p><p>So I know they say they're trying to get off. Haven't heard much from them lately. They're supposed to be off by the end of the year. We'll see. SAP said they were getting off of Oracle. And a lot of people said they were getting off of Oracle. And maybe Amazon can, God bless them. It's fine.</p><p>But right now, from a technology standpoint, we are so many years ahead of them, and I'll just quote Don, because I think Don said it perfectly, \"What we have, they can't build.\" What they have, which is the ability to rent Open Source technology on hardware, we can build that, and we can do a better job of delivering that than they do.</p><p>So we expect to have a highly differentiated business from AWS because we develop a lot of software. Microsoft has a highly differentiated business from AWS. They develop a lot of software. Amazon cannot develop Office. That's an enormously valuable thing, Microsoft Office. Lots and lots of documents are stored in Microsoft Office.</p><p>Amazon can't do that. Amazon, not even in that business.</p><p>Over here.</p><p>PHILIP ALAN WINSLOW, SENIOR ANALYST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Larry, Phil Winslow, Wells Fargo. Couple of big announcements in terms of partnerships you made this year. One, just with VMware, so when you think historically, Microsoft and VMware, we don't think of it as the tightest companies with Oracle. So my question here is sort of why these partnerships and also just sort of why is now the right time to partner with VMware and Microsoft?</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: Well, Oracle has really never been a platform company, right? So we've sold database on top of a variety -- on top of Red Hat, Linux, right? So with on-premise business, we would sell our database. We'd sell our applications. That's the business we're in, but we've never historically been a platform company.</p><p>So now as we -- now with OCI, we become a platform company. And as a platform company, it's very, very important -- so they come to our cloud, or if you will, a complete solution, the whole thing. It's not about, \"Hey, we love your database and we love Java and we love your enterprise apps, but we get a lot of things from other people.\" And we recognize now we want people to be able to come to our cloud and get everything they need. Well one of the things they certainly need is Microsoft Office, and Microsoft Teams is also -- Microsoft -- e-mail from Microsoft. Microsoft has lots and lots of assets that are in broad use by companies.</p><p>So the best thing for us, what customers wanted us to do was, look, we'd like to come to your cloud, but there are a lot of things you don't have. And so why don't you and Microsoft work together, I mean between you, Oracle and Microsoft, that's the vast majority of what we use. And you throw in the Open Source stuff, which we fully support, very important, fully support in our cloud. You take all of the Open Source stuff. You make that available plus the Microsoft stuff and the Oracle applications and database and Microsoft Office and Mail and Excel analytics and all of that jazz. There's a long list of Microsoft stuff. You put that stuff together, it's great. And they say, \"Oh yes, one more thing,\" actually probably they say 2 more things. They say, \"One more thing, VMware. We got a big investment in VMware.\" So we want to be able to take -- preserve those investments, protect those investments and lift and shift their VMware configurations into our cloud and maintaining and use the same tools and the same procedures you already have in place on-premise.</p><p>The other thing they might have want -- they have an investment in is Red Hat, Linux. But that's one thing we think they shouldn't bring over to our cloud. By the way, you can. You can absolutely run Red Hat Linux in our cloud, get support from Red Hat, and all that stuff. There's no problem.</p><p>But we think we offer Oracle Linux, which is 100% Red Hat compatible for free in our cloud, and it's autonomous. It's much more secure, much safer to use than using IBM's Red Hat Linux.</p><p>So in that particular case, we thought the technology we offered -- and by the way, converting from Red Hat to Oracle Linux is you change one pointer in your system to point at our update server. You don't even have to reboot this. You do it while it's live. You don't have to reboot the system. There's no recompilation, retesting, there's virtually nothing to do. It's really easy. And you get all the benefits of Oracle Autonomous Linux. So that's one case where we thought, all right, should we fight with IBM and try to make a deal with them, and we said, no. Actually, customers would be way better off and it is trivial for them to upgrade from Red Hat to an autonomous system.</p><p>We also think from the point of view of running an operating system in our cloud where we want to prevent users from making errors, we think having an autonomous operating system that configures itself, that you can patch while it's running is so much better than what Red Hat offers. It's so much safer, so much faster, that in that case -- and the migration is instantaneous. I mean there's really -- virtually nothing to do. In that case, we expect us to -- customers to -- hope customers will simply upgrade to our version of Linux rather than sticking with Red Hat.</p><p>But again, we are full platform. We've got to be a full platform. So it's got to be able to run their business, all of it, run their IT, all of it, on our cloud. Connect up with Microsoft, connect up with VMware, have a compatible replacement for Red Hat, and we're pretty much -- run all the Open Source stuff, and we're pretty much there. Yes?</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Kash Rangan from BofA. I wanted to ask you a question on digital transformation. That's something we have not heard much out of Oracle, but a lot of software companies are chalking up their results through this big phenomenon that's pervading the customer base. So what's your...</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: I'm sorry, I missed...</p><p>KASTHURI GOPALAN RANGAN: Digital transformation.</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: Digital transformation, right. Yes. I mean it's aspirational. I think the -- we're working on a lot of advanced technology, which we think enables digital transformation. Our applications, for example, which sit on top of our Generation 2 Cloud, take advantage of our -- the Oracle digital assistant. A robot that allows you to talk to your applications and it allows the applications, by the way, to talk to you and to send you messages and all of these other things.</p><p>So we think -- I think Don is exactly right. What customers want to do. They want to move to the cloud. There's economic benefits in doing that, and there's reliability, security benefits in doing that, but basically, that's step one. So they want to move their existing workload to the cloud and then they want to modernize their business using the latest and greatest technologies and adopt. So you got to move over what you currently have and then fully exploit a Gen 2 -- our Gen 2 cloud to start their digital transformation. And we offer lots and lots of tools for doing that.</p><p>We offer analytic tools that actually will tell you what expense reports are kind of not normal or are surprising. We use machine learning. We have easy to use machine learning tools in our Gen 2 cloud. So we've tried to -- machine learning is maybe the most important new technology in the last 10 years, in fact, you probably could say maybe it's the most important things that computer have ever done. The fact that computers can now learn. And part of your digital transformation will be taking advantage of these new technologies. The new technologies -- those technologies have enabled our autonomous database. Those technologies will allow to look at -- their customers look at their data in new ways for the data to actually kind of -- people say, \"Okay, this expense report is an outlier. This particular transaction should not be allowed to go through.\"</p><p>So we think people want to shift their existing workloads and then start their digital transformation, and we think we have offered a broad toolset in our cloud. That's 2 missions. We've got to make it easy to move, what you have, into our cloud. And then once you get there, we've got to make it easier for you to evolve what you moved into a next generation of applications and technology that will digitally transform your business.</p><p>But until -- but we got to get you into the cloud. It's kind of hard if we don't move you into the cloud first. They go hand in hand. Step one, move what you have. Step two, start improving it and enhancing it. It's not, leave what you have in place and then completely start over in the cloud. That is not going to work, I don't think.</p><p>Gentleman, right next to him.</p><p>ALEKSANDR J. ZUKIN, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Larry, Alex Zukin from RBC. I wanted to ask, you mentioned we're at the tip of the iceberg for the workloads that you have today on your Oracle Database moving to the cloud. And I wanted to ask, over what time period -- and then actually even look like international growth or demand is outstripping domestic. So I wanted to ask over what time period you think the workloads have moved? What percent of share will move? And how does the market share between you, Amazon, Google, Microsoft look over the next 5 years?</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: Well it's really -- I mean it's really interesting. I mean our database business has been growing. Our middleware business has been in decline. A lot of people -- it's very interesting. I mean I almost don't like talking about this but people say, \"Well, hey, Oracle is flat, there's no growth. Oracle is flat, there's no growth.\" Actually, if you look at one number, that's the only number you look at, revenue. \"Yes, okay. I mean, we're growing slowly,\" right? However, there's incredible change in our technology businesses, in our application businesses. As I said, we're by far, the fastest growing application -- enterprise application company. Organic growth of 30% in back office, both NetSuite, that's combined NetSuite Fusion number, 30%. We didn't buy anything. Salesforce, unbelievable, they got to keep that 20% growth number, right? Or their stock price collapses. They got to buy somebody. I mean they're on a hamster wheel, and it doesn't matter what they buy, they got to buy something. We're not doing that. Our database business has never stopped growing, never stopped growing.</p><p>Our middleware business, however, which is part of our tech on-premise business along with -- a lot of our database is on-prem. Although, it's really not on-prem, it's licenses. We have this funny situation where you say, \"Well, how much is cloud? How much is on-prem?\" Well, what is in the license? You run the license in our cloud. So we let you bring your \"on-prem licenses\" that you pay on-prem support for. We let you bring that to the cloud. Our database business is growing. We're actually gaining share in database or actually gaining market share in database.</p><p>We think we got 90% of it in our cloud. How big is that? Way bigger than Amazon. I mean Amazon is going to grow, don't get me wrong. But if you suddenly said, \"Okay, I'm going to move all the application, all those Oracle databases and all the applications that are on the Oracle databases in the world instantly to our cloud tomorrow,\" we'd be way bigger than Amazon and Azure. We'd be bigger than Amazon and Azure combined, right?</p><p>So -- all -- but all that stuff is going to move. And they don't get it -- there's no autonomous database that can run on the Amazon. They're never going to have -- never have autonomous database capability. They don't get any of that. They don't get any of this new stuff. So it's not like, \"Oh, Amazon, we're going to -- we'll run Oracle for you.\" They can run an old version of Oracle without a lot of the -- without the ability to patch itself online, without the ability to configure itself. They can do some of that, they can run a primitive version of Oracle. But they really can't run modern Oracle. Where is it going to go? They can stay on-prem or they can move into our cloud.</p><p>But let me tell you another thing. Some of our biggest customers -- some of our biggest customers are going to become OCI regions. IBM says, \"I hate this term private cloud, I really don't like it because what is a private cloud? It is a computer, and I assume we rename a computer a private cloud.\" That's nonsense. We will build an OCI region identical to the OCI regions we have in Ashburn, and in Mumbai and all this. We will build an OCI region at a big bank, let's say. And that big bank -- so if they want to stay \"on-prem\" or in their data center, they can stay in their data center. We'll build a complete region for them. They can take all of their Oracle stuff, all their application and run it in our cloud. It's just that our cloud, which we will manage. And you don't have to buy the hardware, we'll ship all the hardware there, we'll configure this whole thing, we'll put that whole region into your data center.</p><p>So when we talk about having nearly 40 regions next year -- this time next year, those are public regions. We're not talking about regions we're going to end up building for our biggest customers, and we have a lot of really big customers. So that's another avenue of growth, and we think we'll be announcing some of those soon.</p><p>People deciding, okay, build a region. We're a big bank, build us a region. We can do that. Amazon can't do that, Azure can't do that. So we think we're going to get virtually all of the Oracle databases, which is most of the world's data. It sounds crazy, right, because if Oracle really holds on to its database franchise and moves it to the cloud, I'll ask you, it is the most interesting question of the day, so how big is Oracle? If we hold on to our database franchise -- think about all the applications that are built on top of Oracle databases. Remember, we were way bigger than IBM and Microsoft combined in the database business. Still are, still are. If that all moves to the cloud and we get it, how big are we?</p><p>You think we're bigger than Amazon? I'm asking you. What do you think? Yes, [$200 billion]. Easy, right? So -- but you say, \"That's ridiculous. People will just move off the Oracle Database.\" Really? No one's moved off the Oracle Database. Name somebody. Go on to Amazon's website, and I'll show you names of companies who moved off the Oracle Database, you've never heard of those companies. Bob and Sarah's Pie Shop and Towing Company. Biloxi, Mississippi. Bob deceased. Sarah is still available.</p><p>It is -- I mean it's a bizarre question. So you either have to believe that people are just going to stop using the Oracle Database or we have the biggest cloud on the planet. Because it's not -- Satya Nadella was asked a couple of years ago, if you can have any technology in the world, any technology in the world, what would you have? Well, maybe he's really stupid, but he didn't say Google Search, he said the Oracle Database. Why? Because this is the information age and we manage almost all of the world's information. Manage it. Now Google catalogs it. Google catalogs vast amounts of it, but they don't manage it. They catalog it and provide access to it and do all of that, it's a big deal. Very important. They're actually sitting in Oracle databases. So I mean that's the prize, right? If we execute well, that's the prize.</p><p>Markets certainly haven't reflected that. That's okay. I'll give you my favorite market observation. Right now, the private markets thinks we companies were worth more than Tesla, and that public markets think that Uber is worth more than Tesla. I'd love you to write -- list of all technology that Uber has and all the technology that WeWork has on that side, and let me list all the technology that Tesla has. And let's see who has a longer list.</p><p>But it's interesting. It's all very interesting. That's why we're aggressive buyers of our stock. What can I say? We're pretty optimistic, and we think we have these 2 franchises we're not going to lose and this great new technology called OCI, which we think is -- it's the newest. People can say, \"Hey, we're late.\" We'd like to think of it slightly differently, that we're the newest and greatest cloud out there. We're the most modern and most capable cloud out there. We have the advantage of watching what other people have done before us, and so we're excited about our second-generation cloud. We're excited about our growth rate in enterprise applications that will send us way past Salesforce, but it's not just that we'll pass Salesforce -- anyone know what our market share is in Cloud ERP? Just randomly talk about this. What do you think our cloud -- our market share in Cloud ERP is?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: 80%.</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: 80%, okay. No. Much too low. And I know it's asymptotic. It can't be 100%. It's not 100%, but it's probably over 98%. I think our closest Cloud ERP, enterprise ERP customer is Workday with, according to Workday, a few hundred customers. And we have, what's the right number, Steve? NetSuite, we have 32,000?</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Yes. And then...</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: No, but that's Fusion, that's not just -- maybe ERP is 25,000.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: [ERP 25,000. NetSuite is 7,000].</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: Say again?</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: 7,000 Fusion, minus, I think, it's 32,000, 25,000.</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: The total is 32,000. So Workday has a couple of hundred and we have 32,000. So it's more than 99%. That would even make Bill Gates proud back in the day. Salesforce has no product. Workday really has no product. SAP didn't move ERP to the cloud. How much is that worth?</p><p>So let's just look at these fantasies. Now you know why I wander around, I don't really work, I just wander around, and fantasize about stuff. So what is that franchise worth? What is the ERP franchise worth in the cloud if we have 99% share? Or let's say, it erodes to 88% share or 85%, what's that worth? And how big is it? Moving all the Oracle data to the cloud, what's that worth? How big is it?</p><p>If Don wasn't making stuff up, we have a general -- we regularly do benchmarks against Amazon and because we know, I mean we know they're the incumbent. So we have to be better or we're just kidding ourselves. But we continuously beat them in performance. When people look at a workload in Amazon or move a workload from Amazon to our cloud, even if it's using all the same Open Source software. It can be using a Mongo database or application written in Python, whatever. And they move that stuff over to our cloud and we cost half as much. We scale better. We're more robust. And that's without using any of our cool database stuff or any of our cool enterprise applications stuff that people just don't have at all.</p><p>So we think we have the best cloud, OCI. We think we have the best database. Oracle Autonomous Database, with best operating system, Oracle Autonomous Linux. The best enterprise application, certainly in the back office. Salesforce.com is the incumbent in the front office, especially in sales. We recognize that. But we're starting -- just beginning to start replacing them and some of their large customers. They're very expensive, so we compete -- we'll go in there and say, \"We can cut your bill by a large amount of money,\" with some of their larger customers who are -- who think that the Salesforce.com is overpriced. So that's our strategy. Those are the opportunities. We think the size of the opportunities are just monumental.</p><p>Yes, sir? And then I'll come right here next to you.</p><p>MICHAEL TURITS, MD OF EQUITY RESEARCH &amp; INFRASTRUCTURE SOFTWARE ANALYST, RAYMOND JAMES &amp; ASSOCIATES, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Michael Turits from Raymond James. So Larry, Don finished off by talking about Open Source and cloud data computing and you've talked about it quite a bit today, too. If you're going to be successful doing that in Gen 2 Cloud, does that require more investment in other databases besides Oracle Database?</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: Well, I said, we are the steward of MySQL. So we are -- we probably invest in Linux. So let me not just limit it to database, because, yes, I mean clearly, we invest in MySQL and MySQL services are very, very important to us. We invest in Java languages but not just Java, we invest in run times environments for everything, for Ruby. We have the Graal environment, which runs Java plus JavaScript and Ruby and Python and everything much faster. So we're investing in all of these standard languages. Obviously, we've invested very heavily in Linux. I mean, clearly, another important open technology, I mentioned MySQL. You'll see us constantly building more and more services around that.</p><p>So we will certainly -- our goal is to, if you want to use MySQL or Aurora, whatever you want to call it, the best version of it should be in the Oracle Cloud. You should have a better experience with using MySQL in the Oracle Cloud than in Amazon or Azure. We were even putting SQL Server directly into OCI. Current and previous versions of Microsoft's SQL Server. So we want -- so we are investing in other databases. We're investing in MySQL, we investing -- but the storage around MongoDB, so MongoDB doesn't operate on its own. I mean MongoDB accesses our storage systems. So providing very reliable, very robust, very high-performance storage systems.</p><p>We announced on Monday that our newest storage systems are not -- usually you have to pick all-flash, all-rotating storage. Our newest storage systems are a storage hierarchy made up of a combination of rotating disk, plus flash cache to that, plus DRAM cache, persistent memory cache in front of that. So we're building these storage hierarchy systems which makes Mongo much faster, which makes MySQL much faster, makes these things much faster. So yes, we think we have to deliver Open Source technology in a more easier to consume, more performant, more reliable, more economic way than our cloud competitors. I mean we have to do that. Or we're missing a huge opportunity. Another huge opportunity because people are going to be using a lot of these technologies around our applications, around the Oracle Database, around all these other things.</p><p>So yes, we're trying to hit on all cylinders, but what you say is correct. We've got to deliver Open Source, OpenStack technology better than AWS to realize the full opportunity of the cloud.</p><p>Yes, sir. One then the other. Let's do both.</p><p>JAMES DERRICK WOOD, MD &amp; SENIOR SOFTWARE ANALYST, COWEN AND COMPANY, LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Larry, Derrick Wood at Cowen. So it seems like you solved the technology side of the equation on Oracle Cloud platform, now you're quickly trying to build that data center capacity. The next phase is now getting enterprise customers to move their big apps over. So what's the strategy to push customers over? And can you give us a sense for how -- the time and effort needed to migrate from on-premise to OCI?</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: Well, the answer is I mean, our VMware partnership is very, very important to make it easier for people to lift and shift. We have an awful lot of companies that want to do the lift and shift. But again, [and block] came in --these parts of Don's presentation.</p><p>They have aspirations, but they also wanted to change as little as possible when they move because they don't want to have to retest everything. If you could really lift and shift and leave it intact, you can do a minimum of testing, but you didn't change much. So it should keep working. It shortens the time and lowers the cost of shifting things to the cloud. So the VMware was very important as far as that's concerned.</p><p>The -- so we're trying to make sure that the tooling is in place to make that easy. Also, autonomous database is now so much better than the Oracle that came before, the Oracle that they're running on-prem. There's a huge incentive for them to -- for their applications to take advantage of database autonomy. So we're seeing the autonomous database now of adoption rate beginning to spike. 500 new customers this past quarter, we'll have over 1,000 new customers in this quarter. It's now happening. Now it's happening -- they'll take an existing data warehouse or a new data warehouse project, they'll move that over, they will -- they typically start slowly. So what happens is you got a team of people involved in one project. They move the project over. They report back to IT. Was it successful? How much it costs? What were the performance gains? You have people moving stuff from Amazon to Oracle. Okay, they say, \"We're going to save half of our money.\" Did that really happen? Were they making that stuff up? How hard was it to move? What is the cloud like versus Amazon?</p><p>So all -- we're seeing all of that activity now, but it's their typically smallish projects when you're talking about the autonomous database. It's not someone said, \"Okay, I've decided to lift my entire estate and move it over.\" We have people looking at that, but now I can start naming customers that are looking at doing that. But if I can name them, it's not enough. So what we're seeing for the first time, people are saying, \"Yes, I want to lift the entire state. Okay. I'm very impressed with what I've seen. I want to take further steps and move forward. Now I want to talk to you about a better -- not your standard list prices. I want to negotiate a deal.\" All of those things.</p><p>So we've now made it easy enough to consume. We've gotten to the part where it's easy enough to consume. We have a lot of people moving over small projects. And that's going to -- and those projects have been very, very successful. And we're seeing the first expansions. And sometimes a second order expansion. There's, \"Okay, I want to come up with a plan to move this entire data center over.\" We're just beginning to see that. But again, the infrastructure businesses is relatively immature compared to our -- compared to your application business. But the infrastructure business, I think, will be much larger than our application business.</p><p>Gentlemen here.</p><p>COLIN R. DUCHARME, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR &amp; PORTFOLIO MANAGER, STERLING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC: Larry, my name is Colin Ducharme, I'm with Sterling Capital. My question is what indicates to you that integrated stack is the right strategy from here forward? Clearly, as a product company, the legacy of integrated stack served you well. But now, going forward, as a service company, and walking around OpenWorld and chatting with some of your customers, obviously, Oracle fans all, what I hear is they enjoy the empowerment of a more modular stack, whether infrastructure agnostic, et cetera. So can you do both well? I hear integration as a key advantage from both of you and Safra today. One of the hallmarks of a credible open model to me is a robust developer community. You've got one with Java. How do you engender that to the extent Microsoft or Amazon has?</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: It's extremely interesting question because people talk about building applications with Microservices, lots and lots of -- and having a huge library of different services to choose from and having lots and lots of choice and being able to configure whatever technologies they want to configure. This reminds me of the days of object-oriented programming, when I was a boy programmer and object-oriented programming, it was going to -- was the wave of the future and there was these object libraries and it was all about program reuse, that as a programmer, I was no longer going to actually write much code. I was simply going to select components from an object library and assemble them, if you will. And then I might slightly modify a few of them, it wasn't called modification, but anyway, but that was kind of the new model. And that model actually work for UI, worked for certain things. Didn't work very well for a lot of programs because you had a real hard time figuring out what each one of these programming modules did exactly. You had to learn the interfaces and the characteristics of all of these components.</p><p>If you go on the message boards and look at what people are saying about AWS, it's absolutely fascinating. It's very different than what I intuitively would guess, but I like to guess about things. I like to sit in a darkroom and figure everything out with no information, and then -- okay, I'm now going to actually look, it's like the French Academy. The French Academy argued for years about how many teeth that horse had in his lower jaw, but they were slaves to deductive reasoning and empiricism was just beneath them and then finally, someone actually kind of looked.</p><p>So actually I think a mixed mode is good. I mean it's good to have both deductive reasoning and empirical investigations. Anyway, that's a bit of a digression.</p><p>The thing that people complain about in Amazon is there's so much stuff in the cloud, they don't know what to use. I mean it is -- so to me, it was so -- I was like, wow, that's so interesting. But you get on the message boards, and you see what the developers are talking about, and it's like -- because Amazon's always -- they're adding all the stuff. And they're basically taking all open -- it's not exactly curated either. It's a library. A huge library of all of these services, but it's not as curated as, if you will, their retail shop, which will tell you, you should buy this flashlight. These are the most popular flashlights and this is Amazon Prime and all of this. There are all of these services, and it can be a bit difficult and confusing as what to assemble when you have too many -- there's such a thing as too many choices on the menu. And it's about a balance. So choice is good. Too many options without kind of a ranking of what -- people don't know what to use. The people having a hard time navigating through all the different cloud services.</p><p>So we think we need -- so we have a dual strategy. So we think we should offer a large basket of services, certainly, all of the popular ones. We think we should invest heavily in making those services the best -- making OCI the best place to acquire those services. But also to have, if you will, Amazon Prime technologies, where we really recommend you use this for this, or recommend you use that for that, and that is going to be very important. And I think for certain things where availability is important, where availability is important, the Oracle Database is really good at that. We do upgrades. You get new versions of Oracle while Oracle is still running, it doesn't go down. So if you have a highly -- if you need high availability, that's important.</p><p>So I think providing integrated suites, things that work well together that you know have -- that lots of people are using together -- well, I'll give you another example of integration. The Apple iPhone. And admittedly, I think other smartphones are getting better and are kind of catching up, but for a long time, the fact that all those pieces were kind of curated and integrated by Apple. It was a better -- a much better experience in the beginning. And the phone, an iPhone is a way simpler thing than an application in infrastructure cloud. That's a pretty simple piece of digital technology compared to a cloud.</p><p>So I think we have to walk down both roads. We have our recommended technologies. We have recommended suites of technologies. These things work well together, but we also offer the choices you'd expect in Open Source. I think we have to do both.</p><p>Yes, sir.</p><p>JEREMY SCHAAL, MD &amp; PORTFOLIO MANAGER OF U.S. AND GLOBAL EQUITIES, JARISLOWSKY, FRASER LIMITED: Jeremy Schaal from Jarislowsky, Fraser. I'm going to ask a nonproduct question, if that's okay. So to me, the departures of Thomas Kurian and the absence of Mark. put into sharper focus succession planning. So I'm curious from a governance perspective, what sort of steps are being put in place to make ensure continued success over the next 10 to 20 years?</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: Well, I mean a lot of people have said, \"God, you guys are weird, 2 CEOs, that's ridiculous, that's bad governance.\" And then so -- and I think we have a very deep team. I believe in the dual CEO, that the normal case, the normal case would be dual CEO here for obvious reasons that it's good to have capacity. And good to have specialization. So -- and then God forbid something untoward should happen, you have capacity. You're not incapacitated. We're very lucky, Safra has been here for a long time. It has been a very familiar with the Oracle Corporation. It's not like we have to rush out and hire somebody to be CEO. We have a very deep team of experienced people around the world. One of the things I promised our Board of Directors is we're going to give them a list of 5 people inside the company, all of whom we think can be CEO, kind of this next-gen CEO.</p><p>And so we're constantly making sure that our management team -- that there are people on the management team -- by the way, not everyone who is doing a spectacular job necessarily even wants to be CEO. Let me tell you, I'm really happy about not being CEO. I love my -- I much prefer my job I have now than when I was -- I like it better than being a CEO. But we should have people in the company that are capable of being promoted into that position. So when there is a succession, it's not rushing out and doing a search. It's knowing we have these assets that are familiar with the company, familiar with the personalities, I mean, this is a complicated company. We have a lot of technologies. We have a large selling organization. We have a large service organization. We have a lot of underlying technologies. So it is a -- we make our own hardware. I mean it is a complicated company. We used to make our own semiconductors, and we very may well again. So we think that's very important -- we think that's a very important.</p><p>Tesla makes their own batteries, we probably should make our own semiconductors. Not that I want to constantly refer to Elon Musk, but it is -- it's reasonable. It's reasonable. It's not necessary for us to make our own semiconductors. But if we can get an advantage that way, then we should do it.</p><p>So we're in a lot of different technologies. We have promised the Board. I have promised the Board that we will have 5 people and we're starting to run people by the Board that are -- have the potential to be CEO next round. I don't think Safra is going to any place. At least, she hasn't indicated to me that she's going to any place. We're pretty happy with her. So we think we're in pretty good shape.</p><p>We've got -- again, I think we've got quality and quantity on our management team. The current layer of people who are really running the company, I guess today you've seen Steve Miranda, you've seen Don Johnson. These people are all slightly younger than I am. So I think, hopefully, they're going to be around a long time. We certainly want them to be around a long time. So we can grow because they can grow.</p><p>So I'm very comfortable, actually, with the decisions we took in the past in terms of how we ran the company and how it's enabled us to deal with Mark's absence, God willing, he comes back. All is well, he recovers and he comes back. But in his absence, we have the capacity to continue to run the company and continue to make progress in our markets.</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: Maybe with that, we'll relieve you of all this. Are you good with that? Unless...</p><p>LAWRENCE J. ELLISON: I'm good. No, no, no. I'm good. Thank you all very much.</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: Over now. Thank you.</p><p>So listen, we talked about my coming up and taking more questions, but we've run very late. I'm perfectly willing to take questions, more questions, if you want, though I have a feeling none of you were saving any questions for me. You got them all on Larry.</p><p>Do you have more questions? You have -- okay? We'll take it. All of you don't have to stay. We've gone right through your break, by the way. I know that.</p><p>So there's a question. This might be the last one. I'll take Larry's seat.</p><p>ALEKSANDR J. ZUKIN: In a way between us and the break.</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: No, break -- we missed the break, that's so far gone, guys. That was 1.5 hours ago.</p><p>ALEKSANDR J. ZUKIN: Alex Zukin from RBC. I just wanted to ask a quick question about something from the earnings call which was the macro. I think a lot were expecting you guys to talk about the macro as an impediment, maybe not, as other companies have. What are you seeing internationally that's different from a lot of the other big tech companies? And what's making you more resilient?</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: We have been -- there was this question about if we spent more, would we grow faster and all of that. And we have been working really hard in making sure all our services are ready to go. And interestingly, we've now launched our free offering, just a free offering. It's really to -- it's a taster. And if you like it, then you start buying stuff. And we always -- we don't offer stuff free until it's really fantastic. And so what's happened is for us, we are now on the field. I mean you saw Reliance Jio. I mean for those of you who follow the telecommunications wars in India, the just massive volumes of what's going on over there. It is quite interesting what the uptake is for our service. There was a massive pent-up demand. Many of our customers are only now getting to the point to understand that we've got offerings, this autonomous database, we've got references.</p><p>So is it -- if there's a giant global slowdown, is it going to hit us in one way? I don't know. I mean we have so much potential to -- for customers waiting to spend less and get rid of their data centers and -- hard to say. We're not seeing it right now. So -- but listen, I mean I remember the Internet bubble implosion, we go into that or the 2008 financial crisis, people stopped doing anything whatsoever. We're not seeing anything like that. We're not even -- I mean, even like our U.K. team, you would think we would be having Brexit problems. My U.K. team hit their numbers. So when I get a question like that on the macro and I'm not seeing a U.K. problem, then I got to say, \"Okay, some things,\" -- because you'd expect something, right? So again, like to have a situation where we have not officially opened, launched the India data center because I know we didn't launch it because I just did the video for the launch at the end of last week, and we had to dropship kit to build it out even bigger.</p><p>I don't know what to tell you. For us, I will say one thing, China has never been a big market for us, okay? It has never been a big market. We are an extremely security-focused, national security enterprise. China, not a big market for us for a number of reasons, I won't go through them here, but it's not a big market for us. As a result, if China is -- it just has much less effect on us. We don't have a data center in China. We've not partnered to launch a data center in China. We do not have a Chinese partner, okay? So those kind of things, maybe that's what's part of it, too.</p><p>Okay. More questions. We've started the trend, okay. We should order in dinner soon.</p><p>KEN BOND: This will be our last question, everybody. Last question.</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: No, no, two, there's one and another. I'm going to regret this, I can feel it. I feel like -- go ahead.</p><p>JAMES DERRICK WOOD: Derrick Wood at Cowen. Now that your application portfolio's on OCI, it's got embedded ML and embedded analytics, are you thinking any different about pricing or premium SKUs or any different way to monetize it?</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: No. So let me tell you what we want to do. We actually want to continue to simplify our product line, okay? We want everyone to go there. We want to clean up because as you -- sometimes folks show market share of the existing base right now. Between us and SAP, I'm not even sure that's half. So there's a whole bunch of other stuff, companies, that some of you were in high school when they were big, okay? But customers are still running them. We're going to clean up all of that, and we want to make that compelling, easy, easy, easy. We want to get the E-Business Suite over and then when these customers get sufficiently (expletive) off at what SAP is doing and realize that they did not write a new product for the cloud, that hosting is not at all the same, that you're not going to get new features every 90 days the way you do in a real cloud product, and all that, we're going to get those guys, too.</p><p>So we're not trying to premium price. What we're trying to do is get entire enterprises. We're trying to simplify the product line. Let our customers have a lot of flexibility, the same kind of flexibility they have with E-Business Suite. You bought financials. You didn't buy 100 users of GL and 100 or 200 users of AP and 300 users of AR. That's the kind of simplification. We want to make it easy. And there's so much market share out there that's sitting, we're just going to pick it all up.</p><p>JAMES DERRICK WOOD: And does that include moving -- offering quarterly invoicing? Because we've heard that may be happening a little bit more and how would that impact your cash conversion?</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: Usually, we don't invoice quarterly for ERP-type stuff. Most customers make a commitment in advance. In fact, we usually have 3-year agreements. We'd actually like to go down to 1-year agreements. Gives us a lot more flexibility. Of course, our customers would like to lock in their prices for the next 3 years and things like that. And we can work all that kind of stuff out. Folks who want to -- I mean the actual trend is they'd like to know what it's going to cost them the next couple of years, but we're fine with that. We don't get a lot of demand.</p><p>Now we do have pay as you go where -- and that's for the technology part of it. If you don't want to make a commitment at all and you want to just pay, you use it, you pay for it. We're good with that, too. You don't get much of a discount that way. But pay as you go, we love that. We are totally into, we'll bill you, and -- because discounts, much lower there.</p><p>Most big enterprises, they don't like that so much. They like their discounts, and they're perfect -- and they know how much they got, they want to -- they like to buy in bulk.</p><p>What else we got? Are we clear? Is everyone down? I see no hands. One last hand. Because I did promise you, I would not leave until you got all your questions answered.</p><p>JAMES DERRICK WOOD: I'll pay for Chinese if you want to...</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: That's all right. Good, good. No issue for me.</p><p>KEITH WEISS, EQUITY ANALYST, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: Thank you for sticking around, Safra. Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Larry Ellison, he mentioned that Oracle hasn't been making the big acquisitions, he was noting Salesforce.com has done a couple more recently. But you guys used to do the big acquisitions. And in fact, you did them really well. You executed really sharply against those acquisitions. Why not? Like why aren't we doing acquisitions?</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: Well, we're buying little things...</p><p>KEITH WEISS: Well, why aren't you making the big ones?</p><p>SAFRA ADA CATZ: Because what's there to buy? We wanted to build it. It's much better to have a product that I don't have to buy and rebuild. I mean every single one of those cloud acquisitions had to be completely rewritten to clean up the stack to be at our level. Every product we've ever bought has ultimately had to be rewritten. Even things in the old days, on the on-premise, you guys probably don't realize, when we bought BEA and WebLogic, we took it off the market for a little while because parts of it had to be rewritten to our security standards. Imagine what we have to do with all these cloud properties.</p><p>So the entire Fusion suite is completely consistent. It is written to our security level. It is written entirely in our tech stack. It is built, both to fit together horizontally and vertically. Every time we buy one of these things, as easy as it is to add the revenue numbers for a year or so, do you know the amount of work the technical people have to do to get it to the level of expectation of our customers? It's massive. And then we also have -- now I'm not saying we won't buy something else. Well, I'm sure we will, but we don't need to buy. Larry said about this hamster wheel, you got it because they got to keep growing, so now they're adding this and then they'll add that. Just to make the numbers add.</p><p>Our ERP business is growing 30-something percent. We'll take it. We think that as that number gets bigger, it's going to have a positive impact, plus simultaneously -- I can tell this thing is a problem -- the -- simultaneously Autonomous Database, Gen 2 Cloud is just starting to roll. It's small, it's getting bigger, you can see it's getting bigger, especially Gen 2 Cloud on its own. Autonomous Database, growing at 3 digit -- 3 digits across on a small base. That's going to kick in. We're not going to need an acquisition to get to our growth numbers. We're a pretty big company already. Once the things that we've been defocusing get small enough and the things that are growing are big enough, everything else is going to take care of itself.</p><p>So we don't need an acquisition. We've got 100 modules in the cloud, in applications. Nobody is even close to us. So anyway, that's why. But if we saw something and it went incredibly on sale and my team thought they had absolutely nothing else to do in development, we would totally sign up for that. And I actually -- I love M&amp;A. I teach an M&amp;A class at Stanford. In fact, class starts next Friday. Okay. You're so welcome.</p><p>I'm getting the hook. That's it. We are done. Thank you for being with us. We had a great time. I hope you did, too. Thank you, everyone. We appreciate it.</p><p>KEN BOND: Thank you, everybody. That's a wrap. Thank you very much for coming this year. We'll see you next year. Safe travels home. Take care, everybody.

Where's Maynard? Where's Maynard? Well, Rick's doing it. All right. Great, yes.</p><p>Welcome. So happy to have you here today. Just out of curiosity, how many of you went to the appreciation event last night? Anybody? Good, good, good show of hands.</p><p>It was a great show, apparently. My wife loved it so much, she felt compelled to come in and tell me at 1 in the morning. And she brought her sister in to see it, as well. They stayed till 2. And that's when I went through the whole routine: I love you, but leave. So thank you all very much for being here.</p><p>So let's do some housekeeping real quick. (Conference Instructions) One thing we always ask is as you are moving in and out, be careful not to trip and kill yourselves. We're not really looking for any of that.</p><p>And so here comes always my favorite, favorite, favorite part of the day. I get to read this line by line, so bear with me. I'm going to do this once as we go through the remainder of the day. Not everybody else will; they will make reference back to what Ken said earlier. This is what they're going to be talking about. So with that, let me read that for you.</p><p>As reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might considered forward-looking. And while these forward-looking statements represent our current judgment on what the future holds, these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today.</p><p>Throughout today's discussion, we will attempt to present some important factors relating to our business which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. And as a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, as they reflect our opinions only as of today.</p><p>As a reminder, we are not obligating ourselves to revise or publicly release the results of any revision of these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future results. And, of course, we always encourage you to review our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect the future price of -- our results or the market price of our stock.</p><p>You will also see this slide. This is basically a slide just to let you know that the conversation that we are having today -- for informational purposes.</p><p>And then lastly, whether it be Safra, myself, or Mark, we may be making use of non-GAAP information in the presentation. And you can always find those reconciliations on our website from GAAP to non-GAAP. So I thank you for your indulgence on that part of it.</p><p>And as a reminder, as the speakers are coming through, you will see them making reference back to what Ken said. This is the part they are actually talking about.</p><p>So with that, let's go ahead and get into what is the agenda for today. Welcome! And what we are going to do is basically start. First, Mark is going to come up here, and he's going to talk about Oracle Cloud: what we're doing, why we are winning, how we're differentiated, and how we see the cloud playing out for Oracle -- as well as the traditional on-premise part of the business.</p><p>Bob Weiler will then take the stage. Bob will talk about our vertical businesses, including the recent MICROS transaction and some of the exciting opportunities that we see in the vertical markets as well as our strategy.</p><p>That's going to take us to a break. That should be somewhere around 1:15 in the afternoon. And then we will come back from break. As we get in the break, we will get into some -- definitely some technical content.</p><p>Thomas Kurian will take the stage. He will spend some time focusing on Oracle 12c, middleware, Big Data analytics. And that will include a panel discussion. And Thomas will then continue with a deeper discussion as he starts the cloud conversation. He will focus on infrastructure, platform, as well as ERP/SaaS, also including a customer panel discussion.</p><p>Steve Miranda will then come up. He will continue the cloud conversation, first focusing on HCM Cloud. And he will do a customer panel. And then Steve will then finish up his part of the day with a segment on the customer experience, CX, or some of you even call it CRM. And he will also finish with a customer panel.</p><p>So there will be four customer panels today. Clearly, the voice of the customer is here. For any of you that were attending OpenWorld, you should have heard the voice of the customer throughout the event. Best thing that we can do is have you hear what our customers say about Oracle and the successes that they are having.</p><p>So for those of you that have attended meetings in the past, you will know this is not your normal analyst day, and that we absolutely bring you through a lot of the technology. We bring you through this technology because it turns out this matters. Marketing pitches are all wonderful; what is underneath the hood turns out to be a very important thing.</p><p>We want you to understand why we're differentiated. Mark will talk about that. Thomas will talk about that. Steve will talk about that. All of them will be talking about why we are differentiated from a technology standpoint and why that actually matters. So look for that.</p><p>Let's see. We will go to a break. We'll get to that one somewhere around 3:45. And then following that, I'll come back up. I'll spend a few minutes with you, talking about some of the financial highlights, some things we want you to take away in terms of -- you know, there's a big business model; there's a lot of technology; but how do we distill the business model down to a few takeaways for you to walk away with and think about?</p><p>After that we will then finish out the day. Safra will come up. She will do a Q&amp;A, and then we will have Larry come up and take a Q&amp;A as well. The day should wrap up somewhere around 5:30.</p><p>And with that, I am going to turn it over to CEO, Mark Hurd.</p><p>EDITOR: At time of publication, no audio was available for Mark Hurd's section.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Oracle Executive Vice President, Bob Weiler.</p><p>BOB WEILER, EVP, GLOBAL BUSINESS UNITS, ORACLE CORPORATION: Good morning. Thank you for joining us at Oracle World. That video -- debate whether to show it or not, but it has a lot of facts there and a lot of stats. And the theme of it is: Did You Know?</p><p>And the reason we go to Did You Know is that we believe it's one of the better-kept secrets in all of Oracle. We have a strategy that is built on a number of pillars -- and I'm sure you've heard Mark and Safra speak of this strategy often -- which is, first, be the best of breed in every category of which we have a product, so that product can stand alone, be competitive, and provide a great solution to our customers.</p><p>The second is to provide an open integration of those products, all the way from the top of the industry applications all the way through to storage, so we can provide a complete, integrated solution. The third, which probably takes the most dominance in our current environment -- and you heard Mark address it -- cloud, cloud, and cloud.</p><p>And then the fourth pillar is our industry, our industry solutions. Our industry solutions are really kind of a secret, because it is a difference in -- Oracle has always been built on building the backbone technology, architecture that focused on the operations of the business from the back-office up through the horizontal applications. But in the last years we have focused on actually building applications and acquiring applications that run the business, that are mission-critical.</p><p>You've seen Safe Harbor. You've seen Mark address all of that earlier, and Ken. So we'll skip those.</p><p>Let's go to the global business units and what we call the ISGs. Oracle does business in 22 different verticals. And we go to market on a process in two ways.</p><p>First, global business units -- and I will speak to that at depth in a moment. The second is through our ISG, or our industry solution group. The global business units contain 17 distinct verticals. Our ISG group has an additional 17 verticals that we use to make our technology products and our application products function within a vertical: everything from a data model in a database; all the way up to features and functions in a horizontal application; all the way to configurations for products between our industry groups, horizontal applications, and the data, all the way optimized to our hardware platform. And that represents 22 different verticals of which we conduct business.</p><p>The global business units that we're going to focus on today is an organization structure within Oracle that is rather unique to our type of companies in that it is a separate unit. Within Oracle all of the horizontal applications, right down through the hardware. The development is managed by Thomas Kurian, hardware by John Fowler. And then all of the sales of those products are done throughout a region in the normal regional marketplace.</p><p>Our global business units, which are industry-specific applications, is a group of dedicated 22,000 employees that report into one of seven verticals through a Senior Vice President and General Manager of that vertical. So it's almost like a company within a company. And that manager has responsibility of not only global sales, their own sales force; not only their own support, consulting, services group, product marketing; but also development.</p><p>And we take that organizational model together and collaborate with the rest of Oracle to sell complete, combined solutions. So why do we do that? Why is that model -- why do we believe it's so effective?</p><p>Well, the reason is if you look at where we have acquired this business, it has been over about 30 acquisitions since about 2005-2006. And it's very interesting that companies that look to the products that run the business -- core banking, clinical trials, diameter signal routing for the network -- that those products have traditionally come from smaller companies rather than the cross-horizontal big platform companies.</p><p>And the reason that is -- these companies were formed generally with tremendous deep domain expertise, with a passion of the product, have built themselves up into, usually, a leadership position. But at a certain point these companies run out of steam, usually in two areas.</p><p>The first: they are growing, but they don't have the ability to add enough research and development to continue their growth or expand the footprint and become part of an integrated solution. And the second is they generally don't have the ability to invest in global distribution and global support.</p><p>And that's where Oracle can step in -- where we can provide a structure for those products and those companies to fit a footprint that we will invest in R&amp;D, and where we will invest in distribution, support, and services. And we look at those companies and build out a footprint so that we can start filling out all the needs of those mission-critical companies.</p><p>Mark mentioned earlier that Oracle spends a little over $5 billion in R&amp;D. In this chart here you see that we spend about $650 million in R&amp;D. But that is a very, very powerful $650 million. And the reason it's powerful is that that $650 million of R&amp;D is focused on innovation of the product functionality or the solution required by our customers, because we get the benefit of the $5 billion R&amp;D. So when our teams develop a product and they are working on a new release, they get the benefit, for instance, of moving that to 12c. Now they get multi-tenancy; they get security; they get all the capabilities of in-memory database from our Oracle R&amp;D group.</p><p>If we need to look at security for our products, think about what better place to have a development organization to provide security to our products, which is probably one of the most important things we can do now for any application, never mind a mission-critical application. So instead of our development group trying to figure how to do security, we just reach over into the greater Oracle and pull Oracle Identity Management, the view of our entire Company around the structural areas. So that $650 million is focused on individual product, individual product innovation, not just trying to keep up with infrastructure. So it's very, very powerful.</p><p>If we look at the unit portfolio, there are many different products that we have in each category as we fill it out. And I'm going to talk about a few of them.</p><p>So when we talk about retail, we talk about merchandise management, commerce, store supply chain management, and retail analytics. We've always had a retail -- very, very strong retail business. And I will talk in a moment about how that gets us to hospitality.</p><p>In banking we have 500 banks throughout the world using our core banking product. Now, in addition to having the core banking products, we were able to add other products in our -- using analytics, anti-money-laundering. All of the things that banks are focused on, we can now build onto that core customer database -- database of customers.</p><p>If we also look now at communications, communications is probably one of the fastest-moving, most dynamic areas in all of computing right now. We had an application group that did customer care, and billing, and normal capabilities. But then a little over a year ago, we acquired two companies in Acme Packet and Tekelec that brought us over on the networking side. Why was that important?</p><p>I can actually make a statement here that I think communications is going to turn into another new and horizontal product, not just a vertical. And that's because of all the technology changes we're seeing. Everyone who has an iPhone 6, as an example -- iPhone 6 has Voice over IP. The gateway for Voice over IP is a service that we already have in market so that the carriers now can start doing Voice over IP.</p><p>When we look at Amazon's product, their Mayday button -- that is using our WebRTC product that we released a while ago that is a combination of our applications business, our Acme Packet business, and our Tekelec business put together in a product. We are now seeing the hyper-interconnected company, where you're going to have applications with embedded video and automatic chat. All of that comes out of a lot of our products.</p><p>If we look at the four or five of the -- four of the five large LTE providers in the United States, they all use our diameter routing product. If you look at almost every -- actually, every cable -- major cable; I'll qualify it -- major cable company in the United States, they use our policy management system. And the reason this is important is, as you heard, maybe Mark's last comments walking off the stage was about we didn't even get into all of our mobility that we are doing in our cross-applications throughout all of Oracle.</p><p>So not only do we just have front-end mobile capabilities; we have back-end mobile capabilities. So we have the best expertise, the most expertise and understanding of what's going on in this space. So when I want to hook up my healthcare products with a product that lets our life science companies integrate to the pharmacist, who's going to talk to the doctor over video, that can come all from our applications -- but not just as a layer, but from the core. So we actually participate in every component of delivering those type applications across the marketplace.</p><p>And when we talk about clinical management, every one of these industries are going through a major transformation -- transformation unlike, frankly, I've ever seen in the industry, and I've been around a long time. And the reason they are going through transformation is that for the first time, more technology is being bought the consumer than by the corporations.</p><p>And because this technology is getting in the consumers' hands, for the first time the corporations are not able to dictate their go-to-market model. The go-to-market model is being dictated by the consumer. And they have to transform, or they will not succeed. They have to transform or they don't succeed.</p><p>And they have to transform in a way that changes their business model. And they need applications, and experience, and domain expertise to lead them there. And that's what we're trying to provide.</p><p>In addition, technology not at the consumer level is also affecting it in the area of life sciences. In the area of life sciences and clinical trials, the way trials have been done forever has been as a group of cohorts in a controlled study going through a Phase 1 through a Phase 4, and this process would take anywhere between one and seven years to get a drug to market.</p><p>But now, because of data, being able to process the data, genomics, proteomics -- we had a customer I met with Tuesday who got a drug for 30 indications approved in 18 months -- 18 months through the whole cycle. And why were they able to do that? They were able to use biomarkers, genomic data, analytic data; be able to do it fast and bring that all the way through from the health science side merged over to the life science side; and combining that, which is dramatically reducing the costs, increasing the safety and the speed at which life science companies are bringing it to market. And they are using our technologies and our core products to do that -- a major transformation in the life science industry.</p><p>And then when we look at hospitality, we see that we just acquired MICROS and the change that's taking place there as well.</p><p>One point I'd like to make on that last slide is that the difference is that when we call on a company with these type of products, we are not calling on the IT manager. We are not calling on the vice president of human resources. We are not calling on the vice president of customer relation management. We are generally talking to the CEO, the COO, the CIO, because these products are the ones that -- they're transforming their business. It's very difficult to ask a CEO of a very large bank -- you ask them what database they have. And they say, oh, probably Oracle; maybe a little DB2; maybe a little bit of this. They are not really sure.</p><p>You ask them what software is running their bank; or you ask the guy who owns a restaurant what's running his restaurant; you ask a CEO of a hotel who he's using for property management -- they know. And we call on them to help them shape their business with technology.</p><p>Because of that and what we've built up in a position, we are number one in every category of the industries that we participate. And these are not static, on-premise businesses that we have acquired. Many of them have come to us already SaaS or have SaaS. We have 55 cloud offerings in our industry business. And in 2014 we had 74 new major product releases of our industry products, and most of those have some bearing on bringing them to the cloud.</p><p>I talked earlier about distribution, increasing distribution we get these companies. We've increased distribution by almost 70% since 2010. Generally, that's globally. Usually, we start entering markets that the previous companies haven't been able to drive into.</p><p>And then as far as numbers go, the only number that Safra will let me talk about -- and I'd really like to, but I cannot -- is that our new software licenses are growing. And I put in a nice superlative there: greater than, better than, quite a bit more than -- you pick your own -- than normal Oracle licenses. But I'd love to be able to tell you, because we are extremely excited about the growth and, once again, the materiality that we are bringing to Oracle in this space.</p><p>Now, I just talked about all those numbers. Everything I talked about -- the 22,000 employees, the distribution, the growth that we have are for the industry product licenses in SaaS only, not the products that we bring along with us when we sell a solution. So when we sell a solution for an industry-specific product, we generally bring anywhere between one and four, so roughly about 3X value of other Oracle products with us.</p><p>So as an example, we have a large customer who is using our healthcare data model. They bought our Healthcare Data Model, but our Healthcare Data Model ran on top of Oracle analytics. It ran on top of our database. And then when we optimized that data model -- we optimize the data model for the analytics; we optimize analytics for the database. And because of this R&amp;D methodology I told you about before, the database is already optimized for Exadata, an in-memory database. We sold the entire platform to this company.</p><p>This company -- entire platform never had a piece of Oracle hardware in it. It never had an Oracle database in it. It used our competitor's analytics. That company two years ago had never had an Oracle product.</p><p>That company now is revamping their entire data center platform to Oracle products. That's going to show up in all my peers' numbers, but it started with the ability of having a solution. And that story I just mentioned is happening over, and over, and over again. And this allows us to cross-sell/upsell. And as I mentioned just a moment earlier, once we build the trust with that senior C level, we get the benefits of that through the rest of Oracle and drive a lot of other Oracle products, which we are very excited about.</p><p>So let's talk the last five minutes here or so on the MICROS acquisition. So we have these seven verticals. Our goal is to continue and build out more multiple verticals in this same model, so that we can accrue all the same benefits that we just mentioned. We want to build out more.</p><p>And we want to build out more that also has adjacency. So we had a retail vertical -- we still have a retail vertical -- that does general merchandising: merchandising supply chain, planning, analytics, retail science are our products that we sell in that group.</p><p>But we knew that that kind of blurs over into the hospitality space, of which there was really one clear leader. And that was MICROS. And MICROS was broken up into essentially three business areas -- retail; hotel, and under hotel is cruise, casinos; and then under food and beverage was restaurants, stadiums, and concessions. So those businesses have a natural affinity to what we were doing.</p><p>And if you look at MICROS, it's a great company. Growing nicely, nice profits. But why were we attracted to it? Because we believe that those industries are going through the great, great transformation. And the transformation is going from premise to cloud to mobile, all the things that are Oracle's strengths. And all of those things that I mentioned about companies before were obstacles that were facing MICROS -- distribution, growth, investment in R&amp;D.</p><p>And when we acquire a company, we have, as you know, a very, very powerful, positive, well-proven acquisition model. And we focus on investing in R&amp;D, we focus on distribution, and we focus on support and service. And we invest in those areas, allowing these companies to grow when they come into the overall footprint.</p><p>The really exciting thing about MICROS is that we think that that industry is moving to the cloud and mobile probably faster than anyplace else. If you think about the environment that they are in -- if you go into a restaurant, and you walk into the back area, you see a fryolator; you see an oven; you see a coffee machine. And down below you see a server. A server. And that server is running that restaurant. And that's like having a generator in your business.</p><p>How great an opportunity to bring that to the cloud -- because they don't have an IT staff. They don't have somebody that knows how to even reboot it. Maybe somebody; maybe he went home in the morning. How better place to have that model move to the cloud? And MICROS has already started doing that with a product called Simphony 2. Brand new, great UI that runs in the cloud.</p><p>And therefore, think about even the cost -- the cost of maintaining, and supporting, and servicing in that environment, versus for a restaurateur to just have a nice cloud solution that we can provide. That is going to move -- restaurants are going to move to the cloud, and we are well equipped and positioned to be able to do that.</p><p>If we look at the customer experience of running a hospitality customer, what you are seeing on these charts is -- where it's red are products that Oracle already has, and the gray are the products that MICROS has. So you can see how we can mesh the two together.</p><p>So we can take advantage now of things like, for attracting customers -- I'm sure as the Steve Miranda comes up and speaks this afternoon, he's going to talk about the CX products that we have; the marketing products we have -- Eloqua, Responsys, and BlueKai, and all those capabilities that we now can bring into a solution for the hospitality to help that hospitality market work around things like attracting. Everything from the Google search, to booking, through the customer experience, all the way through the survey after they leave.</p><p>And then knowing all the attributes to attract that customer back to the same environment. That is so much of what's going on in that business right now, and we are able to complement our products to be able to do that.</p><p>In service, given the customer experience, the property management -- so when you show up at a hotel, they know your preferences. They know what you like for a room. They know what you buy. They know what you spend your money on. And we are able to drive that to improve the profitability of the hospitalities group.</p><p>And then we move to the horizontal apps. Oracle already has a great presence in the hotel industry with our Siebel and CRM products. We are now able to go back in and cross-sell more of the cloud supply chain management capabilities that we had, along with inventory and property management; and then, finally, we go to the back office a little more, where we bring our human resource products. And we complement that with fraud; loss prevention; and, once again, property management as well.</p><p>So let's talk about is MICROS an old kind of company, been around a long time? And are they adapting to the needs of the marketplace? So Levi's Stadium down in Santa Clara for the San Francisco 49ers -- the most advanced technology stadium that's essentially in the market right now. And by the way, we already have 18 of the 32 NFL stadiums, as well, as customers of ours.</p><p>So what did they do in this technology area? Well, they have Wi-Fi routers, I think, something like every 250 to 300 seats, something in that area. But more importantly, when you come in as a customer of 49, you download their app. And your app -- from your ticket, a map to your seat -- all of those capabilities are on your application to create your customer experience.</p><p>But what is really great is that when you get to your seat, and it's your BYOD device -- iPhone, Android -- you can then go to concessions. You hit a concession on your BYOD device. The system then takes it; it routes it by workload to the appropriate concession nearest to your location -- so if you say, I want two beers, two hot dogs, and French fries -- it locates the closest concessions area that can fulfill that order quickly; gives you an option to say, do you want to go to the express line that's closest to your area, or do you want it delivered to your seat?</p><p>And you want it delivered to your seat. And then, if you do that, when do you want it? Do you want it right now? Do you want it a little bit later? Do you want it in between the third and fourth quarters? And it will do all that for you. If you want to buy along a T-shirt or a 49ers shirt, you can add that to it. And that's your buying experience.</p><p>From a technology standpoint, yes, it's pretty impressive that you can do it on a BYOD device. But I think what is even more impressive is that we processed $2.1 million worth of receipts in the first game. We processed just nearly 6,000 transactions every 15 minutes, and we did it over the cloud to our data center in Virginia. Mobility, cloud, back-end enterprise, analytics -- tremendous solution for our customers.</p><p>So our industries are trying and working on building out footprints to combine with an Oracle stack an industry solution. That industry solution is going to meet the mission-critical needs of our customers. And we're going to continue to expand that and expand our footprint in our industry solution.</p><p>So I hope you learned a little bit about the fact that we do know a lot about Oracle database. You know a lot about our Sun. You know now an awful lot about cloud and mobile. And now I think there is something you need to think about as we are the leader in industry solutions to the entire market. So thank you very much.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Oracle Senior Vice President, Juan Loaiza.</p><p>JUAN LOAIZA, SVP, SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY, ORACLE CORPORATION: Okay, so I'm Juan Loaiza. I've spoken the last couple of years here, and today I'm talking about Engineered Systems. Now, one thing you should know about me is I'm a software guy. So I've been working on database software at Oracle now for 26 years, but I'm here talking about Engineered Systems. Why? Because it's kind of the software that matters.</p><p>So I'm going to lead you through some of the things that we've been working on, some of the things we've just released and a little peek into something Larry talked about on Sunday, which is a really -- really the next big thing in this area.</p><p>Okay. I'll let you speed read this. One more. Okay. All right. So we have introduced quite a number of Engineered Systems. We started six years ago. Almost exactly six years ago, we released our first engineered system, which was our database machine, Exadata Database Machine. We've added Engineered Systems for most of our major products in Oracle including Middleware, applications; and we are introducing a number of new ones now, so I'm going to cover a little bit of this in my talk.</p><p>I'm going to start with Exadata because that's our kind of first engineered system that we use for our Database platform, which is of course a very successful platform. This was introduced in 2006. We've achieved our goals with this. We wanted it to be adopted widely in the industry for both OLTP warehousing mixed workloads, financial analytics, everything. That was our goal. That's what we set out to be.</p><p>A lot of people said no, you need specialized systems for every little workload. You have to have a separate analytics system, separate OLTP system, separate this system, separate that system. We said no, we can do it all with one system. And in fact it's better because we can combine it all together.</p><p>And that's what we've done. We are running now everything from petabyte warehouses, big business applications, SAP, E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft, Siebel, financial trading, e-commerce site, software as a service. We run all of our Fusion applications on our Exadata systems, so we have hundreds of Exadata systems in our cloud that run our SaaS business applications. We have many big other applications like SASSA -- Salesforce, one of our biggest customers for Exadata. So it's been very successful. We have really fulfilled our initial goals for this product. We've done everything we set out to do.</p><p>And so originally we set out to be data warehousing OLTP. Our focus these days are on our major database focus -- two of our most important database focuses are database as a service and Database In-Memory. So those are two things we have worked on a lot in the Database group. We've introduced a number of software solutions. So we have our Multitenant database that we introduced last year in June.</p><p>We've also, in July, just introduced our Database In-Memory. That was also done in my team. Our Database In-Memory product, which has really two big goals. One is the superfast in-memory processing, and the other part of it was to be dead simple to adopt. So when we talk about Database In-Memory, one thing to keep in mind is that second goal is just as important as the first goal.</p><p>So when we set out to design this product, we said it has to be 100% compatible with everything we already have. So by 100%, I don't mean 51% rounded up to 100% or 90% rounded up to 100 but 100.0000% compatible with everything we have because we want to make this dead simple for our customers to adopt.</p><p>So you can run -- today we are running E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft, Siebel, extremely complex applications all on this -- we have third-party like SaaS, MicroStrategy, they all adopted it with no changes to their applications. We are running current versions of applications, not future re-architected, rewritten versions, but the current version. That's extremely important.</p><p>So we are also focusing on these areas on our Engineered Systems side. Also it's two of our biggest pushes in Engineered Systems is in database as a service and Database In-Memory, and I'll talk a little bit about that.</p><p>So, I'm not going to go through a lot of technical details. But, again, the key thing about our Engineered Systems is the combination of software and hardware. So we have very advanced hardware. But what really distinguishes our Engineered Systems is the special software and the integration that's in there. And we integrate from the top down, so we start at the database and integrate down in ways that aren't possible unless we own the whole stack.</p><p>And there's a few examples in here. For example, we are able to push database processing, our Oracle Database processing into storage. We moved our core database data processing algorithms into the storage in our integrated system, which is something that we can only do because we own the whole layer. We own the database. We own the servers. We own the servers. We own the network. We own the storage. We own the protocols.</p><p>Same thing in things like flash. We've moved our -- we've put database intelligent caching in flash. We are actually reformatting the data as it moves through tiers. So that's something -- you hear a lot about caching and flashing and all that kind of stuff. Caching in memory with Database In-Memory. We don't just move the data. We reformat the data because we own the data. So there's a lot of very different things we can do.</p><p>Same thing with messaging. Our database directly speaks to our switches and tells it which messages are important and need to be prioritized. And again, that's because we own the database. We own the switches. We are able to do many unique -- implement many unique capabilities in this product. And that's what makes this product extremely fast, extremely high available.</p><p>And what we are really focusing a lot on nowadays is Multitenant and database as a service. So you can combine many applications together. So integrating all that together, and it makes it a very powerful platform.</p><p>This July, we introduced our latest Exadata Database Machine called X48. A big focus there was in-memory. So in this particular product, we're using the latest and fastest Intel processors, Intel Xeon processors. And specifically, we put a lot of memory in this. So we have up to 12 terabytes of memory in that Exadata machine. So it combines all the superfast networking and storage, InfiniBand, PCI flash, all that stuff we had before with superfast in-memory processing also. So we are optimizing our Engineered Systems around our in-memory processing.</p><p>We also have the biggest in-memory database machine in the world, the M6 that Larry talked a little bit about last year. This one holds up to 32 terabytes of memory. That's a lot of memory in a single machine. Hundreds of cores, extremely fast interconnect. Very, very good platform for in-memory database. So we have the in-memory database software that we have introduced, and we are also introducing very optimized systems for running in-memory database. Far beyond what other people are able to do.</p><p>SuperCluster is our -- is another one of our Engineered Systems. It combines Database and Middleware in a single platform using our SPARC processors and has very efficient virtualization.</p><p>And one of the -- again, the key thing to understand is, everybody benefits from hardware improvements, but every year we are adding more and more software improvements. And so, all the stuff that I talked about, we are building on it and building on it and building on it. So over time, we are actually separating from everyone else.</p><p>So the differentiation between our engineered system and taking a system and running generic software on it grows every year. It gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. So the value prop every year gets more and more and more compelling, and that's going to keep going on for many years.</p><p>So I mentioned we are optimizing in-memory. And I'll talk a little bit at the end about some of the new things that we are doing that Larry mentioned.</p><p>At this OpenWorld, we started shipping a new machine called the Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance. So in addition of focusing on things like in-memory, we are also doing the opposite. The opposite end of the spectrum, things like data protection backup, a very specialized machine for protecting mission-critical database data.</p><p>And the key things we focused on here was solving the issues that our customers have. So backup has been around for a lot of years. It's kind of been the same thing for 60 years, and it was invented in the 1960s. And what do you do? Every night you take a copy of your data and you push it off to some backup location. If you have a problem, you just restore it. Well, the problem with that paradigm that's been going on for 50 years is when you restore it, you've lost everything that happened that day. And that goes on today.</p><p>So the only thing that's really changed in the last 50 years is instead of pushing it to tape, a lot of times people are pushing it to disk, but the paradigm is the same. And so this has been a big problem for everybody in the industry.</p><p>And so we set out to solve that with this new Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance, and we wanted to make it zero data loss, how? By integrating with our Database tightly to solve this problem. So our Database generates something called redo. We are able to ship the redo in real-time to basically back it up in real time to our Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance, so we can essentially eliminate data loss.</p><p>Data loss is a bad word in customers so -- at my kids' school, they say we have zero tolerance for drugs. Well, CIOs nowadays tell us they have zero tolerance for data loss. It's just not acceptable anymore.</p><p>Also, it's very highly optimized. We can run backups much faster because we only do -- we only ship changed data. So it's a big problem. As databases keep getting bigger, if you are backing up the whole database you are having to read it all from disk, ship it all across the network, it's getting more and more bogged down. So we optimize it so we only ship changes.</p><p>A lot of other optimizations in here that I'm not going to get time. It's a very scalable system. It's based on that same Exadata technology. We have a lot of interest in our customer base in this technology, a lot of interest in this. So it's just started shipping this week. Okay.</p><p>Exalogic is our in-memory analytics engine. There's a lot of optimizations in that also. Notably this year, just now we started shipping with our new Oracle Database In-Memory Insight [SLI]. So it's a major improvement to the product, a major enhancement to the product that just shipped now.</p><p>I think I was talking to Exalytics when it was an Exalogic slide. This is the Exalytics slide. Okay. So let's talk about Hadoop and big data. I'm just going to talk briefly about this. So we just introduced a new capability called Big Data SQL. And what it does is it combines Oracle Database data with Hadoop data. Now, what does that mean? We combine the data. What does that mean? So I'll give you a concrete example.</p><p>So typically things like customer data account data is kept in an Oracle Database. A lot of people want to keep weblog data in Hadoop. Weblog data is like, what did you click on? I clicked on this, I clicked on that thing, I clicked on that thing. That's weblog data. So that's over in Hadoop. User data, customer data, account data is in Oracle.</p><p>So that's all fun until you actually want an answer. So let's say you have a simple question like how many 20-year-old women clicked in this area of the website? How many executives at the VPN-above level use of this part of the website? How many people in this income bracket -- how is their trending of their web data going? You have a problem because the user data is in Oracle. That click data is in Hadoop. And so if you ask a question like that, the answer is hey, let me get back to you in a couple of weeks. I'll try to figure it out by hand and put this stuff together.</p><p>So the idea of this Big Data SQL is we can now combine this data seamlessly. So we can run a query that combines for example that customer data that's running inside an Oracle Database with that click data, that weblog data, that's in Hadoop. And so you can say the answer exactly to that question. How many 20-year-old women are looking at this area? How many senior executives are on our website? How is that trending? What are they looking at? It's very important data.</p><p>That's what you really want to know. You don't really care that a bunch of people -- you might care that a bunch of people clicked in this area of the website, that's fine. But you kind of want to drill down. And to do that you have to combine that data with existing relational data, and that's exactly what we've done.</p><p>And we've made it extremely efficient, extremely simple to use with our Big Data Appliance and this new product called Big Data SQL. You run the exact same SQL as if you were running it all against an Oracle Database. And the Oracle Database coordinates, accesses the Hadoop data. We've used some of our same technology we've used in Exadata to offload operations in the storage, to offload operations into Hadoop. So it's all extremely fast and, again, it's very, very simple to do. Now if somebody asks that question, you can give them the answer immediately.</p><p>Also, all the analytic stuff that works on the Oracle Database, all the tools that have been built up, the third-party tools for decades, it all just works on top of this. So you instantly get those tools available. So that was just introduced, I think, a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>And we have a lot of customers now using our Engineered Systems. Very popular across our Engineered Systems. I'm not going to read all of these. But we do have basically most of the major corporations around the world, a bunch of really good corporations here. They get really big benefits -- performance benefits; cost benefits; things that they were never able to do before that they can now do. Reduced cost, which is a big deal. So across the board, we are getting very good adoption of our Engineered Systems because we are providing high value to businesses. That's why they care. That's why they want to adopt this technology.</p><p>All right. So that's -- and then I'm going to cover one last thing today. So let me just say if you are reading email, listen for the next two minutes. This part is important. Okay? This is really a big deal.</p><p>So Larry talked briefly about this on Sunday. This is our next big step. This is a really, really, really big deal. We set out -- Oracle bought Sun a number of years ago. Sun has a chip team. We've been working with them very closely to engineer our Engineered Systems. We've engineered the architecture, we've engineered the software, we've put it all together.</p><p>We've also had an effort going for the last four years -- so our team, the software team, the Database team has been working with the chip design team for the last four years to do something nobody's ever done before, which is to move database processing on chip, particularly for in-memory applications. So that's really the area that we targeted.</p><p>And Larry talked about this on Sunday. It's three different areas that we've targeted. It's not just about performance. One thing is performance. Performance, of course, very important. So our in-memory database engine uses -- is a very highly optimized engine. It uses something called vector processing that's on chips today. So that's been -- those are very high-speed instructions that were put on chip for graphics processing, for scientific processing. They exist on Intel chips, SPARC chips, every chip in the industry. And we are taking advantage of that technology to make our database and memory run very fast today.</p><p>But that technology wasn't really designed for Database. I mentioned it was designed for graphics. It was designed for scientific computing. So about four years ago we started a project and we said, let's put exactly what the database wants on chip and make it run extraordinarily fast and do something that is far beyond what you can do today with generic hardware.</p><p>So we've been working on optimizing chips for many years. So my team has worked with all the major chip vendors. We have about 20 Intel people in our team that worked on optimizing Intel chips for the Oracle Database. We optimized SPARC chips for the Oracle Database. We've optimized everything over the years.</p><p>But the new Database In-Memory has different optimization. It's a different architecture. It works differently than the way we used to work before. So it's kind of like the whole brand-new area that's opened up. And it's actually much more amenable to optimization than what we had before. And so this is a big deal. Larry talked about -- actually had some very detailed slides on this on Sunday. It's more detailed than the slides I use actually, which is interesting.</p><p>So that's the first big deal. We are putting these database engines directly on chip and it's -- think of it like a few years ago the chip vendors put encryption/decryption on chip. And encryption/decryption actually ran really slow if you run it in conventional processors. But they put specialized encrypt/decrypt engines on chip. Now it runs really, really fast. You can keep up -- basically you don't notice any more. You can get encrypt/decrypt for free now.</p><p>Same kind of stuff. We put specialized software engines on the new SPARC chip to make in-memory database processing run really fast. So that's one thing. Second thing is capacity. The other problem with in-memory is you lose capacity. Memory is a lot smaller than flash, which is a lot smaller than disk. So as you're moving data into memory, you're losing capacity.</p><p>So the answer to that is you have to start to compress more. And there's various levels of compression. There's some levels of compression you can kind of get for free, and there is -- but the deepest levels of compression are very CPU-intensive. They can't be run in real time. They don't run anywhere near the speed of memory. So they can keep up with disk throughput, but memory throughput is about 1,000 times -- 10,000 times faster. The chip technology just can't keep up with encrypt/decrypt at that rate.</p><p>So, again, we developed special encrypt/decrypt algorithms that were very amenable to put on chip, and we baked those in on chip. What that means is will be able to run 2 to 3 times more memory, more data in memory than if we didn't have the specialized processing. So it increases the capacity of our in-memory database beyond what anybody else can do. And it runs in real time.</p><p>So I don't have numbers on here. I know all these numbers. Most people don't understand these numbers. But a single socket will run at 120 gigabytes per second. So, like I said, most people don't understand these numbers. If you understood these numbers, you would say, wow, that's unbelievable. It's amazing! 120 gigabytes per second. We can do like one now. And it burns up the whole chip. It uses all the resources on the chip. So it's very, very fast.</p><p>And then the last thing is reliability and security. So we are moving terabytes of data in the memory. And there's a big problem -- there's another big problem there, which is data in memory is much more vulnerable than data on disk. It's very easy to overwrite data in memory. You can do malicious attacks on data in memory. There's things like buffer overflows. If you follow security, one of the main exploits that people use against -- to attack systems is buffer overflows, and that's by corrupting memory.</p><p>So as we move more and more terabytes of user data -- this is financial data, customer data, very critical data in the memory -- it becomes more vulnerable than it is today on flash and on disk. It's much easier to access the data in memory.</p><p>So on the reliability security side, we have built a number of special capabilities onto the chip to protect this data at a very fine level. And, again, today I don't have the time to go into this. It's actually not that complicated conceptually. But the conceptual idea is every little bit of memory that's given out -- so for example if you want 50 bytes for this purpose -- the chip will lock that memory so only you can access it. Nobody else can access that memory. Somebody else wants 30 bytes for some other purpose, it's locked for that. So if some sort of either mistake -- we make mistakes in our software that kind of overwrites memory, which can corrupt memory, or a malicious attack comes in, they can't access that memory. So like every little piece of memory that we allocate is protected against access by someone else.</p><p>And this by the way, that one I would say is a computer science advance. It's not just a special feature in our product. It's a computer science advance. Nobody has really done anything for -- to improve reliability and security in hardware in 50 years. So 50 years ago, paging was implemented, and that's what we all use today. It's very, very course-grain data protection. It's also kind of expensive.</p><p>This runs in real time and protects data at very fine levels. We're going to use all of this to protect all our Database In-Memory data from both attacks from the outside and from our own mistakes so it doesn't get corrupted. And because of the way it's implemented on chip in the memory subsystem through all the caches, through all the memory buses and everything else, it's free. It's a big deal. It basically runs with no performance overhead.</p><p>So those are three big areas that we focused on. And you're going to be hearing a lot more about this next year. So we have these systems working in our lab today. We're going to be shipping them next year. Larry talked a lot about them at the end of his talk on Saturday. But, again, this stuff -- every single one of these things is a really, really big deal. And it's possible because we are building our software on the chips. We're optimizing that in ways that nobody's ever done before. And so, I'll just leave you with that and that's it. Thank you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome back to the stage Ken Bond.</p><p>KEN BOND: Everybody come on back in. Please take a seat. Who was that? Zelnick. Make a note, no Zelnick next year. Make a note. Come on back in those of you outside. Alright. We are a third of the way there.</p><p>We are now going to basically turning into the technology port of the presentation. We'll have two of our senior executives, Thomas Kurian, who is our Executive Vice President responsible for software development, and then Steve Miranda, also Executive Vice President who works on applications, will both be coming up. Thomas will take two parts of this. He will be focusing on technology. And when I mean technology, I don't mean the word -- the broader sense of technology. He'll be focusing on products like our Database, our Middleware, big data analytics. He'll also then spend some time on cloud infrastructure, platform as a service and then ERP/EPM. So without further ado, Thomas Kurian.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN, EVP, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, ORACLE CORPORATION: Thank you, Ken. So I'm going to start with an overview of what we've done with our software portfolio as a whole this year. So our strategy is quite simple. We've had the same strategy for three to four years now. First one is deliver Engineered Systems combining our hardware and software together for breakthrough innovations in performance and reliability. I think Juan Loaiza covered that earlier today. Then to deliver a complete open and market-leading suite of database middleware and applications. I'm going to drill down on that now.</p><p>To add to that, a complete and unified infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, software as a service and data as a service through the Oracle public cloud. And you've seen a lot of announcements from us this week on that. So we'll cover some of that. And then to use our scale and installed base product breadth to offer customers integrated solutions.</p><p>So I'm going to focus on -- so this last year if you look at all the magic quadrants from Gartner, all the various analyst firms from a leadership point of view, we continue to lead the largest number of categories of an enterprise software vendor. And we've added a number this year. I'm going to focus on three primary businesses: Database, Middleware, analytics in this session.</p><p>So our Database, a lot of our focus in core Database is around six or seven key areas. Storage management, which is optimizing how our Database stores data on disk so that we can compress data to save space on disk and costs for customers as well as improve performance. Grid or cluster computing is the ability to run large-scale systems and to add nodes into the system to improve both performance and reliability.</p><p>Historically, you've seen us do transaction processing, data warehousing; maximum availability is an area where we've added a lot more capabilities, and I'll talk about some of them.</p><p>And then we've added -- over many, many years we focused on the ability to have the Oracle Database manage all your data. We've added a number of new data types to the Oracle Database. The ability to run, for example, JSON, which is a very popular format now. The ability to persist JSON directly into the Oracle Database so that you can query on JSON data without having to have a separate system for it. We've gotten new products in the area around database security as well as around management. I'm going to focus on three important new database options we've introduced.</p><p>But before I do that, I want to reiterate we are number one in database. We have nearly half the market in the database market. And we are also number one in data warehousing. And if you go back and look at the analyst firms and their market share results, we have taken market share steadily over the last three years. So not only are we large, but we are growing faster than everyone else.</p><p>Now, the three new options -- the first one, in-memory database. So what's unique about Oracle's in-memory database, it's the only database in the industry that supports both transaction processing applications and analytic applications on the same database: in-memory. Number two, it allows you to get great performance by adding columnar capability to your applications, but it does not require you to change your applications which means that any customer running Oracle simply has to upgrade to 12, no matter which one, what their applications are, and they can get improvements in performance, which means this option has enormous market potential. And it both runs analytics and OLTP substantially faster, and to a database user it looks like a regular Database upgrade. So you don't have to retrain your database administrators on a brand-new set of tools or products.</p><p>The proof of it is the following. Oracle E-Business Suite, J.D. Edwards, PeopleSoft, Siebel, Fusion, Hyperion, these are all certified and now generally available supporting Oracle Database 12c and Oracle in-memory database. So it has the ability now for us to take these products into the installed base of our applications customers, which is obviously, as you know, very large.</p><p>And secondly, you can see some of the data and performance results. Oracle E-Business Suite cost management goes 1,003 times faster. So something that took you 1,000 hours to compute can now be done in an hour. PeopleSoft time and labor goes 1,354 times faster. J.D. Edwards sales order analysis goes 1,700 times faster. Our Transportation Management product, which is the market leader in transportation management, goes 1,030 times faster and so on.</p><p>So not only have we delivered the in-memory database, not only have we certified all of our applications on it, but also the results speak for themselves.</p><p>Number two is the Oracle Multitenant database, 12c. What this allows you to do is if you've got many, many different applications accessing separate physical instances of the Oracle Database, it gives you the densest way to consolidate database environments. So you can take one physical database, put many instances of Oracle. You can collapse them as what we call Multitenant database instances inside that physical database. You get the ability to patch, upgrade, and maintain one physical database. And inside of it, each database instance, what we call pluggable database, is completely isolated from a memory CPU, security, and resource point of view.</p><p>So lots of our big Oracle Database shops that have many, many departmental databases or smaller transaction processing databases, et cetera, as well as a number of SaaS vendors are looking at this solution to consolidate databases and both save on operating expense, because you have to have fewer people to maintain stuff, and capital expense, because it gives you the densest footprint from a consolidation point of view.</p><p>And third is a new offering that's getting a lot of attention by our customers is what we call private cloud database as a service. This is the ability for a customer to use three products from Oracle. Oracle Enterprise Manager's Cloud Management Pack, which is another option to the Database, plus Oracle Exadata and Oracle Multitenant database, which I just covered, to create databases so that you can have all your databases look identical from a configuration point of view and also set up what we call a database farm or database cloud so that you can share workload much more efficiently and you can also consolidate how you manage your database requirements.</p><p>So many, many customers who want a private cloud, which runs behind their firewall, use this technology to do so. And these three are brand-new options with 12 that are getting a lot of attention.</p><p>Secondary is Fusion Middleware. So, Middleware at Oracle is a broad suite. It consists of a number of pieces. I won't go through every piece, but think of it as consisting of the major pieces of infrastructure that you need to run applications. So application servers, integration tools, business process management, analytics, collaboration, identity management, user engagement and tools.</p><p>Now, in middleware, we are also the market leader in middleware. We are number one in middleware. We have the largest market share. And you can look at the competitors as well in this market and look at the market share results from Gartner or IDC, and we have taken market share faster than anyone in the market in this segment as well.</p><p>Now, here we have introduced Oracle Fusion Middleware 12c. Brand-new major release of the entire Middleware suite. It went out in April. And within Fusion Middleware 12c, there are a number of new options. I'm going to just highlight three of them to give you a flavor of some of the new capability.</p><p>The first one is the ability in our cloud application foundation. This is part of WebLogic Server. WebLogic is our -- the number one application server in the market. Historically, people have wanted the ability to have an application tier run on a primary data center. And because of regulatory requirements now, they have to have a secondary data center within a metro area, 50 to 100 kilometers. And now you can run those application servers active-active, and we are the only ones in the industry that lets you do that. So a lot of financial services institutions and so on that have regulatory requirements to run active-active now have expressed interest in these products.</p><p>Similarly, we have a capability called federated caching. So federated caching is interesting to a lot of customers who have a central data center with application access from multiple locations around the world. So they want to distribute data from that centralized data center to remote data centers. And so we've got a capability to support what we call global data distribution for very fast-changing data. Again, we are the only product in the industry that does that, and so that's been very exciting to people in telecommunications, financial services, and any organization that is concerned about Patriot Act because now you have to distribute data to multiple data centers.</p><p>The second offering that we've introduced is something called Oracle Mobile. This is a brand-new offering. It consists of three parts. The ability to take an application framework and with one code base build applications that span iOS and Android phones, iOS and Android small tablets, iOS and Android large tablets, and web apps. So most enterprise customers are now struggling with -- as people bring their own devices, they have to support the same apps running on eight or nine different platforms, and writing it eight or nine different times is not pragmatic. We give you a solution to build an application that spans devices and operating systems. Associated with that, we also give you a security solution called Mobile Security; and a backend as a service, what's in the industry called mobile backend as a service, the ability to take all of your legacy systems, all of your packaged apps, and expose them up to mobile devices. We have used this to build mobile applications for all of our packaged apps: PeopleSoft, Hyperion, E-Business Suite, Fusion, J.D. Edwards, et cetera. And so most of our apps customers as they get a mobile requirement not only use our packaged solution, but when they went to extend or customize these solutions use the Mobile solution from us to extend it. And so that's a brand-new offering.</p><p>The third one, similar to database as a service or the private cloud, we offer Middleware as a service for the private cloud. This is the ability to create, manage, patch, upgrade a large number of Oracle Fusion Middleware instances in a 100% consistent way. Similar to the Database offering which consists of -- on the Database side, I said it consists of Exadata, Multitenant database and Enterprise Manager. The equivalent one from middleware is Oracle Middleware, Exalogic, and Enterprise Manager. And so this gives you the ability to create environments and manage them with on Middleware very quickly and easily, and there's a lot of interest from the customer base for these new capabilities.</p><p>Third one, the area of business intelligence. So business intelligence, we have introduced at OpenWorld a number of new products. I wanted to just talk about them. But before I do that, traditionally there have been two segments of business intelligence: one called enterprise performance management, the other one called business analytics. We are the leader and number one in both segments; just like in Database and middleware, we are the leader in both segments.</p><p>Now, what are some of the new capabilities we've introduced this year? The first one is called Big Data SQL. What this allows you to do is organizations today have data in Hadoop. They have data in a NoSQL system. They have data in an Oracle system. So they may have operational data like CRM or HR in an Oracle system. They may have weblogs and various other things in Hadoop. And they want to compare data they are collecting from their weblogs with data from the operational system, which tells you which customers are the most profitable.</p><p>So prior to this, you could not access data in Hadoop using SQL. Which meant that you wrote MapReduce, you pulled the data out of the MapReduce program into some middle tier, you fetched data from Oracle into the middle tier, and then tried to join your data in the middle tier which was clearly was not very efficient and also didn't scale very well.</p><p>So Big Data SQL allows you to use standard Oracle SQL to query across most SQL, Hadoop, and Oracle sources. So it opens up data in Hadoop to all people who know Oracle SQL, which is a huge community of people, and it also makes you have the ability to join data very efficiently between these sources.</p><p>And lastly, similar to the technology we have in Exadata to offload scanning down to the storage tier, which makes query performance very well, very good. We've done the same thing with the Big Data Appliance to offload scanning for Hadoop data down to the storage tier, which obviously means that analysis goes much faster.</p><p>So the first thing is that now Oracle customers can use Hadoop alongside their Oracle investments, and we've got a competitive advantage against other suppliers of Hadoop as an infrastructure for Big Data.</p><p>The second thing we introduced to complement that was a new analytic tool called Oracle Big Data Discovery. So when business users want to sit in front of Hadoop and analyze data in Hadoop as well in relational system, today they don't have any technology to do that. So they have to call this guy called a data scientist who then goes and writes a statistical program in MapReduce, generates some data and comes back to them with here's what I found.</p><p>But business users want to explore the data in Hadoop themselves. They don't want to have to wait for some scientist to do that. So we introduce the first visual graphical user interface tool to Hadoop. So the business user can actually literally -- that's a snapshot of the screen. A business user can sit in front of it. He can browse the data, he can annotate the data, he can build models with the data and then share it with other people. So it brings interactive query and analysis to Hadoop.</p><p>And finally, we've also introduced a number of new application modules on top of this technology to allow you to do packaged analytics out of both on-premise sources like E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft, J.D. Edwards; but also out of cloud sources, our SaaS applications, and be in more than 2 million users now using these prepackaged analytics from CRM HR ERP in the cloud. So you don't have to go build all your ETLs or anything like that, you can do it right on the cloud. We give you packaged analytics to do that.</p><p>So three important areas: Database, Middleware, analytics. They are big market segments. We are the leader in all three. We have a huge installed base in all three and introduced a number of new interesting products in these categories.</p><p>But I thought it would be best if you heard from some of our customers about these products. So we've got three very important customers with us. Mr. Sudhi Vijayakumar from Yahoo. He is the Principal DBA at Yahoo. He's going to talk about what they are doing -- Sudhi, please come up -- with our Oracle in-memory database. Dr. Marcus Praetzas from Deutsche Bank. He's the Head of Technical Architecture at Deutsche Bank. He's going to talk about what he's done with our Big Data Appliance. And Mr. Facundo Rua. He is the Chief Digital Officer and the Head of IT at TUI, a major travel company in Europe. So welcome. Thank you for coming. Nice to see you all. Please sit.</p><p>So Sudhi, can you tell them what your experience -- you started with Andy Mendelsohn's team trying the Oracle in-memory database.</p><p>SUDHI VIJAYAKUMAR, PRINCIPAL DATABASE ARCHITECT, YAHOO! INC.: Yes, we did.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: What we are guys trying to do at Yahoo, and what did you find?</p><p>SUDHI VIJAYAKUMAR: So let me give a little bit of context as to where exactly we saw in-memory fit in. We -- I'm part of a team which takes care of ads in Big Data, so pretty much entire data flows through our department. And we have quite a lot of important data miles which address internal e-staff users as well as our external advertisers. We were looking at providing them data as near real time as possible, and we're trying to determine the options. And we got a word that there is some secret plot that's going on with Oracle, and then we hooked onto it and then we were blown away by the speeds of it. So what we see is we put in-memory and we make a lot of our customers very, very happy. Get them the data as fast as possible.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: That's great. How long did it take you to do that? Was it a very complex upgrade or anything of the kind?</p><p>SUDHI VIJAYAKUMAR: This was the initial fear of our entire management team. But it was very surprising. When we went to the data program, we didn't have to change any line of code. All our customer applications that built in, they are all exceedingly happy because they don't have to write a single -- they don't have to make any changes to their application. And then in a flip of a switch, we get really fast responses. So it is completely transferred into the applications.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: That's wonderful. Thank you, Sudhi. And so we made you a hero.</p><p>SUDHI VIJAYAKUMAR: Yes, that's what I would like to look at it that way, though.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: Okay. Dr. Praetzas, thank you for joining us. Can you tell the audience what you do -- what's the application you guys are doing with Big Data?</p><p>MARCUS PRAETZAS, DIRECTOR OF TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE, DEUTSCHE BANK AG: Yes, maybe as well to give some context first. So we've been using Exadata systems for now five years about. And initially we thought about Exadata in order to increase performance, which we saw over the course of the years. We actually saw over the course of the years increased reliability and deterministic, so we are very satisfied with that.</p><p>And then there are other use cases as well that either have been there in the past already or are now emerging. And for these use cases, Big Data we think is the appropriate solution. And coming from the experience with the Exadata system, the performance, the offload to the storage, that's something where we are looking forward to see and from the initial tests as well, and so all these only Big Data Appliance. The main reason for that is new use cases, data analytics, pattern matching, exercises, that sort of thing with the appropriate performance.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: And what did you find?</p><p>MARCUS PRAETZAS: As with the Exadata system, we see very satisfying performance. We see that we now look through what are applications? What are use cases that we haven't addressed so far which are appropriate for that kind of technology? We as well looking forward, I think you mentioned this probably here, the integration between the Big Data world and the relational world order.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: That's great. And Sudhi's ROI was he could deliver something that his users wanted for a very, very long time, which is virtually real-time analytics. What kinds of things are you looking forward to deliver to your users?</p><p>MARCUS PRAETZAS: New insights. That's basically what we are looking for because there is things that we couldn't -- it's mostly a discovery tool. That's what we want to use it for. Unfortunately, I'm not a hero yet, so --</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: Only a matter of time. That's great. Thank you. Facundo, you are an Oracle Middleware customer. Can you tell people first of all what you guys do actually and then secondly how you use Oracle Middleware?</p><p>FACUNDO RUA, CHIEF DIGITAL OFFICER AND HEAD OF IT, TUI AG: Absolutely. What we do at Toohey Multitenant is we try to provide to our customers experiences. So everybody wants to go on holidays, right? So that's what we do, and we try to provide them experiences that they are not going to ever forget.</p><p>We operate in more or less more than 180 countries, and we serve -- or we provide services to 30 million consumers around the world. It's pretty intense.</p><p>In terms of what we use our Middleware, which was your second question, we decided to go with the stack of WebLogic 12c and Coherence 12.2. We strongly believe that the demands from people in terms of their holidays is increasing. Everybody wants to have better holidays, cheaper holidays and quicker holidays to purchase. So those three things combined, we realize, we need to be fast.</p><p>So we basically started to look at different solutions, and we realized that those two things together were not going to provide us with what we needed. So we achieved a lot of stuff in terms of technology and non-technology, which we didn't realize we were going to be able to have it. In terms of technology-wise, yes, we scale massively, I have to say. And we are providing services within the blink of an eye. So that's around 100 milliseconds.</p><p>In terms of the non-technology, we were able to standardize our product. And that helped us to have our team in this digital transformation to quickly get on hold and hands-on with what we need to develop.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: So your travel system essentially uses our Middleware as an integration middleware. You are using SOA Suite to tie a number of systems together, and you've been looking -- you were trying to get something that gives you great latency which is a very low latency because people want -- when they try to book a travel trip, they don't want to wait around to get a response. Are you guys happy with the product?</p><p>FACUNDO RUA: Well, I have to say I'm happy. I'm very demanding as well. And I'm very aggressive to technology. So putting things into place and making them work, it's beautiful. Simple is beautiful. So actually you really helped us in that perspective. I have to thank you on that.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: And how many transactions go through the system today?</p><p>FACUNDO RUA: We have reaching -- any separate day, we are reaching around the 2 billion transactions a day more or less of availability. So that's pretty amazing, to be honest.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: That's great. So three examples of different capability that we've introduced. You guys are in 12c of Middleware. You're using the Big Data Appliance. Sudhi, you guys are trying the in-memory database. Are you happy with the new innovations we are introducing?</p><p>SUDHI VIJAYAKUMAR: Oh, of course. Yes.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: What kinds of things do you guys see as the next step? At Yahoo, for example, what kind of business value do you guys plan to get? If you can provide your users with instantaneous response time for analytics, what kinds of things will they do with it?</p><p>SUDHI VIJAYAKUMAR: As an advertiser, if I start off a campaign, I want to really see how fast, what was my reach to the marketing campaign. So these kinds of analytics would take time because data get invested in so many different places. They are all finally funneled to an Oracle Database for us, and then we make it available to them as soon as possible so that they can, as Marcus mentioned, do all kinds of insights, find out whether it was successful, make some modifications. They get instant responses or feedback of how their campaign performed, and that helps them have better campaigns and in turn makes our advertisers very happy.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: That's great. So in a way, the fact that you can find these patterns allows you to come up with new economic models, new pricing mechanisms and other things to grow Yahoo stock by some day. Yes?</p><p>SUDHI VIJAYAKUMAR: Yes.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: Dr. Praetzas, what -- when you -- one of the things that we see a lot of our customers using Hadoop for is what we call a data link. Put all your data in there, and then they really want the mechanism to be able to search the data. And you've heard about Oracle Big Data SQL. How is that interesting to you?</p><p>MARCUS PRAETZAS: Yes, the interesting part on that one is because currently we have tested a sort of in isolation. So the Big Data Appliance of the data, and we already gained some insight, and we can run pattern matching over it and gets all of the data that we have.</p><p>But at the moment, I guess many companies are mostly relational data pools that are available. So we want to bring these two things together. So therefore, the Big Data SQL, that's the interesting part of it where we don't need to move data from here to there in order to match it in order to join it up. But we can basically integrate our data pools.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: So you can open it up to all the people who know SQL and Oracle. Which as you meant, Deutsche Bank is many, many people.</p><p>MARCUS PRAETZAS: Yes.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: Yes. Okay, great. Absolutely great. And then where are you guys going next with Middleware? What kinds of things are you looking at? You've seen 12c. I know based on the sessions you've seen here at OpenWorld, there's a lot of new stuff. What do find interesting next?</p><p>FACUNDO RUA: Well, I have to say that my team already back at Palma have implemented 12.3 already. So they have it in test. We are kind of entrepreneurs in technology, and we like to test things first.</p><p>I'm really interested in one of the things you mentioned in one of your sessions, which is the cloud perspective, the cloud services. We are mainly integrating clients that supply us all the time. So one of our main challenges today is to make that pretty easy to disrupt the market in terms of the integration perspective. So I'm really looking forward to getting my hands dirty on that perspective.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: So you've heard about the costs. And these guys surely the integration cloud service, or ESB in the cloud, which allows you to add people very quickly because you don't have to attach them to your enterprise system. And then we've got messaging from there down to your enterprise system, and I assume that's interesting to you guys.</p><p>FACUNDO RUA: Correct. And that basically is going to allow us to create a pace to make our business grow faster, to be honest.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: Great. So example of a customer who uses on-premise software because it's the same technology that they are comfortable with now running the cloud here, interested in trying out our cloud service.</p><p>FACUNDO RUA: We're going to move forward to that.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: Okay. Thank you so much all of you for joining us and for telling the audience what you like about the software, how you are planning to apply it. I think it opens their eyes up to the fact that when we say the technology is very easy to use and adopt, one of the big things we're excited about release 12 and of Database and of Middleware and of analytics is that the new options are very easy to pick up. Big Data Appliance -- and you do Oracle Big Data SQL, you simply connect your Exadata and Big Data machines together and you can run SQL.</p><p>In-memory database, you simply pick up your application, upgrade Oracle database from 11 to 12, and you are off and running. And you guys have done live on 12.3 faster than -- we just shipped 12.3 in May for Middleware. So you are already live on such a large system.</p><p>FACUNDO RUA: It's in the process to be live, and we think it's going to be live by the end of the year.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: Okay. Great. So thank you again for joining us, and thank you for being here. Thank you.</p><p>So that gives you a flavor of our technology business, our database, our Middleware analytics. We talked about a lot of new offerings. There are a number of them. I touched on just three or four them, the new options, and we have the customers more importantly than me telling you why they like it and how they plan to use it.</p><p>So I thought I'd go next to a quick update on Oracle Cloud. I'm going to talk about three areas: infrastructure, platform, and ERP Cloud. And then Steve Miranda is going to talk about HR and CRM, and we're going to have some customers talk about their experience with our platform and why they like the platform and ERP Cloud before we go to Steve, okay?</p><p>So what are we trying to do with the cloud? Four years ago, we said we're going to enter the cloud and we're going to build these four layers; Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, Software-as-a-Service and Data-as-a-Service. And essentially we've delivered those pieces. So I'll talk about each one and just give you a flavor of some of the services so you have an idea of what we are doing.</p><p>So Infrastructure-as-a-Service, at the core of it, the services we are delivering are elastic block storage, elastic object storage, elastic compute, secure identity, and then messaging. So secure identity says when you sign into the Oracle Cloud you have one place where we manage all of your identity and your username/passwords and that gives people comfort that if somebody leaves their company they can delete the customer in their on-premise system they are automatically revoked from the cloud. So that's one of the differences in our implementation because it's one architecture and we have a central place to manage identity.</p><p>I'll talk about storage and compute briefly just to give you an example of some of the things we do. So let's start with object storage. Object storage is meant for archiving data or documents. It can also be used for backup. There are three or four interesting capabilities that we've introduced with our object storage.</p><p>The first one is this integration with Oracle RMAN, or Recovery Manager. It's the tool that used to backup and restore our database. You can now configure RMAN to point to the object storage services in the cloud and it automatically backs up your database and puts the backup in the cloud. So that's number one and it's about simplification.</p><p>Similarly, we have introduced a storage gateway that allows you to take files from any network-attached storage device or blocks from any SAN, storage area network device and archive it in the cloud. So that allows you to ingest non-Oracle database content, that's number two.</p><p>Number three, our storage service has two important capabilities that I want to highlight. One is this notion of single global namespace. So why that's important is so we have a triple mirror storage solution. It's triple mirrored across three different data centers. So you won't -- even if one data center goes down, you don't lose data.</p><p>But when you configure your backup, for example, to point to the cloud, you simply point to a central namespace. And behind that we replicate your data transparently to these other locations.</p><p>Now that's different than other cloud storage vendors who require you explicitly to tell them which data center you're backing up to. And that means that if you decide, for example, that you want to change a policy to say my weekly backup, I want it put in triple mirror and my nightly backup I only want a double mirror, you have to change every time you run the backup where you put stuff to. Versus for us you have one global namespace and how much redundancy you configure is strictly by policy.</p><p>So all of these are significant differences between what we do with storage and similarly there are differences with what we do with compute than other cloud providers, and it largely comes from our experience with enterprise customers.</p><p>Now the second area built on top of this Infrastructure-as-a-Service, 100% of our platform runs on top of the Infrastructure-as-a-Service. On top of the Infrastructure-as-a-Service, there is a broad suite of platform services. These are all technology that we built organically based on our expertise in database, middleware and analytics. It's the targeting three different audiences. It's targeting enterprise IT, it's targeting application developers, and it's targeting the line of business users.</p><p>So, some of these services apply to many different audiences, but I'm going to give you a flavor of them. So let's start with application developers. For application developers, we give you a Database-as-a-Service where you can load your data, Java-as-a-Service where you can build applications in Java, a developer service which allows you to store all of your stuff in source control up in the cloud and then allows you to build the source and deploy to our cloud, and then mobile which if you're building mobile applications allows you to get a set of tools to very quickly and easily build applications for iOS and Android devices. So that's part one.</p><p>Part two is if you're a departmental user, they gave you four services. The first one is document management which is if you've got corporate documents that you want to synchronize with your own desktop devices -- your PC, iPhone, your Android devices to synchronize those documents securely. And then secondly, to collaborate with others using a workspace.</p><p>The second piece is Oracle Social Network, which gives you a social networking tool, and then we have two different analytics solutions. One for people who want to do Hadoop and one for people who want a traditional [quotidian] analysis environment. And both of them have a graphical user interface backed either by Hadoop or Oracle-as-a-Database.</p><p>And finally for enterprise IT, we have variety of solutions -- one for identity management; one as an integration service, which integrates our Cloud with your on-premise systems; and the third one is a business process management solution. So we've got a range of Platform-as-a-Service solutions appealing to a variety of different people. So I'll touch on them and just highlight some of the key capabilities that differentiate our cloud services and why we're getting interest.</p><p>So I'm going to start with Oracle database in the cloud. So Oracle database in the cloud, you can go to our cloud and request either 11 or 12. You can request either a single instance or a clustered instance. And then you can configure various things.</p><p>So we automatically in the software do a bunch of work that if you were to use either someone else's cloud or your on-premise system, you're doing manually. So when you configure the database, we do it for you in software. If you want a stand-by environment set up, we do it automatically for you in the software. You simply check on a menu what you want and it's configured for you automatically.</p><p>If you want to encrypt the data in the database, we encrypt the data automatically for you. If you want to patch the database, you tell us which weekend and what window of time you want and we patch it for you. If you want to upgrade the database, we upgrade it for you automatically.</p><p>So we're taking a lot of the work that in an on-premise environment or with someone else's cloud you have to do manually. You have to patch, you have to upgrade, you have to set up a standby, you have to fail over, you have to add encryption. And through software, we've automated 100% of it. So you literally simply check off what you want in a GUI, in a graphical user interface, and it's all done lights out for you. And by doing it, we allow you both to reduce your cost, improves the value of the service, and also allows us to appeal to people who may not be professional DBAs.</p><p>Now for development, important thing is we bring essentially have a GitHub in the Cloud, a Git repository. We've got a tool called Maven that allows you to do dependency management. There is something called JIRA and if you are a developer, if you're an engineer, you love all of these terms because that's what every engineer who's doing open source development uses. And we give you all of that in the cloud.</p><p>So if you want one-stop shopping, I want to develop in the cloud, I want to deploy in the cloud, I need a database in the cloud, you have it. And we've certified all the popular tools that people used to work so you don't have to pick and choose. We don't constrain you from the choice of which IDE or development environment.</p><p>If you want to build mobile apps, we give you a full mobile solution. So if you want to take Oracle E-Business Suite and access it from a mobile device you can do it without any middleware on your premise. You can do it with a cloud backend, a cloud development framework, and security through the cloud. And that's obviously of interest to a lot of our customers.</p><p>Collaboration and social networking. So if you have documents from ERP, HR, CRM -- we have a big on premise content and document management business -- and you want something that integrates with your corporate security infrastructure, your corporate network, your corporate directory, any active directory or LDAP, your corporate security system so that there's no leakage of these documents out a separate drop box, if you will -- we give you a secure file so you can share and a team workspace and collaboration environment. And similarly, we give you a social network. This is like a Facebook-like tool that allows users to collaborate with one another across different lines of business and also allows you to post information to it from applications.</p><p>Additionally, if you have applications in our cloud or someone else's cloud and you want to integrate it with your on-premise system you can use our integration Platform-as-a-Service. Think of it as an enterprise service bus -- that's a technical term -- that runs in the cloud that allows you to connect different systems together, route data between them, map data between them.</p><p>And similarly, if you have got departments that want workflow. Workflow is I need a bunch of screens. I want to build an application like absence reporting, and I want to do that with a set of screens and a workflow engine behind it. Our process cloud service gives you that.</p><p>And then lastly, we've got two analytics systems, both designed either for enterprise IT or for departmental users. So one is a traditional analytic tool called Oracle Business Intelligence. So if you've got -- if you are an HR person and you want to do some spreadsheet analysis, you can take the spreadsheet, load it through this thing called a self-service data loader. We understand the spreadsheet's format, we create a database schema, and then you can build dashboards, do analysis and publish it out to Excel as well as to mobile client.</p><p>If you want to load data into Hadoop, meaning you've got a huge amount of data, and you want to put it somewhere, you can load that into our storage service in the cloud and then use Hadoop from our cloud. And to analyze that you can either run SQL on Hadoop, as I said, Big Data SQL or you can run our Big Data Discovery, the brand-new visual tool to explore data for your business users.</p><p>So there's a full range of analytics and, as I said, we have packaged analytics from our applications and we've also introduced a new product called social graph analytics which allows you to figure out which people are communicating to which people. And for salespeople, this allows you to bring contact management in a much more efficient way -- allows you to look at your social network, your LinkedIn profile, external sources and build a unified view of your contacts.</p><p>So it's a full-fledged Platform-as-a-Service. Broad suite, all the pieces are integrated together. They were all written on the ground up on one architecture and they are written all to run on the Infrastructure-as-a-Service. And here are some customers who use us for Platform-as-a-Service.</p><p>Now key differentiators. First of all, we appeal to a number of different audiences, for developers, for analytics, for departmental users, and enterprise IT. For each audience we have differentiators. So for developers we are the only solution that gives you a developer collaboration environment, source control, and two different market-leading solutions. A database that leads the market for deployment, of your data and your middle-tier the application server market leader to deploy your application code to.</p><p>So the important thing here is we appeal to different audiences and for each audience we have a complete solution and highly differentiated. We also use this Platform-as-a-Service to extend our SaaS applications. So if you're using our Sales Cloud or Service Cloud, you can extend those; or our HR Cloud or ERP, you can extend those out using our platform.</p><p>And a number of other Cloud vendors who are in SaaS do not have a PaaS to go with it and so this gives us an advantage over those guys. And also you extend it using standard Java of which there are close to 9 million developers in the world. So you don't have to learn a proprietary programming language to extend our SaaS.</p><p>And lastly, we also have integration from the on-premise world to the Cloud because our PaaS is also the same software that runs on premise. Mr. Ellison showed you how easy it is to move a database from on-premise to the cloud. It's the same tools that DBAs use to move databases from one database to another on premise, use the same tools to move up to the cloud.</p><p>And opportunity wise, obviously, Platform-as-a-Service is a huge market opportunity. If you thought in the enterprise IT world, technology is this big and applications are that big, in the Cloud they would have a similar ratio and obviously the technology offering that we have, the Platform-as-a-Service, there's nobody's big in that market. So it's a brand new market. We offer the broadest breadth and we offer multiple market segments. Enterprise IT we can sell to, departmental users, independent software vendors who run Oracle, who want to move to the cloud. They can simply move their apps on our cloud. System integrators, developers. So there's an enormous number of segments in which they can apply.</p><p>And then the differentiators, portability of workload. As I said, it's easy to move applications up to our cloud and back down. And so this allows you to use our cloud for many, many different scenarios. You want to do it as a backup environment. You want to do it for test development. You want to do consolidation. You can do it very easily.</p><p>The second thing is our platform can be sold to our SaaS customer base to extend the SaaS. That's both a competitive advantage against other SaaS vendors, but it also gives us the ability to push our PaaS into a very big customer base.</p><p>And the third thing is because we offer all of these pieces of PaaS together on one platform, as a company, meaning as a customer contractually you get a single service level agreement, you get a single way you need audit security, you get a single data center where all your stuff is running. If you want to do contractual reviews, it's one place to do it. So that also has enormous advantages for our customers.</p><p>Now, let's look at Software-as-a-Service. So Software-as-a-Service we have continue to broaden out the portfolio. Enterprise resource planning or ERP, enterprise performance management or Hyperion -- financial planning, budgeting, financial reporting, financial consolidation. A full HR suite -- human capital management, recruiting, talent management, payroll, time and labor, absences all integrated together. And then a full CRM suite -- marketing, sales, commerce, configure price quote, order capture, customer service, field service, et cetera. Mr. Ellison went through a very long list of new SaaS modules we've introduced this year.</p><p>And then finally supply chain, all built on a common Platform-as-a-Service and also on integrating our social relationship management suite. So I'll focus a little bit on ERP.</p><p>So it's a full ERP suite -- financial management, financial planning, financial budgeting, financial reporting, financial analytics plus cash and treasury management, travel and expense management, revenue management, statutory reporting. All written, ground-up on one architecture as one integrated suite.</p><p>To that, we added project and portfolio management. This is the ability to do project planning, product execution, project billing, resource management, task management, et cetera. So if you're a company like Oracle or a consulting company like Accenture, not only do you have financials but a big part of your costs are in projects because you build them to customers.</p><p>And so if you don't have this capability project and portfolio management, you really can't operate your ERP properly because most of your costs are associated with projects and you need a way to map people and cost of projects and manage them.</p><p>This a full procurement suite, sourcing, contract management, Internet procurement, supplier management, supplier contracts, logistics, and order management. And then finally, a supply chain. So we offer a full supply chain for nonmanufacturing companies, and we have introduced with release 9 the first phases of supply chain for manufacturing companies.</p><p>So for nonmanufacturing companies, we can manage your inventory and your costs, we can give you a product master, we can configure price and quote it. We've got order management. Then we can manage your logistics, and we've introduced transportation management now as a Software-as-a-Service offering.</p><p>So you can do 100% of all of this in the Cloud. Now, here are some examples of things you can do with our platform to extend SaaS. So if you've got our SaaS apps and you happen to have E-Business suite or PeopleSoft on your premise and you want to mix-and-match analytics between the Cloud and on-premise, you can do it with our Business Intelligence Cloud.</p><p>If you want to integrate your cloud with your on premise E-Business Suite, you can do that with our cloud. If you want to build a workflow or business process that spans the cloud and on premise you can do with our platform. So there's a number of things that we allow you to do because we have one common platform that extends our SaaS offering as well and lots of customers are interested in that.</p><p>So people often ask me who is running your ERP Cloud. Here are customers who run ERP in the cloud. You can see some of the very biggest companies on earth run ERP in the Oracle Cloud.</p><p>Who's running your financial planning and budgeting module in the cloud? Here are some customers who run our financial planning and budgeting modules in the cloud. So enterprise performance management in the cloud and, frankly, we are the first one in the market with a enterprise performance management solution in the cloud. No other cloud ERP vendor offers EPM.</p><p>Other questions I get are how many customers -- give us examples of customers who use multiple products from you in the cloud. So here are examples of customers to buy multiple products from us in the cloud, and here are customers who buy multiple portfolio from us. So these are companies who put ERP, HR, CRM all in the Cloud with Oracle or ERP and CRM or HR and CRM. And so, these are not small agencies are institutions, these are some of the largest companies running it and they have taken multiple pieces of their on-premise infrastructure and moved up to the Cloud.</p><p>Competitive differentiators and ERP. We have the leading financial planning and budgeting cloud. That's easy because we're the only ones with an enterprise financial planning and budgeting cloud. None of the other so-called cloud ERP vendors have that.</p><p>Second, we've a highly scalable core financial management system. Our financial management system can run in the general ledger 100 million general ledger transactions an hour. Our competitors talk about being able to run 100 million general ledger transactions a year. So it's a very different scale on which you can run financials in our cloud.</p><p>We give you integrated financial reporting. So can you generate your 10-K, your 10-Q, your disclosures? In our Cloud you [can], in other people's Cloud you cannot. Project management, billing, so for professional services and project-oriented organizations we offer full-fledged project management, project planning.</p><p>You can do your Gantt chart for the project all the way over to you can execute the project, because we have integrated some of our Primavera capability with our ERP systems. So there are significant differences between what we do with ERP in the cloud and that is why we have a lot of customers. And I'll give you some of the statistics in just a second.</p><p>So how big is this? ERP has traditionally been the largest segment of the enterprise software market, and SaaS, ERP for upper midmarket and large enterprise there are very, very few players in it. And so, we have a best in glass offering for upper, mid-market, and large enterprise ERP. And to be frank with you as ERP transitions, ERP in the cloud will be proportionately larger to HCM or CRM in the cloud.</p><p>And traditionally been driven not by HCM, it's been driven by what the finance people in the company want and it's largely driven by how good are your financials?</p><p>So Oracle has a best-in-class offering. Breadth of product; depth and scalability; industry functionality, which is very important in ERP; and our user count is growing faster than anyone else. And the implication for our customer base is not only will it lead us to strengthen ERP but then ERP in turn drags a lot of other pieces with it. ERP drags HR, et cetera.</p><p>Now, we've introduced this year a number of new certifications to allow us to broaden our SaaS portfolio into government agencies, Department of Defense. We just announced at OpenWorld a specialized offer for financial institutions, which handle their regulatory requirements for security and auditing separately, and we have seen very fast growth.</p><p>Just in the past 12 months, if you look at the last day of OpenWorld last year to today, we added 2,181 total new SaaS customers split between customer experience, human capital, and enterprise resource planning. If you look at our ERP number of 263 it's more than 2.5 times the other vendor who just published their number last week of 100. And these are not just customers that have come from the acquired products; these are also customers that have come from the organically built Fusion SaaS products.</p><p>So if you look just between last OpenWorld and this OpenWorld, we've added new Fusion SaaS customer experience, human capital, and ERP. All of the ERP customers by the way are Fusion customers because that's the only ERP offering we have. We didn't acquire anything in ERP. And we have 5.4 million new Fusion SaaS users. This is 5.4 million new users added between last OpenWorld, the last day of last OpenWorld and today. So, we're obviously growing very quickly.</p><p>And if you look at how efficient we are operationally, in Q1 of fiscal year 2015, which is the last three months, we added 7,500 virtual servers, 45 additional petabytes of data, 6,700 new environments, and 655,000 additional weekly users and we only added 40 people. So as we get scale because our operations are so highly automated, I think you'll see that things look better and better.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>EDITOR: So we wanted, similarly, to invite three customers up to come and talk about their experience with our cloud: Paul Cardell, Vice President of Corporate Operations of CTDI. Paul, please come up. Patrick Benson, Chief Information Officer of Ovation Brands, and Aaron de Los Reyes from Cognizant, please come up. Nice to see you (multiple speakers).</p><p>Please have a seat. Thank you for coming. So, it's lovely to have you. So Paul, can you tell people what CTDI does briefly and then how you use our EPM Cloud service?</p><p>PAUL CARDELL, VP, CORPORATE OPERATIONS, CTDI: CTDI is a telecommunications service company. We do engineering, test, repair and logistics services for the phone companies, cable companies and the equipment manufacturers that make the products deployed in those networks.</p><p>What we plan to use the EPM Hyperion Cloud solution for is to support what has historically been one of CTDI's primary business management practices. We've been in business for about 40 years and have started with a single operation. And the founder of our company had a philosophy that he wanted to know how the business performed every day.</p><p>So, from the early stages of CTDI starting, every day they forecasted the P&amp;L results of the operations. Over the last 40 years, that's grown from one operation to 70 operations around the world. But the business management practice of forecasting our P&amp;L, both revenue and expenses at the general ledger level, every day hasn't changed.</p><p>We've been doing that over the last 40 years through an increasingly complex network of linked spreadsheets with a lot of manual data entry. And across our operations around the world, we have about 150 people that spend a good portion of their day first extracting data from our back office systems, and then inputting that data manually into those spreadsheets. It all rolls up and then we report how the corporation did previous day.</p><p>Our plan is to use the Hyperion Cloud service solution to replace that manual process with one that's integrated, that is directly linked into our back office systems, so the data can be automatically uploaded as opposed to manually entered. And then it will speed both the time required to do the process each day as well as accuracy of the data, because it will be a direct link between our financial systems and the forecasts that we use to monitor our business on a daily basis.</p><p>So we are looking for this to save us a lot of time and also improve our results, as well as give us the time to use the data, analyze the data as opposed to just report the data.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: Thank you, thank you Paul. Patrick, can you tell people about Ovation Brands and what you use in our Cloud?</p><p>PATRICK BENSON, CIO, OVATION BRANDS: Sure, absolutely. Ovation Brands is the US's largest buffet restaurant chain. We have about 350 locations across the United States. It started about 30 years ago and had explosive growth up until 2006, when things imploded, couldn't sustain sales. The company filed for bankruptcy not once, but twice.</p><p>I'm part of a new leadership team that was brought in in 2012 by our owners to really reinvent that business. What I inherited and what we are using the cloud for is to replace our outdated complete infrastructure that we have, both from an applications as well as from a hardware standpoint. None of it was supported, very much outdated.</p><p>We are looking from the bottom up at all of our processes and really we are looking for something that was built on leading practices that we could take advantage of, to help inform our business and be able to follow that and use that as the guide star as we deliver a new system and a new suite of solutions for the business. We're currently implementing ERP Cloud and HCM Cloud in rapid succession from a July -- I'm sorry, a June 4 kickoff, six weeks later we were already active and up and running in our conference room pilot one. And we're in the middle of conference room pilot two, headed for a Valentine's Day implementation for both ERP and HCM.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: Thank you, Patrick. So you found the value not just that you could use the system without having to run it, itself, but also that you could then focus on some of the business transformation, new business processes, etc., similar to what Paul was talking about with what they're doing with financial management?</p><p>PATRICK BENSON: Absolutely. It lets us focus our internal energies and internal IT towards being business partners and actually delivering and understanding and advising and helping our business, and really partnering with Oracle to really become the technical heavyweights to actually use technology to transform and reinvent our business.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: Thank you, Patrick. Aaron, you lead the Oracle Practice for Cognizant, one of the fastest growing system integrators and solution providers the world. Can you tell people what got you interested in the Oracle Cloud Platform-as-a-Service?</p><p>AARON DE LOS REYES, SENIOR DIRECTOR, ORACLE TECHNOLOGY PRACTICE, COGNIZANT: Great, thank you very much. Cognizant has a very diverse set of clients. We operate in over 100 geographies and our Oracle practice has been growing compounded about 50% year for the last dozen years. And we have a very diverse set of requirements on the PaaS side and on the infrastructure side and also in the traditional ERP spaces. And we saw clients who struggled with bringing up instances, environments to do everything from sandbox all the way through DR.</p><p>So we looked at these platforms holistically and said, well, if we can start consuming them internally as a customer, we're a very large customer, and then we can actually create best practices. We can turn those time frames of provisioning down, and running and packaging those together that normally take maybe weeks, months, sometimes never and turn it into hours and days.</p><p>And so what we have internally, I have basically a tiger team that every time Oracle comes out with either a partner release or market release that we'll go live within seven days internally, and then look to trigger that as offering to the market to our downstream clients whether internally or externally.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: Interesting; so you're looking at the Oracle Cloud platform not just for internal use at Cognizant, but also to offer that to customers as part of your solution portfolio?</p><p>AARON DE LOS REYES: Absolutely, and what we've done is really seen the development of a service management model as really Cognizant is just another big customer of our own Oracle practice. And we just provide the same tier 1 services and we just use and launch the service capabilities internally first, and then spin them out to the marketplace.</p><p>And what we're trying to do is really package not just the platforms and the services, but a whole SLA-driven tiered level service that you might have, whereas a large company North America that wants Tier 1, when they expand maybe into another geography they only want a Tier 2 service. We blend that together and get it out the door in days or maybe few weeks, which obviously in go to markets now, that's revenue.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: And when we spoke as part of your decision-making process, you were looking at a variety of different cloud providers. One of the things that got -- there were two things that seemed to get your attention. One is that the breadth of the platform that we offer, which means you have essentially one-stop shopping. And then second is this portability between cloud and your on-premise skills with Exadata and other systems. Can you tell them a little bit what you found there?</p><p>AARON DE LOS REYES: Absolutely, so we're a very large client of Exadata and Exalogic internally, running all our PeopleSoft, all our systems. So we came up with, in essence, a hybrid hosted cloud offering where we coexists engineered systems across the whole Oracle stack and all the Oracle Cloud products simultaneously, and were able to create a tiered service catalog. So you can dynamically move up and down based on demand, price, priority, geos, contracting business, expanding business.</p><p>And it allows us to really take a portfolio approach with clients both internally and externally. And we see that is really going forward the dominant approach, because you can scale up your business and you get a utility like flavor. But you also have Tier 1 capability when your business truly expands.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: Thank you, Aaron. Patrick, one of the questions that's been common that we see a lot of people asking us is in the cloud, don't people put ERP in one cloud, HR in another cloud and CRM in a different cloud? You guys have chosen ERP HR in one place. One of the customers, the many who have now started picking ERP CRM HR, multiple piece of the Oracle portfolio -- what value do you guys find, business process wise, data retention and other reasons why to do that?</p><p>PATRICK BENSON: Gosh, there are so many, not the least of which is access to real-time information across all of those systems for our entire enterprise, not just from a financial standpoint but also from an HCM standpoint, as well as we're also Micro's Symphony customers. So we also now have that integration or happy accident. We're 2/3 of the way rolled out throughout all of our stores with Micro Symphony.</p><p>So, the native inorganic integration, all the way to our stores really extends the value of that entire information chain into the stores and lets our operations actually take advantage of the real-time data. That's really one of the most important aspects of it.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: That's a lot of your employees, frankly, are store employees at some point. So your HR system being integrated with your retail systems helps you, as an example?</p><p>PATRICK BENSON: Yes, absolutely. It's seamless, it's speed. It also has really accelerated the adoption, I'll say, because everything behaves and acts very similarly. It has a very similar presentation that is quite familiar. So the change management is really eased tremendously by having everything that is under one umbrella, if you will.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: And then Paul, when we spoke, one of the things you told me which struck me, given I'm an engineer, is I'm not a technical guy. How did our guys -- we often get the question how are your guys, how is Oracle's sales team reaching out to business people? Because your CFO said I don't know anything about technology. You said I don't want to know about the technology. I just want it to run. How did our guys do?</p><p>PAUL CARDELL: Well, the Oracle team that we worked with really spent a lot of time listening to what we needed them for. As opposed to a lot of companies that are going to use the Hyperion products to do either quarterly or monthly or annual budgeting and forecasting, CTDI was going to use it for everyday. So we really wanted to make sure that the solution was robust, because as I said, that's one of our primary business practices.</p><p>We can't have that system down for a day. We have to report on our financial results. We've done it every day for 39.5 years. So they really listened to what we needed and understood that it was an uptime requirement that every day we have to do the reporting.</p><p>And then, ultimately, they convinced us because when I went to our CEO and our COO -- and our CEO is one of the founders, and he was there when it was one location -- told him that we were going to change what has been the practice for 40 years. They basically said Oracle has to show us how this is going to work. If we are going to make that kind of fundamental change in one of our business practices, they have to show us it will work.</p><p>And the team we worked with actually built a prototype using actual data from one of CTDI's operations from earlier this year, has been working with one -- my financial analyst, put that together and that's what we demonstrated to our executive suite, our divisional teams to show that it would work. And that's what made the sale.</p><p>THOMAS KURIAN: Thank you again, all of you for coming. And thank you for being customers. We really appreciate it (multiple speakers). Thank you.</p><p>So just to close, we've always said that one of the things about the Cloud is it allows us to take our software and give it to all the people in the world who want to use our software, but not run our software. And there are many, many more people in the world who want to use Oracle software and have the skills to run Oracle software. Whether they happen to be in lines of business of big companies, in countries where there's a demand for IT but there's not skills in operating IT, and here you heard from three customers talking about their experience with it.</p><p>presentation</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA, EVP OF ORACLE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT, ORACLE CORPORATION: Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. So I'm going to cover, first, HCM; give you an idea of the product update, what we see as our key strengths in the product and then differentiators. I'll have a customer panel for the HCM, very similar to what Thomas has had, to give you their experience in our HCM cloud business; and then do the same for our customer experience set of products afterwards.</p><p>Okay. Again, to reiterate what Thomas said, for full context, the HCM suite of applications is part of our overall suite that includes HCM, ERP and CRM, or customer experience set of applications; built on not only the same technology set, same platform, but sharing the same database, same data structure; on the same Platform-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service capability, which affords customers the ability to not only today, be able to run multiple pillars together -- as was just described by Ovation, running ERP and HCM and CRM together -- but also the ability to start in HCM, and expand at the time that they see fit.</p><p>Within our HCM applications, we believe it's a full and most comprehensive suite of HCM applications on the market today, bar none. This includes global human resources, which I'll drill down on what we mean by global, very explicitly, because I think it's an important differentiator or distinction from any other competitor. Workforce reward -- so this is talent management capability for performance reviews, appraisals, goals, et cetera.</p><p>Workforce management -- that includes things like time and labor and absences. So it's critical if you get into unionized industries, or if you get into European countries that have particular labor laws and rules for tracking time, regulations on how we have to take or not take or allocate vacations.</p><p>Talent management, which includes recruiting as well as learning management, for both regulatory industries and other corporate environments for learning. And then social. And key here is that social completely embedded into the applications, not just social collaborations as an add-on. And probably the most explicit example where that becomes critical -- and, in fact, I would argue today, it's already table stakes in HR with social integrated, is in recruiting.</p><p>So it's a very simple example. If you have today in recruiting -- pretty much any industry, any corporation, their number one leads for recruiting are internal referrals.</p><p>With social, and our social integration recruiting, when you post a job requisition or a job opening, any employee in the enterprise is allowed to share that automatically through their social streams of Twitter or Facebook or Google Plus, to all of their constituents or their friends or followers there. And then we track the responses. So that if you have things like employee incentives to do recruiting, that is a capability automatically built in and tracked for that reward.</p><p>So that doesn't sound like anything that's out of the ordinary, something that's table stakes today. If you look at anybody looking for a job today, they are looking at job boards, they are looking at Twitter, they are looking through their friends. And any corporation, that's their number one and most reliable source for external talent, is employee referrals. But without the ability to embed social, not just chat, into the HCM applications, you don't have that capability -- so it's kind of table stakes -- to expand a recruiting suite of applications.</p><p>Again, all built on a single set. All key on a universal employee master. So you'll notice Thomas talked about our uptake in terms of overall customers through acquisitions, as well as our fusion applications. So on the HCM space, we had our fusion applications we've prebuilt. And we augmented that with Taleo recruiting and acquisition.</p><p>But today, refer to it as a collection as a HCM cloud -- a complete HCM cloud, because we've taken that Taleo infusion components, we've done the integration -- single sign-on, single technology stack -- with a unified customer master, so our customers don't need to integrate the different cloud aspects. It's a unified, complete cloud management system, which takes the best-in-class features that we had from Taleo and integrates that with the best-in-class features we've built into HR.</p><p>So, some key capabilities with HR. First off, for context, we have thousands of customers and many of the opportunities that we have out there today in HCM. It's a rare case where somebody doesn't already have an HCM system going forward -- or to start with. So, one key capability we offer is flexibility into deployment as far as how you get to the cloud.</p><p>And generally speaking, we offer and recommend to our customers three distinct paths. First is the capability to start and deploy talent management in the cloud, and integrate back to a core HR system of record on-premise. So example, many of our customers will take recruiting or talent management compensation, move that to our cloud, and with our prebuilt integration, continue to maintain their core HR and payroll in PeopleSoft.</p><p>Second step -- which could be joined for some customers, because they take talent management recruiting compensation as well as core HR -- move that to the cloud, and integrate back to an on-premise payroll system or a third-party provider system at other parts of the world.</p><p>And then third would be where you do the entire suite migration together -- talent management, core HR, and payroll to the cloud. And this flexibility is a core driver that we can go to all of our existing customers and new customers to get them the flexibility to move to the cloud when the timing makes sense for them, and where they get business value for each particular component, and that meets with their timeframes.</p><p>The next part is it's talent-centric. If you look at where the value is today, much of the value in core HR is not just in the records management. Of course, our core HR have the ability -- has things to have work charts and titles and their job codes, et cetera, et cetera. But key to it is managing their talent.</p><p>It's everything from finding the right talent -- again, through recruiting, including social recruiting; compliance on recruiting -- so if you have things in the United States, for example, you have to recruit and show that you've put out certain interviews to different classes of employees, or have recruits from different areas, et cetera -- but on through into one set of employee as onboarded, having a seamless employee experience, to set goals for that employee, track containment of those goals, and then with business analytics and prediction, feed that right back.</p><p>So, for example, some of our customers who are in retail, they have a annualized cycle for retail and recruiting, which basically means they ramp up staff for the busy Christmas season and then they ramp down staff subsequently. A big component of their HR system is how they do the interview process during that critical time right before Christmas to ramp up the staff.</p><p>With integrated recruiting as well as talent management, when the staff comes onboard for Christmas, they evaluate that staff going forward. Those who score well, who are good employees during that Christmas season, they also have the employee's social handle. They can then publish through social the subsequent year. And, in a sense, the next year, instead of having to interview everyone all over again, they take the employees who did best, they send them feeds through their Twitter or Facebook approach for new employment the subsequent year, and they substantially cut down on their interview cycle in the next Christmas season.</p><p>And they substantially increase the effectiveness of their employees, because they're only publishing that to their most effective employees. So the tight integration between recruiting, talent management, core HR and social, together with the business intelligence, gives a closed-loop, heavy-value-add proposition to customers beyond what you might think of as classic HR recordkeeping, if you will.</p><p>The next is modern user experience. So, hopefully, some of you have gotten a chance to see both our UI from last year and our UI from this year. So we feel very strongly that our user interface across HR is best-in-class. But probably more important than best-in-class today is the speed at which we are able to improve the user interface, not only in the browser, but in mobile capabilities.</p><p>And I think one thing that's not very well-understood is the importance in that speed of the technology platform and why we make such a big deal on building on standards today. Because when we built fusion applications for V1 several years ago, we built with Java standard supporting HTML and HTML 5. At the time we were building that, just in the mobile device capability, for example, the primary mobile devices for dominant market share was BlackBerry and iPhone.</p><p>Android did not exist as an operating system on the market today, and tablets did not exist; much less the different tablets that are there today that multiple flavors now for Windows Surface, et cetera. We were able to improve our UIs not by rewriting UIs from one technology to the other, but because we picked standard to build the interfaces, standard Java, standard HTML, we knew that those user -- those technologies would run on the most modern user interfaces. And so we were able to deploy a build-once/deploy-many methodology, so that we very quickly had the same product running on iOS, Android, and now, as the Windows Surface starts to take hold, Windows Surface.</p><p>And as things continue to change beyond with tablets to wearable devices or the watches, whatever the next device that may come, we feel extraordinarily confident, based on history, that by basing it on standards, the new devices will run those standards, and we're going to be quickest to market in terms of best-in-class user interface today, as well as whatever the market may bring for standards going forward. And then, for some innovation, we've added to our core HR applications what we call Work/Life applications, which are basically gamification type of apps in HR.</p><p>So, allowing your HR department to do things; to integrate with like the fit bit devices, to do employee rewards for how many employees. We actually ran a contest at this session here at Open World in our HR track, where we gave out prizes and tracked the leaderboard using our own applications of who took the most steps in the conference, and other health-type-related items, which is increasingly important for two reasons.</p><p>One, as a new millennial workforce enters the workplace and the corporate workplace, they are looking for a more complete experience in terms of not only work, but Work/Life balance; and two, for the employee, for the corporate, kind of encouraging these type of things in Work/Life balance as well as health, is a substantial reduction as far as healthcare costs -- again, something not commonly thought of as common within HR.</p><p>Now differentiators. I talked about the complete suite. I mentioned I was going to talk a little bit more about the broadest capabilities in terms of country support. And I think what's important to understand in core HR, particularly when you talk to any other vendors in the cloud space, is when we say we support the countries above, it's a couple different dimensions.</p><p>What most people talk about is what I would consider table stakes. We translate into a little bit over two dozen different languages. We support multiple different date formats. So in Europe, they put the day before the month or vice versa. We, of course, have multi-currency. So you can do raises and run payroll in multiple different currencies.</p><p>We support global operations. So that means when -- if I'm in the United States, I can view your salary in US dollars; but if I have an employee who happens to work in China, obviously, and a manager who works in China, they see the employee's currency in the dollar or the currency amount that makes most sense to them visually. So those are kind of table stakes areas.</p><p>But in HR, where we believe we are far and away the leader, is in global compliance. So these are rules and regulations that different countries set for HR. So, in other words, in the United States, if you hire somebody, you are allowed to collect certain types of information -- whether it's type of information about marital status that you may need for benefits, or health status for benefits.</p><p>In Europe, you're allowed to collect different sets of information; in some cases, mandated to collect different sets of information. Now the people who can see that information varies. As a benefits administrator, you may be able to see lots of information about the employee beyond their work criteria. However, as a manager of that employee, you are not allowed to see that type of information, because you can't have that influence your management.</p><p>So that has one complexity to it, which is -- by the way, those regulations are constantly changing. And when you are running a global environment, they're really constantly changing, because every country has a different time period in which those rules and regulations change. So we have a dedicated staff from our history of development in this space that keeps up with those. Further complicating the issue, if you are a global organization like ourselves, where I am a manager in the United States but I have employees around the world, all of a sudden, we have people in Europe who they're allowed to collect certain information, that if they were an employee in the United States, we couldn't even collect.</p><p>And so we have to have the flexibility and the legal requirements there to comply with the fact that I can see certain parts of information, payroll needs to know other parts of information, the benefits administrator may see a third part of that information, all of which in a global nature, and in a global world that we live in, if that person happens to transfer from one country to the next, we have to make sure to comply with not only the data privacy issues, but all the regulations I just talked about before. So that is what we feel as beyond table stakes for global capabilities. And we support basically every country in the world with statutory requirements, as well as the ability to extend those statutory requirements.</p><p>I talked a little bit about the social network integration, as well as predictive analytics when I went into my talent management example. So, in terms of momentum, a little bit of subset to what Thomas said. In terms of total customers in our cloud today, we have over 5,000 customers total; over 900 of them are new -- and by new, we classify over the last year, basically, since last Open World Today.</p><p>To give you some context to that scale, we have over 4 million job openings that are posted in our recruiting cloud today with over 450 million candidate records. So these are people who have applied for jobs whose candidate record is in our cloud through job applications. And then for speed of innovation across our cloud platforms, we've had over 10 releases over the last year, bringing faster and faster innovation in all dimensions that I talked about to our customer base.</p><p>And here is a subset of the customers that we have on our HCM cloud. You'll see, and you'll notice in just a moment, from the very largest to some of the smaller companies, global companies as well as local companies in just about every country in the world.</p><p>I'd like to invite the panelists -- didn't see where they were -- to join me on stage. So first, let me introduce Melissa Fuller. Melissa Fuller joins us from National Instruments. She is their HR IT Manager.</p><p>Next is Adhir Mattu. Adhir is a Vice President and CIO from PMC, or PMC-Sierra. And then we have Daryl Szebesta -- thats the best I can do, Daryl, okay? -- who is the CIO and Group MD of BT or British Telecom. Thank you. Thank you all for joining us.</p><p>So, let me start here with you, Melissa. So, obviously, the audience definitely knows about National Instruments and what you do. But I wonder, could you give some context into your role and kind of the HR perspectives, so talk about the HR cloud -- you know, how many employees, countries, kind of the profile for National Instruments, and set the context.</p><p>MELISSA FULLER, HR IT MANAGER, NATIONAL INSTRUMENTS: Absolutely. And so as you mentioned, I'm the HR IT Manager, and I am in charge of the technical side of managing the systems for HR platform. And the landscape at NI we're in -- 7,100 employees over 40 countries; three major manufacturing facilities globally. And we are headquartered in Austin, Texas. And we are growing. We are a $1.1 billion company and have double-digit growth. And we have for a very long time.</p><p>So, our landscape is changing. And the challenges for HR just get steeper and steeper every year.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: So it's an interesting ratio too, a number of employees to number of countries. So a lot of broad compliance with maybe not a lot of ability to have HR support in all those countries. And (multiple speakers) --</p><p>MELISSA FULLER: Right.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Yes. Do you have (multiple speakers) --</p><p>MELISSA FULLER: I'm sorry.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Okay. Adhir, can you have the similar with -- again, PMC-Sierra, I think most people -- everybody is familiar with the Company; some background on the HR part of things.</p><p>ADHIR MATTU, VP AND CIO, PMC-SIERRA: Sure. So PMC, we have a fabless semiconductor company. And I think everybody knows these days what big data is all about. So when you talk about big data, you know, you store big data in servers and storage, and there are networks involved. You're transferring big data between data centers, so there's network involved.</p><p>All of us carry smartphones and tablets, and these days, phablets. So, all that data gets transferred over the mobile networks, so big data is involved. So what PMC does is basically we are innovating and transforming those networks by designing and manufacturing and supplying chips in those areas. So, very, very exciting growth potential for PMC.</p><p>Now in terms of our overall size, we are about 1,500 employees globally. We are close to 18 countries. And that number keeps on changing, depending on M&amp;A's and those kind of things. Now, a very, very high percentage of our employee work force is engineers. Very, very smart people; PSG's.</p><p>We develop very complex chips. I mean, some of our chips have like 350 million gates on one single die. So, obviously, from an HR perspective to what we wanted to do is ensure that we empowered our HR business partners, so that we can automate most of the manual transactions and processes, and give them more time to focus on more strategic business objectives.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: So, for some context for the audience, when Adhir answers a few comments and questions, when he talks about engineers who are using our system and software, that's a category of people who all think of as the most, let's say, feedback on what our software should do. (laughter) So keep that in mind (multiple speakers) --.</p><p>ADHIR MATTU: Trust me, we get that feedback often.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: (laughter) For BT -- again, well-known global company. You give us the size and the HR perspective from British Telecom?</p><p>DARYL SZEBESTA, CIO AND GROUP MD, BRITISH TELECOM: Sure, yes. We, British Telecom, we operate in over 170 countries. We have roughly 90,000 employees and probably half as many again third parties; third-party partner workers. Large number of engineers, actual field engineers as well.</p><p>We serve all sectors with all types of service, say, small businesses, consumers, right through to our competitors actually. Within the UK, we are highly regulated. We have Open Reach, which is the last-mile provider for the UK, essentially.</p><p>From an HR perspective, we are -- well, we're transforming as a business, launching new services, multimedia services, et cetera, and transforming away from traditional telco-type products. And within HR, we are transforming the model from one which is a high-touch HR business partner model to more of a shared service center, self-help kind of capability. So that everyone gets. So, we are going through that transition, and transitioning platforms at the same time.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Yes. Well, 90,000 employees and half as many partners and affiliates, you almost have to, right? You can't scale to anything but self-service.</p><p>DARYL SZEBESTA: Yes. Yes. Absolutely.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Melissa, maybe you can talk about -- I think some people maybe think about HR as kind of a record-keeping part, but can you give us some of the business challenges or opportunities? And what was National Instruments really looking to do as you deployed the HCM cloud from Oracle to business opportunities? What was a kind of business driver behind it?</p><p>MELISSA FULLER: Well, as I mentioned, we have -- we also have a lot of engineers. But we are really growing. And we are getting increasing demand from the business to provide information and provide services that, in our old platform, our big EDS shop, and we had Oracle HR there. Even with our very, very limited team, resource team, we couldn't do it.</p><p>We couldn't -- we weren't agile enough. We couldn't navigate through our EPS platform to do it. So it was our real opportunity to meet the needs of the business in a way that our very small team can deliver it up to them in a meaningful way that's mobile and with them, and doesn't require a lot of technical coating, a lot of process to get it out there. So this is a big opportunity for us.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Could you maybe give the audience some context on the timing of how things went moving from non-premise to the cloud type applications?</p><p>MELISSA FULLER: Yes. So, absolutely. So from RFP to go-live was about 14 months, I think? About, give or take. And our actual implementation was about 12 of that. So, it was -- we had a lot of -- we were coming from three HR systems and consolidating, and transforming our data at the same time. So this is the biggest part of our challenge.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Consolidating three to one, getting to an agile system, changing business practice --</p><p>MELISSA FULLER: Yes.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: -- twelve months, and then on-premise cloud.</p><p>MELISSA FULLER: Yes.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Impressive. Adhir, how about PMC? The business challenges, business drivers. And I think also, you may have another -- be another customer who's looking for an expansion, meaning beyond HCM. You want to talk about kind of your thought process as a CIO, a broader perspective, what was the business challenges and why consider Oracle cloud?</p><p>ADHIR MATTU: Absolutely. So, like I mentioned earlier, our Company is seeing a lot of potential in growth because of all these big data and all these new technologies which are out there. So, obviously, Company is growing. And then they look at IT and say, okay, so what are you guys going to do to help us scale?</p><p>So, I think from as far as scalability of systems and processes, and those kind of things, these are, these days, par for the course. These you had to do. But -- and then, obviously, I think, as we all know, cloud technologies that help you get scalability, flexibility, quickness and implementations, and PCUs and all these good things.</p><p>So, we do have a digital blueprint in terms of digital transformation. And as part of that, we also sat down with our HR folks, and we have HR transformation, I think that's the word these days in there. So we got that figured out.</p><p>And then what we said was, okay, as part of this deployment, what we want to do is, we want to, like I said earlier, we want to enable our HR business partners with actionable intelligence. I know that's a highly loaded word, but what that means is make your transactions automated, put workflows in place, so that you are not spending your time on manual things; but giving insight into the business, how it works. So that we can -- like I said earlier, we have -- all of us have engineers; we can retain top talent, and we can basically help business grow.</p><p>We can, because a lot of times, we have a number of R&amp;D projects going on. So, it's quicker. We can source engineers and put them on the projects. So that actually helps the Company.</p><p>And then being in the semiconductor business, as I think many of you know, there's a lot of consolidations, M&amp;A's, and those kind of things happening all the time. So one of the things for us was that whenever we acquire a Company, or whenever we develop a new product that is supposed to win a new market, do that very, very quick.</p><p>And the last thing I want is IT to be a bottleneck to make that happen. So that was another thing that we wanted to ensure that we have cloud systems, and particularly SEM, that can enable us to do that. And we know, obviously, business continuity, security, compliance we want to ensure that we've got that.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Scale, global solutions, speed of business intelligence, and then business continuity. (multiple speakers)</p><p>ADHIR MATTU: (multiple speakers) Exactly, exactly. And I know many companies have these distributed standalone system. So what we wanted to also do, and that's very important, have an end-to-end integrated system. Because that helps you get analytics quickly.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Daryl, implementing cloud or any HR system and cloud HR system for 90,000-plus employees across the globe. Can you maybe give the audience -- again, what were the business drivers behind that? And then I think, importantly, how you start thinking about a project like that, and the different steps along the way in moving that type of organization, size and scale to the cloud?</p><p>DARYL SZEBESTA: Yes, absolutely. So as we transform as a business, we need to bring in new talent and develop the talent we've already got. Our model was very inconsistent, nonstandard processes across the world. And as a consequence, heavily customized on-premise solution, PeopleSoft actually. So we had something like 114,000 customized elements in our platform, which made it almost impossible to allow us to change.</p><p>The intent was to change our model, our HR model, to be more modern-day in terms of the practices, but also standard across the world. And without transforming to a car-based solution, that would've been impossible. The way we embarked on that, and this is critical to success, is having a very close relationship with our HR colleagues.</p><p>It's not an IT program; it's a business program. It's a business transformation program. And one of the key things in terms of moving to cloud is ensuring -- that's an obvious statement -- but ensuring the processes are rich enough and supported by the platform, so it's configuration of in development.</p><p>So -- and that's where we embarked, really, is around standardization processes, what we wanted the processes to look like. And to a large extent, we took the out-of-the-box ones from fusion, applied those to the organization. And from that point on, was derived the ability to configure. So that's fundamentally the approach we took.</p><p>And as a consequence, it's not just a good thing to do; it makes big financial sense for us, as there is a lot of wastage from the HR community people doing a large percentage of repetitive transactional tasks rather than adding value. So it's allowing us to transform the HR community to actually helping people rather than just generating reports of speculative strength.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: It was costing you more to actually go slower? (multiple speakers)</p><p>DARYL SZEBESTA: Yes. I mean, yes, absolutely. We worked out probably in excess of 40% of people's time was just doing mundane transactional tasks. In order to create an end-and-end people report, given the complexity of our organization, it took 18 days of manual effort, which is majorly out of date. So, it will be the press of a button going forwards. And we're fully integrating it with a similar finance transformation, so it will be end-to-end and consistent.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Now did you say 100 PeopleSoft customizations, or --?</p><p>DARYL SZEBESTA: 114,000.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: So does this give you a sense of -- for the scale and the breadth, so it went from 114,000 PeopleSoft customizations (multiple speakers) at a 90,000-person-plus company --</p><p>DARYL SZEBESTA: Yes.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: -- to the HCM cloud. So that -- you can ignore everything I said about the depth and the breadth and just take that as the testimony to it.</p><p>DARYL SZEBESTA: Well, we did a compliance of fusion functionality against our bespoked system, and it was the high 90% match in terms of functionality. So, yes, it was a no-brainer in terms of the choice for us.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: That's great. Maybe just in time -- just a final -- you've been live; you had it running; what's the feedback? How are you on your path to achieving the business objectives you had for making the transition to Oracle cloud? And how has it been working with Oracle, as opposed to working in the on-premise world -- you've been a ABS customer for a while; you've worked for a development team. Maybe you can describe some of the changes and the results?</p><p>MELISSA FULLER: Sure. So, as you mentioned, we've been live since Q1 of this year. And with our go-live, we also implemented the shared service center. So we went from about 100 folks doing HR data entry globally to down to five.</p><p>So, in addition to scrubbing our data and getting it in there nice and pretty and clean, we also have a team of people that's dedicated to keeping it that way for us. And so as a result, we've been able to make really dramatic improvements to give the business, which is one of our big goals, is give the business the data they need when they need it.</p><p>Before we started down this journey, we were three instances, as I mentioned, it would take two weeks to get a headcount report, which I learned is actually pretty fast for some companies. (laughter) So -- but this was very slow for us. So we were less than 100 people globally in HR. So that was a very long time to take two people down for two weeks.</p><p>Post-go-live, almost instantly we took the headcount down to about one day, and now we are down to a couple hours -- one person, a couple of hours to do it. So this is a big deal for us, and our VP is extraordinarily happy about it.</p><p>You know, it's -- overall, weve been able to streamline our processes, and really being -- people ask us for data, we can literally turn around and do it really quickly -- in a very meaningful way, so there's not a lot of data transformations.</p><p>And the second part of your question --?</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: How has it been working with the development group in the cloud and it was different (multiple speakers) --</p><p>MELISSA FULLER: Oh, perfect.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: It's been perfect. (laughter)</p><p>MELISSA FULLER: Oh, no. (laughter) (multiple speakers)</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Yes. Done.</p><p>MELISSA FULLER: (multiple speakers) No, no -- I got lost in my revelry of reporting. It's been really amazing. And I will say we struggled -- and a lot of the promise was, we'll help you get through us, we'll help you through this. And as a ABS customer, this was a really hard thing for us to recognize. But we had really excellent partners to guide us through, saying -- when you are stuck, you have to ask us. This is the cloud, you have to ask us. We appreciate you love doing the things yourself, but this is different now.</p><p>And everyone -- every promise that every place that we've been offered help, we've gotten it. And it's really enabled our success so far. It's been an amazing journey. and we've had amazing partnership above and beyond that we ever thought we would get.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Great. I want to thank you all for being our customers and partnership through this transformation you are all doing. And thank you all for being here today. Appreciate it.</p><p>presentation</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: So I'm going to shift gears to CX, or what we call our customer experience and CRM, once again part of the complete portfolio of applications. And our CX in the cloud or customer experience in the cloud is inclusive of marketing, sales, configured price quote, e-commerce, service, social and a marketplace. Again, based on the same common foundation platform as a service -- the same accessibility, the same infrastructure service to the extent of the application.</p><p>Now, before I get into the details of not only the footprint of what we think is a distinction, I think I want to make a point. So, what is commonly covered in the CRM or customer experience space is, of course, the big transformation to the cloud. And from a software perspective, this is definitely the leading set of applications that have moved to the cloud. But what I think is underappreciated and why we believe that is our strength is in the complete end-to-end suite, including social and data as a service, is over the last several years, fundamentally the way we buy, sell, service and market our goods and services has changed dramatically.</p><p>And I'll give you all kind of a personal example, if you will, that I hope you don't face in the next couple of days, but unfortunately some of you likely will. So, you are at an airport and your flight gets delayed. What used to happen? Your flight gets delayed, or flight gets canceled -- even worse. You used to have to call the airline. Inevitably, that phone call would be longer than normal wait times. You are on hold for the wait time and then you try to surface through that interaction.</p><p>More and more today, you are at that airport -- I would actually encourage ,you personal advice -- to not call your airline of choice, but instead to go to your Twitter and to tweet them, because you will get a much, much faster response because what airlines are especially sensitive to is that customer service and perception. While you may be on hold for five minutes, that's a pain that you feel and you alone feel on the phone.</p><p>What they had found is in the Twitter universe, not only when you put a delay on your Twitter, you get the bad experience, but anybody who happens to be following you -- all of your friends or colleagues also get that bad experience. By contrast, when they respond quickly they notice that they get better scores on customer experience going forward.</p><p>Now let's explore what happens behind the scenes. They respond to your Twitter question, they route you to their website, you rebook the flight. Okay, all goodness there, so what's happening behind the scenes? First part is service.</p><p>So customer service has changed from what used to be call centers only. Then they became knowledge management centers, so you would route them to your website and you would search for flights, etc., to now what is called listening centers because you didn't call them. You posted something -- a complaint, an issue on a social network, and its listening centers -- and responding in the context of that listening center. That's been the fundamental change, number one.</p><p>But once you have contacted that customer, and if you went to their website, all of a sudden you will probably start to notice something else. If you went and looked and looked your flight on any kind of the website or you are shopping for a computer, what you will start to notice is that within 24 hours on your Facebook page or on your Twitter stream or in your email you will start getting advertisements. If you are flying back to New York you will get an advertisement for hotels in New York or car rentals in available in New York, or museums to go see in New York or plays that are available in New York.</p><p>That is no accident and it's no coincidence. What happens is they have your Twitter handle, you have gone to the website, they have a cookie. They have tracked your activity, so they have information about you to know where you are going, and they market to you.</p><p>This is changed from what used to be spray and pray marketing -- basically they segment employee or populations of people and they try to send out advertisements and buy television ads and try to measure hit rates to very targeted, very digital marketing interactions. So, now, they sent the same type of interaction but they don't send it to a random set of people or a somewhat random set of people. They send it to someone that they know who is traveling, they know where you are going and, oh, by the way, they know your credit information. They know what other interest you might have going forward, so they take that and they personalize the offer directly to you.</p><p>So, what has changed there? Now, if they have a direct sales force -- so if you are a buyer for a business, in a business to business case -- not a business to consumer case, they can then take your response to those interactions. If you read the email, they can send you another email because you didn't click on it. You read it but you didn't do anything.</p><p>If you read the email and clicked on the offer, but went to their website and didn't do anything, they may actually have a direct sales person call you because they know they got some interest. So you can fine-tune and tailor an offering along the way. So our customer experience offering is not just sales force automation and contact management and cloud. Of course we have contact management in our sales force automated.</p><p>It's not just an ability for salespeople to enter their quota or their forecast in the cloud or manage their report on it. It is a comprehensive integrated set of applications that ties together service to marketing to sales, to feed that sales rep the precise point to contact you. And it integrates not only data that the company has, but third-party data and tracks you digitally on a go forward basis.</p><p>So it's our data to service, integrated with social, integrated with service, integrated with marketing, integrated with sales that fundamentally changes the way things do today. And you can see this today in your personal life.</p><p>Again -- if you want to experiment go to any website, shop for a PC or computer. Within the next 24 hours if not less -- nowadays probably less -- you will start to see those advertisements. That behind-the-scenes is very likely Oracle data as a service in the cloud, tracking you with cookies, and Oracle marketing as a service in the cloud sending you emails or allowing our customers to post advertisements.</p><p>As you interact with those advertisements, you will start to notice you get finer and finer, more granular and more precise marketing which, again, is our cloud marketing system integrating with that in going forward. In the context of a business-to-business you would see the same thing, and then with follow-up with a direct sales person in our sales cloud. That's what we think of as a customer experience.</p><p>So what do we believe are our key capabilities? First of all, to have all that, you have to have a unified view of the customer -- having marketing, sales, e-commerce, and service operate on the same definition of a customer including house-holding. So if you are in a family, we target the family as a whole unit, not as a distinct customer.</p><p>Complete and multichannel business-to-business as well as business to consumer marketing. By multichannel that's not only email, but that's display advertisements, that's advertisements on mobile if you have a mobile device going forward.</p><p>Role-based sales force automation that is not just quota management or forecast entry, but allows direct and channel sales to be able to operate with data which could give them better leads and have an engineered selling process to allow sales reps to be more effective, because still today the number one issue in sales force automation is getting the sales reps to actually use the system. Why? Because the systems up until now didn't help them sell.</p><p>By integrating those better leads and better marketing and better engineered selling, it helps salespeople sell. And if you help salespeople sell, they use the system better and you get better information going forward.</p><p>We have now integrated that with our CPQ which allows you to offer complex product bundles including pricing and contracts, best-in-class knowledge management. So, in the case where we still have to go to the web for a service request and search for an FAQ. Again, you've all done this in personal experience. You are looking for something, you search on the web, you rate the answer, that answer gets scored better -- it's called knowledge management, integrated with our service capabilities.</p><p>And we've taken all that customer experience and integrated it not only to the CRM components with each other, but tied it back to our ERP systems. Both ERP in the cloud that Thomas Kurian spoke of earlier this afternoon, as well as our on-premise systems. So if you run a CRM in the cloud and still have our ERP on premise, you have that integration so that orders flow through to the integration.</p><p>And then below it all, if you need to extend our customer experience applications, you extend that with a standard-based platform as a service. That means you do not have to rewrite any extensions you have had in your CRM systems today. It's simply a re-deployment of your existing database application or Java application, or any third-party application -- just as Larry Ellison showed you on his keynote on Tuesday.</p><p>So, some differentiators; again, many of our competitors have a standalone CRM component, but haven't had the pre-built integration between CRM and ERP. We think that's a critical piece. The whole goal with CRM is ultimately to get the customers to actually place orders. Once that order is placed, you need that integration for ERP, for fulfillment and billing and accounting, a critical component.</p><p>Powerful business analytics -- so the example here I kind of glossed over, in our sales force automation system we've introduced the concept of engineered selling. And it works as follows: when you have the capability of having better, more targeted leads in the sales system as I just described, you can then give the sales reps individual steps that you recommend they follow, because you have a very precise customer target you are going after.</p><p>What we do with that is we measure the effectiveness of those individual steps. And driven from those reports centrally, you can then remove steps, add steps, modify steps and learn from the selling process. So, as you have presentations or demonstrations or product discounts or product promotions, those that work in an engineered selling process you expand. And those that don't work, you contract or eliminate.</p><p>So, by having the data -- not only the better leads but then be able to engineer the selling process, you can start to fine-tune your sales process centrally through business analytics and offerings. We have the only cloud competitive market that offers both business-to-business as well as business to consumer capability, particularly in marketing. We have an integrated multichannel marketing, including sales intelligence tools across those.</p><p>Again, I talked about the simplified UI and the UI experience. The same thing I said for HCM holds true in CRM and CX. It's just magnified more because mobile is so much more of the default platform for sales, and then the highly differentiated cross-channel customer service.</p><p>Cross-channel -- that again means we can take the phone call if you have a service request. We can route you to the website through knowledge management for a service request, or we can do it through social listening in the different social platforms -- the same request can deal and interact with the customer cross-channel.</p><p>Our CX momentum -- this, again, over the last year we have over 4000 companies using our CX in the cloud. We added 1100 companies in CX over the last year. To give you an idea of the scale of some of our clouds, within our service request cloud or our service cloud -- so these are if you have problems or issues or questions for your vendor, we handle -- over the last year we handled over 2.3 billion service sessions annually. So these are kind of ticket service request across our service questions.</p><p>I talk about our marketing cloud, so this is the ability of the multichannel marketing and target -- very precise marketing to people. In 2013, our marketing cloud sent over 89 billion emails for targeted marketing on behalf of our customers for market. And that is precise targeted marketing, not kind of a random spray. Of course we operate in just about every country in the world for CX.</p><p>This is a list of the customers, and in this slide we've broken it down a little bit because in the customer experience area, so much of what you do varies. I mentioned B2B and B2C a couple of times, but it also varies across industry. Some industries are obviously much more heavily service oriented, so you have a service component coming in. Other industries are much more where e-commerce comes into play, with the B2C type of thing and you route them to e-commerce. Others have a direct sales force.</p><p>And you will see that we have strength in communications, financial services, manufacturing, automotive, high-tech, consumer goods and again -- once again, some of the biggest brand names in the world. Some of the most global companies in the world on down to relatively small customers as well.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: So, for this, from your left to right we have Jim Ferron. Jim is the principal customer experience and commerce architect for Nintendo. Jim has used our service cloud both now and in a previous role, which you will talk about.</p><p>We have Hayden Mugford. Hayden is a director in one-to-one marketing programs, nurturing and retention for Dell who has got some very interesting stories and uses a number of our marketing products. And then Ralph van Dijk. Ralph comes to us from Atradius. Ralph is the global commercial director using both our sales force automation and the sales force and marketing going forward. So, thank you very much. Welcome.</p><p>So, in this panel CX is a broad portfolio -- a broad portfolio of things. To set context we have kind of split it up for a little bit of service and a little bit of marketing and a little bit of sales. So Jim, start with service.</p><p>Can you give us -- everybody knows what Nintendo does, I'm pretty sure. But your role -- what does service mean at Nintendo? The type of service requests that come in and the kind of broader, give us some context of size and the scale of the service problem at Nintendo.</p><p>JIM FERRON, CONSUMER EXPERIENCE STRATEGIST, NINTENDO CO., LTD.: Sure. So, most people are familiar with the Nintendo brand -- we hope so. And Nintendo from a service perspective is actually undergoing a tremendous change in the interactions that we have with our customers. Previously -- and by previously I mean up until about 24 months ago -- most of our interactions had to do with technical support, troubleshooting for a connectivity issue or troubleshooting for a hardware problem for their home console or their had console -- gaming console.</p><p>But about 24 months ago, the nature of those contacts began to change, and they changed really for two reasons. One is that the complexity of the interconnectedness of the device changed dramatically. So it's gone from a simple troubleshooting process to a home network troubleshooting challenge.</p><p>But secondly, and probably more dramatically impactful to the team at Nintendo and the interactions with the customers, is that we are now the merchant record for many of the customers' digital purchases. The customers are shopping from their devices, purchasing digital products. And for the first time, they are swiping their card with Nintendo as the merchant record, which means the nature of the inquiries changes quite dramatically.</p><p>The other thing about that change is that it goes from what I'll call a many to one to a one-to-one type of scenario for service solution. In product troubleshooting one answer contained in a knowledge article satisfies the needs of many customers, once we identify what their challenge is.</p><p>But when you are talking about a service inquiry, the answer is now contained in a database record regarding that transaction. It's no longer served up easily by an article. So that's kind of some of the changes that have really caused us to take a look at the technologies we had and the methodologies we employ to determine what kind of platforms we needed moving forward.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: It's kind of interesting -- the device, if you will, has almost turned into what is a computer and it's turned into kind of the e-commerce console for a number of things now, for Nintendo. It's really broadened.</p><p>JIM FERRON: It has -- and a conduit for other things other than gaming as well. As video on demand grows in popularity, it's the entertainment device of the living room.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Exactly. Hayden, from your role as the one-to-one marketing program, maybe can you -- before describing the solutions, just give us a background -- size and scale. Again, Dell, I don't think we need any introduction, but size and scale of what Dell is doing with their customers and the challenges in one-to-one marketing and the ultimate goals you are trying to achieve?</p><p>HAYDEN MUGFORD, DIRECTOR, GLOBAL 1X1 MARKETING, DELL INC.: So, again, I think we are probably familiar with what Dell does as a brand. What we have really been focusing on is trying to become more of a solutions provider. And when you talk about moving from a transactional business that's very much send an offer and have some sort of transaction occur, how do you support a customer experience that lasts anywhere from 6 to 18 months? And how do you watch your customers consider, demonstrate behavior on multiple topics?</p><p>So we saw a variety of things. We can see behaviors where customers are researching storage, cloud, laptops, tablets and they are doing that across a variety of areas, all at the same time. We want to provide very targeted information back to them.</p><p>In terms of if we see a behavior demonstrated online with cloud, how do we respond to that versus if we see it off-line somewhere else, how do we respond to that? And when you talk about millions of customers and millions of behaviors being seen on a daily basis across the globe, finding scale in how you treat one-to-one communications is really important.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Okay. So you gave a little tease, and I just want to make sure to follow up on that part now, because you talked about following people both online activity, what they are interested in, and also off-line activity. Can you give a description of how that works and some of the components that you are using to do that?</p><p>HAYDEN MUGFORD: Sure. So we leverage Eloqua for lot of our triggered responses, leveraging both the online and off-line vehicles. So we have started -- not modifying, shifting the use of Eloqua to be a command center to deploy all of our go-to-market vehicles both online and off-line. We are also a big user of BlueKai, which helps us with audience creation in the online space with anonymous programmatic media buy-in, as well. So we are looking at behavior, capturing it in a variety of ways and then triggering out responses with dynamic content modules back out to those customers.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Yes. I had to change my example. I usually use actually the Dell example when I talk to customers on how to do it. I say, go to Dell's website, go shopping for something and you are going to see advertisements and targeted email precisely on what you target, because of Eloqua's use of both BlueKai tracking the data as well as the marketing commitments, so thanks for sharing that part.</p><p>Ralph, now you are a little bit different. Starting with sales and moving to sales and marketing, could you give folks the context of the size of the organization, what Atradius does and what you are looking to do with the sales product first? And then we will get to marketing.</p><p>RALPH VAN DIJK, GLOBAL COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR, ATRADIUS COLLECTIONS: All right. Thanks. Good afternoon. Well, we started as a business in trade enforced collections already 90 years ago. And in 2007 we started as a separate business unit in the Atradius Group. Atradius is a global trade credit insurance company. And I work as a Global Commercial Director for the unit collections, and we are the leader in trade enforced collections globally; offices in more than 24 countries.</p><p>And we handle about 1 billion of trade receivables to collect on, recover it internationally. So, most of our transactions are international debt collection services and trade enforced services. We are in the B2B, obviously. And we have -- in these 24 locations, we manage about 14,500 clients across the globe and it's growing.</p><p>That brings us immediately, of course, to how do you service these clients on an international basis? How do you deal with attracting new clients, retaining new clients and but also developing your new clients? So we decided two years ago in 2012 to implement a global solution where we could actually give our clients what we call the customer experience that they need.</p><p>We have a lot of clients that have offices across the globe. And if we want to make sure that all these clients are treated in the same way, we need to have a platform that enables us to do that.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Okay. Great. So, Jim, you talked a little bit about the challenges. And can you maybe give us, the group, the thought process between going to the cloud for service? How has the service cloud been?</p><p>And I know you have out actually been a longtime customer of the Oracle cloud, both at Nintendo and previously. Can you give some background on not only how is it working so far, the thought process? And the results for that -- particularly as Nintendo is going through this change.</p><p>JIM FERRON: Sure. So, really, two decisions that we needed to make, right? One was premise versus cloud and the second was if cloud, then which provider? And so we made those decisions at the same time, but through a collective process.</p><p>I think the decision to select Oracle service -- cloud service, for the primary reason that knowledge was central and core to the platform and that we were able to curate a single set of knowledge that we were going to be able to leverage both from a self-service perspective and as the core of that agent desktop experience, while also using that same core of knowledge in chat interactions and email interactions. So that was really one of the primary impetuses.</p><p>The question of cloud or not cloud was a really challenging one for Nintendo. Prior to Nintendo -- I am a serial customer of Oracle service cloud, both with Expedia and previously at Sony. The decision was hard, but for the same reasons. And that is the have interaction data about our customers and we were going to be storing that outside of the enterprise.</p><p>And that's a challenging thing for any organization, but I would say it was even more so for Nintendo. And the reason that it was more so for Nintendo is that we have a large number of minors that contact us. So, there is a lot of risk profile associated with that data and the PII associated with that.</p><p>So the reason I mentioned that only is that we really had to put it through excruciating process to determine that we were satisfied with the security model that was in place in order to acknowledge that it was a viable solution to begin with. But the real decision was the combination of the availability, and the ability to take advantage of the migration and evolution of the product without having to burden our IT team, which at that time was very busy with an Oracle EBS implementation.</p><p>So we would have either waited two or three years to do something premise or we were able to make a move and turn something on within three months that was cloud-based. So we were able to achieve some of our business objectives in a much better timescale with that cloud-based solution, once we passed the logical hurdles of why organizations sometimes have a barrier to go in cloud.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: So, it sounds like crossing the hurdles of availability and security, the benefits of speed -- speed to implement without IT, and then as far as the product, kind of the multichannel capabilities on top of the basic service capabilities to deal with people.</p><p>JIM FERRON: I think that's right. I think the other thing that we did analyze was recognizing that many of our contacts and our agents are outsource providers in different locations. Having a premise-based application within our WAN wasn't as important as being able to serve the front end to those contact centers in an efficient way.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Hayden, so you gave a little bit of background on the first answer on the scale of what you are trying to do and the product. Can you give any type of metrics on how the implementations have gone, what -- any kind of before and after? Maybe not even an apples-to-apples, because the way you dealt with customers may not have been in the same way. How it's really affected the business moving to the marketing cloud and the BlueKai?</p><p>HAYDEN MUGFORD: Sure. When we look at some of the before and after metrics, we look at things like speed to market or efficiency or productivity gains that we have seen. So, a year ago, two years ago, before we would using Eloqua for our lead operations, we would probably take anywhere from two to three weeks to get qualified leads over to sales. We are down to two to four hours at this point, and that's in our top 20 countries. That obviously sees a lot of efficiency and is a much better customer experience for people who are ready to engage with our account teams.</p><p>In terms of performance, when we think about creating a variety of communications out to customers that are very targeted and one-to-one, so each of you would receive your own specific email based off the behavior you have demonstrated. And if I have to accommodate that in 22 different languages, being able to have the flexibility to produce those emails in a dynamic and modular way real time, and adjust any content I need to every 30 seconds, if that's how quickly you are demonstrating behavior, that gives us productivity gains as opposed to asking an agency to build static HTML files every day. I would say those are probably two of our biggest findings.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: Yes, that's a huge difference, between a couple of weeks to a lead and a couple hours -- especially time to buy.</p><p>Ralph, you are similar, because we started on sales but I think you have plans to expand sales to marketing. So could you talk about both -- we talked about yesterday just the importance of getting the sales reps to use the system and how you plan on doing that? And then why is it that you believe it's so important to expand the sales and the marketing component?</p><p>RALPH VAN DIJK: Well, I think to start with your last question, the most important challenge that we had as a company was to link sales and marketing together. I mean, too many times you see in companies that sales and marketing are two different entities and not functioning together. We are very much in the approach that sales and marketing should be in our strategy, aligned.</p><p>Although we started with the sales cloud solution because that was our highest need at that time, especially on managing the contact side and all the information that we have on our client base in the right way and have that capability available to do cross-fertilization within the customer portfolio -- cross-sell and deep sell, but also service our clients better. We started with the sales cloud solution.</p><p>Had we implemented that solution in 11 weeks -- we went plain-vanilla, so we didn't make any customization whatsoever on the system. We took it off the shelf and put it up in the cloud and used it, and it works perfectly fine for us.</p><p>What we do is we, on the way, work with Oracle to further enhance our requirements that we would like to see back in the system as our service is pretty particular and specific in the market. You know probably a lot of lawyers or debt collection agencies that are across the globe, but to manage it on a global basis specifically in our business, that is key to further develop it.</p><p>And then we decided very quickly after that, that it could be important to also acquire the Eloqua solution, because one of our challenges is, like I said, not only retaining and servicing our existing customer base. But we have a major challenge of course to acquire new clients. And if you want to do that in the right way in more than 24 countries, where every country has a different buying behavior, you have to be capable of actually subtracting data from different sources and have tool available to start communicating with that suspect and prospect base.</p><p>And now we are aligned, the systems are integrated and we are extremely satisfied with that.</p><p>STEVE MIRANDA: That's great. So again 11 weeks kind of start to finish, live with sales across 20-plus countries, and then adding marketing after the fact. So that's great. Jim, Hayden, Ralph -- I can't thank you enough. Thanks for being customers. Thanks for joining me today. Appreciate it.</p><p>presentation</p><p><person><nameText>SAFRA CATZ, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT, CFO, ORACLE CORPORATION: I'm overwhelmed really by the massive amount of technology we have at Oracle, whether it is Java, it is software in the silicon, whether it's the database, it's applications, it's cloud services, it's vertical applications. All of these things, really from beginning to end, we have here. Hardware optimized for our software, services, storage, everything engineered to work together.</p><p>Even though we have all these pieces of technology, we have the broadest, broadest technology framework in the world, we also have the deepest. You know what? In many ways, that's actually not what Oracle OpenWorld is about.</p><p>What Oracle OpenWorld has been about this week, and I sure hope you went over and I sure hope you also not only sat in keynotes, but walked around randomly meeting customers, because you saw a few customers today, but simply there aren't enough days, there aren't enough weeks, there aren't enough years, frankly, for you to meet everyone, because -- and for me either, to be honest, and I ran into them and met with them and saw them and just overheard them sometimes talking about why they are here, why they decide to use their most precious resource, which actually isn't their money, but is their time, to walk around here to learn about these technologies, because Oracle OpenWorld is actually about them.</p><p>The reason I get so excited, whether they are enormous banks out of Germany or the UK or Brazil or small chocolatiers from Argentina or a telco from a tiny little African country, all folks I ran into and met during this visit here, this week, of really nothing but visits and sharing.</p><p>The reason that's so exciting is because all that technology means different things to each one of them, but it's useful for all of them. The cloud for some of our customers is, as you heard, an engine for transformation, a way to get rid of how many thousand customizations they thought they couldn't live without move to the cloud.</p><p>For others, the cloud is almost an IQ test. They say, but I'm a small business, should I -- and small for us, I don't mean Joe's Pizza. For small, it's an enterprise of the kind of size that makes sense to use our technology, but with the cloud, that's even smaller than before because they don't have to allocate resources to DBAs and application managers and whole IT departments. Because with the cloud, that's actually us, and for them when I say it's an IQ test, it's because they are medium sized, they are small. They don't have the resources to use all of this technology on their own on premise.</p><p>For us -- for them, the cloud is the way to get there, the way to release resources to do the things that make them competitive. That's what this whole week is really about.</p><p>To watch the pieces of technology, I feel like that old Columbo television show. I know many of you are too young to even know what I'm talking about, but it would be like this. He's walking out. He's talking and then walk out and he'd say, and another thing, and he'd come in and, yes, and another thing. Another thing is the advanced technology we are putting into the silicon. Who thought we are doing that?</p><p>Another thing is what capabilities we have in the cloud, whether it's the platform, the infrastructure, the -- what I would call horizontal applications, or the vertical applications. I have to tell you there is one thing very, very hard about working at Oracle, at least there used to be. You'd walk in and people would say to me, my dad, very proud, would say, yes, she works at a software company, and I'd say, yes, it's Oracle.</p><p>A regular person would really not know what I was talking about, and I'd say, you know, like Microsoft. Kind of like when you are an investment banker, which I was for many, many years, and my dad would say, she works at a bank. And they'd say, oh, how nice. Do you enjoy being a teller? Okay?</p><p>It's very, very much -- now with Oracle, it's not that -- it's very, very true. Most people don't have any idea that we are what makes your phone something other than a paperweight, frankly. We are what makes really your whole day possible, whether it's the ATM, the ATM transaction, or otherwise.</p><p>All of you in this room, you know, but the reality is that when we see our applications, now I'll get to see them in restaurants, at micros. I am getting behind every counter to bring a few waters, forks, and napkins, but really I am just trying to figure out what they're using.</p><p>But you see behind all of that is our technology, and that is phenomenally exciting because it's important to our customers.</p><p>Now, I will tell you -- I absolutely promise I will give you a chance to ask questions, so have no fear. Larry, as Ken told you, is going to be here in a little while. If you haven't gotten a full -- if you are not satisfied with a full hour of torturing Larry, you've got me back and you've got Ken, so don't worry.</p><p>But I did want to make sure you understood what we see is the true opportunity for Oracle, because I know that you're going to drag me into the spreadsheets and the enterprise manager in Uzbekistan trends and things like that. But before we get there, I think it's very, very important for you to understand how we see it, because for us at Oracle, the cloud is the Y2K opportunity all over again, okay? That's what we are talking about.</p><p>You see, when Y2K started, everyone knew it was coming. Many companies and especially one of our formerly important competitors, SAP, would -- they got themselves ready and they locked themselves in really for the next 20 years almost, right, 2014. They got themselves ready in 1995 and that was their lead in applications.</p><p>Now during this period, of course, we became number one in database, number one in middleware, number one in a lot of areas, yes, but in applications, you know, we are -- you all know what I'm going to say. We are number two, got you. We're number two. And we don't like being number two, and being number two is where you end up when you weren't quite ready for the last go-round.</p><p>But this time, you see Larry saw the cloud. Larry saw it coming now since way before I joined Oracle 16 years ago. It was business online. It was the founding of NetSuite. It was the founding of Salesforce.com. This whole area, he saw this coming and it was going to be our opportunity.</p><p>Now we talked about it. We bought PeopleSoft, so we'd have the resources to make the investment to build the platform and build a whole future of applications. We talked about it. We told you about it. Larry said it was coming, and we sat there and we built brick by brick the most formidable platform in the world and then the broadest possible product line.</p><p>And it's here because the one thing you have to see is our customers have recognized the opportunity for them, for them now. Again, Oracle OpenWorld this year is markedly different because everyone, small to big, security conscious or outwardly market focused, or all the different things, and whether it's the IT organization, the operations group, the line of business, the CFO, for everyone there is value in moving to the cloud. Whether it's speed of deployment or cost or efficiency or as a driver for them, everybody sees what they need in what we are offering.</p><p>So for us, it is Y2K, but we are ready, and what luck our formerly [groovy] overwhelming competitor in the application suite isn't, isn't ready. No ERP suite for them. No 100-plus modules. No references in financials or otherwise.</p><p>But we are ready and this is it. This, I would say, we're ready with the products. We are ready with the distribution. We're ready with the references and now, with this show, we are ready with the customers.</p><p>And that's really why we are so excited. That's why we're all here. I hope you -- this is going to play out. We are darn sure it's going to play out exactly the same way and this will leave us number one in every market we're in.</p><p>All right, that's how we see it. Okay, I am ready for the question, enterprise manager in Uzbekistan; who's got it? Okay. You are the only one I see, so you win.</p><p>KIRK MATERNE, ANALYST, EVERCORE PARTNERS: Kirk Materne, Evercore. Safra, to, I guess, follow up on that, with the vertical apps that you guys have put together, the customer experience, this is touching to your point a lot of people outside of the traditional IT buyer. I was just kind of curious, do you feel like your go-to-market is ready to hit those people that are outside that core IT person?</p><p>And in your discussions, your team's discussions here at Oracle World this week, are you getting to the line of business person? Because that seems to be where a lot of the incremental spending is coming from these days in software. Thanks.</p><p><person><nameText>SAFRA CATZ</nameText></person>: That's exactly what we have been working on for the past, I would say, 24 months. There's no point in getting to them when your products aren't already referenceable and ready to go, and that's really what we've been working on.</p><p>You know what's very interesting? GE, fantastic Oracle customer, they bring 200 executives to a summit as part of Oracle OpenWorld. They go from morning, literally 7 AM, to night, all day, and it's not IT. Yes, there are IT folks, but there are operations folks, there are line of business folks, and for folks like them, they are using going to the cloud as a way to drive their own constant transformation. When you're big like that, it's very, very important that you keep momentum going in your different lines of business, and those are the folks that are showing up.</p><p>Again, that's why I sort of implore you to talk to the customers because you're going to run into a lot of folks who historically -- I can't tell you how many people said to me, I have never been to Oracle OpenWorld. It's usually the IT guys.</p><p>All of a sudden, it's the line of business, and so that's what we've been building in the sales force. That's what Mark's been focused on. That's what Larry has been focused on. We had -- that's, by the way, one of the benefits, frankly, of some of the acquisitions in cloud because we are historically go to IT.</p><p>Many of the companies we bought -- I mean, BlueKai doesn't sell to IT. Eloqua doesn't sell to IT, and all -- Taleo, and so we've just gone ahead and built on all of those, and we have taken seeds and we have grown them, which is why Mark said, you know, we feel like now we are really ready.</p><p>Additionally, by the way, though, not only ready in North America, but the value that we bring is -- it is from enormous, pick a country, Russia, China, to Djibouti. In Africa, I met folks from literally everywhere around the world, and that's another reason it's so darn hard to compete with us, because it is global. Thank you.</p><p>RICK SHERLUND, ANALYST, NOMURA ASSET MANAGEMENT: It's Rick Sherlund. I wonder if you can just discuss the dynamics, financial dynamics, of the transition to the cloud a little bit for us. There's obviously a lot of speculation about what this means.</p><p>We heard today that you get more revenue, 2.5, 3 times the revenue, and you've got the benefit of vertical integration, so you can sell a lot of things to the customer, and if you sell them apps, then you sell them the infrastructure whole stack, so I can understand that.</p><p>The margin implication of the shift, so I've heard you say maintenance will continue to grow. License may not. You would expect the license to get cannibalized by the move, but together -- I think for the foreseeable future, it sounds like you're saying together they are still going to grow.</p><p>Do you get more -- just the math suggests a slower margin, but do you get more gross profit dollars as you give up a license, sell, and you move. Can you discuss that?</p><p>And also, the CapEx implication. Will, at some point, you need to increase CapEx for data centers as you get scale in the cloud?</p><p><person><nameText>SAFRA CATZ</nameText></person>: What is really wonderful about our business model is we are so large that we can do so much within the envelope of profitability.</p><p>We have been building data centers and expanding data centers and filling them with computers now for a few years, and yet you see our capital expenditure numbers are nothing like everybody else because, as you know, we make all our own stuff, which means I can give myself a phenomenal deal on mostly everything.</p><p>I have not yet figured out how to generate my own electricity beyond my car, but as a general matter, this is one piece of it. This is not an area that I am concerned about, frankly, on the capital side. We have a lot of experience here.</p><p>Additionally, the dynamics in our business are such that there are two things going on. The first thing is that because historically customers have spent, let's say, this much, and I know a lot of you have seen me show you this before, they've spent this much on the software and the hardware and this much running the systems and implementing them and all of that that they save an immense amount of money, immense amount of money, by letting us handle it, based on our massive economies of scale.</p><p>Because we aren't one customer, even a big customer, we are hundreds -- actually, thousands of customers, and so we have such a highly automated engineered cloud, whether it's at the infrastructure, at the platform, at the applications, at the vertical applications that they save an immense amount, okay?</p><p>So you got to start there because it has to be compelling to the customer.</p><p>Now because they are saving so much, they can and they do give us more money to do the work they used to do. Now they don't give us all of that money, they give us just a small percentage, but it is more than enough to cover the expenses and it actually encourages them to do even more than they were able to do before.</p><p>If there is anything you heard from these customers, you heard how they are -- it is not only they save money, they got up and running faster, but all of a sudden they were able to do more. They were able to have capabilities they couldn't possibly have.</p><p>Imagine it took them 14 days to come up with a lead to the salesman. Now it's all well and good to hand a sales woman a 2-week-old lead. Think about what a waste in cycle that is. Now they are down to an hour or two. You mean when the customer is still interested in buying, so it not only brings them more revenue, but there is no -- if it took them two weeks to hand over a lead, think how much -- how many hands it passed and then -- ching, ching, ching -- how much money that cost them.</p><p>As a result, for us we have put up the cloud service because it's up already. We have added the users. We have integrated it with their system. Boom, that's it. The marginal cost of them using more, what do you think the marginal cost of that is, once the work is done? It is not very much. And yet, the marginal benefit of it is compelling.</p><p>Now, listen, you do not have to -- you cannot model from what I am saying to you because it's almost unfathomable. As I was telling you before we started, Rick, when we did Oracle's original transformation in 1999, we went from -- I know it's old news, but the pattern doesn't change -- we went from 70 ERP systems at Oracle and we put up our own global single instance, made it available to our 100 countries.</p><p>Now we didn't actually do a business plan on how much money we saved. But we knew it would be significant. If you had asked me, well, Safra, it's 1999. You just joined. Next year, exactly how will this translate into increased profitability? I probably -- I know what I thought at the time. I thought it would be $1 billion, actually, and it turned out it was $1.2 billion.</p><p>Now Larry shared that with those of you who were on that earnings call in June 1999, but I couldn't have gotten it down to the cent, but I sure knew it was going to be big and that it would be profitable for us to do.</p><p>For our customers that pick cloud, it is both profitable for them, because they are spending less, and the marginal cost of it as we get to even higher scale is overwhelmed by the -- marginal cost is way overwhelmed by the increased revenue we get. Yet again, the customer saves a fortune.</p><p>DERRICK WOOD, ANALYST, SUSQUEHANNA FINANCIAL GROUP/SIG: Derrick Wood, Susquehanna. Maybe a more specific model question. One of the big product announcements this week was Platform as a Service, putting database in the cloud, putting middleware in the cloud. I think a lot of us as we think about the 12c product cycle have thought of it as something that is going to be more perpetual license driven. Obviously, you are in a big product cycle right now, but now with this new push to the cloud, do we need to think -- is this going to have a material impact to the modernization cycle? And maybe if you could give us some color as to the sales incentive behind the Platform as a Service side.</p><p><person><nameText>SAFRA CATZ</nameText></person>: Okay, sure. So first of all, you are right about one thing, which is 12c is compelling. It's actually -- it actually sparked a number of customers literally out of nowhere, almost exclaiming after seeing some of the capability of 12c, 12c and memory, that they simply could not wait to get to it.</p><p>Now I have to tell you, this level of enthusiasm on a new version, we're always enthusiastic, of course. We understand the value, but this level of enthusiasm is actually stunning. Astonishing, I would say.</p><p>Now, of course, as you know, those customers who are already subscribers to our database, who pay support, do receive 12c straight. They get that as part of what they pay.</p><p>Now to the extent that they want additional options, whether it's multi-tenant or in memory, that just costs more money. Again, so that's helpful, but it's not like a new version of Windows where everything you had, you have to buy it again. You have been paying. You have been paying, it turns out, millions, billions, in fact, to receive the upgrade. You're entitled to it. So it's not bumpy, like other companies, so first.</p><p>Two, it is compelling. Three, your question is really focused on whether PaaS will cannibalize it. I actually believe -- Larry and I and Mark believe that it will have the exact opposite effect. You see, there are a lot of applications that are on premise and customers are perfectly happy keeping them on premise. What it will do is it will have them try out some of these things as PaaS, maybe test development, and then bring it on premise or -- so start in the cloud, bring it on premise.</p><p>It is also true that some customers will go from on premise to the cloud. We do not believe and we have not seen at all in the behavior of our current customers that they will say, you know what, I am canceling all my licenses. Just not happening, not likely to happen, because every single year at least since the 1980s, since I have been following Oracle, there is always this feeling that all the data in the world is already in a database. We don't need any more.</p><p>I remember when Intel processors got really, really fast sort of all of a sudden, and very, very senior development heads at Oracle walked in and says, oh, my goodness. There is so much power in these new servers, they are just not going to need any more database because they got it all.</p><p>Now guess what, look around at what's going on, the exact opposite. The more powerful systems become, the more things are possible. This is before the IoT, Internet of Everything, where literally -- I mean, this room is sending out so much data you would think you can see the heat from space, but you can't because you're not that different from the room next door.</p><p>There is so much going on and so much of it is ending up in our database as we are not only the market leader, but our leadership grows every year. And our confidence is so enormous that at Oracle OpenWorld, you walk around -- I walked around the demo grounds yesterday, just the database side of the demo grounds, and if you look just on the outskirts of our demo grounds -- and I don't know if you noticed, we put the demo grounds in the hardest possible place to reach, right? You got to go through every one of our competitors first before you get there.</p><p>This just shows you how confident and how comfortable we are that the new features in the database and that making it available as a platform as a service is so compelling that we literally -- you looked around -- they have probably struck it by now, but you look around and all the little fancy -- the names that everyone is talking about who are going to be the next company to put the Oracle database out of business, there they are, parked right next to one of our features that we are demoing at Oracle OpenWorld.</p><p>PaaS, we think, is going to accelerate it because you're not going to have to put it up. You're going to try it and maybe you'll bring it on premise or maybe you'll let us run it for you, and as a result, you actually pay us more. That's because your overall spending, so much less. Okay, yes, whoever --</p><p>JOEL FISHBEIN, ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS: Joel Fishbein, BMO Capital Markets. I just have a follow-up to that last question you elaborated. Larry had talked about Database being the biggest cloud service out there, which is a little bit surprising to at least me. Can you talk about how that would impact the model? Is that more of a subscription? Is it more licensing? And when do we expect to see it or how will we see it?</p><p><person><nameText>SAFRA CATZ</nameText></person>: You are going to see it in the SaaS, PaaS, IaaS line. I do not currently have it in the model. It is not -- it is one of those -- we will meet again, let's say, in two years and it will be unmissable, frankly.</p><p>We believe that as long as we execute well on it, which I know we will, our leadership in database will be even more obvious as PaaS becomes larger and larger.</p><p>As I said, we are not concerned that this will cannibalize. What it will do is expand, and for any customer here or there, they may say, you know what, I will move everything to the cloud. Hooray, we say, because those are customers who bought their license 15 years ago and now they're going to pay us more because we are going to run the whole thing for them. Fantastic -- support. Overall, that business will grow.</p><p>We are extremely bullish, but again, you have to understand it is not up to us whether a customer wants their product on premise for them to run it or as a service for us to run it. That's their choice. Either way, it works great for us.</p><p>Okay, I think one last question. Is Larry here? Somewhere. Okay, yes, go ahead.</p><p>BRENT THILL, ANALYST, UBS: Brent Thill, UBS. Just a follow-up on Rick's question around the business model transition. You are not alone in the transition to subscription and cloud. The one common denominator among these companies that have gone through this is the margins have reset for Intuit, Autodesk, Adobe, you go through the list, right?</p><p>In the near term and to your point, you expect the margins to rebound, but is there something we should consider that may not impact the margins during this transition? Are there offsets that we should look at that perhaps we don't see that you are seeing that could give us a better sense of how you are managing that?</p><p><person><nameText>SAFRA CATZ</nameText></person>: Listen, no matter what I tell you now, you're not necessarily going to believe it, and that's the right answer because you're going to watch this play out.</p><p>We are not Intuit. We are not Adobe. We are not any of those companies because, you see, the massive scale of our operation is completely different, and what I mean by that is we are very deeply ingrained in our customers, some of whom you saw today, and these transitions will take time for us because we will be taking market share from our competitors in the cloud.</p><p>But in addition, the move to the cloud will release so many resources for our customers that they will buy from us additional cloud services, like Platform, to build add-on to things that we have.</p><p>We believe that maybe as -- we will see how their percentages work out. Q1 is not a data point for you to all of a sudden think has changed our model in any way. What you'll see is that we will generate more cash flow. We will make more money at Oracle, while our customers spend a markedly reduced amount of money.</p><p>You will see we are very, very focused on maintaining our profitability. The economies of scale that we have here at Oracle and the differentiated product line, both in breadth and in depth, is unmatched by any other company, so do not think we will necessarily follow what other companies' paths are. We will be more profitable and I guess that's it.</p><p>Oh, I can go a little bit more. Oh, joy. (laughter).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible). Until now, we have been looking at cloud as been faster and larger in the US.</p><p><person><nameText>SAFRA CATZ</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: And slower in the (multiple speakers). Do you believe that's an issue of the fact the vendors are US based? Do you think it is going to be different for Oracle in terms of where you're going to get penetration is going to be equal?</p><p><person><nameText>SAFRA CATZ</nameText></person>: Yes, yes, yes. Okay (multiple speakers). You're welcome.</p><p>Most of the vendors were US only. Many of the vendors that we acquired were US only. We are not US only. We are an enormous export story. You saw here today quite a few accents, may I say, which showed you enterprises from around the world. I went to five, six different receptions here during Oracle OpenWorld. You are wondering where all those folks are every evening. Yes, they are eating and drinking with us.</p><p>Whether they are small countries, Chile, Colombia, big countries, Brazil, whether they are really -- Romania, you name it. They are here. They are if not as excited, if this is possible, they are more excited because many of them are catching up. Many of them don't have the years and years of investment.</p><p>In fact, the most excitement is coming from countries and regions that are in a full-out speed to move fast, to jump. If you ever -- if you want to model the look at, look at phones. Phones in the United States, remember land lines and other kinds, and then cell phones, the adoption rates. Many countries skipped the land lines, almost. That's where we're going. That's what Oracle can bring that nobody else could afford to bring, let alone the development.</p><p>You heard Steve today -- Steve or Thomas, one of them, talk about what it means to be a product that can be used in other countries. It's not multi-language. That's not enough. It's not even multi-currency. That's not enough. It's knowing the regulations if you are HR or if you are finance. It's being able to do, frankly, all the things we have been doing on premise for years, and we also have a sales force ready to go.</p><p>But I'll tell you, the customer pull is enormous. Many can't wait. When is this coming? I see -- the most hilarious conversation I always find is a customer who I may end up being the executive sponsor for some reason or another, we acquire a cloud -- one of these cloud vendors that is a US only, and I get an email asking when it will be ready for their country because they assume immediately once Oracle owns it, off it goes.</p><p>I have to tell you the truth; it takes a few minutes to get that going, okay? And it takes Thomas and Steve and their whole team, but that's the expectation from us and that's exactly what we're delivering.</p><p>KASH RANGAN, ANALYST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH: On the topic of joy, I am joyful to get the mic and have possibly the last question. Kash Rangan at Merrill Lynch. Safra, good to see you so passionate and fired up.</p><p><person><nameText>SAFRA CATZ</nameText></person>: How do I look, by the way? I know you said (multiple speakers) Mark looked good. Do I look all right?</p><p>KASH RANGAN: Fantastic, fantastic. (laughter)</p><p><person><nameText>SAFRA CATZ</nameText></person>: It kind of hurt my feelings, so (laughter)</p><p>KASH RANGAN: You should be on the cover of Fortune magazine.</p><p><person><nameText>SAFRA CATZ</nameText></person>: You're funny.</p><p>KASH RANGAN: I mean that. It's a sincere compliment.</p><p>With this model transition, sorry to drag you into the model, but as you work through this ARR, I think you threw out a statistic earlier today that, or Mark did, license plus ARR grew double digit.</p><p>As you work through this transition, can you provide -- or will you continue to provide things like that that can help us get confidence that we should not be just looking at the reported revenue, but there's something bigger than that that is quantifiable so we can all hang on to that? Thank you.</p><p><person><nameText>SAFRA CATZ</nameText></person>: Yes, we will continue to provide what we can, what we think is instructive, what is helpful.</p><p>I myself love revenue, okay? I very much like it and I understand with cloud, especially in the very, very high growth phase, cash flow often precedes what we can book as revenue. But me, I am old fashioned, so the truth is that it is starting to be obvious even on the revenue line, between all of us. And you see it and it will become more and more obvious in the other lines on both the income statement and the cash flow statements. It is becoming more and more obvious that it is driving our business growth.</p><p>Now, it is very true, we are enormous. If you saw some of the graphs either that Mark just did or that Ken will do, assuming we still have time, you will see that cloud is growing, but we are really, really big. We have been at this for 30-plus years and we have the largest subscription base of enterprise customers for whom we are running their most important applications. And this will drive -- this will more and more drive growth overall in our software business and we will give you markers for you to see the future, but the markers I like, I am on the accounting/finance side historically, I also like those accounting numbers that just go boom. All that profitability down to the bottom line, and we're pretty excited about the capability there, too.</p><p>KEN BOND: Can you discuss with us the unique ability that Oracle has because of your vertical integration and now with Platform-as-a-Service, Infrastructure-as-a-Service, how you might be able to inflect here?</p><p>Is this an inflection point for the Company, given the number of announcements we have seen this week and how you can create maybe something that is a little more visible to us, the shareholders, in terms of real traction in the financials?</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN AND CTO, ORACLE CORPORATION: Okay, well, we are approaching $2 billion, I would say. $2 billion. We are the second-largest cloud company on the planet. So I realize that and people say well, it is only 6% of your revenue or something like that, that's -- okay.</p><p>We could try to get rid of that other revenue. Then it would be -- the $2 billion would be 100% of our revenue. But the other revenue is quite profitable.</p><p>So first of all, let me disagree. The last couple of years, we have been -- we have been. The last couple of years we have been very vocal, but eight -- more -- no, nine and a half years ago, we started rewriting all of our applications.</p><p>We -- Fusion ERP. You think we did that in the last two years? We did that in the last nine and a half years. We had to rewrite all of our middleware for the cloud. We had to rewrite big chunks of our database for the cloud. Then we had to rewrite our entire ERP/HCM suite for the cloud.</p><p>Now if you think we did that in the last two years, hey, we are really good. Because it actually took as nine and half years to do. So we have been working on this for a very long time.</p><p>Again, I will go back -- this is a little, you know, me feeling insecure. People said I was a CEO until very recently and I just didn't get the cloud. I started NetSuite. It was the first cloud company. And I don't think I invest -- I wasn't an investor in that suite.</p><p>I mean, I put in -- it was my idea. We started it to do small companies, the ERP in the cloud, and we didn't know it was called cloud. In fact, I have ridiculed the name cloud. That is pointless now. It just -- it is the name. People decide to call servers on the Internet, God bless, and we -- the cloud is great. It is a very charismatic name.</p><p>But we started working on this thing -- might -- I made a major -- I started NetSuite a year later and made a major investment in salesforce.com. It is not that I didn't notice or think this was a good idea. I thought this was a good idea for a very long time.</p><p>For Oracle to move to the cloud is very different than NetSuite building an application for the cloud or Salesforce building an application for the cloud.</p><p>When we move to the cloud, we have to move all of our middleware, all of our database, rewrite our entire ERP suite, HCM suite, and CRM suite. That is a lot of work. It takes a long time. It takes a decade. We have been at it for almost a decade.</p><p>Now there is no reason for us to be enormously vocal about cloud, cloud, cloud, cloud, cloud when we are in the middle of engineering for the cloud, but not delivering cloud products.</p><p>And we started getting aggressive in promoting cloud is the right way to go a couple years ago, because it is when our first cloud product started coming out. And now, two years later, we think we are in a much, much stronger position. To move our middleware business and our database business customers to the cloud just by pushing a button.</p><p>Java is an important brand. By the way, Java is not like a dinosaur technology from a dinosaur company. Maybe it is, but Google thought it was important enough to steal. And they are, like, really cool.</p><p>So the Android phone is entirely a Java phone. That is our technology. And it is the most popular programming environment in the cloud and on-premise. That is our technology and our brand.</p><p>So -- but us moving our enterprise customers to Java in the cloud and re-doing our middleware for the cloud, putting mobile interfaces on all of our middleware -- that is just an enormous job. Making our database multi-tenant. Big job.</p><p>But at the same time, making the database handle all of the data in memory. Big job. There was a lot of work to do to move this Company to the cloud. No reason to spend a lot of time talking about it until we actually had products to start to sell. And that was a couple years ago.</p><p>So I do think -- I mean, I think this is an inflection point. It was my speech on Sunday. It was my speech again on Tuesday that this is a turning point for the Company. Because now we have the exact same database that we have had out -- we have on-premise.</p><p>We have that exact same database capability in the cloud and you can simply move the database by pushing a button. We have never had that before. There are millions of Oracle databases out there.</p><p>Now you have a choice -- you can rewrite from MongoDB and rebuild all of your applications or you can push a button. By the way, in the cloud, everyone uses Oracle. 19 of the top 20 SaaS companies use Oracle in the cloud.</p><p>Oracle is by far the number one enterprise database and if people want to move to the cloud and get the benefits of the cloud and have lower costs and monthly payments and all these other things and not pay upfront license fees and have us run on our servers on our network, use our storage, do all of that, they can now do that with the push of a button.</p><p>It is the same exact database that they have on-premise they can count move to the cloud. That is a big deal. We think that is going to be our biggest cloud business very quickly.</p><p>And that is why we are quite confident we will blow by salesforce.com. Because salesforce.com's -- has had no platform competition. What used to be called force.com and now is called Salesforce1 is a highly proprietary programming language that you use for extending and building applications on Salesforce's platform.</p><p>Well, we don't have -- it is interesting and I pointed this out before, Salesforce builds on top of our Oracle and our Java. That is how they build applications, but that is not how they encourage their customers to build applications.</p><p>We encourage our customers to build on top of the same platform we build build on: Oracle and Java. We encourage our customers to build on the same platform that Salesforce builds on: Oracle and Java. Except you can't get from Salesforce; you can only get it from us.</p><p>We encourage our platform -- our customers to build on the same platform that SAP builds and runs on. Ariba runs on Oracle. SuccessFactors runs on Oracle and Concur runs on Oracle. Those are that is their entire cloud story.</p><p>They do say Hana powers the cloud, but I don't know what cloud they are talking about. Certainly not theirs. Not ours, not these other 19 guys. And the other -- the one, the one of the top 20 SaaS companies that don't run on Oracle is Workday and they sure don't run on Hana. They run on their own proprietary object database.</p><p>And by the way, Workday has no platform. I mean, at least Salesforce has a platform. I think it's -- I think there's a problem that it is not [sanders-based] and it is proprietary and there is only one place in the world you can get that platform. You don't get more closed than Salesforce's platform. Because the only one that sells Salesforce's platform is Salesforce.</p><p>Java and the Oracle database are based on hundreds of industry standards. Their stuff is based -- isn't 100% proprietary. So we have what we think will be the most attractive platform in the cloud and that is going to be a very big business for us. So that is, yes, that is an inflection point in and of itself.</p><p>We finally got our ERP suite out. The whole thing. The whole thing -- there's a few missing pieces, but the bulk of the ERP suite is out. And we sold more ERP customers in our last quarter. You see no evidence that we are doing okay in cloud.</p><p>We sold more ERP customers in our last quarter than Workday has sold since the beginning -- since they started their company. We have totally blown by them in midrange and high-end ERP.</p><p>We are selling more HCM systems than Workday right now. And we have had lots of big brand wins against them, against Workday. We are Salesforce's only serious competitor in high-end sales automation.</p><p>We are competing and lots and lots of areas of the cloud. Platform, database, Java, I know you have seen a lot -- the fact that our -- that our platform also includes social mobile and this hold big issue of security, where we think we have a huge lead over salesforce.com.</p><p>I mean, do I have to sit here and convince you that our platform is more secure than salesforce.com's platform? We have been working on this problem for 30 years.</p><p>So we provide, I think, a very attractive platform made up of Java and the Oracle database where customers can migrate to it with the push of a button. No one else has anything like that.</p><p>You might look -- does IBM have that? IBM has DB2. Does it -- can you push a button and move your DB2 database to the cloud? Can you? No.</p><p>IBM has WebSphere. Can you push a button and move your WebSphere application to the cloud? No. So our primary database competitor, IBM and Enterprise, and our primary database competitor in middleware, IBM WebSphere, has no -- nothing for the cloud.</p><p>That is good for us. So we go from competing with IBM in the platform business to competing with salesforce.com with their proprietary platform. I like our chances.</p><p>So, yes, now that we are in the platform business, it took us a while to get there. We have a lot of software. When you re-engineered a lot of software, it takes a long time.</p><p>But we have the platform in the cloud. We have CRM -- customer experience suites, sometimes called -- used to be called CRM. I have got to get with it. It is now called CX.</p><p>HCM suite, ERP suite -- they are all available and they are all quite differentiated. If you look at our user interfaces, everything we have, all of our applications have mobile interfaces. All of our cloud applications, mobile interfaces, because it is built into the platform.</p><p>We didn't put multi-tenancy at the application layer like Workday did and Salesforce did with all of the inherent security problems of mixing data. Different customers' data in the same database.</p><p>We didn't do that. We gave you secure, separate, pluggable databases. We gave you a multitenant database where all of the security stuff still works.</p><p>So it is much harder for Oracle to move its portfolio of platform applications and ERP and CRM. It takes much longer than for a Salesforce to write a single app. It takes us a long time to get there.</p><p>But now that we're there, we think we just have huge competitive advantages in saying gee, if you buy ourselves automation application, you can extend it using the Oracle database and Java. The same thing that it is written in.</p><p>You have built in in-memory Big Data analytics built in. Because it is built into the platform. Salesforce doesn't have that. Workday doesn't have that.</p><p>And we have security because we don't have multi-tenancy. And security is going to become a bigger and bigger deal every year in the cloud. And we have been working on that. As I said, we have been working on that problem for more than 30 years.</p><p>So we think it is an inflection point for us. We -- our platform business is basically at a point of zero today. We don't think it is going to be a zero a year from now and certainly not -- it is going to be a big number in a couple years. It is going to be our biggest cloud business.</p><p>So it is going to help us sell our SaaS applications, because people don't want -- well. If people can buy sweets, they want to buy sweets. Here is another story. Suite [went] vendors always win.</p><p>In the early days of a new technology, a new platform, you get a lot of point applications. This clever point application, that clever point application. Like I concur, it is a very narrow area, travel expenses.</p><p>And they put the one application up, but they don't have a platform to go with it. They don't have a suite of applications. In the end, those point application companies never survive. They never survive. It is -- all in the end, it is always one by suite providers.</p><p>If you look at the last generation, the two big application companies were SAP, number one, with their ERP suite and us, number two, with our ERP suite. Suite companies always win. The point guys always disappear. They get acquired or they just fail to compete.</p><p>Now the suite in the cloud is really interesting, because it is not only is the suite in the cloud, customer experience in HCM and ERP, but to compete in the cloud, there has to be some kind of platform.</p><p>There has got to be a way to extend your database. To extend your applications, to enhance your applications. To connect your applications one to another. There has got to be a way to do that.</p><p>So you got to offer a platform. Salesforce offered a platform. They've been around for a while. A lot of these guys have no platform. You can't make it without a platform, I don't think.</p><p>IBM hasn't started. There -- IBM, no DB2 in the cloud. No WebSphere in the cloud. SAP -- their business isn't -- they are not the giant in expense reporting for travel. There an ERP company. They have no ERP in the cloud, none. Nothing. They haven't started moving their stuff to the cloud yet. Took us 10 years.</p><p>Now maybe they are twice as smart as we are. Maybe they can do it in five years. I don't think so. I really don't. So they are 10 years away. I will tell you, we don't even think about them as a competitor anymore or IBM.</p><p>We worry about the new generation of cloud companies and we think we just have a huge advantage over those companies, given our breadth of application products and the power of our standards-based platform and the ability to move all of our existing customers' applications and all of our existing customers' databases to the cloud with the push of a button. They spend less, we get paid more. We like that model.</p><p>If you ask a nicer question, I will give you a shorter answer. Way in the back.</p><p>KASH RANGAN: Hi, Larry. Kash Rangan at Merrill Lynch. Nice question would be the database cycle -- and you've sounded quite bullish on in-memory and multi-tenant. And it harkens back to RAC back in 2003. You talked about how people can save money by using commodity service instead of more expensive ones.</p><p>So that was a very obvious cost save for the customer; the cycle worked out quite great. In this cycle, what do you think could be those compelling factors that would allow the customer to see the value so obviously that he can start to see that kind of cycle? Thank you.</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: Well, I think everyone is talking about real-time analytics. IBM talks about real-time, real-time. Everyone is talking about Big Data. To way -- the way to process huge amounts of data very, very quickly is to put it in memory.</p><p>I mean, Hadoop is a batch system. Again, without going into all the details. We sell Hadoop, we support Hadoop, we connect Hadoop -- we are big Hadoop supporters. But it is basically batch. It is like a big sort -- sort merge project.</p><p>In terms of real-time enterprise, real-time Big Data analytics, the way you do that is you put your data in memory. That is not what Hadoop does. Hadoop does something -- what it does, it does quite well. It doesn't do that.</p><p>So we think as customers want to analyze large volumes of data, they want to put in a columnar database, compress that data, put it in memory, and be able to query that data very fast. And then build all sorts of dashboard-embedded analytics in their applications, et cetera.</p><p>We think that is a huge -- obviously, SAP has been talking about it for -- ever since they have been pushing Hana. And there have been tons of university papers on it before that. I mean, in-memory database has just been something that we as an industry have been working on for a decade.</p><p>And, okay, so why did Oracle come out with in-memory database recently? As opposed to -- did SAP really beat us to the market with in-memory database? Well, kind of. But not really. So let me explain.</p><p>The -- when we put in-memory into Oracle, the Oracle database, it means that every existing Oracle application has to run in-memory without any changes. We got to have -- there's this business concept of upper compatibility.</p><p>We got to take all of our millions of databases and make sure that they work. All of our millions of applications have to be able to work in-memory with the customer not even -- with the customer not changing anything.</p><p>Now SAP didn't have that small problem, because they just came up with the first version of their in-memory database, called Hana. Which I don't want to go into, but it's -- I think it is quite a primitive product. But it is a laboratory product. It came out of the labs, it is version 1. Okay. It is a version 1 product. Great.</p><p>There are lots of version -- I mean there is a company called -- HP bought somebody called Vertica. They are -- which is a columnar database. This has been around for -- this is not a new idea.</p><p>The thing is, when Oracle adopts these things -- Oracle didn't have the first object database, but we have objects in our database right now. We didn't have the first text database, but we have text in our database.</p><p>When we do that, we have to put those things in a way that is completely upward compatible and accessible to all of our existing customers. So it is much harder for us, if you will, it is a much bigger challenge for us to build in-memory into our database and not perturb -- and customers push a button, just like moving to the cloud.</p><p>You push a button, you go to in-memory. You push a button, you go to the cloud. It is called upward compatibility. And we had been doing it for a very, very long time and we have to do it. And it is part and parcel of the job.</p><p>A startup or a lab project that doesn't worry about any of that stuff or doesn't worry about in-memory having to work with RAC, in-memory having to work with Data Guard, in-memory having to have seven levels of security.</p><p>I mean, it has to be the real -- it has to do all of those things. We can't regress in any way. We have to be as secure, as fast, and add this new feature where customers just press a button, everything is in-memory, and it runs 100 times faster. It is a much harder job for us than for others. But we do it.</p><p>Now how does that benefit customers? Well, here is what the customers have got to decide between: totally rewrite your application for Hana or install the new version of Oracle and it runs 100 times faster. Plus we are a lot faster than Hana. We did a better job.</p><p>But that is not that big thing -- whether we are faster in-memory or they are faster in-memory. The fact is those millions of databases and those millions of applications now run in-memory without change. It is just a totally different issue.</p><p>So in terms of adoption, which is what you are asking -- in terms of adoption, who doesn't want to press a button and runs 100 times faster? Who doesn't want to press a button and enable Big Data analytics in all of their applications?</p><p>We think this will be -- we are already seeing adoption rates. People using this in terms of bringing it in-house, developing stuff, moving staff. We have already seen a very rapid early adoption of in-memory, which is not -- it hasn't been around for that long.</p><p>So we think this is going to drive our database business on-premise and as well as driving our database business, our platform business in the cloud, if you look at those two things.</p><p>So we think we are on a very good cycle for the database with two major features. Again, I will use the word charismatic again. Two features that have caught people's imagination. To make your existing applications multi-tenant by moving them to Oracle 12c. Make your existing databases run in-memory 100 times faster by moving to Oracle 12c.</p><p>What else do I have to do? Nothing. Just upgrade your database. All the applications are multi-tenant and all of your data runs in-memory. That is all you have to do. And we think that means we are going to have a very strong couple of years on-premise, but I would say even more exciting, you are going to see our platform business just take off.</p><p>Way in the back, right here.</p><p>PHIL WINSLOW, ANALYST, CREDIT SUISSE: Hi, it is Phil Winslow from Credit Suisse. You provided some good historical context that application suites win in the cloud, they won in client/server, they are going to win now in the cloud. What if you put (multiple speakers)</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: No, they won in mainframes, they won in client/server, they won in Internet. So we have seen it happen three generations where the suite providers have won. But keep going.</p><p>PHIL WINSLOW: But I was hoping you could provide us similar type of historical context, but for the database. And some of the perceived threats that the Oracle database might be facing right now -- NoSQL, Hadoop -- and maybe how the Oracle database managed the previous technology waves like object oriented, XML and maybe just provide some context there.</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: I can't. This is -- by the way, this is our 87th and 88th threats to our very existence is NoSQL and Hadoop. And we are kind of dead. I mean -- dead with object databases. We are dead with unstructured data.</p><p>I mean, some people spent in excess of $10 billion built -- unstructured. I mean, getting a database to store all of your cat videos. It's -- I mean, unstructured data was going to -- I never give the -- the pitch was un -- most data is unstructured.</p><p>And Oracle only handled structured data. And we are going to kill them, because we are going to be the kings of unstructured. And they are kind of screwed, because they just handle structured data.</p><p>Well, yes, structured data like banks, and phone companies, phone records, and connecting phone calls, and banks, and the military targeting things, and insurance companies, and all of that structured stuff. Versus unstructured stuff like cat videos, dog videos. Videos. Pictures of your friends; pictures -- your Facebook pictures of what you had for breakfast.</p><p>Now the question is -- which -- are the banks going to pay more to keep track of money than consumers are going to pay to keep track of their cat videos. And it turns out banks are still paying more than consumers in terms of monitoring.</p><p>Cat videos, you store for nothing. So it turns out that unstructured data versus structured data was not the death knell for us. Either were objects.</p><p>Okay, NoSQL. We have a NoSQL database. We had a very -- we bought -- Berkeley DB was the biggest NoSQL database. It wasn't called NoSQL database. It is called a keyvalue payer.</p><p>It is called -- let me tell you what it was called. It is usually called ISAM. I think this is -- talk about back to the future. This is 19 -- late 1950s technology. I am not saying it doesn't have value. We have one. We have a NoSQL database. It has value. You don't need to -- you don't need an [opri] or schema.</p><p>There are things that it is very good at. And you should use it for, but it has nothing to do with competing with us.</p><p>I remember when MySQL was going to kill us. Another relational database was going to wipe us out. I can't -- the death knell for Oracle has sounded so many times, it is hard for me to jump up and run out of the house every time -- in my underwear every time that happens.</p><p>The -- now Hadoop. I know what Hadoop is. I actually know what it does. Most people writing about Hadoop -- I am not accusing you of anything -- have no idea what Hadoop even does.</p><p>All they know it has got an elephant and it is written kind of by Google and Yahoo, it is open source, and oh, is Oracle is screwed. I mean, it has nothing to do with what we do.</p><p>It is a big sort merge. It handles massive amounts of data; it is highly parallelized, MongoDB, and we actually follow all this stuff. It is not a competitive product. It doesn't do the same.</p><p>Why do you think 19 out of 20 of the biggest SaaS providers today are running Oracle? You think they are all confused? You think they all -- they couldn't find -- they couldn't download MongoDB? It is just preposterous.</p><p>Again, MongoDB is a highly distributed. It does some very interesting things. We have a NoSQL database. We have -- we sell Hadoop. We put SQL in front of Hadoop. We have done a lot of things with Hadoop. Again, it does some things extremely well.</p><p>It just is not a product that competes with what we do. It coexists with what we do. And the -- Workday doesn't run on Hadoop. Workday doesn't run on NoSQL. Even the one guy that doesn't run on Oracle, it doesn't run on those things. It doesn't run on Mongo.</p><p>It runs on its own proprietary object database, where you can actually build applications and actually do online transaction processing. Which none of these -- well, Mongo kind of does it. But Hadoop certainly doesn't.</p><p>Okay so it is just -- they really aren't a threat to what we are doing. They are interesting new technologies -- insofar as we can incorporate those technologies into Oracle, we have done that. Insofar as that -- hey, Hadoop does certain things. Does its -- lots and lots of servers doing basically sort/merge. It is not exactly sort/merge, but what -- it is called MapReduce.</p><p>In parallel, process a lot of data and we put the SQL language in front of it or we have very tight coupling to Hadoop for -- so customers can use Hadoop and use Oracle in concert.</p><p>This is not something that is -- will take the place of Oracle. It is different. It is a little, I don't know, it is a little bit like saying laptops will take the place of steamships. They won't. I mean, they won't. (laughter). They are too different.</p><p>So our big database competitors, we continue to gain database share on-premise and in the cloud and we think now with our platform, we'll be able to amplify that advantage because our biggest competitor, IBM, is not there.</p><p>The other -- the interesting -- other competitor that has kind of shown up relatively recently, like us, is Microsoft, which has moved a lot of its stuff to the cloud. And they do have a legitimate relational database that is pretty good and a bunch of -- and platform services.</p><p>They have got .NET -- we have Java. We have always kind of -- the world has always kind of self-selected between Oracle and Microsoft in terms of what you want. We have Linux, they have windows, we have Java, they have .NET. We have the Oracle database, they have SQL Server.</p><p>But Microsoft has a pretty complete port -- pretty complete platform. It is kind of the other pretty complete platform out there with a lot of applications built on top of it. And they are going to be an interesting competitor going forward.</p><p>I think Bill's return to the company, while it hasn't been heralded, has made a very big difference. I mean, I have always had -- I mean, when competing with Bill over the years, always thought he is a very smart guy. And he is. And he is helping a lot over there. Yes, sir?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Ryan (inaudible - microphone inaccessible) Cantor Fitzgerald. Just a question on the -- a lot of media reports around consolidation in the industry lately. Not small companies, massive companies -- EMC, HP, and a couple of their big IT vendors who were mentioned.</p><p>So I would just be curious in getting your view on the IT landscape. Do you think there is going to be more consolidation among these vendors, big vendors? Last year, you talked about cloud consolidation, but where do you see it and how does this impact Oracle?</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: Well, I think if your business, or if our -- if we hadn't made some moves to the cloud -- in other words, if we just said, okay, we are never going to offer anything in the cloud. We are just going to keep selling on-premises hardware, keep selling on-premises software. That is what we are going to do and that is all we are ever going to do.</p><p>That would be a precarious strategy. I mean, I would not be comfortable with that. I think we can do fine. I don't think on-premise is going away. But I would like to have one foot in on-premise and one foot in the cloud to get some hypergrowth in the cloud. And some decent growth on-premise, so we can grow our profit -- grow our cloud share and grow our profitability at the same time. And we have to grow in both areas, I think.</p><p>But if you look at -- oh, EMC is interesting because of VMware. But VMware, while it has done very well with enterprise customers, has -- is not represented in the cloud at all. There are no cloud companies that use VMware.</p><p>So that is really an enterprise -- kind of an early enterprise software play. Virtualization was a big deal. They were there first, but as you move to the cloud, Azure doesn't use it. Google doesn't use it, Amazon doesn't use it, we don't use it. We use something called Xen, an open-source VM.</p><p>And all the big providers have gone with open source and standards based. And we use a lot of open-source stuff, by the wait, without going into -- it would -- not just Linux, but Xen VM. There's a long list.</p><p>Some of us gets us into trouble because there are -- sometimes there are security issues with open source software, but us along with the rest of the community are working very hard to address those issues.</p><p>But -- so EMC with VMware and in their storage business, VMware nowhere in the cloud. Their storage business really nowhere in the cloud. I mean, that is not good. So people have said well, they haven't grown Oracle -- but Oracle, your growth hasn't been so great.</p><p>If you look at the growth of our software business, it has been pretty good. What has shrunk is our hardware business and our consulting business. But our software business is now in excess of 80 -- what percent is in our business? In the 80%s.</p><p>I know it is in the 80%s. I don't know offhand, but I'm guessing 82%, 80 --? Anyone, no one, but it is almost mid80%s.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: 76%, Larry.</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: Total? That is what I said, mid-80%s. 76%. Okay. We will have to go back and check her math, but she is the boss now. What can I say? I just move on.</p><p>But if you look at our software business, our software business has grown quite well. And our cloud business has gone from nothing a couple years ago to we are the number two player. And I don't think it is -- we are very far away from being the number one player, given the kind of growth we are expecting over the next 24 months in our platform.</p><p>But if you are an HP, what is your -- what are you selling? If you are an IBM, what are you selling? If you are EMC, or -- what are you selling? It is what you have always been selling.</p><p>And as the world changes, if you don't make it across the chasm, you really are a dinosaur. We hope to be the only dinosaur that makes it across the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary. And all those little soft furry mammals -- yummy, yummy, yummy.</p><p>So imagine a velociraptor and a bunny. (laughter). And that is how we see the opportunity, but we have got to make it across. And it is hard.</p><p>And it is not simply a matter of -- in answer to Rick's question, I talked about a lot of the engineering we had to do. And that is a big job. That is just the start. Once you get all of the engineering right, you have got to restructure your sales forces against a whole new set of competitors.</p><p>You got to lower your cost of selling, because the size of a lot of these cloud transactions are smaller than what we are used to doing. We have to add a lot of salespeople to get better coverage, because we can go lower in the market than we used to be able to go.</p><p>And again, we have to change the focus of the sales force from on-prem to cloud. And it is much easier doing a startup, you have got one and only one. You are a startup and you sell on -- selling the cloud and that is all you do. It is very easy to do.</p><p>For us, we have to say that is not priority one anymore. Priority one is ERP in the cloud. Priority one is HTM in the cloud. And we have to get the comps [in]. We have to train the people. We got to get the composition systems right; we got to get the coverage right.</p><p>So there are -- there is a huge amount of engineering work to do on the foundation side and then there is a huge amount of distribution work that has to follow that. And then you have to get your first wave of references and your next generation references for all these new products.</p><p>So it is kind of a startup inside of an existing company. It is very tough. It is a cultural change, structural changes, engineering changes. That is why most companies don't make it across the chasm.</p><p>But the opportunity, the opportunity, if you think about it, just -- let's say you just toss a coin. What happens if we, in fact, make it across the chasm? We with our $5 billion of year of R&amp;D become the cloud company. What happens to the little furry bunnies over there?</p><p>And I think, I think we -- I mean, we got to do it. And I think we are well on our way. And I would say the difference is now we are actually in the cloud. At $2 billion -- just under two -- $1.5 billion a year, we are really in the cloud -- we are in the business.</p><p>We have real customers, real references, we are winning big brands. Not just midmarket -- we are getting some very, very large customers. We are competing aggressively with Salesforce. They beat us more often than we beat them, but we are competing aggressively with Salesforce.</p><p>We are competing aggressively with Workday. We beat them more than they beat us. So we are actually in the game. We are on the field.</p><p>And just kind of -- you are handicapping it. What is the percentage? You are trying to -- you are trying to pick a percentage. What is the likelihood that Oracle actually makes it across the chasm? This big tech company makes it across the chasm to compete with this whole new generation of startups. I think we are the only one.</p><p>SAP hasn't started. You can't just do three acquisitions and say we are in the cloud. We rebuilt all of our ERP. We rebuilt all of our HCM. We rebuilt all of our database. We rebuilt all of our middleware for the cloud. You just can't -- you can't buy three things and say we are in -- hey, we are big in the cloud. Look at our revenue.</p><p>Not the point. So if we make it, we are going to be a very formidable competitor in the cloud and we are going to make it.</p><p>Gentleman right here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. Larry, you see significant upside from the cloud and not from your on-prem business. Where do you see the dollars coming from? Is it just the dinosaurs or is it more internal in terms of IT, et cetera?</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: Well, okay, so that's -- I mean, where are we taking share from? Well, I think we will -- even if we ran Workday completely out of business, it is not very much money, right? You would all yawn. Great job, you ran Workday out of business, who cares? That is $40. Great. What do you --</p><p>So you are right. The big money is replacing -- taking more database share with our platform business from IBM. And to a lesser degree from Microsoft, because Microsoft is actually competing in the cloud with a platform. Microsoft should be able to move their .NET SQL Server applications to their platform.</p><p>I mean why would you come to our platform? The application is built; you can move to Microsoft's platforms at .NET SQL Server application. People do convert from SQL Server to Oracle because they want to go larger scale, handle bigger customers and more data. But if that is not a problem for you, you just move to Microsoft.</p><p>Our customers -- and we have got a lot of them -- will move to our platform. But what -- where do IBM's customers go? Where do the DB2 customers go? Where do the WebSphere DB2 customers go?</p><p>So we think we pick up a huge -- we continue to take share from IBM. We have been taking share from IBM for a very, very, very long time.</p><p>We think in ERP, midrange and high-end ERP, now it is going to be a slow process, but I would love to hear what SAP's plans are. I know they are talking about some simple Edge applications. They have done a few acquisitions.</p><p>They have got nothing. Their last big internal development they canceled. This is by design. Just shut it down. Whoops, it didn't work. They are now obsessed with Hana.</p><p>But they don't even use it. They market it aggressively, but I mean think of how embarrassing it would be for me if I said hey, Oracle Fusion applications run on Hana. But not Oracle database. Pretty preposterous. But all of SAP's cloud apps run on Oracle, not Hana. Everything.</p><p>And they have been obsessed with this. They have had another obsession before that was NetWeaver. So they -- Hasso, bless his heart, has always wanted to be a techie, not an accounting guy, accounting apps guy, and he wanted to be techie.</p><p>So he wants -- first he wanted to compete in middleware and he tried with NetWeaver. And that didn't work out so well. So now he said okay, I couldn't beat Oracle at middleware. I know what I am going to do. I am going to beat Oracle in database.</p><p>Okay. I mean, you can try. I thought that he was insane. I actually said get me the name of that pharmacist. He wants to play us in database. They are the number one ERP company in the world. We are number two. If I were him, I would want to play us in ERP, where they are the leader. They are not in the top 500 in database.</p><p>I know, okay, they bought Sybase. Great. They did Hana. So they want to play us in database and they talk about it and talk about it and they never talk about ERP.</p><p>So they shut down business by design, give up on NetWeaver. And I am telling you they don't use Hana. What does that say? How long have they been talking about Hana? Rick, you have been a big Hana supporter. How long have they been talking about Hana?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Right about four years.</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: About four years. Rick -- I know Rick has been really saying this thing looks really good. Why do you think they don't use it?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: They are porting all of their products over to it.</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: Yes, four years to -- okay. They are porting all of their products over to it, right. Okay, so they have had four years. They don't use it. They don't use it. It is astonishing.</p><p>And that is where they are putting their marketing efforts. That is where their ego is. That is where their R&amp;D is. They lost a lot of key people, including the primary architects of Hana.</p><p>And I am telling you it is not going to work. It is going to be like NetWeaver. It is an unmitigated disaster. But that is not the problem. Hana never needed to work. NetWeaver never needed to work.</p><p>What needs to work is ERP. That is their business. At least 98% of their business. And they have not started moving that to the cloud. What are they going to do?</p><p>So where is the money going to come from? IBM, SAP. We are going to -- one by one, we are going to take a lot -- starting in the midmarket, we are going to take ERP customers from them. And they got no answers. They got no -- they got nothing.</p><p>Now people don't make ERP changes every day, but if you want ERP in the cloud, you can't get it from SAP. So that is another huge reservoir of money, answering your question. So IBM, SAP.</p><p>And strangely enough, though it sounds funny. A lot of the hardware companies, because we sell storage-as-a-service and we sell compute-as-a-service. So now when you buy our ERP applications, it comes with storage and it comes with compute and it comes with networking and all that stuff.</p><p>So -- and we charge -- and you -- over a ten-year period, you pay a lot more for our ERP as a service than you would pay for the license on-premise with support. And the reason you pay more is we do more.</p><p>We do the backups, we do the resource, we do the upgrades, so you get a much higher quality of service. But also we provide the computers. We provide compute and storage and networking and all that other jazz.</p><p>And that means companies aren't going to -- especially in the midmarket, companies aren't going to be buying servers. They are not going to be buying storage. So that is also money that can come to us.</p><p>So in this massive shift, as computing begins to look like a utility, we have our traditional competitors -- SAP in ERP applications, and IBM in database, and Java in middleware.</p><p>And then we have people we really, historically, have not been competing with, which are kind of all of these different server companies. And whether it is an Intel server running Linux, or a Windows Intel server running Windows, or a UNIX server running IBM AIX, doesn't really matter.</p><p>We don't -- we think people are going to be buying less and less of those. And they are going to be buying a lot of that stuff in the cloud. Again, it is just a gradual trend. Especially in the midmarket.</p><p>In the high-end, our engineered systems are still growing nicely. People like engineered systems, because people are coming to expect their suppliers to do the system integration so they don't have to.</p><p>Why do I like the cloud? I like the cloud because it includes compute and storage and memory and the operating system and the VM and the database and the Java platform and the application and the service to upgrade it and back it up and run the whole thing.</p><p>I like it because -- so the cloud provider, the cloud services provider integrated all those pieces for me. I don't have to. I don't have to.</p><p>Same idea behind engineered systems. Exadata -- it includes storage and networking and the VM and the OS and the database. And we will manage it for you, if you want us to our not. If you don't want us to be attached to the system.</p><p>But it is a lot easier for you to manage, because when we patch an Exadata system, we send you one file and it patches the firmware and the VM and the OS and the database all at once. And it has all been tested. Together.</p><p>So the fact that we have these pre-integrated suites of hardware and software that go on-premise. We have the cloud, obviously, pre-integrated and you just access over the Internet as a service.</p><p>Kind of the same benefits. Getting the labor out of enterprise IT. Getting the human element, the cost of the labor, and the human errors, and the project delays, and the overruns, and all of those things out. Because suddenly, the supplier is responsible for the integration -- doing the integration, not the enterprise customer.</p><p>And we think that is attractive in the cloud, obviously. But we also think for those banks that are not going to move to the cloud overnight, we think an Exadata sure makes more sense than buying your own storage, your own network, your operating system, your own servers, your own virtual machine, your own database, and piecing it all together and patching it all separately.</p><p>Think about what happens when you become a new -- Red Hat comes out with a new version of Linux, VMware comes out with a new version of VMware, Oracle comes out with the new version of the Oracle database. The server manufacturer changes the storage firmware.</p><p>I mean, it costs a lot to keep that stuff current and there are -- and who does the testing? The customer does the testing. The customer is the system integrator. It is a very bad model. It is a very inefficient model. So we like our cloud business and we like our engineered system business. Yes, sir?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible - microphone inaccessible) SaaS company. You said you thought you could be the largest SaaS company in a couple years. And if you look at Salesforce's growth rate, if they grow at a similar declining rate for the next couple of years, they will be an $8 billion company.</p><p>And if you grow at a mid-30%s rate, over the next couple of years, you will be a $4 billion company, so -- ?</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: No, we are certainly planning to grow in excess of 50% a year in SaaS. So I mean, our internal plans are well above 50%. And remember, Salesforce has to make the right acquisitions to keep growing at that rate and they have to continue enjoying almost no competition.</p><p>So we think we can slow Salesforce down and accelerate our business. So we are not -- our business has got to be the first digit of growth that we are targeting is a five and -- but not five zero. Maybe mid-50%, let's say.</p><p>And that is not including pass. So our intent -- we think we can and should be the number one SaaS company, because we have -- we think we are very strong -- we are kind of the pioneer in the ERP, midrange in high-end ERP.</p><p>NetSuite is a pioneer of ERP and kind of mid to low. We are the pioneer mid-to-high ERP. We think that is a very valuable market for us and we are way in front of anybody. So we think we can be, clearly, the number one player there.</p><p>We are worldwide -- are we the number one player in HCM? Probably. I mean it is close. But we think we are ahead of Workday. And we are certain in the last couple of quarters, we sold more customers -- we had more wins than Workday.</p><p>We are number one in marketing. We think we are slightly in front of Salesforce in service. We just added Fields Serv -- we just had a Field Service acquisition. We can keep on adding around.</p><p>We have got a very strong data -- data business is new for us, but we think it -- we are very optimistic about that. We think it can strengthen our -- it helps us strengthen -- it is an all new business for us and strengthens our position in marketing.</p><p>We have such a large part -- we are number one in recruiting and talent management. We have such a large portfolio of products. And the real challenge, since we have done, I think, a pretty good job of engineering and acquiring -- and I'll just list the things we bought versus what our competitors bought.</p><p>I think we bought at better prices and better assets. We have been the first mover in acquisitions. And we have been building for the last decade -- or almost last decade, ERP/HCM sales, things like that.</p><p>We have got a very strong portfolio. Now the big thing is getting all of the secular sales forces lined up to compete with Salesforce in sales. To compete with Salesforce in service and compete with Workday in core HCM.</p><p>And just blaze a trail -- compete with ourselves, compete with ourselves in midrange and high-end ERP. Just go ahead and aggressively pioneer that market.</p><p>So we think we have all the -- we the right portfolio to do that and then a very strong platform underneath, which is a differentiator at the SaaS level. In other words, if you are buying HCM SaaS, do you want to buy -- let's say the products are equivalent. I think our product is much better than theirs. Ours is social; theirs is not social.</p><p>But without going into that big argument, why we are better than Workday. We have a platform that allows you to extend those applique -- our HCM application and connect it to other applications. They don't have a platform that they sell. They have nothing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible - microphone inaccessible) without acquisitions? Is that an organic type of number?</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: Well, the organic number actually is -- if you look at our organic, what we built, I mean, our organics is way over 100%. And so -- and unfortunately, it is a small number -- it is a fairly small number.</p><p>But yes, no, we will continue to look at acquisitions. There's not a lot out there. Let me tell you. We looked at Concur. We looked at Concur and thought it was -- again, I know I am just sitting here knocking SAP.</p><p>Why do we want to do travel expenses? How is that strategic? How does that help us? What other products -- the simple question is what other products did it help us sell?</p><p>Again, we say suites win, right. The big thing. We think talent management helps us sell core HCM. Core HCM helps us sell talent management. It is the same buyer.</p><p>ERP -- general ledger payables receivable helps us sell enterprise performance management, budgeting, and reporting. And so enterprise performance manages -- management helps us sell ERP. HRP helped us sell EPM.</p><p>They are related products. Same CFO is very interested in both. Same buyer would like to buy the suite.</p><p>With Concur, if we had bought Concur, how do we leverage that into selling more products? That is what we did -- we didn't buy. We could have bought Ariba. We have much more money than SAP.</p><p>We could have bought Ariba and SuccessFactors and Concur. No problem. There would not be a problem. We have a lot more money than they do.</p><p>None of them were deemed strategic. Ariba doesn't have -- they don't even use the Ariba software at SAP. They just use the procurement network. They still use their own procurement software.</p><p>Concur -- there is no leverage out of Concur. It is a very high priced product. And maybe they can convince some analysts, look how big we are in the cloud. There is no growth in Concur.</p><p>So it would slow down our growth. You would complain. If we bought Concur, it would cost us a lot of money and it would slow down our cloud growth. Except for the first year, which would create the illusion of growth.</p><p>We have got hypergrowth from our Fusion apps. Again, we think ERP is just a matter of getting the sales force focused. Okay, guys, stop selling on-prem in the midmarket and just sell cloud, cloud, cloud, cloud. Get all that done.</p><p>We are -- we have kind of won the battle against Workday in Europe and outside the US and we are still fighting in the US. Finish that. Get that thing won.</p><p>And then continue chipping away at Salesforce's 15-year lead. We think our sales products -- well, we are ahead of them in marketing. We are ahead of them in service, but -- in their strength. In their strength.</p><p>We have got to compete aggressively in their strength, where our pitch is we have tools to help you sell more. We do more than simply manage your opportunities and forecast the quarter. We also have tools that allow you to engineer sales processes and actually sell more.</p><p>So we have just got to compete aggressively on all of those areas. And even without additional acquisitions, we think we can maintain that mid-50%s.</p><p>It is not a matter of we got to look for a big acquisition to do that. By the way, there are no big acquisitions left. I mean, what -- we have looked around. When we look -- you look at TOA Field Service, we were buying a relatively small business that had very good technology that we can grow.</p><p>Good corps of engineers, good core of customers, but a relatively small business. It wasn't for that one shot of the illusion of growth through acquisitions. But that is a business we think we can grow. I don't think SAP can grow Concur.</p><p>So -- but again, your question is do we need to make big acquisitions to get to the mid-50%s. No.</p><p>BILL WHYMAN, ANALYST, ISI GROUP: Bill Whyman from ISI. So 10 years ago, you said the tech industry wouldn't growth, that the leading companies would do nicely, but the industry over all wouldn't. Cloud would seem to put that on steroids.</p><p>What do you think, if anything, has changed, what would were your next chapter be, and what does that imply about M&amp;A -- not just in software that you talked about, but across software and hardware?</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: Okay, so are you saying cloud is making -- I am not sure what your question was. Did you say cloud is really making the industry grow rapidly or cloud is proving it is not growing rapidly? What does cloud prove?</p><p>BILL WHYMAN: Cloud would seem to deflate tech spending, which you had indicated as well.</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: So you are saying cloud has depressed overall tech spending, including cloud?</p><p>BILL WHYMAN: Everything. Hardware, software, services.</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: Right and I think that is right. I think cloud has hurt the traditional vendors. I totally agree with that. However, if we make it across into cloud -- I will tell you who it's really hurt are the system integrators.</p><p>So I don't think it has hurt our business. I don't think it has hurt our business. The -- if it has, it is a very small -- it is a very, very small amount. And I think, ultimately, it is destined to dramatically help our business, because we think we can deploy our software assets and our hardware assets very effectively and package them in the cloud. And that is what we are going to do.</p><p>But it is much harder for an IBM to do that. It is much harder for an EMC to do that. And so a lot of these guys -- I mean, there are companies I think that are really under a lot of -- big companies that are under a lot of stress.</p><p>We look at that as an opportunity to take money that would have gone to IBM middleware and IBM database and get that as part of our platform service.</p><p>We look at it -- money that would have gone to EMC to buy disk drives and HP to buy servers and get that as part of our infrastructure service. So the thing in the cloud, you have to have -- we don't want to sell just infrastructure.</p><p>Infrastructure, for better or for worse, is a commodity. You are competing with -- it has got Amazon prices and Google prices and you are selling compute and storage. And are we going to sell that? Yes. Is that where we are going to make our money? No.</p><p>I mean, yes, we got to sell infrastructure as a service and yes, it is profitable. Believe it or not, even those low prices is profitable. But we make our money on platform-as-a-service. We make our money on software-as-a-service, the application layers.</p><p>And then we deliver infrastructure-as-a-service at the same price as Amazon, but with more security and more reliability. And with one security model. So you can buy -- it is one-stop shopping for the whole thing.</p><p>You move some applications to infrastructure-as-a-service, some applications to Java-as-a-service, some to database -- the database is the database-as-a-service -- and you buy some number of SaaS applications. You build some -- you extend some, you build some stuff around -- blah, blah, blah.</p><p>That is what -- who else offers that? Kind of Microsoft. No one else offers that. So we think with that huge portfolio, when we sell a cloud service, we get paid for the software. We get paid for the hardware.</p><p>We get paid for the labor, the service about -- well, actually, there is not much labor in backing stuff up, because it is highly automated. There is not much labor in upgrading our software, because it is highly automated. But we get paid for all of those additional services that right now is done by human beings at the enterprise level.</p><p>So we are -- we also do the integration. We do all the integration, which is done by the customer or the system integrator. So the biggest move -- the biggest problem in terms of the industry getting smaller is the labor being automated away.</p><p>As the labor gets automated away and the system integrators get smaller and smaller and these -- I mean, you remember how big an SAP implementation was for a big company? Anyone remember? Yes, I mean, it was just astounding.</p><p>That is not going to happen anymore. That is huge amounts of money. The EMC storage business. I mean a lot of these businesses -- if you look at what Amazon charges for storage and what EMC charges for storage, it is a big gap. That is going to be -- it is a problem if what you sell is storage. These are commodities.</p><p>But we are not in a lot of commodity businesses. I mean, we have some commodity hardware businesses and they are getting smaller. Our engineered -- our non-commodity hardware businesses are growing nicely: Engineered Systems, Exadata, Exalytics, Exalogic, our Big Data machine, which runs Hadoop, by the way.</p><p>So we have got out lot of engineered systems. SPARC SuperCluster -- all of these things. Our zero data loss backup appliance. I mean, a lot of these -- they are a collection of hardware and software all pre-integrated, which are designed to take the labor out. You don't do the integrations.</p><p>And what we are trying to do is get rid of all of that integration money that is spent. Plus, think about the number of errors that are made as every company does their own unique SAP, ERP implementation.</p><p>I mean, it is not just the system integrator, but how much of the IT Department of that consuming company spend in terms of labor to put that thing in and then upgrade it and upgrade it again. And then bring in the EMC drives and blah, blah, and this other stuff and the HP servers.</p><p>And so we think we have an opportunity to package those technologies in the cloud with lots of differentiation and lots of value-add and make our business grow really nicely at the expense of other people.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE: This will be last question.</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: (laughter). Yes, ma'am. Okay, boss. Last question. This is hard. Could I have two? (laughter).</p><p>KARL KEIRSTEAD, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK: Karl Keirstead of Deutsche Bank. Larry, it would be a shame for you to leave without taking the CEO question, so I will ask it and there's two parts. One is I am wondering if you could give us some context to your decision to give up the CEO title, that is the easy one.</p><p>And then the other one I would love some color on is how things might change now that you have got more time to devote to the technology function?</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: Okay, I think -- I don't think there are going to be any large changes. I mean, it has always been a team effort for a very, very long time. So Safra and Mark have been running the vast majority of the Company for a long time.</p><p>I have run engineering at Oracle from day one and I continue to run engineering now. With extraordinarily able help of Thomas Kurian and John Fowler and Ed Scrivens, so with a phenomenal team of people.</p><p>But it has always been a team effort. I think we get along very well. I mean, we are all kinds of -- we are all both specialists and generalists. I think we all, if we have to, can go out and sell. We all -- if we have to, we can go out and manage processes and do all of those things.</p><p>I think we can all analyze acquisitions and figure out if it is accretive or dilutive and all of those. I think, but frankly, I specialize in the product areas. Safra runs everything from finance and legal to manufacturing and what we will call the back office in the broadest sense. And Mark runs everything that is customer facing.</p><p>And does it mean I am going to stop making sales calls? No. But it really means that they get the recognition that they have long deserved. They have been doing this job for a very, very long time. And I have been focusing on engineering for a very, very long time.</p><p>We will continue to work together as a team. I think we get along very well. It is not as a matter -- an issue that like Lincoln and his -- believe it or not, I don't want to compare myself to Lincoln -- but Lincoln after Reconstruction held a vote and there were all nays in the Cabinet and one aye and Lincoln overruled everybody.</p><p>That is not how we work. It is not that we are consensus managers. It is just that we discussed everything thoroughly. And I think people with the same facts and who are good at reasoning tend to agree.</p><p>And I think we are all very fact-based. I think we are all slaves to reason and we communicate well together and we tend to agree on things and work extremely well as a team. And for me, it was important that both of these guys get the recognition and the credits that they deserve.</p><p>I mean, they really have been running their parts of the Company for a very, very long time and the world should know that. Their titles are now correct.</p><p>And I have always wanted to be -- I like the product. It is my favorite part of the business. It is where I started -- I started as a computer programmer. And I will, as I said on stage, I am excited about my new job. I am excited about all of the things we have in the pipeline that has just come out.</p><p>And you ain't seen nothing yet. I mean, we spent a lot of money on R&amp;D and I think we get good return on our investments. So I am very excited to be on the team and we are all in it to win it. And these guys -- again, these guys now have the titles they have long deserved.</p><p>And this is the last question.</p><p>JAMES GILMAN, ANALYST, DREXEL HAMILTON: Thank you, Larry. James Gilman, Drexel Hamilton. You have a very exciting vision going forward. My question, though, portends around vendor lock-in. Division would say that single source supplier, but I think enterprises want to avoid that vendor lock-in. Can you comment on that? Thank you.</p><p>LARRY ELLISON: Well, if that was true, no one would buy from Workday and no one would buy from Salesforce. It would be great. So if you build an application on force.com, let me tell you where you can run it. On a computer owned by Marc Benioff. That is it. And let me tell you how much you pay. Whatever he wants you to pay.</p><p>If you build an application on our platform, you write it in Java in the Oracle database. Where can you run it? You can run in your datacenter. You can run it on Amazon.com. You can run it on -- in the Microsoft cloud. Azure.</p><p>I mean, you got lots of choices. You can move it back off our cloud. Our stuff is all standards-based. There is no lock-in in our platform. Their platform exists one and only one place. It is 100% proprietary, runs on one set of computers, the computers owned by salesforce.com.</p><p>Workday. Same thing. I mean the only place you can buy Workday is Workday.</p><p>We -- our -- the bulk of our business, our platform business, our Java business. Java is open source, for God's sakes. Java is open source standards-based. The Oracle database is based on standards. Hundreds of industry standards. There is no lock-in.</p><p>You can actually -- that is why people move from DB2 to Oracle. That is why people move from SQL Server to Oracle. God forbid, I hope that no one moves from Oracle to SQL Server.</p><p>Maybe it has happened; maybe one guy some place in Mongolia did that. Nothing against Mongolia. I love Mongolia. I used - I've ridden horses in Mongolia. It is a fantastic place. Great history.</p><p>But there is no lock-in with our platform. There is a lock-in with the Salesforce platform. And there is no lock-in with the Workday platform, because they don't have one.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

But in January, CEO <person><nameText>Larry Ellison </nameText></person>emphatically denied speculation that Oracle planned to make major cuts in Sun's work force, which was then about 27,000.</p><p>At that time, he said he planned to hire about 2,000 people in sales and engineering jobs \"to beef up Sun's business,\" while adding that he would cut about 1,000 jobs that involved administration or other redundant functions.</p><p>Last month, however, Ellison told a Reuters news service reporter that Oracle had found many examples of inefficiency as they reviewed Sun's operations. Though widely respected for its technological innovations, Sun had struggled financially in recent years. Sun cut about 3,000 jobs last fall while the Oracle deal was pending.</p><p>Oracle executives have repeatedly said they expect to make Sun's operations profitable by improving efficiency and combining Sun's intellectual property with Oracle software to create new, high-performance computing systems for commercial use.</p><p>But a report last week by industry research firm IDC shows Sun's core business has continued to decline. IDC estimated Sun's revenue from selling computer servers declined almost 32 percent, from $1 billion in the first quarter of 2009 to $683 million in the first quarter of 2010, while Hewlett-Packard and Dell both increased their share of the server market, at Sun's expense.</p><p>Oracle's announcement caps a week of mixed news for big tech company hiring. HP said Tuesday that it will cut about 9,000 jobs over the next few years as it automates and consolidates some of its computer centers, while adding about 6,000 jobs in sales and other functions.</p><p>Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers, however, said Friday that his company will \"accelerate\" hiring and will add about 4,000 jobs this year, or about 1,000 more than he previously indicated when discussing hiring plans in February.</p><p>Contact Brandon Bailey at 408-920-5022.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-15229358</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SANJOSEMNG2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7YN8-6Y30-Y9NC-P121-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 San Jose Mercury News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>San Jose Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>June 4, 2010 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000243V</classCode><className>ORACLE AMERICA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001P56</classCode><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC7379 COMPUTER RELATED SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC7371 COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS334118 COMPUTER TERMINAL &amp;

A empresa se junta \u00e0 gigante Microsoft na disputa pelo app, que pode ser banido dos EUA caso as opera\u00e7\u00f5es no pa\u00eds n\u00e3o sejam vendidas para alguma empresa americana at\u00e9 novembro. A Oracle est\u00e1 trabalhando com um grupo de investidores americanos que j\u00e1 det\u00e9m participa\u00e7\u00e3o na ByteDance, empresa chinesa que desenvolveu o TikTok, que inclui a General Atlantic e a Sequoia Capital, informa o brit\u00e2nico Financial Times . Al\u00e9m das opera\u00e7\u00f5es no territ\u00f3rio norte-americano, o neg\u00f3cio envolve o controle do aplicativo no Canad\u00e1, na Austr\u00e1lia e na Nova Zel\u00e2ndia.   ASSINE VEJA    A encruzilhada econ\u00f4mica de Bolsonaro Na edi\u00e7\u00e3o da semana: os riscos da estrat\u00e9gia de gastar muito para impulsionar a economia. E mais: pesquisa exclusiva revela que o brasileiro \u00e9, sim, racista  Clique e Assine   Estimativas apontam que o valor dos neg\u00f3cios do TikTok nos EUA podem variar entre 20 e 50 bilh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares. Com valor de mercado  na casa dos 166 bilh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares, a Oracle possu\u00eda aproximadamente 43 bilh\u00f5es em caixa no fim de maio. No quarto trimestre fiscal da multinacional de tecnologia, a receita caiu 6%, o que representa uma queda de 10,4 bilh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares. A empresa sofre forte concorr\u00eancia da Amazon, do Google e da pr\u00f3pria Microsoft no servi\u00e7o de computa\u00e7\u00e3o em nuvem. \u00c0s 16h20, as a\u00e7\u00f5es da Oracle subiam 1,83% na Bolsa de Nova York.    A venda da opera\u00e7\u00e3o do TikTok nos EUA movimenta o mercado corporativo ap\u00f3s uma decis\u00e3o do presidente americano, Donald Trump.\u201d H\u00e1 evid\u00eancias confi\u00e1veis \u200b\u200bque me levam a acreditar que a ByteDance pode tomar medidas que ameacem prejudicar a seguran\u00e7a nacional dos EUA\u201d, disse, em meio ao acirramento das tens\u00f5es com a China e suas empresas de tecnologia. Por recomenda\u00e7\u00e3o do Comit\u00ea de Investimento Estrangeiro nos Estados Unidos, o presidente americano expediu um decreto na \u00faltima sexta-feira, 14, que prev\u00ea justamente o banimento do aplicativo em 90 dias caso nenhuma transa\u00e7\u00e3o seja acertada at\u00e9 l\u00e1 . \u201cComo j\u00e1 afirmamos, 100 milh\u00f5es de americanos adoram o TikTok porque \u00e9 um local de entretenimento, autoexpress\u00e3o e conex\u00e3o social. Estamos decididos a continuar levando alegria \u00e0s fam\u00edlias e carreiras significativas aos que criam em nossa plataforma durante muitos anos\u201d, declarou um porta-voz da ByteDance em resposta ao decreto.    A entrada da Oracle na jogada ocorre porque o bilion\u00e1rio Larry Elisson, co-fundador da empresa, \u00e9 um dos poucos empres\u00e1rios do Vale do Sil\u00edcio que apoiam abertamente Donald Trump, tanto que no \u00faltimo m\u00eas de fevereiro o magnata organizou \u2014 em sua propriedade na Calif\u00f3rnia \u2014 um evento de arrecada\u00e7\u00e3o de fundos para a campanha do republicano. Apesar da rela\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00f3xima entre eles, a Casa Branca ainda n\u00e3o se posicionou sobre algum tipo de apoio para alguma das empresas envolvidas no neg\u00f3cio. At\u00e9 ent\u00e3o, a Microsoft despontava como a favorita para a corrida. A big tech fundada por Bill Gates chegou a cogitar, inclusive, a compra das opera\u00e7\u00f5es globais do TikTok, mas a desenvolvedora da rede social chinesa recha\u00e7ou qualquer possibilidade de incluir novos pa\u00edses al\u00e9m dos j\u00e1 envolvidos atualmente. De toda forma, qualquer transa\u00e7\u00e3o ter\u00e1 que enfrentar uma lista de desafios, o principal deles \u00e9 separar a tecnologia de apoio do TikTok da tecnologia da ByteDance, raz\u00e3o pela qual Donald Trump exige a venda do aplicativo nos EUA, em vista que acusa a desenvolvedora chinesa de espionar os usu\u00e1rios americanos para o governo chin\u00eas.  Continua ap\u00f3s a publicidade   Com a chegada da Oracle ao pleito, as chances do Twitter, que demonstrou interesse na disputa , se tornaram ainda mais remotas, em vista que a rede social teria pouco tempo para levantar o capital necess\u00e1rio para a opera\u00e7\u00e3o. O Twitter tem uma capitaliza\u00e7\u00e3o de mercado de cerca de 30 bilh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares, praticamente o valor de ativos do TikTok a ser alienado. Por outro lado, joga a favor da companhia comandada por Jack Dorsey o fato de que sua oferta enfrentaria menos entraves regulat\u00f3rios do que a da Microsoft, por exemplo, e que tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o passaria por press\u00f5es da China, uma vez que n\u00e3o atua no pa\u00eds.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNPT-42868924503</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNWBR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60MG-TW21-JCSC-J17S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398829</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"748\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Veja on-line</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - Portuguese</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>18 Agosto 2020 Ter\u00e7a-feira</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>PORTUGUESE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>PORTUGU\u00caS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Brazil</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>South America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A39R</classCode><className>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>PE0009THX</classCode><className>DONALD TRUMP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC338</classCode><className>BRAZIL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GR122</classCode><className>SOUTH AMERICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Instead, a program called MySQL, available for less than half of Oracle's $2-million-plus list price, scored about the same.</p><p>\"Everybody scratched their head,\" Offutt recalled last week. And Southlake, Texas-based Sabre signed up for MySQL, an open-source product along the lines of Linux that is distributed, usually at low or no cost, by a small Swedish firm also named MySQL. Sabre joined an impressive customer lineup that includes Yahoo Inc., Google Inc.and Cisco Systems Inc.</p><p>Oracle was once the clear leader in the $14-billion global market for database programs, which allow operations dealing with masses of information to store, retrieve and manipulate figures. But Oracle has been scrambling recently to deal with stiff competition.</p><p>Although Oracle's total database-related revenue of $7.7 billion is greater than IBM Corp.'s, for example, Big Blue passed Redwood City, Calif.-based Oracle in sales of new databases three years ago. And although overall sales of new databases increased 5% in 2003, Oracle's new database sales grew by just 2.4%, putting it just shy of IBM with about one-third of the market. IBM is the foe Oracle faces most often when it bids for big-dollar contracts.</p><p>Oracle's efforts to diversify by selling business software tools that run on top of its database programs -- the market where PeopleSoft plays -- aren't faring much better. Documents introduced during the antitrust trial over Oracle's hostile bid for PeopleSoft show that Oracle often slashes its list prices for such software by 70% or more and still loses deals to Pleasanton, Calif.-based PeopleSoft or to the biggest maker of such programs, SAP of Germany.</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft Corp., which enjoys a massive development budget and the ability to sell customers a full set of interlocking programs, is taking share from Oracle on the low end of the market with its own database program, called SQL Server. (SQL refers to a standard computer language for dealing with databases.) Microsoftwon 19% of the global market for new database installations last year.</p><p>In testimony at the antitrust trial, Ellison and his colleagues were motivated to paint a bleak picture of Oracle's competitive prospects. U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker might be more inclined to let Oracle continue its quest for PeopleSoft, over the objections of government regulators, if he agrees that Oracle is facing threats from all sides and that its best shot at long-term survival was to get bigger.</p><p>Walker is scheduled to hear closing arguments July 20.</p><p>Industry analysts, database customers and competitors agree that Oracle is exaggerating the predictions of its possible demise. But they also concur that Ellison is correct in concluding that the database market has fundamentally changed.</p><p>\"Are they going to grow the way they're used to growing in the database market? No,\" said Gartner Inc. database analyst Donald Feinberg.</p><p>One reason is MySQL, which Feinberg said \"could become a major player\" in the next three to five years.</p><p>Oracle executives declined to be interviewed for this story.</p><p>But at least in the past the company recognized the power of open-source software. Oracle was an early champion of Linux, the computer operating system program developed through a worldwide collaboration of volunteers. Oracle introduced a version of its database that could run on Linux in 1998, before most other big tech companies embraced it.</p><p>Since then, Oracle has tied its fortunes to the operating system by designing products to work on bundles of cheap, Linux-powered machines. The company even offers to oversee its customers' use of Linux when Oracle databases are used on top of it. In that way, Oracle has helped Linux reach deep into big companies, where its use is now routine.</p><p>MySQL could follow a similar trajectory. In court, Oracle President Safra Catz testified that she viewed MySQL as a competitor.</p><p>The first version of MySQL came out in 1996, the work of Michael \"Monty\" Widenius of Finland, where Linux also began. He and a colleague were developing a system for a large retail chain to keep track of its inventory. As they added more functions, \"it started looking like a database,\" said friend Marten Micklos, an entrepreneur later recruited as privately owned MySQL's chief executive.</p><p>The team's free release attracted hundreds of thousands of users, and in 2000 the company shifted to an unusual two-tier method of distribution. The most basic software and its underlying code are still available free of charge and are downloaded 35,000 times daily; 5 million copies already have been installed, making it the fourth-most-used database in the world.</p><p>Versions with more features or technical support are sold for as little as $249 per computer, compared with about $5,000 for a bare-bones Oracle installation. Sabre and other large customers often buy even more sophisticated types of MySQL and install them on hundreds of machines.</p><p>By revenue, MySQL has less than one tenth of 1% of the market, but sales have doubled annually for three years and now stand at $12 million. The company turns a small profit from its operations and hasn't touched the $20 million it received from venture-capital investors last year. Industry analysts at San Francisco brokerage Thomas Weisel Partners estimate that MySQL is a contender for as much as 20% of new database deals.</p><p>The easy availability of MySQL has popularized the technology, attracted helpful reports of bugs and kept the company's full-time staff of 50 engineers motivated to make continual improvements to the product, Micklos said.</p><p>Knowing anyone can see their work, \"those who produce it have much higher pride,\" Micklos said. \"Frontyard gardens are in much better shape than backyard gardens.\"</p><p>MySQL will never have the same overwhelming army of unpaid contributors that has fashioned Linux into the most serious threat to Microsoft's ubiquitous Windows operating system.</p><p>Database expertise is more rare, and fewer people need a database than an operating system, the core ingredient on any computer.</p><p>All that means MySQL isn't likely to steal Oracle's most lucrative contracts. In any case, Micklos said it wasn't in his company's DNA to shoot for the highest-function needs of the Fortune 500. </p><p>\"I'm absolutely convinced there will always be a high end of the database market, where you can charge any price you can think of,\" he said. \"We produce at low cost and we sell at low cost. We try to be the Ikea of databases.\"</p><p>In order to move upstream, MySQL would need to make major upgrades to the main product and get other companies to sell programs that use the database for managing sales, payroll and other business functions. SAP is working on such programs, but they will take a few years to develop, Micklos said.</p><p>\"That's the key event that needs to happen in order for MySQL to be validated in the marketplace and really move forward,\" Gartner's Feinberg said.</p><p>In the meantime, the database is creeping into big companies from the ground up. At Yahoo, software developer and MySQL expert Jeremy Zawodny first used it to run Yahoo Finance.</p><p>\"It was a success, and within the next year, I had all these groups at the company banging on my door\" to help them extend the database to Yahoo News, the My Yahoo personalized portal and elsewhere.</p><p>Other pieces of Yahoo run on more established databases. Yet even where MySQL doesn't win, it is taking a bite out of Oracle's bottom line.</p><p>At Sabre, Offutt decided that MySQL was good enough for the air travel system, where many more people look at prices than make reservations. For hotels, where the ratio of \"lookers to bookers\" is lower and transactions are more common, he decided to go with Oracle.</p><p>After losing the airfare contract, \"Oracle came back with some extremely aggressive pricing, something we've never seen,\" Offutt said.</p><p>That oft-repeated scenario is beginning to make Oracle executives nervous, analysts said. They said the company could afford a price war with SAP and PeopleSoft over the business software they all sell.</p><p>It can't afford to be the next victim of the open-source movement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: <person><nameText>Larry Ellison  </nameText></person></p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LATE-V914HLL6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAT2004</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4CV7-5MF0-TW84-N2XX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1433\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2004 Los Angeles Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName> Los Angeles Times</publicationName><edition>Home Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2004\"><dateText>July 12, 2004 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00028M2</classCode><className>SABRE HOLDINGS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002D0X</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0001T6V</classCode><className>YAHOO!

The case will be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court on March 24.</p><p>Google declined to comment to Bloomberg, though the publication notes that the Mountain View-based web search and advertising giant has provided funding to at least 10 organizations that have filed briefs to support its claims in the case.</p><p>According to Bloomberg, IAP President Mike Davis said in a statement that Oracle did not fund the amicus brief, and that his group does not disclose the identity of its backers.

But, he said, if there are fewer big players competing, smaller players will become more visible on customers' radar.</p><p> \"There will be a scramble for the so-called strong third,\" Wall said. \"There will be companies that will portray themselves as the strong answer to Oracle and PeopleSoft.\"</p><p> Jim Kizielewicz, vice president of marketing at Kronos, agreed.</p><p> \"I think they're right,\" he said. \"To be honest with you, I'd love to see Oracle buy PeopleSoft. From our perspective, there will be nothing but good news in terms of impact on our company. \u2026 We think we'll get pulled into more deals.\"</p><p> And the expected layoffs that would follow a merger would also give smaller firms such as Kronos an opportunity to recruit talent, he said.</p><p> \"It would be a great opportunity for us to pick up some people,\" he said. \"The fear, uncertainty and doubt it creates is good for us.\"</p><p> Gary Beach, publisher of CIO magazine, said Oracle's argument underscores the difficulty of defining the different segments within the software market, which includes firms that make operating systems and different kinds of applications.</p><p> But he said that if Oracle succeeds in buying PeopleSoft, its dominant position would worry many chief information officers.</p><p> Beach pointed out that while there are many other software firms that compete with Oracle, \"lots of them are small businesses that cannot set standards and cannot move markets.\"</p><p> Kizielewicz of Kronos underscored this point as he described the competition between big tech companies like Oracle and PeopleSoft, which offer a broad portfolio of products to customers, and smaller players that specialize in specific areas such as supply chain or payroll management.</p><p> \"The big guys like Oracle and PeopleSoft say, 'We're one vendor, and you can buy everything from us,' \" he said. \"We say, 'Yeah, they're one vendor, but if something goes wrong, and you're with the wrong vendor, you're in trouble.' \"</p><p> Referring to the proposed merger, he added: \"If you're looking to standardize on one vendor, it does limit choices.\"</p><p> Despite what Oracle sees as parallels between its hostile bid and the SunGard-Comdisco deal, there are also major differences that could work against the software firm.</p><p> For one thing, the Justice Department had only 17 days to investigate and then subsequently try to block SunGard's acquisition, which gave the federal government little time to prepare a stronger case.</p><p> But that's not the situation with the Oracle bid -- the Justice Department has been looking into the deal for eight months.</p><p> Oracle appears to face stronger opposition from PeopleSoft customers than SunGard did from Comdisco clients.</p><p> Beach said there's also simply more attention focused on the Oracle bid.</p><p> \"Oracle is paying a price for its high profile,\" he said, adding that fewer people cared about the SunGard-Comdisco transaction. \"When you think of SunGard, you think it's sunscreen you put on when you go to the beach.\"</p><p> Still, Wall, the attorney for Oracle, was optimistic: \"The Justice Department wins a lot of cases, but they lose cases, too. This is not a forgone conclusion.\"</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p> HOSTILE HISTORY</p><p> The merger battle between Oracle and PeopleSoft has lasted for nine months, and could drag on a lot longer.</p><p> June, 2003 2: PeopleSoft announces agreement to buy J.D. Edwards for $1.7 billion, solidifying its No. 2 spot in enterprise software behind SAP. 6: Oracle issues $5.1 billion hostile takeover bid for PeopleSoft.  12: PeopleSoft's board rejects Oracle's offer. 13: PeopleSoft says that it has sued to block Oracle's bid and that it faces six lawsuits from shareholders angry that the board nixed the Oracle offer.  16: PeopleSoft accelerates its merger with J.D. Edwards and says it is offering a money-back deal to reassure customers nervous about the proposed takeover. 18: Oracle increases its PeopleSoft bid from $16 to $19.50 per share. 20: PeopleSoft's board rejects Oracle's sweetened offer. 30: The Department of Justice opens a review of the proposed merger..</p><p> July, 2003 18: PeopleSoft successfully takes control of J.D. Edwards..</p><p> October, 2003 3: Fueled by positive earnings and forecasts, PeopleSoft stock closes at $19.81 per share, above Oracle's offer price.  27: PeopleSoft discloses it has expanded its money-back offer to customers..</p><p> November, 2003 10: Oracle and a group of shareholders sue to block the expanded money-back offer.  17: The European Commission says its investigation of the proposed merger could take up to four months..</p><p> January, 2004 12: European regulators say they suspended their review of Oracle Corp.'s $7.3 billion bid after the software giant missed a filing deadline. 23: Oracle starts a proxy battle by nominating five candidates for the board of PeopleSoft. If elected, Oracle's candidates would be expected to reverse PeopleSoft's opposition to the buyout offer.</p><p> 24: Oracle vows to introduce an alternative slate of PeopleSoft directors for shareholders to vote on, turning the fight into a proxy battle..</p><p> February, 2004 4: Oracle raises its cash offer 33 percent to $26 per share, valuing the deal at $9.4 billion. 9: PeopleSoft advises its shareholders to reject Oracle's latest bid, saying it is still too low and that the proposal is under too much regulatory scrutiny. 10: The Department of Justice staff recommends that the agency file suit to block Oracle Corp.'s hostile takeover bid on antitrust grounds. 26: The Justice Department files a lawsuit to block Oracle's bid. Oracle says it will \"vigorously\" fight it. The company also says it was withdrawing its nominees for PeopleSoft's board.</p><p> .</p><p> Source: Chronicle research</p><p> Chronicle Graphic</p><p>E-mail Benjamin Pimentel at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bpimentel@sfchronicle.com\">bpimentel@sfchronicle.com</email>.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SFCHRN2004</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8172</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><pageSequence><page/></pageSequence></pagination><wordCount number=\"1314\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName> The San Francisco Chronicle</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4092\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2004 The Chronicle Publishing Co.</copyright><edition>FINAL EDITION</edition><publicationDate month=\"03\" day=\"01\" year=\"2004\"><dateText>MARCH 1, 2004, MONDAY,</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>ORACLE CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>\u00a0SUNGARD DATA SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>\u00a0COMDISCO INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>\u00a0LAWSON SOFTWARE INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0INFOR GLOBAL SOLUTIONS\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>ORCL (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ORCL (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>ORACLE CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>\u00a0SUNGARD DATA SYSTEMS INC \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>\u00a0COMDISCO INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>\u00a0SUNGARD DATA SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>\u00a0LAWSON SOFTWARE INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0JUSTICE DEPARTMENT\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>\u00a0\u00a0ORACLE CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>\u00a0SUNGARD DATA SYSTEMS INC \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>\u00a0COMDISCO INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>\u00a0SUNGARD DATA SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>\u00a0LAWSON SOFTWARE INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>\u00a0\u00a0JUSTICE DEPARTMENT\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST00097CJ</classCode><className>JUSTICE DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000577</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC HUMAN RESOURCES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001040</classCode><className>LITIGATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N922110CC</classCode><className>LAW COURTS &amp;

Some analysts have said an extended delay could lead Oracle to cut more deeply, since uncertainty over Sun's future may be driving more customers to rivals such as Hewlett-Packard and IBM.</p><p>Ellison, who was interviewed on stage by former Sun President <person><nameText>Ed Zander, </nameText></person>also vowed that he will not sell off Sun's open-source database program, known as MySQL. European regulators have raised concerns that Oracle's acquisition of MySQL would discourage competition in the database market. They have said their review may take until January to complete.</p><p>Oracle's own flagship database program doesn't compete with MySQL, Ellison asserted, adding that the two are generally used for different purposes. Oracle sells its database software to big corporations and government agencies that need to crunch massive amounts of data. MySQL is widely used but, as an open-source program, is often downloaded for free by programmers who use it for Web-based functions and less \"mission-critical\" operations.</p><p>Noting that U.S. antitrust regulators have already approved Oracle's plans to buy Sun for $7.4 billion, Ellison said \"the Europeans have to do their job,\" but he expects that European officials will eventually approve the deal as well.</p><p>His remarks came during a rare extended public appearance that was billed as an unscripted, although generally friendly interview before an audience of several hundred tech industry workers and executives. One of the planet's richest men, Ellison has run Oracle since its founding in 1977, building it into one of the world's biggest software companies.</p><p>Known for his strong ego and outspoken views, Ellison drew laughter when he ridiculed the industry trend known as \"cloud computing,\" saying as he has before that it's nothing more than a faddish term for the established concept of computers linked by networks. \"A cloud is water vapor,\" he observed.</p><p>On a more sober note, he predicted the economy will take a long time to recover from the current recession. Despite government stimulus efforts, he said, \"The American consumer is so deeply in debt; this is not going to come back, certainly for five years.\"</p><p>Ellison expounded on several other points that he has made before, including his plans to increase Oracle's current competition with IBM by selling high-performance computer systems that combine technology from Oracle and Sun. He described the pending acquisition with enthusiasm, saying, \"Sun has fantastic technology.\"</p><p>Oracle, of Redwood City, is primarily known as a commercial software company, while Santa Clara-based Sun makes software, computer servers and data storage systems. Sun, which was struggling even before the current recession, saw its sales drop further over the past year as high-end customers in the banking and telecommunications sectors were hit hard by the downturn.</p><p>Several other big tech companies, including HP, IBM and Cisco Systems, are also vying to offer a range of products for big corporate computing centers. Ellison said he plans to compete with all of them. HP, IBM and to a lesser extent Dell also have pursued a strategy of selling consulting services   advising customers on how to assemble their hardware and software. But Ellison said he believes he will be more successful by selling hardware and software that is \"integrated at the engineering level,\" or designed to work together from the start.</p><p>\"We have no interest in the hardware business. We have a deep interest in the systems business,\" he said, suggesting that Oracle will focus on high-performance computing systems rather than on lower-cost standardized components that have been a growth sector for the computer industry in recent years.</p><p>Contact Brandon Bailey at 408-920-5022.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Oracle CEO <person><nameText>Larry Ellison, </nameText></person>left, speaks alongside Sun Microsystems co-founder and chairman Scott McNealy at the Java One conference in San Francisco, Tuesday, June 2, 2009.

This year's lineup includes dinosaur rockers Aerosmith, the Who's Roger Daltrey and the Wailers reggae band.</p><p>Analysts expect Redwood City-based Oracle, one of the world's leading commercial software suppliers, to use the event to introduce new products in its Fusion line, which incorporates application software and middleware from Oracle's previous acquisitions of BEA Systems and other companies.</p><p>But it's clear that Oracle also hopes to build momentum behind the pending Sun deal, which Ellison has touted as a major opportunity to expand beyond software, by combining Sun's high-end hardware into integrated systems for corporate and government data centers. Along with McNealy, other scheduled speakers include James Gosling, who created Sun's widely used Java programming language, and John Fowler, Sun's executive vice president for systems.</p><p>While it's not unusual for executives from other companies to speak at OpenWorld, organizers are giving unusual prominence to Sun, said industry analyst Kenneth Chin, who follows Oracle for the Gartner research firm.</p><p>\"It's focused on keeping Sun in front of users and helping shore up the Sun customer base,\" added Chin, who noted that competing vendors such as HP and IBM have tried to lure away Sun customers by exploiting uncertainty over the pending deal.</p><p>Oracle had hoped to complete the Sun acquisition by now, after announcing the deal in April, but European regulators are withholding approval while they look into concerns that it could stifle competition in the database software market.</p><p>Though less momentous, meanwhile, Benioff's appearance is notable because it will be his first presentation at OpenWorld since launching his company in 1998.

He said Benioff's presentation, which comes at Oracle's invitation, will stress that the two firms have a \"multifaceted relationship\" and a \"joint mission of making our customers very successful.\"</p><p>Contact Brandon Bailey at 408-920-5022.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-13518073</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SANJOSEMNG2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7WV2-P720-Y9NC-P03M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"572\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 San Jose Mercury News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>San Jose Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>October 10, 2009 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000243V</classCode><className>ORACLE AMERICA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009DIT</classCode><className>SALESFORCE.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC7379 COMPUTER RELATED SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC7371 COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS334118 COMPUTER TERMINAL &amp;

This does not mean that Oracle will have majority ownership of the app, but they will have control of TikTok in America which includes over 100 million users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The rushed sale was prompted by an executive order signed by President Donald Trump stating that TikTok had to sell its U.S. operations to an American company before September 20 or the app would be blocked in the U.S. TikTok was seen as a security threat to the U.S. because of the way that it stores user information along with the parent company of the app, ByteDance, being a Chinese company.</p><p>The official White House website addressed the \"threat\" of TikTok and the executive order. Here is an excerpt of theirexplanation of why they believe it may be unsafe for Americans to use the Chinese video-sharing app:\u00a0</p><p>TikTok automatically captures vast swaths of information from its users, including Internet and other network activity information such as location data and browsing and search histories. This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information - potentially allowing China to track the locations of Federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage.</p><p>The sudden concern for cyber safety by Trump really put ByteDance backed up against a wall. By having to sell U.S. operations before September 20, they were forced to look quickly for a buyer and did not have quite the leverage in the deal that they would have wanted. The way ByteDance chose their buyer also raises questions about their intentions.</p><p>Last month, the Chinese government issued new regulations that would prohibit TikTok from selling its technology to a foreign company without their explicit permission. They did this by updating the list of technologies that they have the power to veto from being sold to a foreign country. This list now includes data processing and speech and text recognition, which are used for the TikTok app.</p><p>The timing of these new regulations have sparked speculation that the Chinese government might not have been thrilled with the idea of Microsoft obtaining the coveted computer code which would give Microsoft the power to decide what videos are seen by the 100 million U.S. users, among other functions.</p><p>Microsoft, who is in the consumer technology industry with products like Xbox, was seen by many industry experts as the most likely buyer of TikTok. There is no question that they have the money, resources and power to clean up any security risks that TikTok may have posed. However, Microsoft made their initial offer, which was rejected, and was never asked to make another. After the somewhat surprising deal struck by Oracle, Microsoft had this to say in astatement:\u00a0</p><p>We would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combating disinformation.</p><p>Oracle is known for making software designed for businesses, not consumers. This leaves some experts scratching their heads at this move. According toUSA Today, Jefferies Analyst Brent Thill believes Oracle's interest in TikTok is questionable to say the least. He stated that it \"does not fit with the rest of the company.\" He went on to compare it to \"Delta Airlines buying a motorcycle company.\"</p><p>Unlike the other big tech executives, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is a massive public supporter of President Donald Trump. He was reportedly the first person to recommend Hydroxychloroquine to Trump as a drug to treat COVID-19, despite a lack of scientific proof that it is effective against the virus. Back in February, he even went as far as to host a fundraiser for Trump at his ranch in California.</p><p>Trump has said that Oracle \"could handle\" buying TikTok and that they are a \"great company\" but when asked to state his preference between Oracle and Microsoft as buyers he declined to answer. This relationship between Trump and Ellison begs the question of if the executive order was implemented to assist Ellison and his company in acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations.</p><p>Although, by placing the executive order, Trump's intentions to eliminate any security risk with the app seem reasonable, since over 100 million Americans use TikTok (and that number is growing fast). It just seems like a peculiar coincidence that he placed this executive order, forcing an American tech company to run TikTok or else the country is not allowed to use it, and then it ends up in the hands of one of his corporate buddies.</p><p>This sale changes the tech landscape in the U.S. Microsoft being pushed to the side is not something that they are used to. It is especially confounding since Oracle is not in the consumer tech business whatsoever. The deal certainly raises as many questions as it answers.</p><p>Whether the Chinese and American governments influenced this deal or not, Oracle ended up as the winner here and they now have control of the hottest video-sharing/social media app on the planet. TikTok has the extraordinary capability to jump-start the careers of many \"influencers\" into the entertainment industry. The app spreads popular content like wildfire causing the simplest of videos to go viral and boost teenagers and young adults into stardom.</p><p>For questions/comments about this story, email <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:arts@thewhitonline.com\">arts@thewhitonline.com</email> or tweet@TheWhitOnline.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4749292</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VN-YVB1-DY7P-T42M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"922\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Whit: Rowan University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 16, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>SIC7379 COMPUTER RELATED SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>SIC7371 COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>ORCL (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Glassboro</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>NJ</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp;

Good Wednesday morning,  everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is  Wednesday, March 28th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  Technology tanks stocks, the major indices tumbled yesterday,  weighed down by major tech names facing concerns over new regulatory  scrutiny. </p><p> The Dow Industrial down 345 points, 1-1/2 percent, the NASDAQ  211 points yesterday, that was almost three percent yesterday.  Among the  big losers, Facebook, Alphabet, Apple, which all turned negative for the  year.  The news comes as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly agrees now  to testify before lawmakers on Capitol Hill.  Markets this morning are  bouncing on the heels of that loss yesterday.  Dow Industrials now at the  high of the morning, up almost 70 points, up a quarter of a percent higher.   The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ also in positive territory.  We are waiting on the  final reading of the fourth quarter GDP.  It is due out in 30 minutes time.   Economists are expecting growth of 2.7 percent for the fourth quarter.  In  Europe this morning, right across the board although here too off of the  lows.  FT-100 just slipped into positive territory.  It's up two points  right now and the CAC quarante is down 32, two-thirds of a percent, the DAX  index is down 61, that's one-half of one percent, off of the lows.  In Asia  overnight, steep declines across the board.  Worst performers were Hong  Kong and Japan and Korea, down 2-1/2 percent on the Hang Seng.  The global  selloff comes amid a possible crackdown, speculation is mounting that the  White House is considering regulating Chinese investments in technology  companies.  Senator Lindsey Graham weighed in on taking action against  China.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  There's still everything you  bring to China, they manipulate the currency, they dump steel below market  value into the world economy and Trump said during the campaign, he was  going to push back.  He has.  And if the French and the Germans were smart,  they would join President Trump to change Chinese business practices.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The major implications for technology and the markets coming up  this morning.  New problems for Tesla.  The details as the National  Transportation Safety Board investigates yet another fatal crash.  And too  slow, the FBI Director Christopher Wray finally responds.  He says he will  double the number of personnel assigned to reviewing the GOP's request for  documents in the investigation of the Clinton e-mail investigation as well  as the FBI abuse and the firing of Andrew McCabe.  What you need to know  coming up this morning.  Saudi Arabia bets on solar.  The major investment  the country is making with SoftBank on a solar park in the kingdom.  Plus,  too sexy for the aisle?  Why Wal-Mart is removing cosmopolitan magazine  from the checkout lanes.  All those stories are coming up this Wednesday  morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen  McDowell, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin Kelly, and the Wall Street  Journal Editorial Board Member, Fox News Contributor, Mary Kissel.  Great  show so far, you guys.  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be  here, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  Good morning.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, KELLY AND COMPANY:  And we haven't covered  the Kim Jong-un meeting as much I would figured because I figure this is a  really big turning point in the relations between China and the United  States, given the fact that, you know, the South China Sea is a big  contentious issue, what's going on with Japan.  I mean, I think this is a  bigger deal than it's actually being played out.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  I don't know about  that, Kevin.  Maybe I'm just cynical because I've been covering this story  for so long both in Asia and here in the United States.  And I am telling  you, I am really glad that President Trump is keeping the pressure up on  North Korea.  That's exactly the right thing to do.  It's the only reason  that they're coming to the table.  But the idea that they're somehow going  to voluntarily give up nuclear weapons, that is a fantasy, an absolute  fantasy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think so.  Good op-ed in the Journal today by Robert  Zoellick.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Top 10 Tips for Negotiating With Kim Jongu Un.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you for saying that because I was just accused by one of  the viewers of being grouchy and grumpy this morning.</p><p>KISSEL:  No.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, pragmatic.  That's what I call it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KISSEL:  Well, let's learn some history here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Believe nothing that Kim Jong-un says.</p><p>KISSEL:  Republicans, Democrats, both sides of the aisle, they have  appeased this country for decades.  Look at where it's gotten us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to talk more about this this morning and we kick it  off this hour right now with this top story.  Investors are watching a  possible crackdown by the Trump administration on Chinese investments in  U.S. technology companies.  This coming as President Trump seals his first  trade deal with South Korea.  Adam Shapiro covering the story at the White  House right now with the very latest.  Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  When President Trump last week signed the memorandum authorizing  the United States trade representative to come up with a list of potential  items for tariffs in regards to China, the administration also talked about  enhancing the ability of the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United  States, CFIUS over the Treasury Department to also crackdown on what the  administration calls the theft of intellectual property and the forced  transfer of technology to Chinese corporations.  Well, yesterday it was  apparent that one of the negotiating areas that's going on between Treasury  and China could possibly limit or end investment from China into technology  companies in the United States on technology which is still emerging, and  that was something that upset investors.  Wilbur Ross from the Commerce  Department actually talked about what is on the table and here's what he  said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  There will be  limitations on foreign investment.  As you know, the entity that regulates  foreign investment.  As you know, CFIUS which is the entity that regulates  foreign investment has new legislation pending both in the House and in the  Senate.  So that will be part of it.  And then some other action by the  President will be the other part of it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAPIRO:  And Maria, of course, the administration is touting the success  of its negotiations with South Korea.  We will limit imports of South  Korean steel.  It will be 70 percent of an average of their production over  the last three years as well as increasing the number of U.S. cars that can  be exported to South Korea.  Right now, every manufacture can export up to  25,000 cars.  It will go to 50,000 cars.  Critics point out that no  manufacturer in the United States has exported more than 11,000 cars in any  given year to Korea -- to South Korea at least but the administration is  calling this a victory.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  Thanks.  We will watch that.  Adam Shapiro at  the White House.  I want to turn now over the uproar over the census.  At  least 12 states now say they will sue the Trump administration to block the  administration from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census.   The Commerce Department says the question will help determine possible  violations of the Voting Rights Act and protect minority voting rights.   But Democrats say it amounts to a \"craven attack on our democracy.  Joining  me right now is the host of \"MICHELLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES\", CRTV.com,  Michelle Malkin.  Michelle, good to see you.</p><p>MICHELLE MALKIN, POLITICAL COMMENTATR:  You too, Maria.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are Democrats so up in arms about this?  It seems logical  to have that question in there.  </p><p>MALKIN:  It does.  And I think to most people in fly-over countries, the  idea of a country asking who is in it is something that should be basic.   But only in America will a Federal government get sued by states for asking  that basic question.  It is bizarre.  What it really is about is a power  grab.  It's about control over the electoral landscape because the census  is used to divvy up seats in the House based on a proportion of the head  count.  And then of course, it doesn't just affect those Congressional  districts because the Electoral College uses the size of Congressional  districts as well as a gauge.  And the thing that I think people are  missing in terms of context here is that dating back to the Carter  administration, the open borders lobby has used the annual census as an  argument to freeze immigration rates and ICE actions at worksites.  That  was the policy officially under Clinton.  It was the unspoken policy  through the Obama administration as well.  And what's happened is that you  have a Trump administration now that has showed at every level that it is  serious about immigration enforcement and finally for the first time when  the next census is taken, they are not going to be in charge and in  control.  They do not have the reins.  It's a $3 billion industry, if you  think about it.  That's what the census budget is.  I think people's minds  would be blown if they've know that.  And it's been a slush fund for a  number of left wing groups that are used as the census workers to go out  there and pound the pavement and do these questionnaires.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Michelle, I mean, you also have to be just, you know,  shocked at what's going on in California.  I don't know -- I don't know  about shocked but I mean, it's just a stunner.  Officials in Orange County,  California voting to join a lawsuit fighting the state's sanctuary city  laws hours after the county sheriff's department announced it will publicly  list release dates of inmate including those in the country illegally.   Here's what vice chairman of the county's board of supervisors told me  about the moves earlier on the program.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAWN NELSON, ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR:  The board took action basically to  stand up for the people of Orange County, stand up for the sheriff and let  California know that despite their desires to release criminals into our  neighborhoods under the guise of being kind, that we weren't going to  tolerate that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction, Michelle?  </p><p>MALKIN:  Well, there is somewhat of a new opt-out movement in California.   I don't know if it's too little too late.  But there are still pockets of  sanity.  Orange County is one of them, certain regions in San Diego County  as well.  We've already heard from a couple of localities including Los  Alamitos that are moving to pass ordinances to defy the sanctuary status.   Remember, there were three bills that were passed and signed by Jerry  Brown.  One of them dealt with worksite enforcement.  And the state  basically ordering private employers not to allow ICE onto their premises  which is just astounding that this is even legal.  And then the other two  dealing with detention and as the law enforcement officer just mentioned  about being able to notify the public when criminal illegal aliens are  about to be released, if they're not going to be picked up by ICE.  So you  have an anti-sanctuary sanctuary movement.  Again, I wonder if it's too  little too late and really the bottom line is, if these outlaw counties and  cities in places like San Francisco are not prosecuted for breaking our  immigration laws, for aiding and abetting illegal aliens, how does it stop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  No.  I think this is -- this is really a stunning  story and we will of course be watching it.  Let me ask you about the FBI  news because finally the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray responds to  the subpoena which we told you about a week ago.  Now Wray says he will  double the number of staff members combing through documents to comply with  the request from Republicans for records on the investigation into the  Hillary Clinton e-mail server.  This move comes just days after House  Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte subpoenaed the Justice  Department to get those documents.  Here's what Goodlatte first told me  about obtaining the records right before he issued that subpoena.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY: We  need to have those documents.  The Department and the Bureau have been  slow, I would say now very slow in getting them to us.  The last time I was  on your program I expressed confidence that we would have those documents  forthcoming.  Here we are several weeks later, still don't have them.  So  this is coming to a head.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it is coming to a head.  And Christopher Wray now has  responded and he agrees, it's been slow.  </p><p>MALKIN:  Yes.  Thanks a lot.  You know, the F in the FBI has always stood  for foot-dragging when it comes to document production in FOIA request,  public records request.  This is something that the I.G. of the DOJ  currently, Michael Horowitz pointed out under the Obama administration.   They did it with fast and furious, they did it with the IRS investigation  and hide -- the hide and seek and run out the clock have been their M.O.   So finally you actually have somebody in FBI brass who is acknowledging  that.  But it took a long time, didn't it?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we don't have the documents yet.  So, let's not, you  know, jump the gun here.  </p><p>MALKIN:  True.  Yes, that's right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it is pretty extraordinary that they would just blow-off  the committee that has jurisdiction over them for so long and not produce  these documents, especially since the documents that we've had already  have, you know, shown all of these text messages that explain to us and  shown us the bias at the top of the FBI.  So, without the 3,000 pages we  would not have known that.  And without the I.G. report, Michael Horowitz.  </p><p>MALKIN:  Yes.  That's right.  Which I think it points to the fact that  there's so much more here and, you know, we've heard the cliche tip of --  tip of the iceberg.  And -- but that is, you know, anybody who is a  journalist who had to file public records requests know even at the local  level that public records acts are really seen as subvert the public and so  obviously, you know, you multiply that by thousands for the FBI.  I mean,  there are ongoing public records requests that have -- you know, date back  to 20, 25 years.  And thank god we have good watchdog groups like Judicial  Watch out there fighting these battles for us, you know, outside of the  Congressional Committees as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michelle, thanks for weighing in on all that.  Great to see  you.</p><p>MALKIN:  You too.  Take care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michelle Malkin joining us there.  Coming up, SoftBank and  Saudi Arabia teaming up again, now to build the world's largest solar park.   We break down the $200-billion deal, they signed a memorandum of  understanding last night.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Futures erasing early losses.  A complete  turnaround here, Dow Industrials now expected to be up about 90 points on  the session when the market opens in about an hour and 15 minutes.  So  we're looking at money moving into stocks after that tough selloff  yesterday.  Meanwhile, a fatal crash of a Tesla Model X in California  prompting a Federal investigation.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.   Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  The National  Transportation Safety Board says it's conducting a field investigation to  determine whether the vehicle's semi-automated driving system was actually  engaged.  The driver died when the Model X SUV struck a barrier and caught  fire on a highway last week.  Shares of Tesla plunged more than eight  percent yesterday as you can see on your screen, 279.18.  This morning the  company's stock is lower in the premarket by more than two percent.  Well,  Saudi Arabia turning to solar power in a big way.  They've teamed up with  SoftBank to build the biggest solar park in the world.  SoftBank's founder  Masayoshi Son and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman sitting there with  you, Maria, has signed a preliminary agreement for the $200-billion  project.  They did this yesterday here in New York.  The venture is going  to create as many as 100,000 jobs and generate enough electricity to power  150 million homes.  It's part of the Prince's plan to reduce Saudi Arabia's  dependence on oil.  Shares of SoftBank have lost four percent so far this  year.  </p><p>Well, actor Corey Feldman says that he was stabbed last night.  Feldman  post a picture to Twitter about an hour or so ago saying that three men  pulled up and one attack him while he was sitting in his car.  Here's what  he tweeted.  I'm in the hospital.  I was attacked tonight.  A man opened my  car door and stabbed me with something.  Please say prayers for us.  Well,  security was distracted a guy in a car pulled up and attacked.  I'm OK.   According to Feldman, the LAPD is investigation the alleged as an attempted  homicide.  He believes the attack could be connected to a number of threats  made to him on social media.  Feldman has been outspoken for years actually  against alleged sexual predators in Hollywood.  Predators that go after  young actors like himself at one point in his life.</p><p>Well, Wal-Mart has decided to ban cosmopolitan from the checkout line at  its stores.  The National Center on Sexual Exploitation is actually  claiming credit for this, saying Wal-Mart made the decision following  conversations that they had with the organization.  The magazine is famous  for its sexy covers and giving out love and sex advice to women but the  NCSC calls it pornography and has been lobbying Wal-Mart to remove it from  the sight of children.  Cosmo has logged in the most profitable title for  publisher Hearse, maybe there's a reason for that.  Shares of Wal-Mart  slightly higher in the premarket, Maria.  Pornography.  Come on. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is crazy.</p><p>CASONE:  Really.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Removing Cosmopolitan from the aisles, what do you think?  </p><p>KISSEL:  I don't know.  They do run some kind of racy topics, don't they?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KISSEL:  Because I'm a regular reader of Cosmo --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- for the 70s.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's this.  Mark Zuckerberg, guys, he will  reportedly testify before Congress on the Facebook data scandal.  How the  social media company responds to the scrutiny from Washington, next.  And  then the iPad gets a reboot.  The high-tech features from the new Apple  device that's under $300 for students.  Wait until you see it, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching Facebook this morning.  The  company announced this morning new privacy features allowing users to  download and delete data, should they want to.  This comes after CEO Mark  Zuckerberg reportedly agreed yesterday to testify before Congress over the  company's data practices.  The Senate Judiciary Committee wants him  questioned.  The stock is now in bare market territory of notice, trading  higher right now, it is down 20 percent from the most recent high which was  on February 1st.  The stock yesterday was down five percent.  This morning  it's bouncing about one percent.  Joining us right now GBH Insights Chief  Strategy Officer and head of technology research Daniel Ives.  Dan, good to  see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DANIEL IVES, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER, GBH INSIGHTS:  Great to be here.</p><p>IVES:  You still like Facebook stock.  You're bullish on the stock despite?  </p><p>IVES:  Yes.  I mean, look, this has been the darkest chapter for Zuckerberg  in Facebook's 14-year history.  But we view it -- as what's really baked  into the stock is a draconian type of regulatory environment.  If you think  it's anything less caught slight to modest in our opinion, this is a  significant buying opportunity.  If you can navigate through these dark  clouds that are going to become over the coming weeks and months for  Facebook and Zuckerberg.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  I have a hard time with that given the fact that there's so much  uncertainty.  And one of the things that we don't know, what's going to  happen to management?  Will they separate the chairman and CEO role?   That's a real possibility.  Because Mark Zuckerberg can't even apologize or  be held accountable.  He was a v victim.  They were victims of this,  considering the fact that consistently cozied up to advertisers that have  done nefarious things on their platform post election.  Then all of a  sudden you're seeing the multiple compression, right?  Right now they're  still trading at 25 times earnings.  I'm having a hard time buying into  your thesis if they go from 25 to 20.  </p><p>IVES:  Look, I mean, there's no doubt.  Right now the bear's going to come  out of hibernation.  I mean -- and you're seeing it.  Ultimately we  factored if they lose 10 percent advertising revenue up five billion a  year. You fact that in, reduce the multiple, ultimately with $10.00  earnings power, 30 percent grower, I view it as a $180 to $190 stock.  To  your point has the upside been capped as you start to pick up from multiple  expansion?  No doubt.  And this has definitely been -- for Zuckerberg, it's  going to be a defining period.  When he goes on his sort of (INAUDIBLE)  sorry tour in front of Congress and others, that's going to be defining not  just for Facebook but for Alphabet, for Twitter.  You saw Twitter yesterday  for social media peers.  So this is really a game-changing fork in the road  situation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We should just point out.  Twitter's stock fell 12 percent  yesterday.  </p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  They're getting slammed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a huge haircut for one day.  </p><p>KISSEL:  But there's longer term problems here for Facebook.  I mean,  Facebook's user growth has been slowing now for a while.  </p><p>IVES:  No doubt.  I mean, if you look at user growth, engagement, you get  to two billion users, 50 billion in advertising revenue, you're going to  hit a point right now where it starts to slow.  And that's also why Twitter  was starting to get sea legs, Snap continues sort of the up-and-down story.   But when you look at Facebook from a fundamental valuation, this is really  one way of using heavy-handed regulation, this is a game-changing move and  ultimately to -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're talking about 30 to 40 percent upside potential for this  stock?  Is that what you see? </p><p>IVES:  Oh, yes.  I mean, in our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In what time frame?  </p><p>IVES:  In our opinion, over the next year we view this as a 30 percent  upside stock.  I'm not saying you're not going to (INAUDIBLE) roller  coaster over the coming weeks and months.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the charges?  I mean, how much -- how much money is  this going to cost Facebook?  Doesn't that cut into earnings?  </p><p>IVES:  Yes.  And look, when we factored in like in terms of FTC and some of  these other fines, if you factor in it's going to be in the hundreds of  millions of dollars, that's probably where we see FTC funds some of the  class action lawsuits.  But there's no doubt, if you look at Facebook right  now, this is one of those -- it's a fork in the road.  If you think this is  the start of just a game-changer to the model and fundamentals, to your  point, you don't own the stock.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick.  Instagram is owned by Facebook, so if Facebook, the  social media platform gets hurt, where does the traffic go?  Its goes to  Instagram and they also on WhatsApp, so that gives them balance.</p><p>IVES:  And that's -- and that's why even though from advertisers, it sounds  great when you say, I'm going to come off Facebook for a week?  You put the  P.R. out, you feel good.  Realistically, where are you going when it comes  down online, if it's Faceboook.  And ultimately, Amazon is probably a  beneficiary on the advertising model.  Because remember on FANG stock,  Netflix, Amazon are really insulated from regulatory headwinds.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  you're All right.  We will leave it there.  Well, you're  sticking your neck out, Dan.  Thanks.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Daniel Ives there.  Coming up, we've got the final reading of  the fourth quarter GDP due out in a few minutes.  Economists are expecting  growth of 2.7 percent.  Markets are up going into the numbers.  Dow  Industrials are expected to be up 90 points.  We're watching for any change  of that, ahead of the number. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, March 28.   Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Stocks looking to  rebound.  We are waiting on the GDP number out momentarily.  The  expectations call for growth of 2.7 percent.  The number -- 2.9 percent is  the number that is better than expected, just hitting the tape.  This comes  after yesterday's route on Wall Street.  Right now, we're looking at  Futures up 100 points as the number hits the tape of 2.9 percent growth  better than expected.  Yesterday, the market was down nearly 400 points.   Take a look at the Dow Industrials down 344 points yesterday.  1.5 percent  lower, the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ also lower.  The NASDAQ hit hard yesterday.   Three percent lower.  But this morning, we're looking at money moving into  stocks and this fourth quarter GDP number right now is actually boosting  markets as it is up 2.9 percent.  Versus an estimate of 2.7 percent.  This  market is up fractionally from where we we're going in to the numbers.  Dow  Industrials expected to be up 114 points at the opening of trading this  morning.  The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are mixed right now.  NASDAQ is slipping  back into negative territory by two points.  Joining us right now, is the  dean of the Columbia Business School and former chairman of the Council of  Economic Advisers, Glenn Hubbard.  Glenn, good to see you.  Thanks so much  for joining us.</p><p>GLENN HUBBARD, DEAN, COLUMBIA BUSINESS SCHOOL:  My pleasure, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just getting this final report on fourth quarter GDP on 2.9  percent growth.  Your thoughts in where we are in the economy right now.</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, it's a number I expected.  I was looking for somewhere  between 2.9 and three percent.  I think the economy was going into this  year very strong.  Maintaining it will depend on the effects of the tax  bill, of a continued reset about expectations for growth.  But I think it's  a very good news number.</p><p>KELLY:  Glenn, you know, one of the interesting things I look at is the  durable goods report and it actually beat my expectations not only for  nondefense spending.  So, what are the reports you're looking at and where  are they showing growth for this year?  Because, you know, the durable  goods they came out on Friday were gangbusters.  That's leading me to  believe we're going to get above the three percent, maybe 3.5 percent  quarter this year alone.  What are you seeing for the first quarter this  year?</p><p>HUBBARD: Well, I think we've got a good news going in, as you say capital  spending is up.  And that's very promising.  That have been a weakness in  the recovery going in.  So, I think, that's all good news.  I think it  would be hard to imagine the economy growing three percent plus  consistently.  But being in that range doesn't strike me as odd at all. </p><p>MARY KISSELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Glenn, Mary Kissel here,  \"Wall Street Journal\", this Trump administration came into office just as  the business cycle was nearing its end.  Tax cuts really seem to give the  economy a boost but now there's a lot of concern on the trade front.  How  do you see that impacting growth going forward?</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I think a big impact right now, Mary, is uncertainty.  The  actual measures taken thus far like the steel or aluminum tariffs while  they're not good public policy have been fairly modest.  The China action  as well.  So, I think what business people are waiting for is, is this a  game changer or is this more rhetoric?  On the other side, their  renegotiation of the U.S.-Korea agreement, that looks pretty positive.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Glenn, it's Dagen McDowell, what about the rise and borrowing  cost, although we saw the yield on the ten-year treasury yesterday close  below 2.8 percent had been below that level.  I don't think since early  February.  Got a frontpage story in the \"Wall Street Journal\" today, that  the rate that banks pay to lend to one another.  LIBOR or the London  Interbank Offered Rate.  It's at its highest level in a decade.  And,  again, this rate is used to determine what -- the rate paid on about $200  trillion in loans globally.  How much of a headwind is that for economic  growth, particularly here in the United States?</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, it's definitely a headwind.  But I think we have to step  back and ask, you know, why aren't rates rising?  They're rising because  it's a better growth environment.  We're rising because inflation is  getting back closer to where the Fed wants it to be.  So, I don't feel it  as a bad story as long as all of this is gradual.  As long as growth is  there, I think we're fine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where is the growth?  Would you say, I mean, we're just two  weeks away from the first quarter earnings season and we're expecting  earnings for the first quarter to be up 16 percent.  Where specifically do  you see the most growth right now in this economy?</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I think we are seeing a rebounding capital spending  sectors.  Obviously, some weakness right now in the technology sector.  But  strong still in financial services, in health care, generally throughout  the economy with consumer spending.  So, I'm pretty optimistic.  Again,  what would worry me would be policy uncertainty or geopolitical events.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't we have that?  Don't we have policy uncertainty and GOP - - and also upset and uncertainty about the foreign story in terms of  national security?</p><p>HUBBARD:  What we do, and I think what we have to do is focus on what we  can control, which would be the policy uncertainty.  So, it'd be great to  see the administration focus more on its low frequency successes and less  on high frequency noise.</p><p>KISSEL:  But how are consumers spending all this money Glenn?  Mary again  from the \"Wall Street Journal\".  Aren't they taking out debt or they've  putting on credit cards, or is this coming out of savings?</p><p>HUBBARD:  It's out of savings, and that of course will require some  adjustment going forward.  Right now, consumers are more optimistic about  growth and wages.  If that optimism proves premature, obviously consumer  spending would take a hit.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I think one of the things that we're kind of tiptoeing around  too is the strength the dollar last year.  The market was up 20 percent and  one of the reasons why is the dollar was down 10 percent, you're starting  to see that the dollar actually selloff here.  Is that good for the economy  going forward in the regards to, hey, what's going to -- for the stock  market right now.  It's not good necessarily for our trade deficits in our  exports.  But what is your take on the dollar and how it's going to weigh  on this market?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, by the way, you would have expected the complete opposite,  right?  If the economy is growing the way we think it is, you would think  that we would have a stronger dollar.</p><p>KISSEL:  And you think we'd want a stronger dollar.  They're talking down  the dollar, just remarkable.  Terrible idea.</p><p>HUBBARD: Yes, I agree with everything that's just been said.  I mean, first  of all, the dollar should be determined by market forces.  Those market  forces in my expectation should be pointing toward a higher dollar over the  short to medium term.  Obviously, a lower dollar does revise earnings and  help stocks.  But for the country as a whole, we should want the dollar in  market forces, and we should want a strong dollar, not a weak one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You would think.  Let me ask you about the Federal Reserve.   Growing speculation that rising inflation could force the Fed to increase  rates four or five times now?  Is this -- I mean, five times is pretty  aggressive out there.  What's your expectation?</p><p>HUBBARD:  I think five times sounds unlikely.  Three is clear --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think, I agree with you.</p><p>HUBBARD: -- four, perhaps, but I think the Fed is watching inflation rise,  but I don't think anybody expects inflation to suddenly snap out way beyond  two percent.  So, I think Chairman Powell and his colleagues are in a  gradual adjustment mode, and that seems like a good place to be.</p><p>KELLY:  Is there inflation, though?  I mean, that's one of the biggest  questions we're having on the street is that, you know, the PCE has  consistently come around 1.5, you know, we'll get an outlier here and  there.  Otherwise, CPI is not really trudging above two.  And so, I don't  know where there is inflation.  I haven't seen it come anywhere.  </p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I think we will cross two percent in quarter PCE later this  year.  But I agree with you, I don't see inflation breaking out.  So, I'm  not one of these people worried about a sudden snap in Fed policy or indeed  in a long-term rates, which would be the sum of inflation on the real rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Glenn, your thoughts on this deal with South Korea.  It eases  the steel tariffs and exchange for quotas on steel exports from South  Korea.  There's a provision as well to make sure not a country  intentionally devalues the currency for a trade advantage.  What do you  make of this new deal with South Korea this morning?</p><p>HUBBARD:  I don't think it's a bad deal.  I think that there was a lot of  uncertainty going into it because people didn't know what the  administration was trying to accomplish.  But I think it did make some  marginal improvements for the United States.  I Don't think we were even  selling cars at quite our quota before, so I'm not sure what the expected  gain will be.  But I think it's not a bad thing.  What I would urge the  administration to do is be clear about what the goals are when you go in  for trades, so that you don't create so much uncertainty.</p><p>KISSEL:  I don't agree with that at all.  I mean, we're again, we're moving  back towards managed trade.  We did this with Japan in the 1980s.  I mean,  what we did was extend protections for U.S. truck makers instead of forcing  South Korea to lower their tariffs.  There's no help here for our  agricultural market.  I mean, Glenn, this isn't expending market  opportunities.  This is managed trade.  How is this a good deal?</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I think it is a good deal for the sectors involved.  I  don't think it's the best deal that could be done.  I share your views that  we should move toward more openness.  But given where this administration  started, I'm actually pleasantly surprised.</p><p>KISSEL: Oh, so this is good from a low bar.  That's what you're really  saying?</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I didn't quite say it that way.</p><p>KISSEL:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you're worried about protection policies from this White  House, like, a little bit of give is a lot (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>HUBBARD: Exactly.</p><p>KISSEL:  You know what?  Glenn, I'm wondering if this has anything to do  with South Korea and everything to do with the NAFTA negotiations that are  going on that we basically strong armed South Korea into protection for  certain industries so that they could pronounce a win and then go to the  NAFTA partners and say, hey, look, if you don't do what we want, we're  going to do what we did to South Korea.  We're going to do it to you.</p><p>HUBBARD:  That's possible.  The Korea issue of course is complicated  because it's not just the trade negotiation.  It's the obvious elephant in  the room of North Korea and those upcoming negotiations.  So, it's really  hard to see how they're connected.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well you know, I mean, at some point and it's like, any day  now.  NAFTA's off the table.  I mean, let's face it.  They have elections  in Mexico, and then we had the midterm elections here.  So, by the time  you're actually going to get back to the negotiating table on NAFTA is well  after November.  So, I don't know that we'll hear any headlines in terms of  NAFTA.  There's that uncertainty out there.  Let me ask you about the  Atlanta Fed, Glenn.  Because the president of the Fed in Atlanta told the  journal the tax cut and increased government spending.  Like, the recently  passed $1.3 trillion spending bill could put pressure on monetary policy.   What's your take on that $1.3 trillion spending bill and its impact? </p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I think the spending bill was unwise.  It really is a  continuation of Congress's unwillingness to grasp the fiscal situation  we're in.  Whether it radically changes monitory policy, though, I would be  a little bit more questioning.  I think, the Fed will continue to gradually  increase rates.  The only reason it would change monetary policy is if  suddenly inflation snapped, or growth snapped out of a range.  I don't  really see that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll leave it there.  Glenn, great to have you on the program.</p><p>HUBBARD: My pleasure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Glenn Hubbard joining us there from Columbia.  Coming up, the  final meet on the fourth quarter GDP, shows growth of 2.9 percent.  Stuart  Varney has a thing or two to say about that, he's going to weigh in. </p><p>Then Apple takes a bite of the education market.  Where the company is  cutting prices on its new iPad for students.  Next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(AUDIO GAP) </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning,  Maria.  Well, right now we're watching two names.  And the first is  Walgreens.  Walgreens this morning right now we can see how it's trading.   But they came out profit beat, sales beat, and raising the forecast.  The  stock is up 2.3 percent and the forecast is what's good news here for  earnings.  They raised this guidance for 2018 and say they continue to see  growth.  That's what they expect for 2018.  And at least in part because of  the recent acquisition of Rite Aid.  Walgreens boots alliance up 2.3  percent, but it's been a real loser, and that is down 20 percent over the  last 52 weeks.  </p><p>Let's take a look at Apple this morning.  So, Apple this morning looking  down just slightly.  They did have a Goldman Sachs down cutting their price  target, which I'll explain in a moment.  The big news is the new iPads for  schools.  What's happened over the last five years is that Apple has  basically lost ground on the education market.  Google Chrome books are  huge, are up 60 percent right market share.  Microsoft has in the 20  percent range and Apple has slipped.  So now they're putting out this new  iPad.  It's going to be cheaper for the schools.  Instead of 329, to be  299.  It will have a stylus pen, which is only available on the highest  Apple iPads.  So that will be instead of 89 -- $99, it will be $89.  By the  way, Goldman Sachs lowered their iPhone sales forecast for the March of  June quarters.  Putting a new price target of 159.  Much more.  MORNINGS  WITH MARIA coming up after the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we got the number as we're reporting the U.S.  economy grew by 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter.  That is the final  reading out this morning.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"   Stuart Varney with some thoughts there.  Stuart, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Am I as surprised as you, or  are you as surprised as I am?  Because I wasn't expecting 2.9.  That's  pretty close to three percent growth, originally reported I think, back in  2.5, something like that.  That's a very solid rate of growth.  Now, here's  my surprise not just at that solid rate of growth but at the market  reaction.  I see interest rates as in the ten-year treasury down at 2.76  percent.  Why so low?  Having recently touched 2.9, why are we at 2.76 when  we've just got a nice, strong report on the economy?  Why did Futures go  from a gain of 90 to a gain of 48?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>VARNEY:  How come that happened?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm wondering if it's this idea that rates are going to go up  five times do I.  I find that extraordinary, five interest rates hike this  year.  What do you think?</p><p>VARNEY:  I suppose that's what's in the cards given the strength in the  fourth quarter last year.  But I'm just no good at predicting what the  Fed's going to do.  You know me, Maria.  I don't do much on the Fed.  I  have a buzzer if I start running on about the Fed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right, you're right.</p><p>VARNEY:  If you're -- if you're really talking about five rate increases  this year.  If that's what they're talking about, no wonder Futures are not  performing really well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well that, I'm just trying to come up with an explanation of  why the market went from up 100 to up to 50.  Because, I think you're  right.  This is a solid growth story.  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Some of this is going to be end of quarter putting some lipstick  on that portfolio and pulling back on these tech stocks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and reallocating to a safer asset, particularly going into a  long weekend where the bond market closes midday on Thursday, I think it's  closed on Friday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, stock markets are close on Friday as well.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, the market's closed Friday.  It's supposed to be three-day  weekend.  But you know, Dagen's right there.  The focus of the market this  morning is not economic growth.  It's not the Fed.  It's not interest  rates.  It's technology stocks.  They're still under pressure.  They are  under attack starting with Facebook.  And I, think that's what's doing it  to the overall market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  End of quarter positioning. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Technology 25 percent of the S&amp;P at early February that was the  highest percentage it's been since the dot-com bubble blew up back in 18  years ago this month.</p><p>KELLY:  Just to get to GDP, I just want to point out the fact that this is  a great number before tax cuts started to take effect.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>KELLY:  I mean, you had people spending money.  (CROSSTALK) It was the  household spending number is what led this to 2.9 percent.  So, if you  think about that, that's before people even got those $1,000 bonuses from  the corporations.  So, this is leaning toward an even better number for the  Q1 here.  So, I think, the market is actually trying to digest this.  If  we're getting these great numbers before the policies took effect, what  kind of numbers are we going to get for Q1 and the rest of this year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>VARNEY:  The Trump growth agenda rolls on, does it not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly, and we got the jobs number out a week from Friday.   So, let's see what that number is.  And of course, first quarter earnings  are going to start, Stuart, and they should be good. </p><p>VARNEY:  They better be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you in about eight minutes, Stuart.  </p><p>VARNEY:  You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins half of the hour,  right after mornings with Maria.  But first, will President Trump's tariffs  on steel and aluminum impact the oil industry?  Jeff Flock is live at the  New York International Auto Show with some answers.  Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  And we have news on that  this morning, Maria in an interview with Scott Keogh of Audi here  exclusively on the FOX Business Network this morning.  I'll get to that in  the moment, but first, I want to show you the most important unveil.  No,  it's not the Camaro Hot Wheels 50th version, I just showed you that because  it's kind of fun to look at.  But take a look at the what I think it's the  most important unveil of the show, that is the Toyota RAV4.  Why is that  the most important unveil of this show?  Because other than the pick-up  trucks, the F150 and the Chevy's and the rest, that is the best-selling  vehicle in America.  They sold 400,000 of those last year.  And despite the  fact that it was an old version, this new version is out now.  So, people  love the SUVs, and I think SUVs are the star of the show this year.  If you  take a look at the numbers, SUV sales in the U.S. this last year up six  percent.  Cars down almost two percent.  There you go.  </p><p>Now onto the news.  That is on tariffs.  We talked to Scott Keogh of Audi.   You know, automakers are unsettled about this.  Not only the steel tariffs  and the aluminum tariffs but the potential of trade war.  Here is what  Scott Keogh told us on FOX Business this morning about his fears about  trade war.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT KEOGH, PRESIDENT, AUDI:  And I think a lot of this back and forth  starts to put doubt into the system.  You've seen the doubt a little bit  with how the stock market responded and doubt is not a good thing for the  business.  We believe in free trade.  We believe America competitiveness  because when you're competitive, you have the best workers, you make the  best products, and you win the day.  So, that's what we believe in and, of  course, the details, event flows, let's see where it goes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FLOCK:  I leave you, Maria, this is the VW Atlas.  They have a concept.   They're about to unveil, and the rumor has it, and we are going to only say  that much, they will unveil a pickup truck.  A VW pickup truck concept.  I  talked to VW earlier.  They said that's a very patriotic space, but they  think maybe they can play in it.  Interesting.  See if they can get one  that would sell, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jeff, do you think one of the reasons for the pickup and SUV  sales is the price of oil?  Maybe when gasoline comes down, people feel,  well, then I will go big again instead of going for the smaller, electric  cars.</p><p>FLOCK:  I talked to Scott Keogh, and I said what do you think?  And he said  you know, with fracking and everything else going on around the world, I  think I'll be retired before we have $4 gas again.  He doesn't plan to  retire any time soon, by the way.  So, FYI.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well look, the fact (INAUDIBLE) are in New York this week, and  I can tell you for sure, that they're saying $100 oil is going to look  cheap in the coming years.  I don't know.  It feels like $100 oil is off  the table with the supply coming out of the U.S. but --</p><p>KELLY:  Well yes, the Saudi's are also -</p><p>FLOCK:  There's going to be a lot of SUVs and trucks sitting around.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>FLOCK:  If that's the case.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, the Saudis are capitulating doing a deal with the Russians on  a 10 to 20 year cooperation.  But, Jeff, I'm more interested in this Toyota  RAV4 situation that you would brought up.  The best-selling sort of mini- crossover, is there any indication why?  </p><p>FLOCK:  Isn't that amazing.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, is there any indication why that is?  Have you gotten any color  on that?</p><p>FLOCK:  Well, people -- especially with the gas prices as they are and, of  course, RAV4 gets pretty good mileage anyway.  You know, people have just  gone away from cars.  There's plenty more room in these vehicles, if you've  got kids, whatever you're doing, the SUVs work, you know?  It's the station  wagon of the new age.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mama McDowell -- Mama McDowell, can sum up in one sentence why  people buy SUVs and pickup trucks.  I can see out of it that's why people  buy them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They don't like little cars.</p><p>FLOCK:  Thinking high, they like to be high.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I'm flying high and I can see -(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rather than sitting deep into a Sevan.  That's absolutely  right.  Jeff, thank you.</p><p>FLOCK:  Like always great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jeff Flock at the International Auto Show in New York.</p><p>Coming up final thoughts from the officer panel.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, final thoughts of officer panel.  Kevin Kelly.</p><p>KELLY:  Earning season is going to be -- do very well.  It's coming up in  the next couple of weeks.  We'll hear from bank first.  That's going to  lead the rally higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  60 percent earnings good, (INAUDIBLE) Mary.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes that's true.  And I just want to make a quick note about  trade, Maria.  The White House is going to come out and really try to sell  this deal with South Korea.  Don't buy it, they're going to talk about the  trade deficit.  As if it's a problem.  It's not, this is not a market  opening.  This is managed trade, it's the wrong way to go.  Sorry  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, you are not liking that deal.</p><p>KISSEL:  I don't.</p><p>KELLY:  Kissel the missile.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And this real quickly, thank you to John Paul Stevens, former  Supreme Court Justice.  For actually proving to people who believe in the  second amendment.  That the left does want to take it away.

Kevin, (INAUDIBLE) take it  away.</p><p>KELLY:  I will.  Thanks, Maria.  Crunch time the big tech.

Good Wednesday morning,  everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is  Wednesday, March 28th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.  Technology tanks stocks, the major indices tumbled yesterday,  weighed down by major tech names facing concerns over new regulatory  scrutiny. </p><p> The Dow Industrial down 345 points, 1-1/2 percent, the NASDAQ  211 points yesterday, that was almost three percent yesterday.  Among the  big losers, Facebook, Alphabet, Apple, which all turned negative for the  year.  The news comes as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly agrees now  to testify before lawmakers on Capitol Hill.  Markets this morning are  bouncing on the heels of that loss yesterday.  Dow Industrials now at the  high of the morning, up almost 70 points, up a quarter of a percent higher.   The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ also in positive territory.  We are waiting on the  final reading of the fourth quarter GDP.  It is due out in 30 minutes time.   Economists are expecting growth of 2.7 percent for the fourth quarter.  In  Europe this morning, right across the board although here too off of the  lows.  FT-100 just slipped into positive territory.  It's up two points  right now and the CAC quarante is down 32, two-thirds of a percent, the DAX  index is down 61, that's one-half of one percent, off of the lows.  In Asia  overnight, steep declines across the board.  Worst performers were Hong  Kong and Japan and Korea, down 2-1/2 percent on the Hang Seng.  The global  selloff comes amid a possible crackdown, speculation is mounting that the  White House is considering regulating Chinese investments in technology  companies.  Senator Lindsey Graham weighed in on taking action against  China.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  There's still everything you  bring to China, they manipulate the currency, they dump steel below market  value into the world economy and Trump said during the campaign, he was  going to push back.  He has.  And if the French and the Germans were smart,  they would join President Trump to change Chinese business practices.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The major implications for technology and the markets coming up  this morning.  New problems for Tesla.  The details as the National  Transportation Safety Board investigates yet another fatal crash.  And too  slow, the FBI Director Christopher Wray finally responds.  He says he will  double the number of personnel assigned to reviewing the GOP's request for  documents in the investigation of the Clinton e-mail investigation as well  as the FBI abuse and the firing of Andrew McCabe.  What you need to know  coming up this morning.  Saudi Arabia bets on solar.  The major investment  the country is making with SoftBank on a solar park in the kingdom.  Plus,  too sexy for the aisle?  Why Wal-Mart is removing cosmopolitan magazine  from the checkout lanes.  All those stories are coming up this Wednesday  morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen  McDowell, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin Kelly, and the Wall Street  Journal Editorial Board Member, Fox News Contributor, Mary Kissel.  Great  show so far, you guys.  </p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be  here, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  Good morning.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, KELLY AND COMPANY:  And we haven't covered  the Kim Jong-un meeting as much I would figured because I figure this is a  really big turning point in the relations between China and the United  States, given the fact that, you know, the South China Sea is a big  contentious issue, what's going on with Japan.  I mean, I think this is a  bigger deal than it's actually being played out.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  I don't know about  that, Kevin.  Maybe I'm just cynical because I've been covering this story  for so long both in Asia and here in the United States.  And I am telling  you, I am really glad that President Trump is keeping the pressure up on  North Korea.  That's exactly the right thing to do.  It's the only reason  that they're coming to the table.  But the idea that they're somehow going  to voluntarily give up nuclear weapons, that is a fantasy, an absolute  fantasy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think so.  Good op-ed in the Journal today by Robert  Zoellick.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Top 10 Tips for Negotiating With Kim Jongu Un.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you for saying that because I was just accused by one of  the viewers of being grouchy and grumpy this morning.</p><p>KISSEL:  No.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, pragmatic.  That's what I call it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KISSEL:  Well, let's learn some history here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Believe nothing that Kim Jong-un says.</p><p>KISSEL:  Republicans, Democrats, both sides of the aisle, they have  appeased this country for decades.  Look at where it's gotten us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're going to talk more about this this morning and we kick it  off this hour right now with this top story.  Investors are watching a  possible crackdown by the Trump administration on Chinese investments in  U.S. technology companies.  This coming as President Trump seals his first  trade deal with South Korea.  Adam Shapiro covering the story at the White  House right now with the very latest.  Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  When President Trump last week signed the memorandum authorizing  the United States trade representative to come up with a list of potential  items for tariffs in regards to China, the administration also talked about  enhancing the ability of the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United  States, CFIUS over the Treasury Department to also crackdown on what the  administration calls the theft of intellectual property and the forced  transfer of technology to Chinese corporations.  Well, yesterday it was  apparent that one of the negotiating areas that's going on between Treasury  and China could possibly limit or end investment from China into technology  companies in the United States on technology which is still emerging, and  that was something that upset investors.  Wilbur Ross from the Commerce  Department actually talked about what is on the table and here's what he  said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE:  There will be  limitations on foreign investment.  As you know, the entity that regulates  foreign investment.  As you know, CFIUS which is the entity that regulates  foreign investment has new legislation pending both in the House and in the  Senate.  So that will be part of it.  And then some other action by the  President will be the other part of it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAPIRO:  And Maria, of course, the administration is touting the success  of its negotiations with South Korea.  We will limit imports of South  Korean steel.  It will be 70 percent of an average of their production over  the last three years as well as increasing the number of U.S. cars that can  be exported to South Korea.  Right now, every manufacture can export up to  25,000 cars.  It will go to 50,000 cars.  Critics point out that no  manufacturer in the United States has exported more than 11,000 cars in any  given year to Korea -- to South Korea at least but the administration is  calling this a victory.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Adam.  Thanks.  We will watch that.  Adam Shapiro at  the White House.  I want to turn now over the uproar over the census.  At  least 12 states now say they will sue the Trump administration to block the  administration from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census.   The Commerce Department says the question will help determine possible  violations of the Voting Rights Act and protect minority voting rights.   But Democrats say it amounts to a \"craven attack on our democracy.  Joining  me right now is the host of \"MICHELLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES\", CRTV.com,  Michelle Malkin.  Michelle, good to see you.</p><p>MICHELLE MALKIN, POLITICAL COMMENTATR:  You too, Maria.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why are Democrats so up in arms about this?  It seems logical  to have that question in there.  </p><p>MALKIN:  It does.  And I think to most people in fly-over countries, the  idea of a country asking who is in it is something that should be basic.   But only in America will a Federal government get sued by states for asking  that basic question.  It is bizarre.  What it really is about is a power  grab.  It's about control over the electoral landscape because the census  is used to divvy up seats in the House based on a proportion of the head  count.  And then of course, it doesn't just affect those Congressional  districts because the Electoral College uses the size of Congressional  districts as well as a gauge.  And the thing that I think people are  missing in terms of context here is that dating back to the Carter  administration, the open borders lobby has used the annual census as an  argument to freeze immigration rates and ICE actions at worksites.  That  was the policy officially under Clinton.  It was the unspoken policy  through the Obama administration as well.  And what's happened is that you  have a Trump administration now that has showed at every level that it is  serious about immigration enforcement and finally for the first time when  the next census is taken, they are not going to be in charge and in  control.  They do not have the reins.  It's a $3 billion industry, if you  think about it.  That's what the census budget is.  I think people's minds  would be blown if they've know that.  And it's been a slush fund for a  number of left wing groups that are used as the census workers to go out  there and pound the pavement and do these questionnaires.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Michelle, I mean, you also have to be just, you know,  shocked at what's going on in California.  I don't know -- I don't know  about shocked but I mean, it's just a stunner.  Officials in Orange County,  California voting to join a lawsuit fighting the state's sanctuary city  laws hours after the county sheriff's department announced it will publicly  list release dates of inmate including those in the country illegally.   Here's what vice chairman of the county's board of supervisors told me  about the moves earlier on the program.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAWN NELSON, ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR:  The board took action basically to  stand up for the people of Orange County, stand up for the sheriff and let  California know that despite their desires to release criminals into our  neighborhoods under the guise of being kind, that we weren't going to  tolerate that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction, Michelle?  </p><p>MALKIN:  Well, there is somewhat of a new opt-out movement in California.   I don't know if it's too little too late.  But there are still pockets of  sanity.  Orange County is one of them, certain regions in San Diego County  as well.  We've already heard from a couple of localities including Los  Alamitos that are moving to pass ordinances to defy the sanctuary status.   Remember, there were three bills that were passed and signed by Jerry  Brown.  One of them dealt with worksite enforcement.  And the state  basically ordering private employers not to allow ICE onto their premises  which is just astounding that this is even legal.  And then the other two  dealing with detention and as the law enforcement officer just mentioned  about being able to notify the public when criminal illegal aliens are  about to be released, if they're not going to be picked up by ICE.  So you  have an anti-sanctuary sanctuary movement.  Again, I wonder if it's too  little too late and really the bottom line is, if these outlaw counties and  cities in places like San Francisco are not prosecuted for breaking our  immigration laws, for aiding and abetting illegal aliens, how does it stop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  No.  I think this is -- this is really a stunning  story and we will of course be watching it.  Let me ask you about the FBI  news because finally the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray responds to  the subpoena which we told you about a week ago.  Now Wray says he will  double the number of staff members combing through documents to comply with  the request from Republicans for records on the investigation into the  Hillary Clinton e-mail server.  This move comes just days after House  Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte subpoenaed the Justice  Department to get those documents.  Here's what Goodlatte first told me  about obtaining the records right before he issued that subpoena.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY: We  need to have those documents.  The Department and the Bureau have been  slow, I would say now very slow in getting them to us.  The last time I was  on your program I expressed confidence that we would have those documents  forthcoming.  Here we are several weeks later, still don't have them.  So  this is coming to a head.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it is coming to a head.  And Christopher Wray now has  responded and he agrees, it's been slow.  </p><p>MALKIN:  Yes.  Thanks a lot.  You know, the F in the FBI has always stood  for foot-dragging when it comes to document production in FOIA request,  public records request.  This is something that the I.G. of the DOJ  currently, Michael Horowitz pointed out under the Obama administration.   They did it with fast and furious, they did it with the IRS investigation  and hide -- the hide and seek and run out the clock have been their M.O.   So finally you actually have somebody in FBI brass who is acknowledging  that.  But it took a long time, didn't it?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we don't have the documents yet.  So, let's not, you  know, jump the gun here.  </p><p>MALKIN:  True.  Yes, that's right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it is pretty extraordinary that they would just blow-off  the committee that has jurisdiction over them for so long and not produce  these documents, especially since the documents that we've had already  have, you know, shown all of these text messages that explain to us and  shown us the bias at the top of the FBI.  So, without the 3,000 pages we  would not have known that.  And without the I.G. report, Michael Horowitz.  </p><p>MALKIN:  Yes.  That's right.  Which I think it points to the fact that  there's so much more here and, you know, we've heard the cliche tip of --  tip of the iceberg.  And -- but that is, you know, anybody who is a  journalist who had to file public records requests know even at the local  level that public records acts are really seen as subvert the public and so  obviously, you know, you multiply that by thousands for the FBI.  I mean,  there are ongoing public records requests that have -- you know, date back  to 20, 25 years.  And thank god we have good watchdog groups like Judicial  Watch out there fighting these battles for us, you know, outside of the  Congressional Committees as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michelle, thanks for weighing in on all that.  Great to see  you.</p><p>MALKIN:  You too.  Take care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michelle Malkin joining us there.  Coming up, SoftBank and  Saudi Arabia teaming up again, now to build the world's largest solar park.   We break down the $200-billion deal, they signed a memorandum of  understanding last night.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Futures erasing early losses.  A complete  turnaround here, Dow Industrials now expected to be up about 90 points on  the session when the market opens in about an hour and 15 minutes.  So  we're looking at money moving into stocks after that tough selloff  yesterday.  Meanwhile, a fatal crash of a Tesla Model X in California  prompting a Federal investigation.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.   Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  The National  Transportation Safety Board says it's conducting a field investigation to  determine whether the vehicle's semi-automated driving system was actually  engaged.  The driver died when the Model X SUV struck a barrier and caught  fire on a highway last week.  Shares of Tesla plunged more than eight  percent yesterday as you can see on your screen, 279.18.  This morning the  company's stock is lower in the premarket by more than two percent.  Well,  Saudi Arabia turning to solar power in a big way.  They've teamed up with  SoftBank to build the biggest solar park in the world.  SoftBank's founder  Masayoshi Son and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman sitting there with  you, Maria, has signed a preliminary agreement for the $200-billion  project.  They did this yesterday here in New York.  The venture is going  to create as many as 100,000 jobs and generate enough electricity to power  150 million homes.  It's part of the Prince's plan to reduce Saudi Arabia's  dependence on oil.  Shares of SoftBank have lost four percent so far this  year.  </p><p>Well, actor Corey Feldman says that he was stabbed last night.  Feldman  post a picture to Twitter about an hour or so ago saying that three men  pulled up and one attack him while he was sitting in his car.  Here's what  he tweeted.  I'm in the hospital.  I was attacked tonight.  A man opened my  car door and stabbed me with something.  Please say prayers for us.  Well,  security was distracted a guy in a car pulled up and attacked.  I'm OK.   According to Feldman, the LAPD is investigation the alleged as an attempted  homicide.  He believes the attack could be connected to a number of threats  made to him on social media.  Feldman has been outspoken for years actually  against alleged sexual predators in Hollywood.  Predators that go after  young actors like himself at one point in his life.</p><p>Well, Wal-Mart has decided to ban cosmopolitan from the checkout line at  its stores.  The National Center on Sexual Exploitation is actually  claiming credit for this, saying Wal-Mart made the decision following  conversations that they had with the organization.  The magazine is famous  for its sexy covers and giving out love and sex advice to women but the  NCSC calls it pornography and has been lobbying Wal-Mart to remove it from  the sight of children.  Cosmo has logged in the most profitable title for  publisher Hearse, maybe there's a reason for that.  Shares of Wal-Mart  slightly higher in the premarket, Maria.  Pornography.  Come on. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This is crazy.</p><p>CASONE:  Really.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Removing Cosmopolitan from the aisles, what do you think?  </p><p>KISSEL:  I don't know.  They do run some kind of racy topics, don't they?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KISSEL:  Because I'm a regular reader of Cosmo --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- for the 70s.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then there's this.  Mark Zuckerberg, guys, he will  reportedly testify before Congress on the Facebook data scandal.  How the  social media company responds to the scrutiny from Washington, next.  And  then the iPad gets a reboot.  The high-tech features from the new Apple  device that's under $300 for students.  Wait until you see it, next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We are watching Facebook this morning.  The  company announced this morning new privacy features allowing users to  download and delete data, should they want to.  This comes after CEO Mark  Zuckerberg reportedly agreed yesterday to testify before Congress over the  company's data practices.  The Senate Judiciary Committee wants him  questioned.  The stock is now in bare market territory of notice, trading  higher right now, it is down 20 percent from the most recent high which was  on February 1st.  The stock yesterday was down five percent.  This morning  it's bouncing about one percent.  Joining us right now GBH Insights Chief  Strategy Officer and head of technology research Daniel Ives.  Dan, good to  see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DANIEL IVES, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER, GBH INSIGHTS:  Great to be here.</p><p>IVES:  You still like Facebook stock.  You're bullish on the stock despite?  </p><p>IVES:  Yes.  I mean, look, this has been the darkest chapter for Zuckerberg  in Facebook's 14-year history.  But we view it -- as what's really baked  into the stock is a draconian type of regulatory environment.  If you think  it's anything less caught slight to modest in our opinion, this is a  significant buying opportunity.  If you can navigate through these dark  clouds that are going to become over the coming weeks and months for  Facebook and Zuckerberg.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  I have a hard time with that given the fact that there's so much  uncertainty.  And one of the things that we don't know, what's going to  happen to management?  Will they separate the chairman and CEO role?   That's a real possibility.  Because Mark Zuckerberg can't even apologize or  be held accountable.  He was a v victim.  They were victims of this,  considering the fact that consistently cozied up to advertisers that have  done nefarious things on their platform post election.  Then all of a  sudden you're seeing the multiple compression, right?  Right now they're  still trading at 25 times earnings.  I'm having a hard time buying into  your thesis if they go from 25 to 20.  </p><p>IVES:  Look, I mean, there's no doubt.  Right now the bear's going to come  out of hibernation.  I mean -- and you're seeing it.  Ultimately we  factored if they lose 10 percent advertising revenue up five billion a  year. You fact that in, reduce the multiple, ultimately with $10.00  earnings power, 30 percent grower, I view it as a $180 to $190 stock.  To  your point has the upside been capped as you start to pick up from multiple  expansion?  No doubt.  And this has definitely been -- for Zuckerberg, it's  going to be a defining period.  When he goes on his sort of (INAUDIBLE)  sorry tour in front of Congress and others, that's going to be defining not  just for Facebook but for Alphabet, for Twitter.  You saw Twitter yesterday  for social media peers.  So this is really a game-changing fork in the road  situation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We should just point out.  Twitter's stock fell 12 percent  yesterday.  </p><p>KISSEL:  Yes.  They're getting slammed.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's a huge haircut for one day.  </p><p>KISSEL:  But there's longer term problems here for Facebook.  I mean,  Facebook's user growth has been slowing now for a while.  </p><p>IVES:  No doubt.  I mean, if you look at user growth, engagement, you get  to two billion users, 50 billion in advertising revenue, you're going to  hit a point right now where it starts to slow.  And that's also why Twitter  was starting to get sea legs, Snap continues sort of the up-and-down story.   But when you look at Facebook from a fundamental valuation, this is really  one way of using heavy-handed regulation, this is a game-changing move and  ultimately to -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're talking about 30 to 40 percent upside potential for this  stock?  Is that what you see? </p><p>IVES:  Oh, yes.  I mean, in our --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In what time frame?  </p><p>IVES:  In our opinion, over the next year we view this as a 30 percent  upside stock.  I'm not saying you're not going to (INAUDIBLE) roller  coaster over the coming weeks and months.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the charges?  I mean, how much -- how much money is  this going to cost Facebook?  Doesn't that cut into earnings?  </p><p>IVES:  Yes.  And look, when we factored in like in terms of FTC and some of  these other fines, if you factor in it's going to be in the hundreds of  millions of dollars, that's probably where we see FTC funds some of the  class action lawsuits.  But there's no doubt, if you look at Facebook right  now, this is one of those -- it's a fork in the road.  If you think this is  the start of just a game-changer to the model and fundamentals, to your  point, you don't own the stock.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick.  Instagram is owned by Facebook, so if Facebook, the  social media platform gets hurt, where does the traffic go?  Its goes to  Instagram and they also on WhatsApp, so that gives them balance.</p><p>IVES:  And that's -- and that's why even though from advertisers, it sounds  great when you say, I'm going to come off Facebook for a week?  You put the  P.R. out, you feel good.  Realistically, where are you going when it comes  down online, if it's Faceboook.  And ultimately, Amazon is probably a  beneficiary on the advertising model.  Because remember on FANG stock,  Netflix, Amazon are really insulated from regulatory headwinds.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  you're All right.  We will leave it there.  Well, you're  sticking your neck out, Dan.  Thanks.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Daniel Ives there.  Coming up, we've got the final reading of  the fourth quarter GDP due out in a few minutes.  Economists are expecting  growth of 2.7 percent.  Markets are up going into the numbers.  Dow  Industrials are expected to be up 90 points.  We're watching for any change  of that, ahead of the number. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Wednesday, March 28.   Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Stocks looking to  rebound.  We are waiting on the GDP number out momentarily.  The  expectations call for growth of 2.7 percent.  The number -- 2.9 percent is  the number that is better than expected, just hitting the tape.  This comes  after yesterday's route on Wall Street.  Right now, we're looking at  Futures up 100 points as the number hits the tape of 2.9 percent growth  better than expected.  Yesterday, the market was down nearly 400 points.   Take a look at the Dow Industrials down 344 points yesterday.  1.5 percent  lower, the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ also lower.  The NASDAQ hit hard yesterday.   Three percent lower.  But this morning, we're looking at money moving into  stocks and this fourth quarter GDP number right now is actually boosting  markets as it is up 2.9 percent.  Versus an estimate of 2.7 percent.  This  market is up fractionally from where we we're going in to the numbers.  Dow  Industrials expected to be up 114 points at the opening of trading this  morning.  The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are mixed right now.  NASDAQ is slipping  back into negative territory by two points.  Joining us right now, is the  dean of the Columbia Business School and former chairman of the Council of  Economic Advisers, Glenn Hubbard.  Glenn, good to see you.  Thanks so much  for joining us.</p><p>GLENN HUBBARD, DEAN, COLUMBIA BUSINESS SCHOOL:  My pleasure, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just getting this final report on fourth quarter GDP on 2.9  percent growth.  Your thoughts in where we are in the economy right now.</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, it's a number I expected.  I was looking for somewhere  between 2.9 and three percent.  I think the economy was going into this  year very strong.  Maintaining it will depend on the effects of the tax  bill, of a continued reset about expectations for growth.  But I think it's  a very good news number.</p><p>KELLY:  Glenn, you know, one of the interesting things I look at is the  durable goods report and it actually beat my expectations not only for  nondefense spending.  So, what are the reports you're looking at and where  are they showing growth for this year?  Because, you know, the durable  goods they came out on Friday were gangbusters.  That's leading me to  believe we're going to get above the three percent, maybe 3.5 percent  quarter this year alone.  What are you seeing for the first quarter this  year?</p><p>HUBBARD: Well, I think we've got a good news going in, as you say capital  spending is up.  And that's very promising.  That have been a weakness in  the recovery going in.  So, I think, that's all good news.  I think it  would be hard to imagine the economy growing three percent plus  consistently.  But being in that range doesn't strike me as odd at all. </p><p>MARY KISSELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Glenn, Mary Kissel here,  \"Wall Street Journal\", this Trump administration came into office just as  the business cycle was nearing its end.  Tax cuts really seem to give the  economy a boost but now there's a lot of concern on the trade front.  How  do you see that impacting growth going forward?</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I think a big impact right now, Mary, is uncertainty.  The  actual measures taken thus far like the steel or aluminum tariffs while  they're not good public policy have been fairly modest.  The China action  as well.  So, I think what business people are waiting for is, is this a  game changer or is this more rhetoric?  On the other side, their  renegotiation of the U.S.-Korea agreement, that looks pretty positive.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Glenn, it's Dagen McDowell, what about the rise and borrowing  cost, although we saw the yield on the ten-year treasury yesterday close  below 2.8 percent had been below that level.  I don't think since early  February.  Got a frontpage story in the \"Wall Street Journal\" today, that  the rate that banks pay to lend to one another.  LIBOR or the London  Interbank Offered Rate.  It's at its highest level in a decade.  And,  again, this rate is used to determine what -- the rate paid on about $200  trillion in loans globally.  How much of a headwind is that for economic  growth, particularly here in the United States?</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, it's definitely a headwind.  But I think we have to step  back and ask, you know, why aren't rates rising?  They're rising because  it's a better growth environment.  We're rising because inflation is  getting back closer to where the Fed wants it to be.  So, I don't feel it  as a bad story as long as all of this is gradual.  As long as growth is  there, I think we're fine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where is the growth?  Would you say, I mean, we're just two  weeks away from the first quarter earnings season and we're expecting  earnings for the first quarter to be up 16 percent.  Where specifically do  you see the most growth right now in this economy?</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I think we are seeing a rebounding capital spending  sectors.  Obviously, some weakness right now in the technology sector.  But  strong still in financial services, in health care, generally throughout  the economy with consumer spending.  So, I'm pretty optimistic.  Again,  what would worry me would be policy uncertainty or geopolitical events.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't we have that?  Don't we have policy uncertainty and GOP - - and also upset and uncertainty about the foreign story in terms of  national security?</p><p>HUBBARD:  What we do, and I think what we have to do is focus on what we  can control, which would be the policy uncertainty.  So, it'd be great to  see the administration focus more on its low frequency successes and less  on high frequency noise.</p><p>KISSEL:  But how are consumers spending all this money Glenn?  Mary again  from the \"Wall Street Journal\".  Aren't they taking out debt or they've  putting on credit cards, or is this coming out of savings?</p><p>HUBBARD:  It's out of savings, and that of course will require some  adjustment going forward.  Right now, consumers are more optimistic about  growth and wages.  If that optimism proves premature, obviously consumer  spending would take a hit.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I think one of the things that we're kind of tiptoeing around  too is the strength the dollar last year.  The market was up 20 percent and  one of the reasons why is the dollar was down 10 percent, you're starting  to see that the dollar actually selloff here.  Is that good for the economy  going forward in the regards to, hey, what's going to -- for the stock  market right now.  It's not good necessarily for our trade deficits in our  exports.  But what is your take on the dollar and how it's going to weigh  on this market?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, by the way, you would have expected the complete opposite,  right?  If the economy is growing the way we think it is, you would think  that we would have a stronger dollar.</p><p>KISSEL:  And you think we'd want a stronger dollar.  They're talking down  the dollar, just remarkable.  Terrible idea.</p><p>HUBBARD: Yes, I agree with everything that's just been said.  I mean, first  of all, the dollar should be determined by market forces.  Those market  forces in my expectation should be pointing toward a higher dollar over the  short to medium term.  Obviously, a lower dollar does revise earnings and  help stocks.  But for the country as a whole, we should want the dollar in  market forces, and we should want a strong dollar, not a weak one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You would think.  Let me ask you about the Federal Reserve.   Growing speculation that rising inflation could force the Fed to increase  rates four or five times now?  Is this -- I mean, five times is pretty  aggressive out there.  What's your expectation?</p><p>HUBBARD:  I think five times sounds unlikely.  Three is clear --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think, I agree with you.</p><p>HUBBARD: -- four, perhaps, but I think the Fed is watching inflation rise,  but I don't think anybody expects inflation to suddenly snap out way beyond  two percent.  So, I think Chairman Powell and his colleagues are in a  gradual adjustment mode, and that seems like a good place to be.</p><p>KELLY:  Is there inflation, though?  I mean, that's one of the biggest  questions we're having on the street is that, you know, the PCE has  consistently come around 1.5, you know, we'll get an outlier here and  there.  Otherwise, CPI is not really trudging above two.  And so, I don't  know where there is inflation.  I haven't seen it come anywhere.  </p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I think we will cross two percent in quarter PCE later this  year.  But I agree with you, I don't see inflation breaking out.  So, I'm  not one of these people worried about a sudden snap in Fed policy or indeed  in a long-term rates, which would be the sum of inflation on the real rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Glenn, your thoughts on this deal with South Korea.  It eases  the steel tariffs and exchange for quotas on steel exports from South  Korea.  There's a provision as well to make sure not a country  intentionally devalues the currency for a trade advantage.  What do you  make of this new deal with South Korea this morning?</p><p>HUBBARD:  I don't think it's a bad deal.  I think that there was a lot of  uncertainty going into it because people didn't know what the  administration was trying to accomplish.  But I think it did make some  marginal improvements for the United States.  I Don't think we were even  selling cars at quite our quota before, so I'm not sure what the expected  gain will be.  But I think it's not a bad thing.  What I would urge the  administration to do is be clear about what the goals are when you go in  for trades, so that you don't create so much uncertainty.</p><p>KISSEL:  I don't agree with that at all.  I mean, we're again, we're moving  back towards managed trade.  We did this with Japan in the 1980s.  I mean,  what we did was extend protections for U.S. truck makers instead of forcing  South Korea to lower their tariffs.  There's no help here for our  agricultural market.  I mean, Glenn, this isn't expending market  opportunities.  This is managed trade.  How is this a good deal?</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I think it is a good deal for the sectors involved.  I  don't think it's the best deal that could be done.  I share your views that  we should move toward more openness.  But given where this administration  started, I'm actually pleasantly surprised.</p><p>KISSEL: Oh, so this is good from a low bar.  That's what you're really  saying?</p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I didn't quite say it that way.</p><p>KISSEL:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you're worried about protection policies from this White  House, like, a little bit of give is a lot (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>HUBBARD: Exactly.</p><p>KISSEL:  You know what?  Glenn, I'm wondering if this has anything to do  with South Korea and everything to do with the NAFTA negotiations that are  going on that we basically strong armed South Korea into protection for  certain industries so that they could pronounce a win and then go to the  NAFTA partners and say, hey, look, if you don't do what we want, we're  going to do what we did to South Korea.  We're going to do it to you.</p><p>HUBBARD:  That's possible.  The Korea issue of course is complicated  because it's not just the trade negotiation.  It's the obvious elephant in  the room of North Korea and those upcoming negotiations.  So, it's really  hard to see how they're connected.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well you know, I mean, at some point and it's like, any day  now.  NAFTA's off the table.  I mean, let's face it.  They have elections  in Mexico, and then we had the midterm elections here.  So, by the time  you're actually going to get back to the negotiating table on NAFTA is well  after November.  So, I don't know that we'll hear any headlines in terms of  NAFTA.  There's that uncertainty out there.  Let me ask you about the  Atlanta Fed, Glenn.  Because the president of the Fed in Atlanta told the  journal the tax cut and increased government spending.  Like, the recently  passed $1.3 trillion spending bill could put pressure on monetary policy.   What's your take on that $1.3 trillion spending bill and its impact? </p><p>HUBBARD:  Well, I think the spending bill was unwise.  It really is a  continuation of Congress's unwillingness to grasp the fiscal situation  we're in.  Whether it radically changes monitory policy, though, I would be  a little bit more questioning.  I think, the Fed will continue to gradually  increase rates.  The only reason it would change monetary policy is if  suddenly inflation snapped, or growth snapped out of a range.  I don't  really see that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll leave it there.  Glenn, great to have you on the program.</p><p>HUBBARD: My pleasure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Glenn Hubbard joining us there from Columbia.  Coming up, the  final meet on the fourth quarter GDP, shows growth of 2.9 percent.  Stuart  Varney has a thing or two to say about that, he's going to weigh in. </p><p>Then Apple takes a bite of the education market.  Where the company is  cutting prices on its new iPad for students.  Next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(AUDIO GAP) </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning,  Maria.  Well, right now we're watching two names.  And the first is  Walgreens.  Walgreens this morning right now we can see how it's trading.   But they came out profit beat, sales beat, and raising the forecast.  The  stock is up 2.3 percent and the forecast is what's good news here for  earnings.  They raised this guidance for 2018 and say they continue to see  growth.  That's what they expect for 2018.  And at least in part because of  the recent acquisition of Rite Aid.  Walgreens boots alliance up 2.3  percent, but it's been a real loser, and that is down 20 percent over the  last 52 weeks.  </p><p>Let's take a look at Apple this morning.  So, Apple this morning looking  down just slightly.  They did have a Goldman Sachs down cutting their price  target, which I'll explain in a moment.  The big news is the new iPads for  schools.  What's happened over the last five years is that Apple has  basically lost ground on the education market.  Google Chrome books are  huge, are up 60 percent right market share.  Microsoft has in the 20  percent range and Apple has slipped.  So now they're putting out this new  iPad.  It's going to be cheaper for the schools.  Instead of 329, to be  299.  It will have a stylus pen, which is only available on the highest  Apple iPads.  So that will be instead of 89 -- $99, it will be $89.  By the  way, Goldman Sachs lowered their iPhone sales forecast for the March of  June quarters.  Putting a new price target of 159.  Much more.  MORNINGS  WITH MARIA coming up after the break. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we got the number as we're reporting the U.S.  economy grew by 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter.  That is the final  reading out this morning.  Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"   Stuart Varney with some thoughts there.  Stuart, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Am I as surprised as you, or  are you as surprised as I am?  Because I wasn't expecting 2.9.  That's  pretty close to three percent growth, originally reported I think, back in  2.5, something like that.  That's a very solid rate of growth.  Now, here's  my surprise not just at that solid rate of growth but at the market  reaction.  I see interest rates as in the ten-year treasury down at 2.76  percent.  Why so low?  Having recently touched 2.9, why are we at 2.76 when  we've just got a nice, strong report on the economy?  Why did Futures go  from a gain of 90 to a gain of 48?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>VARNEY:  How come that happened?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm wondering if it's this idea that rates are going to go up  five times do I.  I find that extraordinary, five interest rates hike this  year.  What do you think?</p><p>VARNEY:  I suppose that's what's in the cards given the strength in the  fourth quarter last year.  But I'm just no good at predicting what the  Fed's going to do.  You know me, Maria.  I don't do much on the Fed.  I  have a buzzer if I start running on about the Fed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right, you're right.</p><p>VARNEY:  If you're -- if you're really talking about five rate increases  this year.  If that's what they're talking about, no wonder Futures are not  performing really well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well that, I'm just trying to come up with an explanation of  why the market went from up 100 to up to 50.  Because, I think you're  right.  This is a solid growth story.  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Some of this is going to be end of quarter putting some lipstick  on that portfolio and pulling back on these tech stocks --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and reallocating to a safer asset, particularly going into a  long weekend where the bond market closes midday on Thursday, I think it's  closed on Friday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, stock markets are close on Friday as well.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, the market's closed Friday.  It's supposed to be three-day  weekend.  But you know, Dagen's right there.  The focus of the market this  morning is not economic growth.  It's not the Fed.  It's not interest  rates.  It's technology stocks.  They're still under pressure.  They are  under attack starting with Facebook.  And I, think that's what's doing it  to the overall market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  End of quarter positioning. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Technology 25 percent of the S&amp;P at early February that was the  highest percentage it's been since the dot-com bubble blew up back in 18  years ago this month.</p><p>KELLY:  Just to get to GDP, I just want to point out the fact that this is  a great number before tax cuts started to take effect.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>KELLY:  I mean, you had people spending money.  (CROSSTALK) It was the  household spending number is what led this to 2.9 percent.  So, if you  think about that, that's before people even got those $1,000 bonuses from  the corporations.  So, this is leaning toward an even better number for the  Q1 here.  So, I think, the market is actually trying to digest this.  If  we're getting these great numbers before the policies took effect, what  kind of numbers are we going to get for Q1 and the rest of this year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>VARNEY:  The Trump growth agenda rolls on, does it not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly, and we got the jobs number out a week from Friday.   So, let's see what that number is.  And of course, first quarter earnings  are going to start, Stuart, and they should be good. </p><p>VARNEY:  They better be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you in about eight minutes, Stuart.  </p><p>VARNEY:  You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins half of the hour,  right after mornings with Maria.  But first, will President Trump's tariffs  on steel and aluminum impact the oil industry?  Jeff Flock is live at the  New York International Auto Show with some answers.  Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  And we have news on that  this morning, Maria in an interview with Scott Keogh of Audi here  exclusively on the FOX Business Network this morning.  I'll get to that in  the moment, but first, I want to show you the most important unveil.  No,  it's not the Camaro Hot Wheels 50th version, I just showed you that because  it's kind of fun to look at.  But take a look at the what I think it's the  most important unveil of the show, that is the Toyota RAV4.  Why is that  the most important unveil of this show?  Because other than the pick-up  trucks, the F150 and the Chevy's and the rest, that is the best-selling  vehicle in America.  They sold 400,000 of those last year.  And despite the  fact that it was an old version, this new version is out now.  So, people  love the SUVs, and I think SUVs are the star of the show this year.  If you  take a look at the numbers, SUV sales in the U.S. this last year up six  percent.  Cars down almost two percent.  There you go.  </p><p>Now onto the news.  That is on tariffs.  We talked to Scott Keogh of Audi.   You know, automakers are unsettled about this.  Not only the steel tariffs  and the aluminum tariffs but the potential of trade war.  Here is what  Scott Keogh told us on FOX Business this morning about his fears about  trade war.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT KEOGH, PRESIDENT, AUDI:  And I think a lot of this back and forth  starts to put doubt into the system.  You've seen the doubt a little bit  with how the stock market responded and doubt is not a good thing for the  business.  We believe in free trade.  We believe America competitiveness  because when you're competitive, you have the best workers, you make the  best products, and you win the day.  So, that's what we believe in and, of  course, the details, event flows, let's see where it goes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FLOCK:  I leave you, Maria, this is the VW Atlas.  They have a concept.   They're about to unveil, and the rumor has it, and we are going to only say  that much, they will unveil a pickup truck.  A VW pickup truck concept.  I  talked to VW earlier.  They said that's a very patriotic space, but they  think maybe they can play in it.  Interesting.  See if they can get one  that would sell, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jeff, do you think one of the reasons for the pickup and SUV  sales is the price of oil?  Maybe when gasoline comes down, people feel,  well, then I will go big again instead of going for the smaller, electric  cars.</p><p>FLOCK:  I talked to Scott Keogh, and I said what do you think?  And he said  you know, with fracking and everything else going on around the world, I  think I'll be retired before we have $4 gas again.  He doesn't plan to  retire any time soon, by the way.  So, FYI.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well look, the fact (INAUDIBLE) are in New York this week, and  I can tell you for sure, that they're saying $100 oil is going to look  cheap in the coming years.  I don't know.  It feels like $100 oil is off  the table with the supply coming out of the U.S. but --</p><p>KELLY:  Well yes, the Saudi's are also -</p><p>FLOCK:  There's going to be a lot of SUVs and trucks sitting around.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>FLOCK:  If that's the case.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, the Saudis are capitulating doing a deal with the Russians on  a 10 to 20 year cooperation.  But, Jeff, I'm more interested in this Toyota  RAV4 situation that you would brought up.  The best-selling sort of mini- crossover, is there any indication why?  </p><p>FLOCK:  Isn't that amazing.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, is there any indication why that is?  Have you gotten any color  on that?</p><p>FLOCK:  Well, people -- especially with the gas prices as they are and, of  course, RAV4 gets pretty good mileage anyway.  You know, people have just  gone away from cars.  There's plenty more room in these vehicles, if you've  got kids, whatever you're doing, the SUVs work, you know?  It's the station  wagon of the new age.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mama McDowell -- Mama McDowell, can sum up in one sentence why  people buy SUVs and pickup trucks.  I can see out of it that's why people  buy them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They don't like little cars.</p><p>FLOCK:  Thinking high, they like to be high.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I'm flying high and I can see -(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rather than sitting deep into a Sevan.  That's absolutely  right.  Jeff, thank you.</p><p>FLOCK:  Like always great.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jeff Flock at the International Auto Show in New York.</p><p>Coming up final thoughts from the officer panel.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, final thoughts of officer panel.  Kevin Kelly.</p><p>KELLY:  Earning season is going to be -- do very well.  It's coming up in  the next couple of weeks.  We'll hear from bank first.  That's going to  lead the rally higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  60 percent earnings good, (INAUDIBLE) Mary.</p><p>KISSEL:  Yes that's true.  And I just want to make a quick note about  trade, Maria.  The White House is going to come out and really try to sell  this deal with South Korea.  Don't buy it, they're going to talk about the  trade deficit.  As if it's a problem.  It's not, this is not a market  opening.  This is managed trade, it's the wrong way to go.  Sorry  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, you are not liking that deal.</p><p>KISSEL:  I don't.</p><p>KELLY:  Kissel the missile.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And this real quickly, thank you to John Paul Stevens, former  Supreme Court Justice.  For actually proving to people who believe in the  second amendment.  That the left does want to take it away.  Give me a  pickup truck with a Gun Rock.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, Dagen McDowell, whacking it up.  All right, Dagen, Mary,  great to see everybody.  Thank you so much.  Kevin, (INAUDIBLE) take it  away.</p><p>KELLY:  I will.  Thanks, Maria.  Crunch time the big tech.  They led the  market rally.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, March 28th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Technology tanks stocks, the major indices tumbled yesterday, weighed down by major tech names facing concerns over new regulatory scrutiny. </p><p>The Dow Industrial down 345 points, 1-1/2 percent, the NASDAQ 211 points yesterday, that was almost three percent yesterday. Among the big losers, Facebook, Alphabet, Apple, which all turned negative for the year. The news comes as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly agrees now to testify before lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Markets this morning are bouncing on the heels of that loss yesterday. Dow Industrials now at the high of the morning, up almost 70 points, up a quarter of a percent higher. The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ also in positive territory. We are waiting on the final reading of the fourth quarter GDP. It is due out in 30 minutes time. Economists are expecting growth of 2.7 percent for the fourth quarter. In Europe this morning, right across the board although here too off of the lows. FT-100 just slipped into positive territory. It's up two points right now and the CAC quarante is down 32, two-thirds of a percent, the DAX index is down 61, that's one-half of one percent, off of the lows. In Asia overnight, steep declines across the board. Worst performers were Hong Kong and Japan and Korea, down 2-1/2 percent on the Hang Seng. The global selloff comes amid a possible crackdown, speculation is mounting that the White House is considering regulating Chinese investments in technology companies. Senator Lindsey Graham weighed in on taking action against China.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: There's still everything you bring to China, they manipulate the currency, they dump steel below market value into the world economy and Trump said during the campaign, he was going to push back. He has. And if the French and the Germans were smart, they would join President Trump to change Chinese business practices.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The major implications for technology and the markets coming up this morning. New problems for Tesla. The details as the National Transportation Safety Board investigates yet another fatal crash. And too slow, the FBI Director Christopher Wray finally responds. He says he will double the number of personnel assigned to reviewing the GOP's request for documents in the investigation of the Clinton e-mail investigation as well as the FBI abuse and the firing of Andrew McCabe. What you need to know coming up this morning. Saudi Arabia bets on solar. The major investment the country is making with SoftBank on a solar park in the kingdom. Plus, too sexy for the aisle? Why Wal-Mart is removing cosmopolitan magazine from the checkout lanes. All those stories are coming up this Wednesday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin Kelly, and the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board Member, Fox News Contributor, Mary Kissel. Great show so far, you guys.</p><p>MARY KISSEL, EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Great to be here, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you. Good morning.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, KELLY AND COMPANY: And we haven't covered the Kim Jong-un meeting as much I would figured because I figure this is a really big turning point in the relations between China and the United States, given the fact that, you know, the South China Sea is a big contentious issue, what's going on with Japan. I mean, I think this is a bigger deal than it's actually being played out.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. I don't know about that, Kevin. Maybe I'm just cynical because I've been covering this story for so long both in Asia and here in the United States. And I am telling you, I am really glad that President Trump is keeping the pressure up on North Korea. That's exactly the right thing to do. It's the only reason that they're coming to the table. But the idea that they're somehow going to voluntarily give up nuclear weapons, that is a fantasy, an absolute fantasy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think so. Good op-ed in the Journal today by Robert Zoellick.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Top 10 Tips for Negotiating With Kim Jongu Un.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you for saying that because I was just accused by one of the viewers of being grouchy and grumpy this morning.</p><p>KISSEL: No.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, pragmatic. That's what I call it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KISSEL: Well, let's learn some history here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Believe nothing that Kim Jong-un says.</p><p>KISSEL: Republicans, Democrats, both sides of the aisle, they have appeased this country for decades. Look at where it's gotten us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're going to talk more about this this morning and we kick it off this hour right now with this top story. Investors are watching a possible crackdown by the Trump administration on Chinese investments in U.S. technology companies. This coming as President Trump seals his first trade deal with South Korea. Adam Shapiro covering the story at the White House right now with the very latest. Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: And a good morning to you, Maria. When President Trump last week signed the memorandum authorizing the United States trade representative to come up with a list of potential items for tariffs in regards to China, the administration also talked about enhancing the ability of the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, CFIUS over the Treasury Department to also crackdown on what the administration calls the theft of intellectual property and the forced transfer of technology to Chinese corporations. Well, yesterday it was apparent that one of the negotiating areas that's going on between Treasury and China could possibly limit or end investment from China into technology companies in the United States on technology which is still emerging, and that was something that upset investors. Wilbur Ross from the Commerce Department actually talked about what is on the table and here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: There will be limitations on foreign investment. As you know, the entity that regulates foreign investment. As you know, CFIUS which is the entity that regulates foreign investment has new legislation pending both in the House and in the Senate. So that will be part of it. And then some other action by the President will be the other part of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO: And Maria, of course, the administration is touting the success of its negotiations with South Korea. We will limit imports of South Korean steel. It will be 70 percent of an average of their production over the last three years as well as increasing the number of U.S. cars that can be exported to South Korea. Right now, every manufacture can export up to 25,000 cars. It will go to 50,000 cars. Critics point out that no manufacturer in the United States has exported more than 11,000 cars in any given year to Korea -- to South Korea at least but the administration is calling this a victory. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Adam. Thanks. We will watch that. Adam Shapiro at the White House. I want to turn now over the uproar over the census. At least 12 states now say they will sue the Trump administration to block the administration from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census. The Commerce Department says the question will help determine possible violations of the Voting Rights Act and protect minority voting rights. But Democrats say it amounts to a \"craven attack on our democracy. Joining me right now is the host of \"MICHELLE MALKIN INVESTIGATES\", CRTV.com, Michelle Malkin. Michelle, good to see you.</p><p>MICHELLE MALKIN, POLITICAL COMMENTATR: You too, Maria. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why are Democrats so up in arms about this? It seems logical to have that question in there.</p><p>MALKIN: It does. And I think to most people in fly-over countries, the idea of a country asking who is in it is something that should be basic. But only in America will a Federal government get sued by states for asking that basic question. It is bizarre. What it really is about is a power grab. It's about control over the electoral landscape because the census is used to divvy up seats in the House based on a proportion of the head count. And then of course, it doesn't just affect those Congressional districts because the Electoral College uses the size of Congressional districts as well as a gauge. And the thing that I think people are missing in terms of context here is that dating back to the Carter administration, the open borders lobby has used the annual census as an argument to freeze immigration rates and ICE actions at worksites. That was the policy officially under Clinton. It was the unspoken policy through the Obama administration as well. And what's happened is that you have a Trump administration now that has showed at every level that it is serious about immigration enforcement and finally for the first time when the next census is taken, they are not going to be in charge and in control. They do not have the reins. It's a $3 billion industry, if you think about it. That's what the census budget is. I think people's minds would be blown if they've know that. And it's been a slush fund for a number of left wing groups that are used as the census workers to go out there and pound the pavement and do these questionnaires.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Michelle, I mean, you also have to be just, you know, shocked at what's going on in California. I don't know -- I don't know about shocked but I mean, it's just a stunner. Officials in Orange County, California voting to join a lawsuit fighting the state's sanctuary city laws hours after the county sheriff's department announced it will publicly list release dates of inmate including those in the country illegally. Here's what vice chairman of the county's board of supervisors told me about the moves earlier on the program. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAWN NELSON, ORANGE COUNTY SUPERVISOR: The board took action basically to stand up for the people of Orange County, stand up for the sheriff and let California know that despite their desires to release criminals into our neighborhoods under the guise of being kind, that we weren't going to tolerate that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction, Michelle?</p><p>MALKIN: Well, there is somewhat of a new opt-out movement in California. I don't know if it's too little too late. But there are still pockets of sanity. Orange County is one of them, certain regions in San Diego County as well. We've already heard from a couple of localities including Los Alamitos that are moving to pass ordinances to defy the sanctuary status. Remember, there were three bills that were passed and signed by Jerry Brown. One of them dealt with worksite enforcement. And the state basically ordering private employers not to allow ICE onto their premises which is just astounding that this is even legal. And then the other two dealing with detention and as the law enforcement officer just mentioned about being able to notify the public when criminal illegal aliens are about to be released, if they're not going to be picked up by ICE. So you have an anti-sanctuary sanctuary movement. Again, I wonder if it's too little too late and really the bottom line is, if these outlaw counties and cities in places like San Francisco are not prosecuted for breaking our immigration laws, for aiding and abetting illegal aliens, how does it stop.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. No. I think this is -- this is really a stunning story and we will of course be watching it. Let me ask you about the FBI news because finally the director of the FBI, Christopher Wray responds to the subpoena which we told you about a week ago. Now Wray says he will double the number of staff members combing through documents to comply with the request from Republicans for records on the investigation into the Hillary Clinton e-mail server. This move comes just days after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte subpoenaed the Justice Department to get those documents. Here's what Goodlatte first told me about obtaining the records right before he issued that subpoena.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. BOB GOODLATTE (R-VA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY: We need to have those documents. The Department and the Bureau have been slow, I would say now very slow in getting them to us. The last time I was on your program I expressed confidence that we would have those documents forthcoming. Here we are several weeks later, still don't have them. So this is coming to a head.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, it is coming to a head. And Christopher Wray now has responded and he agrees, it's been slow.</p><p>MALKIN: Yes. Thanks a lot. You know, the F in the FBI has always stood for foot-dragging when it comes to document production in FOIA request, public records request. This is something that the I.G. of the DOJ currently, Michael Horowitz pointed out under the Obama administration. They did it with fast and furious, they did it with the IRS investigation and hide -- the hide and seek and run out the clock have been their M.O. So finally you actually have somebody in FBI brass who is acknowledging that. But it took a long time, didn't it?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we don't have the documents yet. So, let's not, you know, jump the gun here.</p><p>MALKIN: True. Yes, that's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But it is pretty extraordinary that they would just blow-off the committee that has jurisdiction over them for so long and not produce these documents, especially since the documents that we've had already have, you know, shown all of these text messages that explain to us and shown us the bias at the top of the FBI. So, without the 3,000 pages we would not have known that. And without the I.G. report, Michael Horowitz.</p><p>MALKIN: Yes. That's right. Which I think it points to the fact that there's so much more here and, you know, we've heard the cliche tip of -- tip of the iceberg. And -- but that is, you know, anybody who is a journalist who had to file public records requests know even at the local level that public records acts are really seen as subvert the public and so obviously, you know, you multiply that by thousands for the FBI. I mean, there are ongoing public records requests that have -- you know, date back to 20, 25 years. And thank god we have good watchdog groups like Judicial Watch out there fighting these battles for us, you know, outside of the Congressional Committees as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Michelle, thanks for weighing in on all that. Great to see you.</p><p>MALKIN: You too. Take care.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Michelle Malkin joining us there. Coming up, SoftBank and Saudi Arabia teaming up again, now to build the world's largest solar park. We break down the $200-billion deal, they signed a memorandum of understanding last night. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Futures erasing early losses. A complete turnaround here, Dow Industrials now expected to be up about 90 points on the session when the market opens in about an hour and 15 minutes. So we're looking at money moving into stocks after that tough selloff yesterday. Meanwhile, a fatal crash of a Tesla Model X in California prompting a Federal investigation. Cheryl Casone with the story now. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria. The National Transportation Safety Board says it's conducting a field investigation to determine whether the vehicle's semi-automated driving system was actually engaged. The driver died when the Model X SUV struck a barrier and caught fire on a highway last week. Shares of Tesla plunged more than eight percent yesterday as you can see on your screen, 279.18. This morning the company's stock is lower in the premarket by more than two percent. Well, Saudi Arabia turning to solar power in a big way. They've teamed up with SoftBank to build the biggest solar park in the world. SoftBank's founder Masayoshi Son and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman sitting there with you, Maria, has signed a preliminary agreement for the $200-billion project. They did this yesterday here in New York. The venture is going to create as many as 100,000 jobs and generate enough electricity to power 150 million homes. It's part of the Prince's plan to reduce Saudi Arabia's dependence on oil. Shares of SoftBank have lost four percent so far this year.</p><p>Well, actor Corey Feldman says that he was stabbed last night. Feldman post a picture to Twitter about an hour or so ago saying that three men pulled up and one attack him while he was sitting in his car. Here's what he tweeted. I'm in the hospital. I was attacked tonight. A man opened my car door and stabbed me with something. Please say prayers for us. Well, security was distracted a guy in a car pulled up and attacked. I'm OK. According to Feldman, the LAPD is investigation the alleged as an attempted homicide. He believes the attack could be connected to a number of threats made to him on social media. Feldman has been outspoken for years actually against alleged sexual predators in Hollywood. Predators that go after young actors like himself at one point in his life.</p><p>Well, Wal-Mart has decided to ban cosmopolitan from the checkout line at its stores. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation is actually claiming credit for this, saying Wal-Mart made the decision following conversations that they had with the organization. The magazine is famous for its sexy covers and giving out love and sex advice to women but the NCSC calls it pornography and has been lobbying Wal-Mart to remove it from the sight of children. Cosmo has logged in the most profitable title for publisher Hearse, maybe there's a reason for that. Shares of Wal-Mart slightly higher in the premarket, Maria. Pornography. Come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is crazy.</p><p>CASONE: Really.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Removing Cosmopolitan from the aisles, what do you think?</p><p>KISSEL: I don't know. They do run some kind of racy topics, don't they?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KISSEL: Because I'm a regular reader of Cosmo --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- for the 70s.</p><p>KISSEL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then there's this. Mark Zuckerberg, guys, he will reportedly testify before Congress on the Facebook data scandal. How the social media company responds to the scrutiny from Washington, next. And then the iPad gets a reboot. The high-tech features from the new Apple device that's under $300 for students. Wait until you see it, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are watching Facebook this morning. The company announced this morning new privacy features allowing users to download and delete data, should they want to. This comes after CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly agreed yesterday to testify before Congress over the company's data practices. The Senate Judiciary Committee wants him questioned. The stock is now in bare market territory of notice, trading higher right now, it is down 20 percent from the most recent high which was on February 1st. The stock yesterday was down five percent. This morning it's bouncing about one percent. Joining us right now GBH Insights Chief Strategy Officer and head of technology research Daniel Ives. Dan, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DANIEL IVES, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER, GBH INSIGHTS: Great to be here.</p><p>IVES: You still like Facebook stock. You're bullish on the stock despite?</p><p>IVES: Yes. I mean, look, this has been the darkest chapter for Zuckerberg in Facebook's 14-year history. But we view it -- as what's really baked into the stock is a draconian type of regulatory environment. If you think it's anything less caught slight to modest in our opinion, this is a significant buying opportunity. If you can navigate through these dark clouds that are going to become over the coming weeks and months for Facebook and Zuckerberg.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY: I have a hard time with that given the fact that there's so much uncertainty. And one of the things that we don't know, what's going to happen to management? Will they separate the chairman and CEO role? That's a real possibility. Because Mark Zuckerberg can't even apologize or be held accountable. He was a v victim. They were victims of this, considering the fact that consistently cozied up to advertisers that have done nefarious things on their platform post election. Then all of a sudden you're seeing the multiple compression, right? Right now they're still trading at 25 times earnings. I'm having a hard time buying into your thesis if they go from 25 to 20.</p><p>IVES: Look, I mean, there's no doubt. Right now the bear's going to come out of hibernation. I mean -- and you're seeing it. Ultimately we factored if they lose 10 percent advertising revenue up five billion a year. You fact that in, reduce the multiple, ultimately with $10.00 earnings power, 30 percent grower, I view it as a $180 to $190 stock. To your point has the upside been capped as you start to pick up from multiple expansion? No doubt. And this has definitely been -- for Zuckerberg, it's going to be a defining period. When he goes on his sort of (INAUDIBLE) sorry tour in front of Congress and others, that's going to be defining not just for Facebook but for Alphabet, for Twitter. You saw Twitter yesterday for social media peers. So this is really a game-changing fork in the road situation.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We should just point out. Twitter's stock fell 12 percent yesterday.</p><p>KISSEL: Yes. They're getting slammed.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's a huge haircut for one day.</p><p>KISSEL: But there's longer term problems here for Facebook. I mean, Facebook's user growth has been slowing now for a while.</p><p>IVES: No doubt. I mean, if you look at user growth, engagement, you get to two billion users, 50 billion in advertising revenue, you're going to hit a point right now where it starts to slow. And that's also why Twitter was starting to get sea legs, Snap continues sort of the up-and-down story. But when you look at Facebook from a fundamental valuation, this is really one way of using heavy-handed regulation, this is a game-changing move and ultimately to --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're talking about 30 to 40 percent upside potential for this stock? Is that what you see?</p><p>IVES: Oh, yes. I mean, in our --</p><p>BARTIROMO: In what time frame?</p><p>IVES: In our opinion, over the next year we view this as a 30 percent upside stock. I'm not saying you're not going to (INAUDIBLE) roller coaster over the coming weeks and months.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about the charges? I mean, how much -- how much money is this going to cost Facebook? Doesn't that cut into earnings?</p><p>IVES: Yes. And look, when we factored in like in terms of FTC and some of these other fines, if you factor in it's going to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, that's probably where we see FTC funds some of the class action lawsuits. But there's no doubt, if you look at Facebook right now, this is one of those -- it's a fork in the road. If you think this is the start of just a game-changer to the model and fundamentals, to your point, you don't own the stock.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Real quick. Instagram is owned by Facebook, so if Facebook, the social media platform gets hurt, where does the traffic go? Its goes to Instagram and they also on WhatsApp, so that gives them balance.</p><p>IVES: And that's -- and that's why even though from advertisers, it sounds great when you say, I'm going to come off Facebook for a week? You put the P.R. out, you feel good. Realistically, where are you going when it comes down online, if it's Faceboook. And ultimately, Amazon is probably a beneficiary on the advertising model. Because remember on FANG stock, Netflix, Amazon are really insulated from regulatory headwinds.</p><p>BARTIROMO: you're All right. We will leave it there. Well, you're sticking your neck out, Dan. Thanks.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Daniel Ives there. Coming up, we've got the final reading of the fourth quarter GDP due out in a few minutes. Economists are expecting growth of 2.7 percent. Markets are up going into the numbers. Dow Industrials are expected to be up 90 points. We're watching for any change of that, ahead of the number.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. I'm Maria Bartiromo. It is Wednesday, March 28. Your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Stocks looking to rebound. We are waiting on the GDP number out momentarily. The expectations call for growth of 2.7 percent. The number -- 2.9 percent is the number that is better than expected, just hitting the tape. This comes after yesterday's route on Wall Street. Right now, we're looking at Futures up 100 points as the number hits the tape of 2.9 percent growth better than expected. Yesterday, the market was down nearly 400 points. Take a look at the Dow Industrials down 344 points yesterday. 1.5 percent lower, the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ also lower. The NASDAQ hit hard yesterday. Three percent lower. But this morning, we're looking at money moving into stocks and this fourth quarter GDP number right now is actually boosting markets as it is up 2.9 percent. Versus an estimate of 2.7 percent. This market is up fractionally from where we we're going in to the numbers. Dow Industrials expected to be up 114 points at the opening of trading this morning. The S&amp;P and the NASDAQ are mixed right now. NASDAQ is slipping back into negative territory by two points. Joining us right now, is the dean of the Columbia Business School and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, Glenn Hubbard. Glenn, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GLENN HUBBARD, DEAN, COLUMBIA BUSINESS SCHOOL: My pleasure, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Just getting this final report on fourth quarter GDP on 2.9 percent growth. Your thoughts in where we are in the economy right now.</p><p>HUBBARD: Well, it's a number I expected. I was looking for somewhere between 2.9 and three percent. I think the economy was going into this year very strong. Maintaining it will depend on the effects of the tax bill, of a continued reset about expectations for growth. But I think it's a very good news number.</p><p>KELLY: Glenn, you know, one of the interesting things I look at is the durable goods report and it actually beat my expectations not only for nondefense spending. So, what are the reports you're looking at and where are they showing growth for this year? Because, you know, the durable goods they came out on Friday were gangbusters. That's leading me to believe we're going to get above the three percent, maybe 3.5 percent quarter this year alone. What are you seeing for the first quarter this year?</p><p>HUBBARD: Well, I think we've got a good news going in, as you say capital spending is up. And that's very promising. That have been a weakness in the recovery going in. So, I think, that's all good news. I think it would be hard to imagine the economy growing three percent plus consistently. But being in that range doesn't strike me as odd at all.</p><p>MARY KISSELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Glenn, Mary Kissel here, \"Wall Street Journal\", this Trump administration came into office just as the business cycle was nearing its end. Tax cuts really seem to give the economy a boost but now there's a lot of concern on the trade front. How do you see that impacting growth going forward?</p><p>HUBBARD: Well, I think a big impact right now, Mary, is uncertainty. The actual measures taken thus far like the steel or aluminum tariffs while they're not good public policy have been fairly modest. The China action as well. So, I think what business people are waiting for is, is this a game changer or is this more rhetoric? On the other side, their renegotiation of the U.S.-Korea agreement, that looks pretty positive.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Glenn, it's Dagen McDowell, what about the rise and borrowing cost, although we saw the yield on the ten-year treasury yesterday close below 2.8 percent had been below that level. I don't think since early February. Got a frontpage story in the \"Wall Street Journal\" today, that the rate that banks pay to lend to one another. LIBOR or the London Interbank Offered Rate. It's at its highest level in a decade. And, again, this rate is used to determine what -- the rate paid on about $200 trillion in loans globally. How much of a headwind is that for economic growth, particularly here in the United States?</p><p>HUBBARD: Well, it's definitely a headwind. But I think we have to step back and ask, you know, why aren't rates rising? They're rising because it's a better growth environment. We're rising because inflation is getting back closer to where the Fed wants it to be. So, I don't feel it as a bad story as long as all of this is gradual. As long as growth is there, I think we're fine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where is the growth? Would you say, I mean, we're just two weeks away from the first quarter earnings season and we're expecting earnings for the first quarter to be up 16 percent. Where specifically do you see the most growth right now in this economy?</p><p>HUBBARD: Well, I think we are seeing a rebounding capital spending sectors. Obviously, some weakness right now in the technology sector. But strong still in financial services, in health care, generally throughout the economy with consumer spending. So, I'm pretty optimistic. Again, what would worry me would be policy uncertainty or geopolitical events.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don't we have that? Don't we have policy uncertainty and GOP - - and also upset and uncertainty about the foreign story in terms of national security?</p><p>HUBBARD: What we do, and I think what we have to do is focus on what we can control, which would be the policy uncertainty. So, it'd be great to see the administration focus more on its low frequency successes and less on high frequency noise.</p><p>KISSEL: But how are consumers spending all this money Glenn? Mary again from the \"Wall Street Journal\". Aren't they taking out debt or they've putting on credit cards, or is this coming out of savings?</p><p>HUBBARD: It's out of savings, and that of course will require some adjustment going forward. Right now, consumers are more optimistic about growth and wages. If that optimism proves premature, obviously consumer spending would take a hit.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, I think one of the things that we're kind of tiptoeing around too is the strength the dollar last year. The market was up 20 percent and one of the reasons why is the dollar was down 10 percent, you're starting to see that the dollar actually selloff here. Is that good for the economy going forward in the regards to, hey, what's going to -- for the stock market right now. It's not good necessarily for our trade deficits in our exports. But what is your take on the dollar and how it's going to weigh on this market?</p><p>BARTIROMO: And, by the way, you would have expected the complete opposite, right? If the economy is growing the way we think it is, you would think that we would have a stronger dollar.</p><p>KISSEL: And you think we'd want a stronger dollar. They're talking down the dollar, just remarkable. Terrible idea.</p><p>HUBBARD: Yes, I agree with everything that's just been said. I mean, first of all, the dollar should be determined by market forces. Those market forces in my expectation should be pointing toward a higher dollar over the short to medium term. Obviously, a lower dollar does revise earnings and help stocks. But for the country as a whole, we should want the dollar in market forces, and we should want a strong dollar, not a weak one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You would think. Let me ask you about the Federal Reserve. Growing speculation that rising inflation could force the Fed to increase rates four or five times now? Is this -- I mean, five times is pretty aggressive out there. What's your expectation?</p><p>HUBBARD: I think five times sounds unlikely. Three is clear --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think, I agree with you.</p><p>HUBBARD: -- four, perhaps, but I think the Fed is watching inflation rise, but I don't think anybody expects inflation to suddenly snap out way beyond two percent. So, I think Chairman Powell and his colleagues are in a gradual adjustment mode, and that seems like a good place to be.</p><p>KELLY: Is there inflation, though? I mean, that's one of the biggest questions we're having on the street is that, you know, the PCE has consistently come around 1.5, you know, we'll get an outlier here and there. Otherwise, CPI is not really trudging above two. And so, I don't know where there is inflation. I haven't seen it come anywhere.</p><p>HUBBARD: Well, I think we will cross two percent in quarter PCE later this year. But I agree with you, I don't see inflation breaking out. So, I'm not one of these people worried about a sudden snap in Fed policy or indeed in a long-term rates, which would be the sum of inflation on the real rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Glenn, your thoughts on this deal with South Korea. It eases the steel tariffs and exchange for quotas on steel exports from South Korea. There's a provision as well to make sure not a country intentionally devalues the currency for a trade advantage. What do you make of this new deal with South Korea this morning?</p><p>HUBBARD: I don't think it's a bad deal. I think that there was a lot of uncertainty going into it because people didn't know what the administration was trying to accomplish. But I think it did make some marginal improvements for the United States. I Don't think we were even selling cars at quite our quota before, so I'm not sure what the expected gain will be. But I think it's not a bad thing. What I would urge the administration to do is be clear about what the goals are when you go in for trades, so that you don't create so much uncertainty.</p><p>KISSEL: I don't agree with that at all. I mean, we're again, we're moving back towards managed trade. We did this with Japan in the 1980s. I mean, what we did was extend protections for U.S. truck makers instead of forcing South Korea to lower their tariffs. There's no help here for our agricultural market. I mean, Glenn, this isn't expending market opportunities. This is managed trade. How is this a good deal?</p><p>HUBBARD: Well, I think it is a good deal for the sectors involved. I don't think it's the best deal that could be done. I share your views that we should move toward more openness. But given where this administration started, I'm actually pleasantly surprised.</p><p>KISSEL: Oh, so this is good from a low bar. That's what you're really saying?</p><p>HUBBARD: Well, I didn't quite say it that way.</p><p>KISSEL: OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If you're worried about protection policies from this White House, like, a little bit of give is a lot (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>HUBBARD: Exactly.</p><p>KISSEL: You know what? Glenn, I'm wondering if this has anything to do with South Korea and everything to do with the NAFTA negotiations that are going on that we basically strong armed South Korea into protection for certain industries so that they could pronounce a win and then go to the NAFTA partners and say, hey, look, if you don't do what we want, we're going to do what we did to South Korea. We're going to do it to you.</p><p>HUBBARD: That's possible. The Korea issue of course is complicated because it's not just the trade negotiation. It's the obvious elephant in the room of North Korea and those upcoming negotiations. So, it's really hard to see how they're connected.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well you know, I mean, at some point and it's like, any day now. NAFTA's off the table. I mean, let's face it. They have elections in Mexico, and then we had the midterm elections here. So, by the time you're actually going to get back to the negotiating table on NAFTA is well after November. So, I don't know that we'll hear any headlines in terms of NAFTA. There's that uncertainty out there. Let me ask you about the Atlanta Fed, Glenn. Because the president of the Fed in Atlanta told the journal the tax cut and increased government spending. Like, the recently passed $1.3 trillion spending bill could put pressure on monetary policy. What's your take on that $1.3 trillion spending bill and its impact?</p><p>HUBBARD: Well, I think the spending bill was unwise. It really is a continuation of Congress's unwillingness to grasp the fiscal situation we're in. Whether it radically changes monitory policy, though, I would be a little bit more questioning. I think, the Fed will continue to gradually increase rates. The only reason it would change monetary policy is if suddenly inflation snapped, or growth snapped out of a range. I don't really see that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll leave it there. Glenn, great to have you on the program.</p><p>HUBBARD: My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Glenn Hubbard joining us there from Columbia. Coming up, the final meet on the fourth quarter GDP, shows growth of 2.9 percent. Stuart Varney has a thing or two to say about that, he's going to weigh in.</p><p>Then Apple takes a bite of the education market. Where the company is cutting prices on its new iPad for students. Next.</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. Well, right now we're watching two names. And the first is Walgreens. Walgreens this morning right now we can see how it's trading. But they came out profit beat, sales beat, and raising the forecast. The stock is up 2.3 percent and the forecast is what's good news here for earnings. They raised this guidance for 2018 and say they continue to see growth. That's what they expect for 2018. And at least in part because of the recent acquisition of Rite Aid. Walgreens boots alliance up 2.3 percent, but it's been a real loser, and that is down 20 percent over the last 52 weeks.</p><p>Let's take a look at Apple this morning. So, Apple this morning looking down just slightly. They did have a Goldman Sachs down cutting their price target, which I'll explain in a moment. The big news is the new iPads for schools. What's happened over the last five years is that Apple has basically lost ground on the education market. Google Chrome books are huge, are up 60 percent right market share. Microsoft has in the 20 percent range and Apple has slipped. So now they're putting out this new iPad. It's going to be cheaper for the schools. Instead of 329, to be 299. It will have a stylus pen, which is only available on the highest Apple iPads. So that will be instead of 89 -- $99, it will be $89. By the way, Goldman Sachs lowered their iPhone sales forecast for the March of June quarters. Putting a new price target of 159. Much more. MORNINGS WITH MARIA coming up after the break.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we got the number as we're reporting the U.S. economy grew by 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter. That is the final reading out this morning. Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\" Stuart Varney with some thoughts there. Stuart, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Am I as surprised as you, or are you as surprised as I am? Because I wasn't expecting 2.9. That's pretty close to three percent growth, originally reported I think, back in 2.5, something like that. That's a very solid rate of growth. Now, here's my surprise not just at that solid rate of growth but at the market reaction. I see interest rates as in the ten-year treasury down at 2.76 percent. Why so low? Having recently touched 2.9, why are we at 2.76 when we've just got a nice, strong report on the economy? Why did Futures go from a gain of 90 to a gain of 48?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>VARNEY: How come that happened?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm wondering if it's this idea that rates are going to go up five times do I. I find that extraordinary, five interest rates hike this year. What do you think?</p><p>VARNEY: I suppose that's what's in the cards given the strength in the fourth quarter last year. But I'm just no good at predicting what the Fed's going to do. You know me, Maria. I don't do much on the Fed. I have a buzzer if I start running on about the Fed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right, you're right.</p><p>VARNEY: If you're -- if you're really talking about five rate increases this year. If that's what they're talking about, no wonder Futures are not performing really well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well that, I'm just trying to come up with an explanation of why the market went from up 100 to up to 50. Because, I think you're right. This is a solid growth story. (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Some of this is going to be end of quarter putting some lipstick on that portfolio and pulling back on these tech stocks --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- and reallocating to a safer asset, particularly going into a long weekend where the bond market closes midday on Thursday, I think it's closed on Friday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, stock markets are close on Friday as well.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, the market's closed Friday. It's supposed to be three-day weekend. But you know, Dagen's right there. The focus of the market this morning is not economic growth. It's not the Fed. It's not interest rates. It's technology stocks. They're still under pressure. They are under attack starting with Facebook. And I, think that's what's doing it to the overall market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. End of quarter positioning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Technology 25 percent of the S&amp;P at early February that was the highest percentage it's been since the dot-com bubble blew up back in 18 years ago this month.</p><p>KELLY: Just to get to GDP, I just want to point out the fact that this is a great number before tax cuts started to take effect.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true.</p><p>KELLY: I mean, you had people spending money. (CROSSTALK) It was the household spending number is what led this to 2.9 percent. So, if you think about that, that's before people even got those $1,000 bonuses from the corporations. So, this is leaning toward an even better number for the Q1 here. So, I think, the market is actually trying to digest this. If we're getting these great numbers before the policies took effect, what kind of numbers are we going to get for Q1 and the rest of this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good point.</p><p>VARNEY: The Trump growth agenda rolls on, does it not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly, and we got the jobs number out a week from Friday. So, let's see what that number is. And of course, first quarter earnings are going to start, Stuart, and they should be good.</p><p>VARNEY: They better be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see you in about eight minutes, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins half of the hour, right after mornings with Maria. But first, will President Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum impact the oil industry? Jeff Flock is live at the New York International Auto Show with some answers. Jeff.</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: And we have news on that this morning, Maria in an interview with Scott Keogh of Audi here exclusively on the FOX Business Network this morning. I'll get to that in the moment, but first, I want to show you the most important unveil. No, it's not the Camaro Hot Wheels 50th version, I just showed you that because it's kind of fun to look at. But take a look at the what I think it's the most important unveil of the show, that is the Toyota RAV4. Why is that the most important unveil of this show? Because other than the pick-up trucks, the F150 and the Chevy's and the rest, that is the best-selling vehicle in America. They sold 400,000 of those last year. And despite the fact that it was an old version, this new version is out now. So, people love the SUVs, and I think SUVs are the star of the show this year. If you take a look at the numbers, SUV sales in the U.S. this last year up six percent. Cars down almost two percent. There you go.</p><p>Now onto the news. That is on tariffs. We talked to Scott Keogh of Audi. You know, automakers are unsettled about this. Not only the steel tariffs and the aluminum tariffs but the potential of trade war. Here is what Scott Keogh told us on FOX Business this morning about his fears about trade war. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT KEOGH, PRESIDENT, AUDI: And I think a lot of this back and forth starts to put doubt into the system. You've seen the doubt a little bit with how the stock market responded and doubt is not a good thing for the business. We believe in free trade. We believe America competitiveness because when you're competitive, you have the best workers, you make the best products, and you win the day. So, that's what we believe in and, of course, the details, event flows, let's see where it goes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FLOCK: I leave you, Maria, this is the VW Atlas. They have a concept. They're about to unveil, and the rumor has it, and we are going to only say that much, they will unveil a pickup truck. A VW pickup truck concept. I talked to VW earlier. They said that's a very patriotic space, but they think maybe they can play in it. Interesting. See if they can get one that would sell, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jeff, do you think one of the reasons for the pickup and SUV sales is the price of oil? Maybe when gasoline comes down, people feel, well, then I will go big again instead of going for the smaller, electric cars.</p><p>FLOCK: I talked to Scott Keogh, and I said what do you think? And he said you know, with fracking and everything else going on around the world, I think I'll be retired before we have $4 gas again. He doesn't plan to retire any time soon, by the way. So, FYI.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well look, the fact (INAUDIBLE) are in New York this week, and I can tell you for sure, that they're saying $100 oil is going to look cheap in the coming years. I don't know. It feels like $100 oil is off the table with the supply coming out of the U.S. but --</p><p>KELLY: Well yes, the Saudi's are also -</p><p>FLOCK: There's going to be a lot of SUVs and trucks sitting around.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly.</p><p>FLOCK: If that's the case.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, the Saudis are capitulating doing a deal with the Russians on a 10 to 20 year cooperation. But, Jeff, I'm more interested in this Toyota RAV4 situation that you would brought up. The best-selling sort of mini- crossover, is there any indication why?</p><p>FLOCK: Isn't that amazing.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, is there any indication why that is? Have you gotten any color on that?</p><p>FLOCK: Well, people -- especially with the gas prices as they are and, of course, RAV4 gets pretty good mileage anyway. You know, people have just gone away from cars. There's plenty more room in these vehicles, if you've got kids, whatever you're doing, the SUVs work, you know? It's the station wagon of the new age.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mama McDowell -- Mama McDowell, can sum up in one sentence why people buy SUVs and pickup trucks. I can see out of it that's why people buy them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They don't like little cars.</p><p>FLOCK: Thinking high, they like to be high.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, I'm flying high and I can see -(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rather than sitting deep into a Sevan. That's absolutely right. Jeff, thank you.</p><p>FLOCK: Like always great.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jeff Flock at the International Auto Show in New York.</p><p>Coming up final thoughts from the officer panel. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, final thoughts of officer panel. Kevin Kelly.</p><p>KELLY: Earning season is going to be -- do very well. It's coming up in the next couple of weeks. We'll hear from bank first. That's going to lead the rally higher.</p><p>BARTIROMO: 60 percent earnings good, (INAUDIBLE) Mary.</p><p>KISSEL: Yes that's true. And I just want to make a quick note about trade, Maria. The White House is going to come out and really try to sell this deal with South Korea. Don't buy it, they're going to talk about the trade deficit. As if it's a problem. It's not, this is not a market opening. This is managed trade, it's the wrong way to go. Sorry (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, you are not liking that deal.</p><p>KISSEL: I don't.</p><p>KELLY: Kissel the missile.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And this real quickly, thank you to John Paul Stevens, former Supreme Court Justice. For actually proving to people who believe in the second amendment. That the left does want to take it away.

Oregon officials as I just said, claim that federal agents are leaving Portland after a deal was struck with the Trump administration but are they lying about that.</p><p>Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf says yes, he's going to tell us why. Also tonight, the war over hydroxychloroquine found a new battlefield today. A congressional hearing room. Two doctors are going to tell us why Big Tech might be endangering lives and Biden emerges from the bunker but does he know where he actually is?</p><p>And an anchor and actor gets an Emmy nomination for three minutes of work, three. Raymond Arroyo explains it in Seen and Unseen but first, do you know his name. That's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.</p><p>That question was posed by activists and protesters for weeks after the killing of George Floyd. It was meant to jar the nation into focusing on police brutality and it worked. Floyd's name and visage became synonymous with the suffering that comes from racial injustice.</p><p>Of course there were others who simply used his name for their own twisted political agendas as if burning down our cities would bring Mr. Floyd back or solve underlying problems. Of course, it just merely made matters worse and in the intervening weeks since the upheaval in late May, many more African-American families have lost loved ones to violence.</p><p>At least 144 have been murdered since June 1 in Chicago alone including these children. Three-year old Mekhi James, one-year-old Sincere Gaston, seven-year-old Natalia Wallace. All shot dead. But unlike with George Floyd, the general public won't remember them because the activists don't find their stories useful and the media also pushing a political agenda, they basically just yawn.</p><p>Last week in Milwaukee, a well-known passionate figure in the community, someone who had supported every issue from police reform and other liberal causes but lately he had been holding a homemade protesters-Trump signs. That man was murdered. He also happened to be African-American. He was shot and killed outside his office just after noon while he was sitting in a lawn chair. This happened in broad daylight. Do you know his name? I bet you don't. It's Bernell Trammell.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Saw the cops pull up. The vans, ambulance, firefighters and we sat and watched. They gave CPR for about 15 to 20 minutes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Security cameras capture these images of the suspect and police are continuing to investigate but the Milwaukee Central Journal reported just a few days ago that Reggie Moore, director of Milwaukee's Office of Violence Prevention said he recently intervene in a dispute between Trammell and a young man.</p><p>Moore thought the incident was related to a Trump sign that Trammell was carrying. And Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican tweeted this on the news of Mr. Trammell's tragic death. \" Bernell Trammell was known to many in Milwaukee. My condolences to his family and friends. I hope they get answers and justice soon.\"</p><p>Well, you probably won't be surprised to know that the major networks outside of Fox didn't even mention this horrific murder. Not of peek from CNN, MSNBC, The Washington Post, The New York Times, ABC news, CBS news or NBC. And this led YouTubers to pick up the slack and ask some pretty basic questions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MONIQUE PETERS, YOUTUBER: I can't for the life of me fathom how it's justified that just because somebody is a Trump supporter, that they get shot down in cold blood when they've never ever done anything to anybody other than express their opinions. I even wonder if the mainstream media is going to give it the amount of coverage that it's given some criminals out there that have died in the streets because they certainly don't give it to children. They don't get the coverage.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: No, they don't. And no one knows their names as I said but those victims are people too like Mr. Trammell was.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The guy was just full of love.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We had very deep conversations.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's just a community figure.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Tonight THE INGRAHAM ANGLE has exclusive video of Trammell's interactions just days before his murder that may shed light on what was motivating the homicide.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERNELL TRAMMELL, ACTIVIST: Obama has enough of work. Everybody say healthcare. We can't afford healthcare. We got no money. So Trump at least had whether the will of God or his own inspiration to do something that no President has ever done and that's why he got my vote. If I stood here with a sign saying Trump Trump Soldiers. I get my [BEEP] I get a rock thrown at me at best.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do you have? No fear. Come love me.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She just called you disgusting.</p><p>TRAMMELL: Well, it ain't right but at the same time we're America. Freedom of expression.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: You know he seemed to truly believe that, didn't he? Well, we have more of that video later in the show but at the very least, it reveals that Mr. Trammell was aware that he could be harmed for his pro-Trump views. Now if this is true, it's absolutely appalling as is the deafening silence from Democrats.</p><p>Where's Al Sharpton? Where's Black Lives Matter? A group that Mr. Trammell even supported by the way. But they're nowhere to be found. Apparently, certain black lives do not matter. Let's not forget the left's long history of ignoring vilifying or dehumanizing blacks who disagree. They're called Uncle Toms or race traitors. They're not authentic. Just like Biden said, you're not really black if you're not a Democrat. At least twice in the last few days, MSNBC hosts have proved my point.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Has Donald Trump ever promised you anything financially in exchange for your blind support of this administration or helping his campaign?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No and I've known him since 2015.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you a paid campaign surrogate? Are you being compensated?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You only ask me that because I don't fit your narrative.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: I'd like to turn the question on the anchor and say are you a campaign surrogate paid by the Biden campaign but how insulting is this? How demeaning? You didn't think this way on your own. You couldn't have come to this conclusion on your own using your own intellect. Think about that.</p><p>The Democrats and the radical media collaborators have been pulling a con on African Americans for decades. The party of slavery and Jim Crow. The party of segregation and the KKK has worked overtime to cover up its own sins in order once again divide us along racial and ethnic lines.</p><p>Now doing so requires that they demonize, disenfranchise, deplatform and dehumanize Americans who disagree. But they know I think that we're on to them and their sick game that more minorities are seeing through their sloganeering about black lives matter when in fact they act like only certain black lives matter.</p><p>More decent people I believe are seeing the pathetic failure in leadership in Democrat run cities where black and immigrant owned businesses are destroyed with impunity. Elected official so possessed by anti-Trump hatred that they actually do more to protect the rights of violent protesters than they do the rights of their own law abiding residents.</p><p>Now on occasion, a few honest Democrats will speak out as happened in a call with Mayor Lori Lightfoot early last month.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALD. RAYMOND LOPEZ (D-IL): We have to come up with a better plan because once - my fear is once they're done looting and rioting and whatever's going to happen tonight, what are we going to do and what do we tell our residents other than good faith people stand up. It's not going to be enough.</p><p>MAYOR LORI LIGHTFOOT, (D) CHICAGO: Thank you Alderman. Next question.</p><p>LOPEZ: No, I want an answer. You commented on everybody. I want an answer.</p><p>LIGHTFOOT: I think you're 100 percent. I think you're 100 percent full of s***. That's what I think.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Did you get that? To a Democrat city Alderman, you're 100 percent full of you know what. It doesn't have to be this way. African-Americans, Latinos, other immigrants who just want what everyone else wants. They want a fair shot. They want decent schools. They want safe streets. They can walk away from the party that's taking them for granted and abuse their trust and support for an agenda that actually will respect their freedom to make their own choices and to believe whatever they want.</p><p>Safe streets. Bernell Trammell wasn't killed by a corrupt police officer. He was cut down in the middle of the day after holding a Trump 2020 sign. That was his crime and that's THE ANGLE.</p><p>Joining me now is Horace Cooper co-Chair of Project 21 and author of 'How Trump is Making Black America Great Again.' Horace, we don't yet know the motive but this is a well-known community figure in Milwaukee who was assassinated in broad daylight and the media and BLM Al Sharpton and the rest of the gang can't even pretend to care.</p><p>HORACE COOPER, CO-CHAIR, PROJECT 21: This is just another example of how they jump to conclusions first and investigate later. The conclusion is Mr. Trammell's life didn't matter. The conclusion is there isn't any instance of any violence being attacked upon or brought upon people because of their political views.</p><p>We, you and I, we don't know what the story is. We're open. But it is strange that were the circumstances different, were he an active supporter of Bernie or Biden, it would be shocking if this wasn't front page news. Someone was holding a sign supporting a progressive or left wing candidate and now they're dead, that would be the sign and news that we would hear continuously.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes Jussie Smollett. Jussie Smollett story was believed immediately that he was beaten up by a bunch -</p><p>COOPER: It was too good not to be true.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, MAGA hat wearing thugs, white thugs jumped him, beat him up and he was barely able to crawl home with bleach all over himself. So that was just take that to the bank and run with it. This man who by the way, is adopted a lot of liberal causes as well.</p><p>COOPER: Absolutely.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Carries around a Trump sign and he's unabashed about it. Then he ends up dead and that's not a story?</p><p>COOPER: It's a story. I want to understand we've got wanted 1619 project where we're so interested and motivated by this idea that the race of America was its starting point, is its most quintessential important point. Why is there silence from The New York Times? Why is it that the party of segregation in the 19th century, the 20th century and even though, the 21st century has continually exploited people for political power and its own ambitions. Why aren't they being called out? Why haven't the media just raised some basic questions?</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now earlier this month on CNN, Actor Terry Crews actually hit the nail right on the head about why BLM just doesn't care about cases like Mr. Trammell's.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TERRY CREWS, ACTOR AND HOST: When you have the leaders of the Black Lives movement who are now talking about you know, if we don't get our demands, we're going to burn it down. Other black people who are talking about working with other whites and other - other races, being viewed as sell outs or called Uncle Toms, it starts - you start to understand that you are now, you're being controlled.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Horace, they set upon Terry for having the temerity to raise that point. He became persona non grata. That's where we are in the country tonight.</p><p>COOPER: Silence those who dissent. This is a pattern that we've seen from the 1800s, 1900s and now in the 2000s heading into deep into the 21st century. Where is the understanding that free people regardless of color have the right to express themselves, to think what they want to think? And where is the outrage that someone could be killed over this only if they don't support the leftist candidate?</p><p>Where is the outrage?</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, Horace, thanks so much. Great to see you tonight and as we noted, Trammell was ruthlessly gunned down in broad daylight in Milwaukee, last Thursday. This was amid growing outrage over the signs he was holding, supporting President Trump's re-election.</p><p>The police are currently asking the public to help identify the suspected shooter so we still don't know why Trammell was killed but tonight, I want to show you more of that video that INGRAHAM ANGLE exclusively obtained. It's footage from just days before Trammell's heinous murder.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRAMMELL: So today, if you noticed I moved a little closer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well and more people can interact with you on the sidewalk unlike the corner over there.</p><p>TRAMMELL: Right, right you know what I'm saying, when they're cussing and hollering, they can't jump out of the car and knock me out at the same time. He snatched the sign.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This one?</p><p>TRAMMELL: Yes, this one. I had to chase him across the street, grab him, swing him around, get the sign back. Well, that why I'm over here today. Over there, they're just about ready to kill me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Joining me now is Andrew Hitt, former prosecutor, Chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin. His office is also the one that got its hands on that video. Andrew, he says they're just about ready to kill me. What were your thoughts when you saw that, heard that for the first time?</p><p>ANDREW HITT, CHAIRMAN, REPUBLICAN PARTY OF WISCONSIN: Well Laura, I mean it is just so chilling to sit there and hear it and watch all of those videos. It's scary, it's terrifying when you think about it. We're a little under 100 days out from the presidential election and there's a real possibility that Trammell was killed as a result of this political beliefs for supporting President Trump.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now we're seeing on the screen now a picture of a suspect that the Milwaukee police has put out. Some local media have described him as about 6 feet tall, apparently African-American, about 30 years of age or so. That's the estimate. Weighs over 200 pounds. Anyone who has any information, he apparently rides a black bike. Anyone has information, please contact the Milwaukee police department.</p><p>Right now, we have federal court houses being threatened. We have another case where a Democrat in Wisconsin was assaulted by two women who today were arrested. We'll put their photos up on the screen when we have them. Again, that's a Democrat was assaulted at one of these protests. These are the two women who were arrested in that assault of Tim Carpenter, I believe I'm getting that name right.</p><p>This is gotten beyond dangerous. Now lives perhaps are being lost in jeopardize. We had an individual shot in Austin, Texas over the last several days. Where does it end up?</p><p>HITT: Well, you know it's hard to see where we go from here. I mean this is a low point. I don't recall anything like this ever happening certainly in Milwaukee or Wisconsin before and you know where we go from here is we have to as people who support the President, we've got to stand up, we've got to honor Trammell and his passion for the President and we need to get this President re-elected and that's what we're going to do in the fall of 2020.</p><p>Well, he was pretty well known in the community Mr. Trammell. I think, I called - I said Trammel before but surprise that there's not more coverage of this by the national media when he's on camera saying, I think they're going to kill me, holding a political sign.</p><p>What happened to people believing in political speech not being punished in the United States?</p><p>HITT: Well, not only do we not see coverage in national news but we're not seeing anything or hearing any reaction from Democrat leaders and Milwaukee, we haven't heard anything from Mayor Barrett. We haven't heard anything from Congresswoman Gwen Moore. Nothing from Governor Evers. Nothing from Attorney General Josh Kaul.</p><p>I mean we have somebody who stood up every day, got out on the street corner, supporting the President talking about his political views and he is dead now and you know we're less than 100 days out from an election. This is worth talking about. This is worth thinking about, being concerned about and we've got to bring attention to this.</p><p>That's why I called for an investigation by the United States Attorney.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You just rattled off all the Democratic officials in the state. None of them have addressed this. None of them have talked about it. That speaks volumes and we're going to stay on this story. Andrew, thank you for helping us understand this better tonight.</p><p>And still to come Raymond Arroyo on Biden's latest string of well, memory lapses plus did Oregon leaders just lie about the drawdown of federal troops in Portland. DHS Secretary Chad wolf is here and he'll set that record straight. Don't miss it.</p><p>INGRAHAM: President Trump travel to Midland, Texas, today the heart of America's fracking boom to laud our amazing oil and gas workers and warned about the newest threat to our energy independence.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Pennsylvania, Ohio, so many other places, you don't realize how big it is. They want to have no fracking, no nothing. This extreme agenda would mean the death of American prosperity at the end of the American middle class.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: He's right. Absolutely. The consequences would be dire especially for Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and elsewhere. That's why we're kicking off a new series tonight. It's called States of Discontent where we're going to examine how America, especially the swing states would fare under a Biden presidency because we know Joe is largely being controlled by a hard Left Obama alliance, it's imperative that the voters understand how his policies will in most cases radically alter the lives of most of you.</p><p>Let's start with the energy sector.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT): I'm talking about stopping fracking as soon as we possibly can. I'm talking about telling the fossil fuel industries that they all going to stop destroying this planet. I'm talking about -</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: But why?</p><p>SANDERS: To try - well, I'm not sure your proposal does that.</p><p>Biden: No more, no more fracking.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Of course Biden's handlers tried to walk back his remarks, claiming he'd only ban fracking on federal lands but he bent to Bernie there, right? And that would still do a huge amount of damage and moreover, do you really think that the squad would stand for only on federal lands banning it.</p><p>Now remember Biden appointed AOC to his Climate Policy panel after all with her stunning scientific acumen, who can blame him? She'll definitely be one of the loudest voices in the room so Pennsylvania, Ohio and Texas as we said are fracking powerhouses.</p><p>Voters in those states must realize that Joe's green new jobs fantasy will reward Democrat friends and destroy an industry, that's provided really good paying jobs to American families for over a decade now.</p><p>Let's look at numbers. A 2019 Chamber of Commerce study found that a fracking ban would lose more than 19 million jobs nationwide including 700,000 jobs in Ohio; 609,000 in Pennsylvania; 468,000 in Colorado and another 816,000 in Wisconsin and Michigan. States and localities of course would see their revenue shrink by $600 billion and children will suffer in states like New Mexico where a huge chunk of public education is funded through taxes on oil and gas.</p><p>Coloradan, well, you'd be on average $6500 poorer if fracking were banned. It'd be a climate stick up with Joe wearing the mask but wait, you can have faith in a green new deal, right? If higher taxes and endless funding for climate cronies, remember Solyndra, if that's your idea of fair, sure, it'll be swell.</p><p>Speaking of lives shattered under Democrat rule, we turn now to Portland. The site of months of violent Antifa chaos, their local leaders have refused to address. But could it be coming to a close. Today Oregon governor Kate Brown gleefully announcing that, \"the federal government has agreed to withdraw federal officers from Portland. They've acted as an occupying force and brought violence. Starting tomorrow all Customs and Border Protection and ICE officers will leave downtown Portland.\"</p><p>Sounds like she's declaring victory. Well, that would be a shocking development, right? But is that true? Joining me now is Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf. Mr. Secretary, she says agents are an occupying force and basically good riddance, she won. What do you say?</p><p>CHAD WOLF, ACTING SECRETARY, DHS: Well, I think that language is very irresponsible. Again, she's describing law enforcement officers, civil law enforcement officers who wake up every day, put the badge on, put the uniform on and protect the community and federal properties as an occupying force and responsible for the violence that we've seen in Portland.</p><p>And it exactly opposite. It's the violent rioters and criminals that we've seen there for over 60 days that are the occupying force in downtown Portland and have caused this violence that we have seen. So I took exception to that, to that language and I would say all of our men and women, law enforcement officers at DHS and those inside that courthouse that are risking their lives every day also take exception to that language.</p><p>INGRAHAM: So how many people are going to be left, federal officers left, in that courthouse, given I guess, the agreement you two came to?</p><p>WOLF: Absolutely. Well, DHS law enforcement presence will remain in Portland until we can be assured that the plan put in place by the governor and the Oregon state police is working, is effective and they can continue to do it night after night and keep the criminal and violent activity away from the courthouse.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Mr. Secretary, hold on, hold on. Do you have faith? She just called your people an occupying force. Do you have faith that given their language, their attitude, and playing politics with this, that that's going to happen and this is going to be secure, Mr. Secretary?</p><p>WOLF: Well, we're going to have to wait and see on that. But I think the key there is that none of the DHS law enforcement that are there today, that have been there for the past month or over a month at this point are leaving Portland. We will remain there. We will protect that courthouse. That is our responsibility, and that is our duty.</p><p>With the Oregon state police, we have a robust presence coming in to downtown Portland across the streets from that courthouse, and we're going to see if they can execute the plan that they put in place. And that's not going to happen overnight. We're going to have to stay there. We're going to have to understand if their plan is effective. And if it's not, then we'll continue to secure that courthouse.</p><p>INGRAHAM: You know what's incredible is a good friend of mine in New Orleans has an office basically right across the street from the courthouse there, a business. And he said to me over the weekend, he said this is a sought after location, because we always assumed that area is going to be safe. Isn't it ironic that now areas near federal buildings are going to give businesses pause when they decide where to locate if this kind of nonsense continues? It never struck me before as when he said that to me over the weekend. And apparently, they are not going anywhere near that New Orleans federal courthouse because they're concerned.</p><p>WOLF: Right. What I will say in cities like New Orleans and other cities across the country, we have a good relationship with the state and local law enforcement. And if there are threats and there are targets against those federal facilities in those locations, we work as a team together to address those. And unfortunately, that has not occurred in Portland over the last 60 days. I'm glad the governor stepped up at this time and is deploying the Oregon state police, that should have been done earlier to address this situation so that they can police city streets and city parks in the area that these violent criminals are organizing each and every night. So I'm glad they did it, and I'm glad they're join other responsible cities around the country.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, they clearly decided this is just not working out for them politically. I know you're not going to say that, but I'll say it. They are looking at the public opinion on this, and it's starting to turn against the Democrats. That's why they decided to start working with you.</p><p>The governor of Michigan said this about having federal officers in her state, Mr. Secretary. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER, (D) MICHIGAN: \"What we are worried about, of course, is the federal government is going to come in and do what they did in Portland.\" That is not acceptable. That is not necessary.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: So is she saying she does not want you to protect courthouses from being burned down? As the A.G. said yesterday, is this now acceptable behavior as a political tactic?</p><p>WOLF: Right. It's very confusing. I've received a number of letters from mayors and governors, and it doesn't make any sense to me, because what they don't understand, they don't understand the facts on the ground in their state or in their cities. Again, Michigan and elsewhere, we have a good relationship with local and state law enforcement, and they come to our assistance when we need them too. We don't see that in Portland, which has caused what we've had over the last 60 days. But in other states and other cities, local and state law enforcement understand that that partnership is critical to securing federal facilities and working together as a team.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right, Secretary, thank you.</p><p>Biden finally emerges from the basement, so surely he had a good event today, right? Raymond Arroyo will show you the latest, \"Seen and Unseen\" next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's time for our \"Seen and Unseen\" segment where we expose the stories behind the headlines. Biden escapes the basement for at least one event. For details we are joined by Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor. Raymond, Biden held a big presser yesterday, and he got rave reviews.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Joe Biden in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, today, not shying away from attacking Donald Trump.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Joe Biden is very comfortable in who he is and in his own skin.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He was fine in that press conference and answered questions coherently and intelligently.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Coherently, is that the standard now? How coherent and intelligent was it, Raymond?</p><p>RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: You know what, Laura, I'm not going to characterize it. I'm going to let the audience be the judge. This is how Joe Biden started the presser.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Kingswood Community Center. Actually, that's the one down I used to work. That was a joke. I didn't know where we were. Anyway.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: It's a joke, OK. It's unclear whether Biden knew where he actually was, Laura. And he was in his hometown where he does everything.</p><p>Then came the challenging questions from the press corps. Now note, all of the reporters were preapproved, Biden consults his list, and some reporters acted like they were campaign aides.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I would be happy to take your questions. Let me get my list here are.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm curious, why Delaware?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you running against President Trump or for president?</p><p>BIDEN: Do you think the president all of a sudden decided not to go to Tallahassee because he no longer thought it was an interest of the public?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Jacksonville.</p><p>BIDEN: I mean Jacksonville.</p><p>I'm not prepared to say much more than that right now.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Laura, are you trying to win your timeslot, or are you trying to get higher ratings than the competition? What kind of questions are these? And these performances of Biden, they don't exactly give voters confidence, that he's ready to lead or can lead any longer. Politics aside, you know what I always say, the more vigorous, vibrant candidate usually wins. That was Obama over tired old McCain and staid Romney. Trump was more vigorous than Hillary. And my sense is this race is tending in the same direction, which is why you see those tightening polls. The more people see this, the more his lead is eroding.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Raymond, I have a question for you tonight. Why New Orleans? Why? What kind of question is that?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ARROYO: That's all I'm going to say, Laura. I'm going to say no more.</p><p>INGRAHAM: The best is Biden answered, and he said, well, I find I can just campaign from here and nobody knows the difference. He explained why he doesn't have to campaign, because the press doesn't really hold him accountable for not campaigning. He's just going to stay in Delaware for the most part. What else?</p><p>ARROYO: This is why that Zogby poll, you see swing voters going with Trump by three to one, 65 percent for Trump, 21 for Biden. And a Marist poll has Biden at 59 percent support among Hispanic voters. That's worrisome for him. So he held an event with a Latino group today, but it was less than coherent and intelligent, Laura, and of course there were some technical pyrotechnics.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I have to ensure the people of Puerto Rico have support to rebuild their country.</p><p>Think of the psychic -- the damage done to the psyche of so many young Latinos.</p><p>The 2020 census, which is now two censuses ago, soon to be.</p><p>I used to think you could defeat hate. I used to. But it just hides under a rock. It hides under rocks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Laura, this is like grandpa trying to operate the Zoom call. If things are coming in and out. But this comes at an urgent moment for Biden. The new Rasmussen poll has Trump with 41 percent over the Hispanic vote and Biden at 46. He can't win with those numbers. And poor man, maybe that psychic, psyche -- maybe that Spanish. I don't know, I don't recognize that particular accent.</p><p>INGRAHAM: First of all, all these immigrant families in just the D.C. area, northern Virginia, Maryland, they are unable to send their kids to school because the teachers unions are blocking a return to in-person education despite to science, despite the real medicine. This is now an easy call for minority owned businesses. Your businesses are going to be threatened, burned to the ground, and now this.</p><p>What else? You have one more thing about.</p><p>ARROYO: Before we go, some entertainment news with political implications. The Emmy nominations came out today, and as my cameraman here said, he didn't know, no one else did either. Brad Pitt was nominated for playing Dr. Anthony Fauci, Laura, for exactly three minutes. And if lousy imitations are the path to victory, surely Kate McKinnon will win an Emmy for her lousy imitation for you, my dear. And yes, she is nominated as well, believe it or not.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Is she nominated?</p><p>ARROYO: Yes, for that intoxicated kind of high, I'm Laura Ingraham.</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK, we're running over, but this is how she did my impression. She talked like this, hi, I'm Laura Ingraham from the \"The Ingraham Angle.\" That's how she talks. I don't think I talk like that. It's just really bad.</p><p>ARROYO: And Brad Pitt did the worst Dr. Anthony Fauci I've ever heard. Terrible.</p><p>INGRAHAM: No, no, no.</p><p>ARROYO: Three minutes, and poor Eddie Murphy does an hour, he gets nominated in the same category. I hope Eddie and baby Yoda sweep everything.</p><p>INGRAHAM: If you thought \"Meet Joe Black\" was a flatliner performance, Fauci was. Raymond, thanks.</p><p>ARROYO: He'll be Joe Biden next season.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM: In moments, the war on hydroxy hits Silicon Valley, and Dr. Fauci cheers at all. Or was that Brad Pitt. Can't miss Medicine Cabinet next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Right now today, the cumulative scientific data that has been put together and done over a number of different studies has shown no efficacy. So when there is a video out there from a bunch of people spouting something that isn't true, the only recourse you have is to be very, very clear in presenting the scientific data that essentially contradicts that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: A bunch of doctors who actually treat COVID patients, Dr. Fauci. That was his latest attack on hydroxychloroquine. The video he is referencing is one that went viral before being censored by the social media giants. What are they afraid of? It featured medical doctors touting the benefits that they personally witnessed from treating patients with hydroxychloroquine.</p><p>And they are not alone. Joining me now is Dr. Harvey Risch, professor of Epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, and Dr. Stephen Smith, founder for Smith Center for Infectious Diseases and Urban Health. Dr. Risch, in your illustrious career, have you ever seen a commonly used drug this set upon?</p><p>DR. HARVEY RISCH, YALE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: No. Good evening, Laura. No. This is totally unusual, and just never seen before that I know of.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Big tech CEOs appeared before a congressional committee today, and the topic quickly turned to their ban on that hydroxy video the other day.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO: If someone is going to go out and say the hydroxychloroquine is proven to cure COVID when in fact it has not been proven to cure COVID, and that that statement could lead people to take a drug that in some cases, some of the data suggests that it might be harmful to people, we think that we should take that down. That could cause imminent risk.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: He should stick to comparing the pictures of hot girls at Harvard. Dr. Smith, how dangerous is it to have big tech now judging what the correct opinions are on medical science?</p><p>DR. STEPHEN SMITH, SMITH CENTER OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES: This is an enormous. It's an enormously bad development for U.S. medicine. It's horrible to have tech companies weighing on what's good and what's bad for you from a medical point of view, regardless of what the issue is.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Ohio is taking its cues from the leftist media on hydroxy. \"The Columbus Dispatch\" reporting pharmacies, clinics, and other medical institutions in Ohio will be prohibited from dispensing or selling hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 according to new regs issued by the State Ohio Board of Pharmacy. Dr. Risch, I've heard from several doctors in Ohio tonight about this. They said they have never witnessed anything like this, the drug that has been around six decades. And at the end of this new regulation, they admit that doctors do say it can be efficacious.</p><p>RISCH: That's right. But Ohio is no different except that they made this public. Forty-four states in total have restrictions and limitations on both prescribing hydroxychloroquine and selling it. And doctors are intimidated all over the country from doing this. So Ohio is more out in public about it.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Dr. Smith, lives, in my view, are in danger, in jeopardy because of this. But I'm not a doctor. You're the one treating COVID patients. Do you agree with that?</p><p>SMITH: A hundred percent. I've seen this. A large percent of our patients that end up dying or being intubated with COVID come to the E.R. and get sent home with nothing. And we know from the French data that that group that is mildly ill do very, very well with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin. And the combination is extremely safe. And that is really disturbing what is going on in Ohio and what is going on, period, with this drug. I don't understand it at all.</p><p>And yet, people have died because they did not get hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin coming to the E.R. They come back three or four days later, get put on a ventilator, and a month later die. That's an awful, awful thing to happen. It's happened several times to patients I'm taken care of. And we know --</p><p>INGRAHAM: I'm sorry to interrupt, but I hope people are understanding this, Dr. Risch, what they are hearing. Dr. Smith is one of the preeminent doctors in New Jersey treating patients, OK? He is a real doctor. He's a practicing physician right now in infectious diseases. Why is this happening, Dr. Risch? Is this political because Trump said it can work, and so if it works, then Trump is responsible for saving lives? What is going on here?</p><p>RISCH: I think the main reason is that the FDA has said that this drug has potential harms. And they said this, and it's on their website as of the posting July 1st, that it says in the title of the website that hydroxychloroquine should not be used in patients managed in outpatient circumstances with this drug because of risks of cardiac arrhythmias. But underneath that box, underneath the title, there's a box that says it was only from data --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Hold that, Dr. Risch. We'll have you back to continue this. We have to take a quick break. Stay there.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Dr. Fauci is changing his mind on masks again? Now they don't cover enough of your face.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You think where we are going to go to where eye protection is recommended.</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: You know it might, if you have goggles or an eye shield, you should use it. It's not universally recommended, but if you really want to be complete, you should probably use it if you can.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: What's next, scuba gear, spacesuits, ski goggles on the subway? Wait, I shouldn't give me any ideas. That's all the time we have tonight.</p><p>Shannon Bream, \"FOX NEWS @ NIGHT\" team, take it all from here.

But as you know THE STORY goes on. So we will see you back here tomorrow night. Thanks for being with us tonight, everybody. Have a great night. Stick around for Tucker Carlson, coming up next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening, and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. There is often disagreement in Washington. But if there's one thing that everyone who lives in the city knows for certain, it is that investigations of government officials are always a good thing. Yes, they can be expensive. They can run to tens of millions of dollars per. Of course they do paralyze the government making it impossible to fix our most pressing problems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And then if we're being honest about it, we will also concede that investigations tend to destroy the lives of completely innocent people.</p><p>But in the end, as anyone in Washington can and will tell you, all of that is well worth it. Investigations are a search for facts. Anyone who stands in their way, obstructs the truth itself.</p><p>That, ladies and gentlemen, is why we spent more than two full years looking into the question of whether or not Donald Trump worked secretly as an agent of Vladimir Putin.</p><p>There was never any evidence that he did that, but Hillary Clinton's campaign donors demanded a thorough investigation of it anyway. And so as you well know, we got that investigation.</p><p>In the end, the investigation in effect cleared Donald Trump of claims he colluded with Russia. But it also did something else. It inadvertently implicated quite a few other people for unrelated crimes.</p><p>We learned, for example, that quite a few senior law enforcement and Intelligence officials think nothing of lying to the public -- really lying to the public -- or of abusing their tremendous powers for partisan political ends. They did that, we now know that.</p><p>We also learned that the Obama administration was perfectly willing to spy on his political opponents in the middle of a presidential campaign. It did that, too.</p><p>Now, these are not small revelations, nothing like them has happened in recent American history. So it would seem wise to get the bottom of exactly what happened, who did it and why.</p><p>And as it turns out, for the past seven months, the Attorney General William Barr has been trying to do just that. He has opened an investigation.</p><p>Now, you would think, given everything you know about Washington, and its love of investigations that everyone in official D.C. would be thrilled by this, but you would be wrong. Because here's the thing. They are not happy in the slightest, they are outraged, in fact.</p><p>Former acting F.B.I. Director Andy McCabe went on CNN today to complain about Barr's investigation. As it turns out, McCabe is one of the people the Attorney General will be investigating.</p><p>Andy McCabe thinks that's completely outrageous.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDY MCCABE, FORMER F.B.I. DEPUTY DIRECTOR: There are two primary questions that I think you have to ask here. The first is why is he doing this at all? The circumstances behind the opening of the Russia case are not a mystery.</p><p>I have testified under oath about them as early as December of 2017. Jim Comey has made comments about them publicly. I have -- we've both written books that touched on the issues. So it's -- the circumstances behind the case are widely known. They were entirely validated by the Special Counsel investigation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Got that? Jim Comey and I already wrote bestselling books explaining our side of things. So what is there to investigate? McCabe seemed completely serious as he said this. How dare the Justice Department not accept my word at face value, despite the fact I was fired for lying?</p><p>You'd have to be lacking a certain -- what's the term here -- self- awareness to make a case like that on television, but McCabe was happy to.</p><p>And by the way, the CNN anchor seemed to agree with him wholeheartedly. It's certainly a common view in Washington.</p><p>A story in this morning's \"Washington Post\" for example, quotes unnamed Federal bureaucrats grousing that they might be subject to the same oversight the rest of us could expect if we ever stepped out of line.</p><p>Here's a direct quote, \"Current and former Intelligence and law enforcement officials expressed frustration and alarm Monday that the head of the Justice Department was taking such a direct role in reexamining what they view is conspiracy theories and baseless allegations of misconduct.\"</p><p>Got that? The allegations against me are baseless. I'm claiming from behind the cloak of anonymity. How dare you investigate us? Didn't you hear what I said? It's baseless. Call off your investigation. I already wrote the book. I already denied it.</p><p>Now, this is the part in the story when honest journalists might step forward -- by the way of all political backgrounds -- and remind us that that's a pretty ludicrous response, actually, and that nobody is above the reach of a Federal investigation.</p><p>But no, the kind of journalist who would make that point seems to have retired or at least no longer works at NBC News. Instead, we get hacks like this siding with the nameless unaccountable bureaucrats against the rest of us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEN DILANIAN, NBC NEWSINTEL AND NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: The top law enforcement official in the United States, Stephanie is spending his time amid all the great concerns that must be on his plate pursuing what many people believe is essentially a conspiracy theory about the origins of the Russia investigation.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It appears that it is just the Attorney General operating outside the normal D.O.J. channels to kind of, you know, roam around the world, roam around the Intelligence Community looking for ways to smear the people the President sees as his political opponents, the Intelligence Community and the F.B.I.</p><p>LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: William Barr could be as deeply implicated in what Nancy Pelosi has called the Trump cover-up as Richard Nixon's Attorney General was in the Nixon cover-up.</p><p>Tonight, the Attorney General of the United States once again, needs his own personally paid for criminal defense lawyer who might soon become the only person William Barr can safely talk to in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, whatever that means.

The people whose job it is to watch over the powerful people and hold them to account, they agree.</p><p>No oversight required. Ever feel like nobody's on your side?

Catherine, great to see you.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Tucker, good evening. The investigation into the genesis of the 2016 F.B.I. Russia collusion probe is global with confirmation tonight from a senior Justice Department official that Attorney General William Barr and U.S. Attorney John Durham were in Italy last week as part of the case.</p><p>A source close to the process tells Fox News that earlier this year, Barr got the runaround from senior Intelligence officials about the Maltese Professor Joseph Mifsud and whether he had connections to U.S., Italian or other foreign intelligence service.</p><p>The Special Counsel report describes Mifsud as quote, \"A London based Professor with connections to Russia, who told campaign a George Papadopoulos that Moscow had dirt on Hillary Clinton in the form of thousands of e-mails.\" Those claims let the collusion flame with the F.B.I. later opening the counterintelligence case.</p><p>In May after this Special Counsel report and before the July 25th phone call with the Ukrainian leader, President Trump told reporters he wanted Barr to cast a wide net.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The Attorney General is one of the most respected people in this country. I hope he looks at Australia. And I hope he looks at Ukraine. I hope he looks at everything, because there was a hoax that was perpetrated on our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERRIDGE: There is a second investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz into the surveillance warrant and renewals targeting the Trump campaign, but the scope of that investigation is narrow and Horowitz cannot compel some testimony.</p><p>A source close to the process tonight suggested to Fox News, the report could finally come later this month -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: That'll be interesting.</p><p>HERRIDGE: It will be.</p><p>CARLSON: Catherine Herridge, thank you so much for that. Well, Hunter Biden somehow got a corporate Board seat in a Ukrainian energy company. Why? Well, it seems obvious, the purpose would be influencing his father, who was Vice President at the time and whose portfolio included Ukraine.</p><p>Now Joe Biden, to the extent he has been asked about it -- not very often, presses deeply and curious -- but he certainly has been, and he says, well, it wasn't a corrupt arrangement, because he never spoke to Hunter Biden about the arrangement.</p><p>And yet, as we reported last night on this show, there is photographic evidence of Biden on a golf outing with both his son Hunter and a man called Devon Archer, who was another member of the Burisma Board.</p><p>What does this add up to? Doug Macgregor has deep knowledge of Ukraine. He is a former U.S. Army Colonel and author of the book, Margin of Victory.\" He joins us tonight. So, Doug, thanks so much for coming on. So you're familiar with the region and you're familiar with Washington.</p><p>COL. DOUGLAS MACGREGOR (RET), U.S. ARMY: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What do you think was going on here?</p><p>MACGREGOR: Well, I think we know now and in fact, for your information, \"Novaya Gazeta\" in Moscow has now just recently published an article backed up by documents that go into far greater detail than we can hear, but the bottom line is that the oligarch who is responsible for appointing Mr. Biden to the Board and his friend, Archer, Devon --</p><p>It seems that he was banned from traveling to the United States. And then magically after the appointment to the Board occurred, suddenly the ban on this man's travel to the United States was lifted, and his suspected criminal activities and shady business practices were suddenly ignored.</p><p>So if you're looking for quid pro quo, it's pretty hard to argue that there wasn't a quid pro quo, at least on that level.</p><p>CARLSON: That is -- that is absolutely remarkable and checkable by the way.</p><p>MACGREGOR: Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. And to this, you've got to add a whole range of other things, billions of dollars over many years in Ukraine disappearing into private banks. One owned by this particular oligarch, and $5 billion, $4 billion -- we're not really sure that may have been lost of that, at $3 billion or $4 billion came out of the I.M.F. that was supposed to jumpstart the Ukrainian economy.</p><p>So the whole problem with corruption in Ukraine is pervasive.</p><p>CARLSON: Ukraine is not a rich country.</p><p>MACGREGOR: Oh, no, not at all. It's terribly poor. It's probably the poorest country in Europe at this point. It's certainly below Russia in terms of per capita GNP, which Russia is at 68. Ukraine is far below that. Things are not getting better.</p><p>But the best barometer of what's wrong in Ukraine is the youth. They've suffered an enormous exodus of human capital out of the country. Millions have left, and these are the people with the education, with the ability to leave and get jobs.</p><p>There are an estimated two million in Poland, and they recently polled the 1.5 million that are legal, at least in small numbers, and the top reason for leaving is corruption in Ukraine. And a third of them have said they'll never go home because they think corruption is hopeless, it can't be eradicated.</p><p>CARLSON: So politically connected Americans who are getting rich from their connections in Ukraine are really exploiting the poorest nation in Europe and its people for money.</p><p>MACGREGOR: This is where the swamp has consequences overseas, as well as here at home. Somebody like Hunter Biden is literally stealing from the Ukrainian people. That's what's really tragic about this, and it doesn't stop with him.</p><p>We could spend a lot of time talking about many politicians who have been involved in one way or another. But a good example is this recent military aid package. We're providing $400 million in aid.</p><p>It sounds like a great idea, unless you're a Ukrainian in the military and you look at this, and you see that most of the equipment that you're supposed to buy is coming from the United States, and much of it is not what you need. Much of it is not terribly useful to you, you would rather buy other things, things based on your experience, things that you can use immediately.</p><p>So who is getting -- who is benefiting from this $400 million aid package? We've got to go to the Senate. Look at the senators who sponsored it, the people in the House who sponsored it, look at the U.S. defense industries.</p><p>So it's kind of a recycling of American money, but it's not necessarily going to profoundly benefit the Ukrainian military establishment.</p><p>CARLSON: That is -- the deeper you dig, the sleazier everything that happens in the city becomes. Put that picture on the screen one more time.</p><p>We heard this last night, we asked the Biden campaign for comment on it, and of course, they haven't responded at all. Doug Macgregor, thank you for that perspective. Fascinating.</p><p>MACGREGOR: Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: And tantalizing, too. Well, between the Biden's and the President -- President Trump -- Ukraine drama has the potential to be devastating for both parties in Washington.</p><p>What's likely to happen? Brit Hume is Fox's Senior Political Analyst and he joins us tonight. Brit, thanks so much for coming on.</p><p>So, this is one of those moments where it would be good to remind us what exactly the President stands accused of doing.</p><p>BRIT HUME, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: He stands accused of using American aid as a lever to get the Ukrainian government to investigate the Biden's for the purpose, it is alleged, of helping Trump's campaign. That's basically what the accusation is.</p><p>CARLSON: Is that a credible claim?</p><p>HUME: Well, it is not clear from the evidence presented so far that that is what he is doing. Now, if you are suspicious of Mr. Trump and think he's a bad guy, and you read the record of that phone call, you might infer that, but you also might very well not infer that because it's not at all explicit that that's what he's doing.</p><p>Because when the subject of the -- you know, when the issue comes up and they mention the Biden's, it's not right --</p><p>He asked for a favor, but that's not the first thing he asked for. Only later in the conversation does he then bring up the question of looking into the Biden's and he is quite vague about it.</p><p>He said, you know, we might look at that, because I heard the guy got -- the prosecutor got fired and it looked pretty bad to me. And that was the end of it. It's not clear at this point tonight, Tucker.</p><p>We know that some aid was withheld, for sure. Right? And it was later released. The Trump team says he was holding it back because he was concerned that the United States was carrying the burden in Europe once again, and putting up all the money to help these guys and the rest of Europe isn't doing its part.</p><p>I know that when Senator Rob Portman, who was very much in favor of that aid being released spoke to the President about this, and the President was talking about withholding the aid what he -- all he talked about in that conversation was his, you know, he was bellyaching once more about Europe not pulling its weight in this regard.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HUME: So it's not at all clear that the evidence supports the accusation, but that's where we are.</p><p>CARLSON: Interesting. So you, I'm sure heard Doug MacGregor say that according to a Russian newspaper -- obviously, we haven't confirmed this -- but that the oligarch overseeing this energy company in Ukraine was allowed access to United States, taken off a cannot visit list after the Vice President's son joined the Board. If that turns out to be true -- I don't know -- if it does, is that meaningful?</p><p>HUME: Well, it would be meaningful if we could connect that step by the U.S. government to the Biden's in some way and we might be able to do that, we might not. We don't know.</p><p>CARLSON: Why would -- and we should also say that this is very common in Washington. Hunter Biden is far from, I mean, if we are being honest, far from the only son of a famous politician to get a deal like this. But why would a foreign company, a Ukrainian energy company, for example, pay someone like that?</p><p>HUME: Well, basically, the same reason that these companies in Washington pay lobbyists.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HUME: They consider it, in a sense of defense. They are looking for ways to advance their interests. So you get someone with the name Biden on the Board and that might help you.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HUME: Now that doesn't establish that Biden, the young Biden himself did anything corrupt.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>HUME: It doesn't establish that Joe Biden did anything corrupt on his son's behalf. It does seem to suggest this, however, if you are going to tell the Ukrainians as then Vice President Biden did, that you're not going to get this aid unless you fire this particular prosecutor, and you've got the son of the Vice President associated with that, with a company that figures in that prosecutor' investigation. That on its face is a conflict of interest and is improper, even if there was good reason for asking right that the prosecutor or the investigator be fired?</p><p>CARLSON: It sure seems that way.</p><p>HUME: Because it looks wrong. Biden is a lawyer, right? His son is a lawyer. Both of them should know better. The Obama administration should have known better than to have the Vice President be the point man on this threat, which, as you seen the Vice President brags about.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HUME: He talks about how, I went over there and I told them I was leaving in six hours and if they didn't fire this guy. They were going to get the money and son of a bitch, the guy was fired. That's --</p><p>CARLSON: The tough guy thing again, as he often does.</p><p>HUME: By the way, the next time you show that picture --</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>HUME: The golfing picture.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, yes.</p><p>HUME: You might point out to the guy you're talking about is the one on the far left, because there's no way to tell that.</p><p>CARLSON: For sure. That's exactly right.</p><p>HUME: He is the guy in the dark blue shirt on the far left there.</p><p>CARLSON: That's right. Devon Archer is another member of the Burisma Board.</p><p>HUME: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: Brit Hume, thank you.</p><p>HUME: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Elizabeth Warren says she plans to rein in America's tech companies, maybe even unwind some of their monopolies. So why does so much of Silicon Valley support her? Why are they holding fundraisers for her? Couldn't be they know she doesn't mean it? We will investigate after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has caught up to Joe Biden in the polls in both Iowa and New Hampshire. It's pretty clear, she is the party's front runner.</p><p>One reason could be that she has promised to break up America's gigantic, terrifying, and all powerful tech monopolies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm deeply concerned right now that this space around companies like Amazon, Facebook, Google, is now referred to by venture capitalists as the kill zone.</p><p>So my view is, break those things apart and we will have a much more competitive and robust market in America. That's how capitalism should work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, it's a good idea, and some people are taking it seriously. Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg is worried about it. Newly leaked audio shows Zuckerberg trashing Warren's anti-Facebook agenda.</p><p>Other Democratic candidates, meanwhile, are tramping through Silicon Valley to raise cash. Fox Correspondent, Gillian Turner is here with more. financially and Turner's here with more. Hey, Gillian.</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker. Good evening. So in this new leaked audio tape, tech titan, Mark Zuckerberg has been caught red handed, telling his staff what he really thinks about Silicon Valley investor sweetheart, Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>He fears a Warren presidency would pose a quote, \"existential threat\" to his company.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACBEBOOK: Elizabeth Warren picks up the right answers to break up the companies, I mean, if she is elected Presidents then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal change. And does that still suck for us? Yes.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER: Zuckerberg doesn't stop there. He says Warren's policies aren't just bad for Facebook's bottom line, they are also bad for democracy.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: It's just breaking up these companies, whether it's Facebook or Google, or Amazon is not actually going to solve the issues. And you know, it doesn't make election interference, less likely, it makes it more likely because now the companies can't coordinate and work together.</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>TURNER: Warren was quick to respond. She tweeted, \"What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices.\"</p><p>Now, this is a familiar theme from Warren and the other 2020 Democratic hopefuls. They say big tech has become too big. The social media companies are spying on Americans, stealing their data and fake news bots are corrupting American democracy.</p><p>Yet for all the tough talk and threats to regulate and rein in these companies, the candidates can't stop seem to taking their money. As of tomorrow, there will have been a total of 16 fundraisers across the Bay Area and just six days for six different Democratic candidates, all raising millions of dollars.</p><p>Biden, Buttigieg, Harris, Booker, Klobuchar -- all cashing in this week with major fundraisers and sources tell Fox News it represents the biggest Silicon Valley campaign donation haul of the entire primary season so far.</p><p>And Tucker it's a two-way street, Warren's campaign despite all of this criticism of Facebook has spent nearly $1.5 million buying Facebook ad space since July to promote her candidacy.</p><p>CARLSON: With the evil company that she wants to break up.</p><p>TURNER: That's right.</p><p>CARLSON: Gillian Turner, thank you for that.</p><p>TURNER: You bet.</p><p>CARLSON: The impeachment drama in Washington has temporarily distracted everyone from the ongoing Democratic primary, but impeachment is also certain to have a political effect on the race itself.</p><p>So the question is -- not to be vulgar about it -- but who benefits most? Dana Perino hosts \"The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino,\" one of our all- time favorite people. Dana, great to see you tonight.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Great to see you, too.</p><p>CARLSON: So the conventional view, which is to say my view, the surface view is that Biden is not helped by any story that gets us talking about his son's board seat with Ukrainian energy company, and that Elizabeth Warren is probably the beneficiary of that. Do you think that's true?</p><p>Per Well, I think that the questions surrounding Hunter Biden were going to come up at some point for the Biden campaign. And if you think back, it was July that \"The New Yorker\" magazine did this really long feature piece about Hunter Biden. It didn't get a ton of attention.</p><p>I read the whole thing because I learned early on from you, you always read these long magazine pieces because you can pick up things.</p><p>So this was going to come whether it came from President Trump or from perhaps one of his rivals on the 2020 scene on the Democratic side, it was definitely coming. So they were going to have to deal with it sooner or later.</p><p>But there is a beneficiary, and it is Elizabeth Warren, no doubt. She has had arguably the best summer of all of the candidates. She's raising a lot of money. She is now, in my opinion, the de facto leader of the Democratic Party until something else happens.</p><p>And with impeachment, she can kind of kill two birds with one stone, because Trump impeachment has like this toxic fallout, right? It encapsulates Biden, but it also for many -- many people think -- it has completed the radicalization of the Democratic Party. They are now on a war footing.</p><p>And she can kind of sit back. She doesn't need the media attention right now. Others do, like Kamala Harris. You look at what she tried to do today by having a campaign shake up. That's something you do when you're trying to get a little attention for your campaign.</p><p>And she didn't have a great fundraising number. It was fine. $11 million. But Bernie raised $25 million. Pete Buttigieg raised $19 million. So something had to give and Elizabeth Warren I think is content to sit back and let other people try to get some attention while she prepares for this month's debate.</p><p>CARLSON: Do you think the Trump campaign believes that? Do you think that they believe Elizabeth Warren is the person they're likely to face?</p><p>PERINO: I think that they are -- from what I can tell, they seem to be prepared for any eventuality. They are happy to try to dirty up the Biden campaign early on. They are looking at Elizabeth Warren. I mean, even President Trump himself said, gosh, I thought I really hit her with the Pocahontas thing, and now she's back.</p><p>Who hit her with the Pocahontas thing this week? Well, it looked like it came from one of her 2020 Democratic rivals, having old videos resurface of her, having said that her parents had had to move because of her mother's Cherokee background, et cetera. Like that's going to come back around.</p><p>But for now, I would say Elizabeth Warren is definitely in the catbird seat.</p><p>CARLSON: Interesting. Is there any other -- and this is purely speculative, but what's to do in politics ...</p><p>PERINO: That's what we do. It's our --</p><p>CARLSON: ... if you can't speculate exactly, that's exactly right. Let's be honest about it. Is if -- I agree with everything you've said, if you had to pick one candidate on the Democratic side, who had a shot of coming from the outside, and lapping Elizabeth Warren by the time it's over, who would that be? Who do you think?</p><p>PERINO: When you say outside? What do you mean like outside of the recent politics?</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I mean, I think most people think Elizabeth Warren is going to be the nominee at this point. I mean, Biden clearly is not up to it.</p><p>PERINO: I think that's pretty early. Look, I wouldn't -- you know, I don't think Bernie Sanders is going to get it either. However, you know, he is holding his own. He raised $25 million in the third quarter. That is not somebody who is dropping precipitously.</p><p>Biden's numbers have gone down quite a bit. I don't think Kamala Harris really looks like she has it there. Cory Booker, for example, this past weekend, he had to do an emergency fundraising plea for $1.7 million. Got his friend Bon Jovi to help him out. He barely makes it in.</p><p>Tom Steyer, the big billionaire in Mr. Impeachment, Mr. Climate Change. He is going to be on the debate stage as well on October. This field is not actually narrowing down very quickly, but I think that might change by Thanksgiving.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm enjoying the heck out of it. So --</p><p>PERINO: It's very fun.</p><p>CARLSON: May it continue for many moons. Dana Perino, great to see you tonight. Thank you, as always.</p><p>PERINO: Thanks. Have a good night.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, once again, the media turned a supposed hate crime into a national story, only to find out that the crime was, in fact, a hoax. That raises the obvious question, why do the media keep falling for these hoaxes? And should there be consequences for lying to your readers, and listeners and viewers again, and again and again? That's next.</p><p>CARLSON: Actor Jussie Smollett as you know got away with his fake hate crime, thanks to the intervention of the State's Attorney Kim Foxx, a special prosecutor is investigating that case. But it turns out the prosecutor was himself a donor to Kim Foxx's campaign. How does that work exactly?</p><p>To find out we go to Fox's Matt Finn in Chicago tonight. Hey, Matt.</p><p>MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Tucker, we've got yet another twist in the Jussie Smollett saga. It turns out that the special prosecutor assigned to investigate this entire case previously donated $1,000.00 to Kim Foxx, that's a State Attorney at the center of the Jussie Smollett scandal that the special prosecutor is investigating.</p><p>Attorney Dan Webb is a revered prosecutor, a former U.S. Attorney. He is considered unbiased, a no nonsense and was assigned by a veteran judge in August to review the entire Smollett case. He can charge Smollett with the same or even new criminal charges and he can bring charges against anyone he discovered committed a crime that includes Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx.</p><p>You'll recall Kim Foxx had to suddenly recuse herself from Smollett's case after texting Michelle Obama's former Chief of Staff about Smollett.</p><p>And later, there was outrage when Kim Foxx's office suddenly dropped the charges against Smollett. Well, now a status hearing this Friday will decide if a new special prosecutor needs to be reassigned because it's been revealed that Dan Webb's law firm hosted a fundraiser for Kim Foxx back in 2016, in which Webb himself cut Foxx a $1,000.00.</p><p>Webb says he doesn't recall attending this fundraiser or making the contribution to Kim Foxx as her office continues to cooperate with this investigation, and at this hearing Friday, Dan Webb could recuse himself or a new special prosecutor could be assigned. So stay tuned -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Amazing. Matt Finn has been on the story from day one. Thanks a lot, Matt.</p><p>FINN: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: Jussie Smollett was not the first phony hate crime in this country and likely won't be the last. Fake hate crimes in fact had become routine here. They become routine because our credulous media rushes to believe them, all of them. They want to believe that America is a hateful, intolerant country despite the evidence.</p><p>Last week, for example, a sixth grade girl at a Christian school in the State of Virginia claimed that three boys attacked her at recess. Immediately, this became a national news story and the press hurried to racialize it as they do so much. Most people don't spend their lives thinking about race, the media does.</p><p>\"The New York Times\" wrote this headline quote, \"Black Virginia girl says white classmates cut her dreadlocks on playground.\" \"The Times\" knows that America is a hateful country. They believe this with zero evidence. So they're eager to tout any story that backs up that storyline. It's also true that the Second Lady, Karen Pence sometimes teaches at that school in Virginia and so the story was also used to tar her by association.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A 12-year-old African American girl said three white classmates pinned her down and cut her dreadlocks.</p><p>The wife of the Vice President Mike Pence, she teaches there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A black sixth grader says she was pinned down by white classmates who cut her hair.</p><p>BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN HOST: A 12-year-old Virginia girl says she is traumatized after three of her white classmates pinned her down and cut some of her dreadlocks off.</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence's wife, Karen Pence teaches art, part-time at Emmanuel.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So after whipping up even more suspicion and race hatred, the Press found today that this like almost every other hate crime that's made headlines in recent years was fake.</p><p>Yesterday, the girl's family admitted the allegations were untrue, and they apologized. Good for them.</p><p>But we have far less sympathy for the media in all of this. This isn't a one-off incident. Of course, it's a pattern. They did it after the 2016 election. They did it with the Covington Catholic boys. They did it this week over and over and over again. The press in fact abets hate crimes because that's exactly what these are. They are hate crimes. They are not false accusations or hoaxes.</p><p>They are deliberate efforts to defame an entire group of people to arouse hate against them, and the press abets this. They drive it. They do it over and over and over. And when they're caught feeding a lie, they pretend it never happened. They face no consequences and they do it again just weeks later.</p><p>It's not a victimless crime. All of us are the victims of this. It hurts the country. It makes people hate each other. It divides them on the basis of skin color, which is the worst way to divide people.</p><p>Robby Soave is an Associate Editor at \"Reason,\" and author of \"Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump,\" and he joins us tonight. Robby, let me just ask you since you are, I think, the living expert on fake hate crimes, why they follow an unchanging pattern. It never changes why?</p><p>ROBBY SOAVE, ASSOCIATE EDITOR, \"REASON\": The media seizes on these things the second they here about them without any care to actually properly investigate them because it's -- they believe -- they want to believe this narrative about America, right? That it's the most hateful place that's ever existed, that Trump has caused it. It fits exactly with their political bias.</p><p>So they don't even, I think, imagine sometimes that these things could be made up even though as you pointed out, a lot of times they are.</p><p>I mean, in this case, who thinks to themselves, you know, a really awful incident between a bunch of kids, but it should be turned into national news, why? Who says let's get this little girl in front of a camera and inflame the entire nation about racial hatred when something like this happens?</p><p>I mean they put her in a position where, you know, kids act and kids lie. Kids screw up, right? And they're supposed to be able to learn that's wrong and they would punished with, you know, in proportion to what happened, maybe a suspension or something and then they learn from that and they get on with their lives.</p><p>But because you decided this group should be on television talking about this. Like now, she is going to be subjected to all of this like national shame, it's terrible. Who thinks like that? That this needs to be something the entire country has to get itself worked up about. Right? That's crazy.</p><p>CARLSON: And you kind of wonder, and it's impossible to measure. The point you're making is such a smart and valuable one.</p><p>And I guess the next point would be, what's the effect on the country? If you persistently tell people that they're swimming in an ocean of race hate, and that everybody is inflamed with bigotry, which is totally a lie, by the way.</p><p>SOAVE: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: But if you tell people that what -- you know, what does it do to how they feel about their neighbors? How they feel about America?</p><p>SOAVE: Well, then they credulously believe things like statistics. I mean, \"The Washington Post,\" all sorts of media outlets ran with this a couple of months ago that you know, hate crimes had spiked like 226 percent in counties where Trump hosted a political rally.</p><p>I looked at that study, actually, if you kind of control for population size in counties, it tends to be that you have Trump-visited counties that have more people in them. So of course, there's more hate crimes. The statistical correlation dropped to zero. There was just as many -- there's just as much of a hate crime increase in counties Hillary Clinton visited. Because again, they're just bigger counties.</p><p>So -- but this was a headline that every major media outlet ran with based on this completely flawed study. And of course, people are believing it. Bernie Sanders' campaign put it out. Ilhan Omar talked about it.</p><p>And there are probably tons of people in the country who believe that and they, just like you said, believe that about their neighbors, their relatives, the people they work with, and we should not be driving people to hate each other. People can find reasons to hate each other.</p><p>CARLSON: That's right.</p><p>SOAVE: And we don't want that to happen. We want people to get along. But we shouldn't be like adding fuel to the fire when there's nothing or when it's much less than what it is actually being claimed.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, especially not an ethnic grounds, because that's not resolvable. If I'm mad at you because we disagree on something, maybe we'll agree someday. But if I'm mad at you because of something you can't control, that's never going to get better. So it's very reckless to do this.</p><p>SOAVE: And there is real racism in our country. But I think a lot of people end up not believing that there is because of this stuff. Every time it blows up, it backfires. It's like a boy who cried wolf problem.</p><p>CARLSON: That's for sure. Robby, thank you.</p><p>SOAVE: My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, virtually all of the 9/11 hijackers came from Iran. No, sorry, Iraq. Oh, no, wait, they came from Saudi Arabia. The members of that country's government may have in fact assisted them on 9/11.</p><p>And yet today, Saudi Arabia is such a close ally of the United States that we may go to war with Iran, which had nothing to do with 9/11 for their sake. How did we get here exactly? An in depth exclusive investigation on that question, next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, today unfortunately marks the two-year anniversary of the Las Vegas shooting that was the deadliest shooting massacre in modern American history. Fifty nine people died that day, including the gunman, Stephen Paddock.</p><p>Authorities though, in two years have been unable to find a clear motive. So what have we learned, if anything? Chief Breaking News Correspondent, trace Gallagher joins us tonight with that. Hey, Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker, the F.B.I. looked at hundreds of video tapes, listened to hours of 9/11 calls, interviewed dozens of witnesses, not to mention scouring every detail of the shooter's life and yet two years later, there is no motive as to why Steven Paddock opened fire on a Music Festival killing 58, wounding more than 800.</p><p>Consider that the F.B.I.'s report into the school shooting at Sandy Hook was 1,500 pages. The report on the Vegas shooting, three pages. And the only theory is that Paddock was an aging man in declining health with troubled finances who may have been looking for a way to gain infamy.</p><p>Over the course of six days, Stephen Paddock brought 23 bags to his hotel room. In those bags, he carried 23 weapons and enough ammunition to fight a small war. His shooting lasted 10 minutes in which he fired more than a thousand rounds using a dozen different weapons, many of them equipped with bump stocks that allow semi-automatic firearms to mimic the motion of a fully automatic.</p><p>Fifty pounds of Tannerite explosives were also found in Paddock's car leading some to believe he was planning to escape the hotel and pull off a lethal finale.</p><p>But the F.B.I. believes Paddock set up several cameras outside of his hotel suite so that he would know when police got close and take his own life, which he did.</p><p>Also unanswered is why the local police response was so slow and why they waited more than an hour to storm Paddock's room. The final report from local police also offered no motive and few answers.</p><p>I talked about all of this case in a lot more in our new documentary called \"The Las Vegas Massacre,\" and that is airing now Tucker, on Fox Nation. Fascinating stuff -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Bless you for doing that, Trace. That's one of those stories that we should keep probing, I think, so thank you for doing that.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, after 18 years of war, you'd think the United States would be finally winding down its presence in the Persian Gulf. Instead, the opposite appears to be happening.</p><p>At times, we seem to be on the brink of bombing Iran. Why are we doing that? Well, we're doing it primarily to protect Saudi Arabia.</p><p>In Washington, the Saudis are overwhelmingly considered by both parties to be one of our closest allies. The strange thing is that Saudi Arabia has far closer links to the 9/11 attacks than Saddam Hussein ever did -- much less Iran. We're always hearing about Iran. Iran had nothing to do with 9/11.</p><p>Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, was so connected to 9/11 that the families of many 9/11 victims are seeking justice -- payment -- as recompense for the Saudis role.</p><p>So how exactly does the country and its government get to ignore this? And what is the nature of America's relationship with Saudi Arabia?</p><p>We decided to take a closer look at that question. Here's what we found.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARK ESPER, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: In response to the Kingdom's request, the President has approved the deployment of U.S. forces.</p><p>CARLSON (voice over): That was Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, announcing a deployment of troops to help our quote, \"partner\" in the region. Not all Americans though view Saudi Arabia as an ally.</p><p>Chris Ganci, a New York City fireman lost his father on 9/11.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS GANCI, NEW YORK CITY FIREMAN: I think the American people should know what the Saudi involvement in 9/11 was before we commit treasure, well, God forbid American blood to a cause.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON (voice over): Ganci is one of thousands of family members of 9/11 victims suing Saudi Arabia. Their lawsuit states that Saudi Arabia quote \"knowingly provided al Qaeda with support, financing and resources that were material, substantial and critical to the success of the September 11th attacks.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM KREINDLER, ATTORNEY FOR 9/11 FAMILIES: For years, Saudi Arabia through its charities had been funneling money to al Qaeda to get ahead in Saudi Arabia, to rise in the government, you need to show fealty to Osama bin Laden.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON (voice over): A heavily redacted 2012 report describes the support Saudi government officials gave to two hijackers after they arrived in Los Angeles.</p><p>The officials gave the two al Qaeda members quote, \"assistance in daily activities,\" including providing money and helping the hijackers get flying lessons.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEN WILLIAMS, FORMER F.B.I. AGENT: Many Saudi government officials were in cohorts if you will, with several of the 9/11 hijackers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON (voice over): In a sworn declaration in 2017, retired F.B.I. Special Agent Steven Moore stated that the hijackers, quote, \"would have had zero chance for success without a support structure waiting for them.\"</p><p>The families still want me information declassified about Saudi involvement, and feel as if their own government has betrayed them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRETT EAGLESON, RELATIVE OF 9/11 VICTIM: One would like to think that the F.B.I. works for the American people, not the interests of Saudi Arabia. They are choosing to side with the Saudis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON (voice over): The Justice Department recently cited state secrets and national security in refusing to declassify a 2012 F.B.I. report that contains Saudi ties to the 9/11 hijackers.</p><p>In that same court filing, the D.O.J. decided it would only release the name of an individual who directed two Saudi officials to help hijackers under protective order.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GANCI: The obstacles that the American government has put up just for the truth is very disheartening.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON (voice over): The U.S. government has not been keen to hold the Saudis to account in the wake of 9/11. Shortly after the attacks, the Bush administration allowed more than a hundred Saudis, including members of the bin Laden family to leave the country on chartered airplanes.</p><p>And two years ago, the Trump administration cautioned a retired F.B.I. agent from working for the 9/11 families.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I couldn't believe that my former employer was telling me not to give assistance to the victims of 9/11.</p><p>To me, it was unconscionable. It really disturbed me.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's an understatement. Unconscionable. We asked the F.B.I. about Ken Williams' claim that he was told not to work with 9/11 families. They told us they are not commenting on that. They can do that. They just refuse to comment.</p><p>We will continue to follow this lawsuit for as long as we have to because we think it matters.</p><p>Well, one of America's most liberal cities is banning urinals. Why are they doing that? For the sake of gender equality of course. Tammy Bruce, next.</p><p>CARLSON: The left's campaign against science in general and Biology in particular, has already claimed quite a few victims, the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts among them, but here's a new one -- urinals.</p><p>Portland, Oregon is abolishing urinals in all of its municipal buildings. The purpose is to quote, \"remove arbitrary barriers\" -- arbitrary -- between the sexes for the sake of gender neutrality.</p><p>How to assess this? Tammy Bruce hosts \"Get Tammy Bruce\" on Fox nation or reason to subscribe. She joins us tonight. Hey, Tammy, was there groundswell of support for this? Did people ask for this?</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NATION HOST: No, not really. I mean, from the beginning -- this is a great question, Tucker, because whether it was the transgender bathroom issue or this, nobody wanted this to change. Nobody was having a problem. The transgenders weren't crying for bathrooms change. Women weren't saying, get rid of the urinals.</p><p>CARLSON: That's right.</p><p>BRUCE: And this is going to be the case in the men's bathrooms as well, all the bathrooms. And here's the reality, Donald Trump is delivering jobs, prosperity and the future. Democrats are delivering wet toilet seats.</p><p>Maybe because this is -- now, at least men will find out what it's like to walk into a stall or into a bathroom and have the toilet seat up or not.</p><p>And then that's the other issue, separate from the inevitable bathroom humor, that fact is that this is actually very serious. This is an issue - - the bathrooms are the one very kind of intimate personal space in public space and they're trying -- it is a desperation to create a gender neutral framework, which is false.</p><p>I mean, we've been listening to the climate science apostles for, you know, years now, and certainly a lot in the last couple weeks, where we're being told listen to science. Well, let's try that. Right?</p><p>And except in this instance, apparently. They don't want us to listen to science, when it comes to Biology and Physiology.</p><p>And look, there are many different people in the world. I'm one of them, right? I'm a sexual minority. And the fact is, you know, we're part of a -- we're a minority in a part of a larger framework, and that's okay.</p><p>I don't think anybody wants us all to be homogenous and for it to all be the same.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course.</p><p>BRUCE: We understand the differences and this is just an unnecessary attempt to be too woke.</p><p>CARLSON: I knew you would take it to the deeper level. We appreciate that about you. Tammy Bruce, great to see you.</p><p>BRUCE: Thank you, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Back tomorrow, 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn and totally sincere enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Sean Hannity live from New York City right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Trump </nameText></person>had used against Mr. Cruz in the 2016 presidential race. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with you,'' Mr. O'Rourke said. ''He's dishonest, and it's why the president called him Lyin' Ted, and it's why the nickname stuck -- because it's true.''</p><p>  ''It's clear Congressman O'Rourke's pollsters have told him to come out on the attack,'' Mr. Cruz replied.</p><p>  In their first debate last month, Mr. O'Rourke was largely reserved and anything but aggressive. He had trouble boiling down his expansive responses into memorable zingers, and his just-good-enough performance most likely played at least some role in Mr. Cruz's recent lead in the polls. On Tuesday, however, Mr. O'Rourke was far sharper and edgier. He sweated more, used his hands and arms to punctuate his arguments and repeatedly cast Mr. Cruz as dishonest, ineffective, more focused on running for president than representing Texas and beholden to corporate interests.</p><p>  In one exchange, Mr. Cruz was asked about Mr. Trump's trade war. Mr. Cruz said he was against it, and pivoted to talk about Mr. O'Rourke's remarks about impeaching the president, calling his opponent ''the only Democratic Senate nominee in the country who has explicitly come out for impeaching <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person>'' He added that if Mr. O'Rourke had his way, there would be ''two years of a partisan circus'' aimed at ousting the president.</p><p>  Mr. O'Rourke replied, ''It's really interesting to hear you talk about a partisan circus, after your last six years in the U.S. Senate.'' Then he switched gears as well, to talk about Mr. Cruz's relationship with Mr. Trump, who is coming to Houston on Monday to hold a rally for Mr. Cruz.</p><p>  ''Listen,'' Mr. O'Rourke said, ''if you have this special relationship with <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>then where is the result of that? You are all talk and no action.''</p><p>  But Mr. Cruz largely kept his cool, and even chuckled out loud at some of Mr. O'Rourke's attacks. He continued to paint Mr. O'Rourke as a liberal who is too radical for Texas and who wants to steer the state away from the low-tax, low-regulation mantra that Republicans view as the key to the Texas economy's success.</p><p>  ''Have you noticed in this debate he doesn't talk about what he has accomplished in Congress?'' Mr. Cruz said. ''Because he has scored political points rather than accomplishing victories for the people of Texas.''</p><p>  Only once did Mr. Cruz grow audibly frustrated -- but that was aimed at one of the two moderators, Jason Whitely, a senior reporter at WFAA-TV in Dallas. Responding to a question about incivility in politics, Mr. Cruz made a point about partisanship, saying, ''There is an anger, there is a rage on the far left.'' When Mr. Whitely tried to interject, Mr. Cruz said sharply, ''Don't interrupt me, Jason,'' and then continued discussing his views on treating others with respect.</p><p>  ''The personal attacks, the going to the gutter that is so common in politics, I've tried not to engage in,'' Mr. Cruz said.</p><p>  The displays of fireworks aside, there was no single significant moment in the debate that seemed certain to help or hurt the two candidates with about three weeks to go to Election Day. Mr. O'Rourke was clearly aiming to energize his base of voters and trying to remind Texas independents and moderates of misgivings they may have about Mr. Cruz.</p><p>  The two candidates clashed from the first question, about the security of voting and whether Congress should regulate social media companies. Mr. O'Rourke said that voting and the ballot box were ''under attack'' more than ''any other time in our nation's history'' and argued that Senator Cruz had not done enough to finance greater election security measures. He also criticized <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>relationship with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, given Russian's interference in the 2016 American election, and pledged to ''stand up'' to Mr. Trump while saying Mr. Cruz had not.</p><p>  Mr. Cruz said he had supported legislation to do more to protect American voting, but also focused on ''political bias of big tech, of Facebook and Google'' and said he was concerned that social media was not protecting free political speech on social media.</p><p>  Mr. O'Rourke also criticized Mr. Cruz for opposing the Violence Against Women Act, while the senator presented himself as a strong supporter of the #MeToo movement and victims of sexual assault and misconduct.</p><p>  ''The #MeToo movement has done an incredible amount of good for our country,'' Mr. Cruz said. ''I believe everyone, women and men, girls and boys, need to be protected.'' As the father of two girls, and the son and husband of women who had careers, he noted that he helped lead a Senate effort to stop secret settlements by members of Congress over sexual harassment complaints.</p><p>  Mr. Cruz and Mr. O'Rourke were facing off for the second and perhaps final time, as Mr. Cruz seeks to widen his lead in the polls and Mr. O'Rourke tries to restore dimming Democratic hopes that he can unseat Mr. Cruz and pull off the biggest upset in modern Texas political history.</p><p>  The battle between Mr. Cruz and Mr. O'Rourke has captivated and polarized Texas and drawn enormous interest nationwide, with the candidates raising far more money than those in typical Senate races. Mr. O'Rourke raised a record-breaking $38.1 million in the last three months alone, the most of any Senate candidate ever. And he has enjoyed a kind of pop-culture celebrity status, getting a shout-out from the young El Paso soul singer Khalid at the American Music Awards and jamming on stage with Willie Nelson. On Thursday, he will appear in a live town-hall event on CNN in the border city of McAllen.</p><p>  Mr. O'Rourke's CNN town hall has become a contested issue. The Cruz campaign asked CNN to change the format of the event into a town-hall debate and to allow the two candidates to hold their third debate there. In a letter to CNN, Jeff Roe, Mr. Cruz's campaign manager, wrote that if they were going to spend an hour ''on national cable news discussing and debating the issues important to Texas voters, we believe it should be on a stage with our opponent.''</p><p>  The network had originally invited both candidates to participate in a town hall, with each candidate appearing separately on the stage in individual segments. The Cruz campaign had accepted but later backed out, the network said. CNN said in response to the Cruz campaign request that it would convert the event into a debate if the O'Rourke campaign agreed to the change.</p><p>  It was unclear if Mr. O'Rourke was going to agree. Although three debates were originally scheduled, one of them set for Houston was postponed, and it was uncertain whether it would be rescheduled. It seemed possible that Tuesday night's debate was the final one.</p><p>  For weeks, several polls showed the two candidates running about even, an extraordinary feat in Texas, where Democrats have failed to win any statewide offices since 1994. But lately the polls have shown Mr. Cruz building a lead over Mr. O'Rourke. One Quinnipiac University poll last week showed Mr. Cruz ahead by nine percentage points and another by The New York Times Upshot and Siena College had Mr. Cruz up by eight points.</p><p>  ''The polls are beginning to reflect the reality that is Texas -- we are a conservative state where Republicans dominate,'' said Allen E. Blakemore, a prominent G.O.P. political strategist in Texas. ''Beto's campaign was always built on a myth, and he's taken $70 million from liberals all over the country to launch a quixotic adventure. It's been a vanity play.''</p><p>Texas Democrats remain cautiously optimistic, with some more cautious and others more optimistic.</p><p>  Few, if any, Democrats running statewide in Texas in recent decades have generated the amount of enthusiasm that Mr. O'Rourke has. In the 2014 race for governor, the party's nominee, Wendy Davis, enjoyed an initial wave of excitement but then trailed the Republican, Greg Abbott, by up to 12 percentage points in the polls four months before the election, and some Democrats were publicly and privately grumbling about her campaign's missteps.</p><p>  Mr. O'Rourke is running a tighter race and a smoother campaign, effectively turning much of his life into a social-media live stream, allowing his supporters to watch him as he drives between events and gets a haircut.</p><p>  ''He's probably running the best campaign that's been run in Texas in my lifetime,'' said Garry Mauro, a former state land commissioner who was the chairman of Hillary Clinton's campaign in Texas in 2016. ''I'm on his Facebook. At one time yesterday he had 13,000 people watching him drive in the car.''</p><p>  On Tuesday night, Mr. O'Rourke was lucky to have made it into the studios at all. Before the debate, the parking attendant outside the KENS 5 television station was surprised when Mr. O'Rourke pulled in driving his own vehicle. He regularly drives himself campaigning around the state. Debate night was no different.</p><p>  ''If you don't have a pass, I don't know how to get you through,'' the attendant told Mr. O'Rourke. His wife, Amy O'Rourke, sat in the car, joined by staff members. They were live-streaming the drive to the debate on his Facebook page.</p><p>  ''This is how you know it's real,'' Mr. O'Rourke said. After some consultation, the parking attendant sent Mr. O'Rourke in.</p><p>  ''Thank you,'' Mr. O'Rourke said. ''Thank you for your service.''</p><p>  He rolled up the window.</p><p>  ''We passed the first hurdle,'' Mr. O'Rourke added.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: <person><nameText>Representative Beto O'Rourke, </nameText></person>left, and <person><nameText>Senator Ted Cruz </nameText></person>on Tuesday.

View original post here[2]. Submitted by Mark Orsley of PrismFP[3] Potential for a 60-day tariff exemption extension another vol killer  S... hitting a historic extension level that would suggest a correction within the next month  More signs of 'Techlash'  With Trump said to be willing to extend the deadline for higher tariffs another 60-days, we are really looking at another two months of compressed volatility for risk assets. Making matters worse is the Fed's neutral stance which means fixed income volatility will continue to not realize the implieds. All this has obviously been a boon to the US equity market which continues to benefit from those who are returning to the equity market after the December debacle. </p><p>Any and all indicators show that positioning is returning to more normal levels and the cash that had been on the sideline being deployed. So now what? My view has been a near term FOMO rally to 2800 and then we shall reassess. It fits my Elliott Wave count where the 5th and final wave should be completed around there, and it is where the market has roughly failed three times prior since October. Also note in the below chart that you are seeing the MACD indicators narrowing which is a sign of waning momentum, and the RSI now hitting over bought conditions.  Therefore, expect a mind numbing grind to that 2800 region and then let's see where the fundamentals stand at that point. I will flash one indicator that jibes with the idea that the parabolic rally off the December crash lows is nearing the final stages. The level of the S...utures versus its 50-day moving average is severely extended. In fact, over the last 20 years, it has only been this extended twice.  Both those occasions saw a significant correction one month later.  The risk of a bull trap is something to consider as Spoos grind up in a mind numbing manner. It is well known that the Fed pausing their rate hike cycle helps, more positive trade war rhetoric helps, and Cisco 'beating' helps but there are developing regime shifts occurring that make just being blindly bullish more difficult than it ever has been. I have discussed the 'Techlash' theme quite a bit but to quickly recap it is the idea that the government imposing regulations on Silicon Valley put the tech sector's best days behind us. On that front, we have seen some potentially game changing headlines this week. Both are in the early stages but let's just put it on the radar for now: California Governor wants a digital dividend aimed at Big Tech - would let consumers share in the billions of dollars made by technology companies off of those companies sharing personal data (similar how to how Alaskan residents share in the state's oil revenues)  Sen. Marco Rubio to introduce a bill that would tax corporate buybacks like dividends in an attempt to spur companies to spend on capex, wages, etc instead of doing share buybacks  Where will S... trade if buybacks are reduced? Bottom line, if you aren't long already; you are too late. Also, its time to start thinking about profit taking on longs and conceivably attempting shorts around that 2800 level.

O Facebook estava finalmente entrando na lucrativa arena de servi\u00e7os financeiros com um servi\u00e7o de pagamentos A decis\u00e3o do BC ressalta o desafio do Facebook em tentar ganhar a aprova\u00e7\u00e3o dos reguladores financeiros e as complexidades que esses \u00f3rg\u00e3os de controle enfrentam na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de riscos de deixar as gigantes de tecnologia soltas pelo mundo. No Brasil, o epis\u00f3dio tamb\u00e9m levantou quest\u00f5es sobre a comunica\u00e7\u00e3o em torno do lan\u00e7amento. Executivos do WhatsApp e autoridades do BC realizaram pelo menos tr\u00eas reuni\u00f5es nos 21 meses anteriores, incluindo duas na semana anterior ao lan\u00e7amento. O presidente do BC, Roberto Campos Neto, disse \u00e0 Reuters, em sua primeira fala com mais detalhes a respeito da decis\u00e3o, que a autarquia n\u00e3o havia decidido ainda como lidar com o modelo de pagamentos proposto -- uma novidade no Brasil, onde n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel transferir recursos por meio de aplicativos usando cart\u00f5es.  \"Teve uma reuni\u00e3o pr\u00e9via, onde foi mais ou menos explicado o que era a inten\u00e7\u00e3o, mas n\u00f3s fomos pegos de surpresa com o lan\u00e7amento no dia 15 de junho porque n\u00f3s entend\u00edamos que uma coisa relevante teria que ter passado por um trilho de aprova\u00e7\u00e3o como todos os outros passaram\", disse ele em entrevista. O BC, que afirmou nunca ter recebido um pedido formal de autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o conforme esperado, suspendeu o servi\u00e7o, o Facebook Pay, em 23 de junho.  Campos Neto e outras autoridades do BC disseram que as preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es se concentram em concorr\u00eancia, privacidade de dados -- eles n\u00e3o forneceram detalhes -- e em delibera\u00e7\u00f5es em curso quanto \u00e0 necessidade de uma licen\u00e7a para o WhatsApp operar enquanto ofertante ou parte integrante de um arranjo de pagamento.  O WhatsApp disse \u00e0 Reuters que respondeu \u00e0s perguntas do BC e forneceu o cronograma de lan\u00e7amento do servi\u00e7o durante as reuni\u00f5es finais. \"Conversamos abertamente sobre nossos planos de trazer pagamentos pelo WhatsApp para o Brasil\", afirmou.   A empresa acrescentou estar profundamente preocupada com a privacidade dos usu\u00e1rios, informou que os detalhes financeiros seriam armazenados em uma rede apartada segura, e disse possuir contratos de seguran\u00e7a de dados com todos seus parceiros.  O WhatsApp afirmou que n\u00e3o quer se tornar uma empresa de servi\u00e7os financeiros. No Brasil, institui\u00e7\u00f5es financeiras est\u00e3o sujeitas a requisitos de reserva de capital e regras r\u00edgidas. Como uma maneira de contornar o entrave, mas jogar conforme as regras em vigor, o WhatsApp procurou usar as bandeiras Visa e Mastercard, que j\u00e1 possu\u00edam licen\u00e7as do BC, para realizar as transfer\u00eancias de dinheiro. A informa\u00e7\u00e3o foi corroborada tanto pela Visa quanto pela Mastercard.  \"O WhatsApp entrou em contato conosco h\u00e1 cerca de dois anos para criar uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o de pagamentos que trouxesse conveni\u00eancia a seus usu\u00e1rios e tamb\u00e9m porque n\u00e3o queria se tornar uma institui\u00e7\u00e3o financeira\", disse o presidente da Visa no Brasil, Fernando Teles. O WhatsApp afirmou que usou sistemas de pagamentos existentes da Visa e da Mastercard, que s\u00e3o reguladas no Brasil. No entanto, Campos Neto pontuou que um servi\u00e7o de transfer\u00eancia de dinheiro via cart\u00f5es fornecido por uma grande empresa de tecnologia nunca existiu no Brasil, e que o BC ainda n\u00e3o havia decidido se o WhatsApp precisava de uma licen\u00e7a. \"Vale lembrar que big tech n\u00e3o est\u00e1 em pagamentos em grande parte do mundo\", disse ele \u00e0 Reuters em 8 de julho. \"Ent\u00e3o a gente ainda est\u00e1 numa fase de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o regulat\u00f3ria em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao que vai vir.\"  N\u00e3o \u00e9 a primeira vez que o Facebook parece ter interpretado mal os meandros da regula\u00e7\u00e3o enquanto busca entrar no mundo financeiro, riqu\u00edssimo em dados. H\u00e1 um ano, a empresa divulgou planos para a criptomoeda Libra, mas foi confrontada com a contundente rea\u00e7\u00e3o dos bancos centrais. No caso do Brasil, a oportunidade \u00e9 grande, com um mercado de pagamentos via cart\u00f5es crescente que registrou R$ 1,8 trilh\u00e3o em transa\u00e7\u00f5es no ano passado.   Nos est\u00e1gios iniciais de seu servi\u00e7o, o WhatsApp tamb\u00e9m buscou fazer uso de uma regulamenta\u00e7\u00e3o de pagamentos que permitia \u00e0s empresas iniciar servi\u00e7os sem licen\u00e7a at\u00e9 atingirem R$ 500 milh\u00f5es ou 25 milh\u00f5es de transa\u00e7\u00f5es em um per\u00edodo de 12 meses, segundo fonte pr\u00f3xima \u00e0 companhia. Isso, novamente, estava dentro das regras. No entanto, o dispositivo, segundo Campos Neto, foi constru\u00eddo para incentivar pequenas empresas a entrar no mercado, em oposi\u00e7\u00e3o a uma grande companhia de tecnologia como o WhatsApp, com 120 milh\u00f5es de usu\u00e1rios brasileiros.  \"O que o Whatsapp fez \u00e9 que eles tentaram se valer dessa prerrogativa, de que 'n\u00f3s vamos come\u00e7ar com uma volumetria muito baixa porque uma hora que eu j\u00e1 estou no sistema depois \u00e9 dif\u00edcil tirar'\", afirmou o presidente do BC, classificando a investida como um \"artif\u00edcio de volumetria\".  O BC alterou a regra em 23 de junho, dando amparo \u00e0 possibilidade de suspens\u00e3o dos servi\u00e7os de empresas de arranjo de pagamento por ele supervisionadas.  Tr\u00eas reuni\u00f5es foram realizadas entre o WhatsApp e o BC sobre o servi\u00e7o de pagamento antes do lan\u00e7amento, de acordo com registros p\u00fablicos da autoridade monet\u00e1ria: em outubro de 2018 e neste ano, nos dias 9 e 12 de junho, com um desses encontros finais contando com a participa\u00e7\u00e3o de Campos Neto e do diretor de opera\u00e7\u00f5es do WhatsApp, Matthew Idema.  O WhatsApp disse que tamb\u00e9m apresentou ao BC seu modelo de parceria com a Visa e a Mastercard em 2019, embora a Reuters n\u00e3o tenha conseguido verificar de maneira independente essa reuni\u00e3o e o BC tenha se recusado a comentar encontros ou datas. Visa e Mastercard disseram \u00e0 Reuters que n\u00e3o notificaram o BC acerca dos planos de realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de transfer\u00eancias de recursos em parceria com o WhatsApp porque acreditavam que j\u00e1 tinham as licen\u00e7as necess\u00e1rias. \"N\u00e3o havia uma regra espec\u00edfica sobre pagamentos via servi\u00e7os de mensagens no Brasil, por isso fizemos (a parceria) dentro das regras que existiam\", disse Jo\u00e3o Pedro Paro, presidente da Mastercard para o Cone Sul da Am\u00e9rica Latina.  AMBI\u00c7\u00d5ES GLOBAIS O rev\u00e9s \u00e9 o mais recente golpe nas ambi\u00e7\u00f5es globais em pagamentos do Facebook, fundamentais para aumentar sua receita nos mercados em desenvolvimento, que respondem pela maior parte do seu crescimento em n\u00famero de usu\u00e1rios.  O WhatsApp tenta lan\u00e7ar um servi\u00e7o de pagamentos desde 2018 na \u00cdndia, seu maior mercado, mas segue empacado em testes beta. [nL4N27S3YC]  O servi\u00e7o de pagamentos no Brasil n\u00e3o iria cobrar por transfer\u00eancias para usu\u00e1rios individuais, mas os lojistas pagariam uma taxa por transa\u00e7\u00e3o. Uma preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o envolvendo a concorr\u00eancia, de acordo com uma fonte pr\u00f3xima ao BC, \u00e9 o uso pelo WhatsApp da Cielo como sua processadora de pagamentos - ou adquirente - para cart\u00f5es como Visa e Mastercard. A Cielo j\u00e1 possui uma participa\u00e7\u00e3o de mercado dominante de 40% no Brasil.  \"Eu preciso que me mostrem que \u00e9 aberto. Ou seja, que se algum outro adquirente quer entrar nesse novo arranjo, ele tem liberdade de entrar\", disse Campos Neto, embora n\u00e3o tenha mencionado a Cielo.  O WhatsApp afirmou que o acordo que assinou com a Cielo n\u00e3o envolve exclusividade. A Cielo se recusou a comentar, mas j\u00e1 afirmou anteriormente que n\u00e3o existe exclusividade. Um outro ponto que esquenta a discuss\u00e3o entre as partes \u00e9 que o BC planeja lan\u00e7ar em novembro sua plataforma de pagamentos instant\u00e2neos, o Pix. Ele possibilitar\u00e1 transfer\u00eancias entre contas correntes de consumidores, um terreno diferente do que o Facebook Pay buscou inicialmente trilhar, envolvendo cart\u00f5es.  O WhatsApp j\u00e1 disse que est\u00e1 aberto a integrar seu servi\u00e7o ao Pix, o que pode ser uma maneira de ajudar a quebrar o impasse, mas mant\u00e9m seus planos de lan\u00e7ar os servi\u00e7os com Visa e Mastercard. Entretanto, o futuro permanece incerto.  Desde que o Facebook Pay foi suspenso, autoridades do BC se reuniram com executivos do WhatsApp, Mastercard e Visa na tentativa de encontrar um caminho. Visa e Mastercard entregaram novos planos de neg\u00f3cios ao \u00f3rg\u00e3o regulador na semana passada, em que o WhatsApp aparece formalmente como o iniciador dos pagamentos a serem processados pelas duas outras empresas. \"O WhatsApp n\u00e3o precisava, e ainda n\u00e3o precisa, solicitar uma licen\u00e7a para trabalhar com nossos parceiros\", afirmou o WhatsApp. \"Se uma mudan\u00e7a exigir que o WhatsApp obtenha uma licen\u00e7a, faremos isso.\" Copyright \u00a9 Thomson Reuters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNPT-42611476935</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNWBR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CB-F6P1-F07F-816H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398829</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1470\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>R7</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - Portuguese</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>16 Julho 2020 Quinta-feira</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>PORTUGUESE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>PORTUGU\u00caS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Brazil</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>South America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Issuance of Visas</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Mzg4RUQxNkU4QUZBNEJGNEE1NkFBMDk1QzEzMTE0QzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkM5NTNBQjk2MUM3NDBCQ0E1NEU3MDI4QkY4NEVBNzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Labor &amp; Employment Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTE3QUQwOTA0MUYzNDlCMEFFMjUwRUNDM0RDRkM5QzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Impasse Resolution</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkQ5MkZDQjIxNTMxNDdBM0FCNDE3QUYyNEU3MjdCREE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxRDVDOEI0NjU5NDk2QUI4QjYxMDNFREUzODcxMzk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC338</classCode><className>BRAZIL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GR122</classCode><className>SOUTH AMERICA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Now they want to make money off it.\" But many questions were left unanswered. Among them: How many apps are collecting this data, and what are they doing with it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"While <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>claimed that even he is not fully aware of everything that happens in the Facebook digital economy, the evidence suggests that health-care information may lead to the next major data-related crisis,\" Ostherr wrote.</p><p>\"In early April, MSNBC reported that Facebook recently launched a project based in its secretive 'Building 8' group to get hospitals to share anonymized patient data with them,\" she wrote. \"The project was reportedly put on hold in the wake of the current scandal, but the stated plan was to match hospitals' patient data on diagnoses and prescription information with Facebook so the company could combine that data with its own to construct digital profiles of patients.</p><p>\"<person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>admitted in his congressional testimony last week that Facebook does collect some medical data from users.

Membership in some patient groups numbers in the tens of thousands, with average daily posts of several hundred or more.\"</p><p>Ostherr said a sampling of the types of data that users post include \"tests, treatments, surgeries, sex drive, and relationships\" on a breast cancer support site. Other data include location and personal profile information such as age, race, sex, educational background, employment and even cellphone numbers. In addition, many posts include photos that can be subjected to facial recognition software.</p><p>\"It is not surprising that Facebook wants to move into the digital health market: So do Amazon.com, Google, Apple, Uber and all of the other big tech companies,\" she said. \"These businesses see an opportunity to profit from users' personal health data because, unlike narrowly defined medical data, health and wellness data are not considered protected health information and therefore are not protected by privacy laws.</p><p>\"These activities could simply be understood as advertising in the age of big data, a practice our society has so far agreed to accept,\" Ostherr said. \"But the unique risks from health- and medical-data mining and digital profiling of patients suggest greater stakes worthy of regulatory attention.\"</p><p>To read Ostherr's full op-ed, go here. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/04/18/facebook-knows-a-ton-about-your-health-now-they-want-to-make-money-off-it/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.8b062a8cbe03\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/posteverything/wp/2018/04/18/facebook-knows-a-ton-about-your-health-now-they-want-to-make-money-off-it/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.8b062a8cbe03</url></p><p>Ostherr, who is also the Gladys Louise Fox Professor of English at Rice, has a forthcoming book on health and big data, \"Quantified Health: Learning From Patient Stories in the Age of Big Data.\"</p><p>For more information or to schedule an interview with Ostherr, contact David Ruth, director of national media relations at Rice, at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:david@rice.edu\">david@rice.edu</email> or 713-348-6327.</p><p>Rice University has a VideoLink ReadyCam TV interview studio.

Booking.com Weighs In On the Need for Further EU Regulation[1] (\"Big tech firms push back against possible EU antitrust reforms,\" MLex, December 14, 2018) (subscription required) Along with other technology giants, Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Spotify, Booking.com submitted last week its response to an European Commission consultation seeking feedback on whether current EU competition rules needed updating to deal with the evolving digital economy. Not surprising, the technology platforms were unanimously opposed to any updates to existing competition rules, arguing that the digital sector remains highly competitive and subjective to disruption. Booking.com, however, in a break from the others, argued in favor of strengthening the Commissions' competition enforcement resources, in part, to avoid the patchwork of investigations and enforcement actions Booking.com has faced from individual EU member states. Seattle Law Firm Again Pursuing Expedia[2] (\"Expedia Faces Traveler Fee Lawsuit Alleging Tax Fraud and Racketeering, Skift Travel News, December 19, 2018) Seattle law firm Hagens Berman filed suit this past week seeking class action status and accusing Expedia and Expedia Affiliate Network (EAN) member, Reservations.com, of tax fraud and racketeering. For those of you unfamiliar with Hagens Berman, the well-known consumer class action firm was part of earlier class-action litigation that Expedia settled in 2009 that arose out of Expedia's practices with regard to the collection of fees and charges. In contrast to the prior claims, these newest claims arise out of Reservations.com's practices of charging 'tax recovery fees and charges' on Expedia's behalf. According to the complaint, these excessive fees and charges are then remitted by Reservations.com back to Expedia for payment to hotels of the applicable tax amount with the excess retain by Expedia. Expect more updates on this story as the litigation progresses. Other news: Travel agents want EU antitrust probe into Lufthansa surcharges[3] Reuters - Business News, December 19, 2018 Travel lobbying group ETTSA, whose members include Amadeus (AMA.MC) and booking.com, on Wednesday urged EU antitrust regulators to investigate Lufthansa's (LHAG.DE) surcharges and other allegedly discriminatory measures against travel agents. Report: OTAs are in rate parity with major chains[4] Hotel Management News, December 19, 2018 OTAs are more likely to be in parity with major chains than independents and local chains, according to a recently released report from OTA Insight. \"The North American Hotel Parity Report\" examines rate-parity trends for second-quarter 2018, and shows there are significant parity-loss issues marketwide, with independents and local chains facing losses: 46 percent of tracked shops in comparison to 33 percent for major chains. A significant majority of parity loss from OTAs was from rates displayed 0 percent to 15 percent lower than brand.com rates. Issues coming primarily from non-contracted OTAs being out of parity\u201424 percent in the case of major chains and 41 percent of independents and local chains\u2014suggest non-contracted OTAs are the biggest contributors to parity loss. World of Hyatt Loyalty Adds New Milestone Rewards to Attract Wider Audience[5] Skift Travel News, December 18, 2018 Chicago-based Hyatt Hotels relaunched its loyalty program as World of Hyatt in March of 2017, and since then the hotel chain has been making fine tweaks every few months. This week, the program announced a change to the way in which it delivers ancillary perks to its elite members. Called Milestone Rewards, the new schema takes some of the traditional perks that came when earning tiers of elite status and breaks out the rewards into smaller segments earned across a wider window of time. At the Explorist elite tier, for example, which is typically earned after completing 30 qualifying nights, World of Hyatt members used to earn four club lounge access awards for use at participating properties.

Enjoy.Dutch Authorities Scrutinize Keyword Restrictions (\"Booking.com and peers may face Dutch scrutiny of ad deals with hotel chains,\" MLex Insight, June 7, 2019) In a study issued last week, the Dutch Authority for Consumers and Markets examined hotel booking platforms' (Agoda, Booking.com, Expedia and others) practice of agreeing contractually with hoteliers not to post advertisements in response to searches featuring the hoteliers' keywords (i.e. keyword restrictions). According to the Authority, such restrictions are likely to lead to higher prices on websites, which ultimately harms consumers. Although the study did not identify plans for a formal investigation or recommend sanctions, those of you seeking keyword restrictions (or seeking amendments to existing restrictions) should expect to hear a lot about this. Safety Filters Not Enough[1] (\"TripAdvisor Pressured Into Making Additional Reforms to Support Sexual Assault Victims,\" SkiftTravel News, June 6, 2019) As a follow up to a story[2] we featured a few weeks ago, TripAdvisor announced this past week that it was taking even more steps to ensure that guests' experiences regarding sexual assault or other violence are properly treated. </p><p>Responding to protests that occurred just days after TripAdvisor's announcement that it was implementing filters on its site to allow users to search properties based on reports of sexual assault or violence, TripAdvisor has now committed, among other things, to improve response times to allegations of assault, provide sexual assault survivor training to its content and customer support teams and improve victims' ability to post reviews anonymously.Expedia Considers Following Booking.com's Move on Commissions[3] (\"Expedia Mulls Matching Booking on Resort Fee Commissions,\"Skift Travel News, June6, 2019) In a wide ranging interview with Skift this past week at the NYU Hospitality Conference, Expedia Group's President of Lodging Operations, Cyril Ranque, noted that Expedia hasn't ruled out matching Booking.com's controversial new stance on commissions. According to Ranque, Expedia is trying to collect as information as possible before making any decisions, but admits that Expedia isn't a fan of resort fees. My take on this . . . It is only a matter of time before Booking.com's approach to commissions is adopted by most of the large distributors, at least to the extent that existing (or future) contracts allow.Other news:Here Are Travel's Big Winners in an Antitrust Crackdown on Big Tech[4] Skift Travel News, June 4, 2019 Some are too scared to say so publicly, but much of the travel industry would welcome a diminution of Google's vast market power. If a U.S. regulatory probe gets going against Big Tech, it is a very open question how far-reaching a remedy might be in the offing. Suddenly there is a glimmer of hope that the travel industry can get some relief from nearly mandatory fees: paying for ads in Google search and in its hotel and flights shopping services to get visibility. That's because Google, Facebook, and Amazon could reportedly face tough antitrust enforcement from U.S. regulators, as well as an inquiry by the House of Representatives' Judiciary Committee.

It did not go well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hearing, held by a House Judiciary Committee panel, featured almost five hours of sharp criticism by lawmakers of shockingly anti-competitive practices allegedly deployed by Amazon and three other dominant technology companies  Alphabet, Facebook and Apple. Although Republicans at the hearing seemed more concerned about instances of alleged bias against conservatives, members from both parties hammered Bezos and his counterparts for seeming to use their positions as gatekeepers of crucial platforms to advance their own interests, harm competitors and abuse the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The panel has been gathering information for more than a year about the companies' possible violations of U.S. antitrust law. The hearing gave the four leaders the chance to rebut evidence the panel collected from internal company documents and testimony from their competitors and customers. They were not persuasive.</p><p> The four companies' products and services overlap, but each has a near-chokehold over one or more multibillion-dollar markets. Amazon is responsible for about 40% of e-commerce in the United States and holds a similar lead in the market for hosting internet-based services. Alphabet's Google handles more than 90% of the world's internet searches, and its YouTube user-generated video platform is the most popular in the U.S. Facebook is the world's largest social network and, along with Google, dominates online advertising. Apple doesn't corner the market on any products or services, but the only way to sell software and services to the roughly 1 billion iPhones and iPads in use worldwide is to pass through Apple's App Store.</p><p> The CEOs insisted that they face rigorous competition and are focused on delivering the best possible products and experiences for consumers. But lawmakers offered example after example of the companies appearing to use their market power to distort the competitive landscape, and the answers offered by the CEOs were singularly unsatisfying. Bezos, for instance, acknowledged that Amazon used data aggregated from other sellers on its platform to develop competing products. Alphabet's Sundar Pichai struggled to explain what his company's data policies were and whether it adjusted its search engine to favor its own products and harm competitors.</p><p>Apple's Tim Cook sought to defend the company's practice of demanding 30% of the revenue app developers collect from their sales as an enormous discount from the software distribution costs of yore, as opposed to a toll that it forced developers to pay. And Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg had to admit that yes, his company has a history of buying companies that it perceived as threats to its business.</p><p> Several Republicans on the panel honed in on complaints of anti-conservative bias, but bizarrely focused on Facebook's decision to remove a video that dangerously touted hydroxychloroquine as a \"cure\" for COVID-19 that negated the need for wearing a mask  after it had garnered 20 million views.</p><p> One potential hurdle for Big Tech's critics is that U.S. antitrust law is uniquely focused on preventing harm to consumers, not to competitors. And because many of the products and services that Big Tech companies offer are free to use, it isn't clear how consumers are harmed when the companies compete unfairly. That's an issue for Congress to explore.</p><p> In the meantime, though, the panel is assembling a powerful case for regulators to pursue. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department have launched investigations into multiple Big Tech companies, as have many state attorneys general. If Wednesday's hearing is any guide, the companies have much to answer for.</p><p> Los Angeles Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKOH-696b18929a43a0a1ee80648b69d28add36eb7fd0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28DA62CA23D187 NWBKOH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K1-BK01-DXVP-V08P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401973</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 GateHouse Media LLC<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

In many cases, their limited time on the phone is the only dependable lifeline to loved ones who may live too far away to visit on a regular basis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ability of incarcerated men and women to stay in touch with those who most support them - spouses, parents, children - is an important part of maintaining their humanity while paying their debt to society. Regular contact between inmates and friends or family can make a difference in their conduct inside the prison walls and get them ready for life on the outside.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's why the Federal Communications Commission's decision to curb the exorbitant rates that phone companies can charge for routine calls is in order. The new rate for local phone calls will be capped at $1.65 for a 15-minute call in-state. Before the FCC stepped in, inmates or those they called could expect to be charged as much as $14 a minute. By any standard, this was an outrageous financial burden for inmates and their families. It's also a price no regular consumer would stand for paying.</p><p>The companies that benefit most from the costly status quo, however, don't like the fact that the FCC is interceding. They characterize the federal agency's actions as an overreach and they vow to sue to reinstate the old arrangement, arguing that the cost of monitoring, taping and tracking prisoner phone calls necessitates the high costs.</p><p>But society's cost of isolating prisoners who can't afford to stay in touch with their chief means of support is even greater. In the United States, 2.7 million children have a parent in jail, each of whom will benefit from the FCC decision. While the parents are behind bars because they broke the law, onerous fees charged to moms and dads for calling their kids are criminal, too.</p><p>Los Angeles Times: Who's flying that drone?</p><p>Anyone who owns a car, motorcycle or plane must register it with authorities so they can be found and held accountable if they crash into someone or something. Soon the operators of drones, more formally known as unmanned aircraft systems, will have to do so too. This is very good news for public safety.</p><p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx announced plans this week to require the owners of recreational drones to register them with the government, just as the owners of commercial drones must do. And he wants to have the mandate in place by the end of the year. A task force made up of about two dozen people - federal officials, pilots and executives from drone industry trade associations and drone manufacturers among them - has until Nov. 20 to recommend a workable registration process. Good luck to them.</p><p>This ambitious timeline is a clear and welcome statement that federal officials recognize the growing threat posed by the proliferation of recreational drones operated by people who don't know the first thing about airspace. And it can't come soon enough. The market for consumer drones has been exploding. This year is expected to be the biggest yet for the nascent industry, with U.S. sales growing 63 percent above 2014. That means an additional 700,000 drones in the hands of people who may not know basic safety rules, such as the ban on flying above 400 feet or within five miles of an airport.</p><p>Scary close encounters have increased even more than sales, doubling since last year. Hundreds of close calls with drones have been reported by airplane pilots this year, including some fighting wildfires. Just last week, a Southwest Airlines pilot reported a drone way too close for comfort as he was landing at Los Angeles International Airport. So far, no major collisions have occurred. But we ought not tempt fate any longer by ignoring the potential danger.</p><p>The task force has a short time to grapple with some substantial issues, from where and how to register drones (online or at the point of sale?) to whether small, toy drones ought to be exempt. It also must ponder how registration will translate into accountability without technology that allows drones to be identified remotely. A license plate or tail number large enough for someone to read from 500 feet isn't practical for an object as small as the typical drone.</p><p>Whatever the task force recommends on registration, it should include a plan for educating drone buyers about safe flying. We believe that most drone operators wouldn't knowingly endanger airplane passengers or the crew of an air tanker. Giving out information as part of the mandatory registration process could go a long way toward ensuring that there's understanding as well as accountability.</p><p>Orange County Register: Government regulating away low-price vehicles</p><p>\"Would you be interested in a brand-new, fully warranted, five-door crossover SUV built by a major, name-brand automaker that gave you 50-plus MPG with a gas (not diesel or hybrid) engine, that has a top speed around 125 mph, is capable of getting to 60 in 12 seconds (about the same as a Prius hybrid) that stickered for less than $5,000?</p><p>So begins an intriguing post by Eric Peters, who writes about two important subjects - liberty and cars - in his EricPetersAutos.com blog. The vehicle in question is the Renault Kwid, which is roughly comparable to the Nissan Juke or Kia Soul.</p><p>But, like the Suzuki Alto 800 and the Hyundai Eon, which similarly have base models with a sticker price in the sub-$5,000 range, the Kwid is not available for sale in the United States.</p><p>The reason? Unnecessary safety and environmental standards.</p><p>The Kwid, for example, just has one airbag for the driver, not the dual front airbags mandated by the government (and, in practice, even more airbags are often needed to achieve high scores on increasingly stringent government crash tests). Nonetheless, it is still likely safer than, say, a SmartCar or others that do have the federal stamp of approval.</p><p>Consumers should be able to choose their own standards of safety. After all, we can still drive older cars that predate certain safety standards. And some people choose to ride motorcycles, which are far more dangerous than even the cars of yesteryear.</p><p>As for environmental regulations, emissions standards \"ceased being reasonable back in the '90s, Peters says. For years, exhaust emissions have been at least 97 percent \"clean, so additional requirements merely pursue the remaining 3 percent or less - often at great cost.</p><p>Autos like the Kwid, Eon and Alto \"show us what we could have - were it not for the effrontery [and cupidity] of the government [and the car cartels] who now work together to shear us like sheep, while telling us it's all for our own good, to keep us safe,' Peters contends.</p><p>As these value vehicles reveal, government mandates cost consumers thousands of dollars - not to mention the higher repair and insurance costs - for, at best, marginal improvements in safety and environmental quality. These regulations should be repealed so that consumers, not bureaucrats, can decide for themselves which features are worth the price.</p><p>Bloomberg View: Congress takes small step forward in fighting hackers</p><p>The cybersecurity bill passed by the Senate Wednesday was six years and innumerable legislative fights in the making. In the end, Sen. Harry Reid summed it up best: \"The bill, which is OK, is better than nothing.</p><p>That pleasingly tepid praise is on target for a bill that does a few good things, mostly avoids doing bad things and leaves all the hardest things for others to figure out.</p><p>The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, known as CISA, would give legal protection to companies that share information about cyberthreats with the government and with each other. This should help them detect intrusions faster, improve their defenses, and take advantage of government advice and intelligence. It should give law enforcement a clearer picture of the threats facing U.S. networks and help in pursuing cybercriminals. And it sends a message - to crooks, spies and bored teenagers everywhere - that the U.S. is starting to take these matters more seriously.</p><p>Although the bill had the support of the White House, much of the business community and a substantial majority in Congress, it won't please everyone. Many privacy activists opposed it. So did some big tech companies (many of the same ones that make their money by siphoning your private information and selling it). And some security experts have warned, reasonably, that the bill's benefits are oversold.</p><p>The sharing of information does raise privacy concerns, but the bill takes sensible precautions. It tells companies to strip out personal data that isn't related to a threat before sharing it, places prudent restrictions on how the government can use the information it receives, and makes clear that the whole thing is voluntary and expires after 10 years. It also designates the Department of Homeland Security - a civilian agency with significant privacy oversight - as the primary coordinator of the new system.</p><p>A bigger worry is that the bill allows the submitted data to be shared with other agencies, including the National Security Administration. Congress should be alert to potential misuse (a House version of the bill is better in this regard), and consider adding stronger language in the final legislation. But on balance, the protections included are sturdy. More to the point, the average privacy-conscious Internet user has far more to fear from hackers than from government spooks (ask the benighted subscribers to Ashley Madison).</p><p>Even so, CISA won't stop intrusions, thievery, espionage or general nuisance-making online. Doing so will require reforming outdated hacking laws and bolstering standards to improve data security. It will mean training more cybersecurity professionals and broadly educating the public. It will require that companies invest in smarter technology, more competent staff and better risk-management models.</p><p>And it will demand that the government's ever-growing cybersecurity bureaucracy get smarter and nimbler.</p><p>In other words, all the biggest challenges will have to wait. But after years of intensifying attacks - against retailers, banks, insurers, government agencies and just about everyone else - Congress is finally taking a small step toward bolstering the country's defenses. It's better than nothing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHRGAZ-2015305550</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHRGAZ2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H90-XT91-JCB7-12TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146813</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1729\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Charleston Newspapers</copyright><publicationName>Charleston Gazette-Mail</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>November 1, 2015, Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009SVI</classCode><className>LOS ANGELES TIMES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

Although Republicans at the hearing seemed more concerned about instances of alleged bias against conservatives, members from both parties hammered Bezos and his counterparts for seeming to use their positions as gatekeepers of crucial platforms to advance their own interests, harm competitors and abuse the public.</p><p>The panel has been gathering information for more than a year about the companies' possible violations of U.S. antitrust law. The hearing gave the four leaders the chance to rebut evidence the panel collected from internal company documents and testimony from their competitors and customers. They were not persuasive.</p><p> The four companies' products and services overlap, but each has a near-chokehold over one or more multibillion-dollar markets. Amazon is responsible for about 40% of e-commerce in the United States and holds a similar lead in the market for hosting internet-based services. Alphabet's Google handles more then 90% of the world's internet searches, and its YouTube user-generated video platform is the most popular in the United States. Facebook is the world's largest social network and, along with Google, dominates online advertising. Apple doesn't corner the market on any products or services, but the only way to sell software and services to the roughly 1 billion iPhones and iPads in use worldwide is to pass through Apple's App Store.</p><p> The CEOs insisted that they face rigorous competition and are focused on delivering the best possible products and experiences for consumers. But lawmakers offered example after example of the companies appearing to use their market power to distort the competitive landscape, and the answers offered by the CEOs were singularly unsatisfying. Bezos, for instance, acknowledged that Amazon used data aggregated from other sellers on its platform to develop competing products. Alphabet's Sundar Pichai struggled to explain what his company's data policies were and whether it adjusted its search engine to favor its own products and harm competitors.</p><p>Apple's Tim Cook sought to defend the company's practice of demanding 30% of the revenue app developers collect from their sales as an enormous discount from the software distribution costs of yore, as opposed to a toll that it forced developers to pay. And Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg had to admit that yes, his company has a history of buying up companies that it perceived as threats to its business.</p><p> One potential hurdle for Big Tech's critics is that U.S. antitrust law is uniquely focused on preventing harm to consumers, not to competitors. And because many of the products and services that Big Tech companies offer are free to use, it isn't automatically clear how consumers are harmed when the companies compete unfairly. That's an issue for Congress to explore.</p><p> In the meantime, though, the panel is assembling a powerful case for regulators to pursue. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department have launched investigations into multiple Big Tech companies, as have many state attorneys general.

Avoiding a bloodbath should be a priority.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The House Judiciary Committee is gearing up to investigate unfair business practices by platform companies, while the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have divvied up Silicon Valleys big four  Amazon.com and Facebook, Apple and Google  as they probe potential antitrust violations.</p><p>The tech business has had its share of mishaps and misdeeds over the years, and the concentration of power in certain digital markets is a cause for concern. But the breadth of these looming probes is worrying. As the government bears down, three things are worth keeping in mind.</p><p>One is that each of these businesses should be evaluated on its own terms, not as part of a generalized crackdown. Its true that all four companies are big, profitable and connected to the internet. Beyond that, though, their similarities arent obvious. Google and Facebook are ad-sales companies. Amazon is a retailer. Apple makes nice phones. These are very different industries, with different competitive dynamics. They may each require distinctive reforms, or no reforms at all.</p><p>Second, the goal should be identifying specific instances of wrongdoing and devising prudent remedies. Take data. All four companies have loads of it, and in some cases may use it to gain unfair advantages. Facebook has created tools to monitor what other products its users are interested in, for example, and has acted on that information to buy out budding rivals or mimic their ideas. Likewise, Amazons birds-eye view into what people are buying on its marketplace may confer an undue advantage on its competing private-label goods. In both cases, regulators should intervene to stop objectionable behavior  not to put anyone out of business.</p><p>Finally, its important to remember that, for all their faults, these companies shouldnt be vilified. Theyre pillars of the American economy. They collectively employ almost 900,000 people. Theyve made it easier than ever to start a business. Theyve invented entirely new categories of products and services  and often charge users nothing for them. No one could argue that consumers have been harmed by Googles free apps or Amazons aggressive cost-cutting. Quite the opposite: They now have a bounty at their fingertips that previous generations could never have dreamed of.</p><p>Its true that tech companies have generally done themselves no favors in the court of public opinion. Theyve often been heedless about the harms their products can cause, opaque about their data practices, and dismissive of their overseers. When it comes to paying taxes, Congress has no doubt noticed that they employ savvy accountants.</p><p>On balance, though, the good vastly outweighs the bad. Markets can always be improved, of course. But as Congress tries to write a new rulebook, and regulators begin to roll up their sleeves, one question above all needs to be asked: What problems are they trying to solve?</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2019/06/27/other-voices-dont-give-hackers-what-they-want/\">        Other voices: Dont give hackers what they want     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2019/06/23/other-voices-in-praise-of-ingenuity-americas-record-economic-expansion/\">        Other voices: In praise of ingenuity: Americas record economic expansion     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2019/06/16/other-voices-democratic-candidates-go-big-on-spending/\">        Other voices: Democratic candidates go big on spending     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2019/06/13/other-voices-how-to-prevent-another-russian-attack/\">        Other voices: How to prevent another Russian attack     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2019/06/09/other-voices-keep-the-value-of-free-trade-in-clear-sight/\">        Other voices: Keep the value of free trade in clear sight     </url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STPLPP-3368690</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STPAULPMNG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8Y-98N1-F0C5-X2TS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313961</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"562\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 St. Paul Pioneer Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 7, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

What shocked many scientists and others was how He Jiankui used new technology for gene editing without serious oversight or transparency, amid grave questions about the medical rationale and potential future damage. One good thing came out of this: He spurred a more deliberate, international effort to answer the hard questions. Now that effort must lead to stricter regulation.</p><p>The world is at an inflection point not unlike that which gave rise to the Asimolar Conference on Recombinant DNA in February 1975. That conference considered biohazards and published guidelines on what was then an emerging biotechnology field; these guidelines helped steer significant research for decades. Something of similar scope and power is needed for germline editing of genes in human embryos, sperm and eggs that can create changes to be passed through future generations. The technology of the method CRISPR-Cas9, in which genetic material can be edited quickly and cheaply, was used by He to manipulate an embryo to edit a gene. Ultimately, the amazing CRISPR technology may help conquer certain diseases and alleviate suffering, but it could be used recklessly and immorally.</p><p>A commentary in the journal Nature has called for a global, temporary moratorium on clinical uses of human germline editing, defined as changing heritable DNA (in sperm, eggs or embryos) to make genetically modified children. The moratorium could be hard to enforce, but it would offer a breather to sort out scientific and ethical issues. Among the authors of the essay is Nobel laureate Paul Berg, an emeritus professor of biochemistry at Stanford University, who helped organize Asimolar. The authors suggest that a goal might be some kind of international research framework. Genome editing ultimately can affect all humankind, but any regulation must be sensitive to individual nations and societies  not an easy task.</p><p>The Nature authors would permit research that does not involve the transfer of an embryo to a persons uterus, and would permit genome editing in nonreproductive cells to treat diseases where the modifications are not heritable. But on the key issue of clinical use of germline editing around the world, they are worried.</p><p>Fortunately, the right organizations are now in motion. The U.S. National Academies and the British Royal Society have launched an international commission. The World Health Organization has created an advisory committee, too. We hope these efforts will find a consensus that can be accepted and enforced by the widest circle possible. The goal must be a framework that will enable genuine scientific advancement but avoid reckless fiddling with the source code of life.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2019/06/16/other-voices-democratic-candidates-go-big-on-spending/\">        Other voices: Democratic candidates go big on spending     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2019/06/13/other-voices-how-to-prevent-another-russian-attack/\">        Other voices: How to prevent another Russian attack     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2019/06/09/other-voices-keep-the-value-of-free-trade-in-clear-sight/\">        Other voices: Keep the value of free trade in clear sight     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2019/06/07/other-voices-dont-declare-war-on-big-tech/\">        Other voices: Dont declare war on big tech     </url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2019/06/02/other-voices-reminder-for-2020-the-russians-did-attack-u-s-democracy/\">        Other voices: Reminder for 2020: The Russians did attack U.S. democracy     </url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STPLPP-3360222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STPAULPMNG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5R-R7S1-JCX4-63VK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313961</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"533\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 St. Paul Pioneer Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 23, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Editorials</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>National Columnists</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Family Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI4M0U5Qzg3RTk0NDdBRUJGNDRGNkZEQkU3RDdFNDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>Disposition of Eggs, Preembryos &amp;

This is the \"big lie\" approach to policy, as you'll discover when your Netflixmovies go into endless buffer mode.</p><p> The big internet service providers \u2014 AT&amp;T, Verizon, Comcast, Charter, etc. \u2014 see a business opportunity here. If they can charge a customer more for receiving a priority transmission slot, then that's just the free market at work. After all, the ISPs argue, they've invested in the routers, cables and connections that make the system work, why shouldn't they be able to charge what the market will bear?</p><p> That means everyone else's content will be delivered just a little bit slower, but that's just freedom at work \u2014 enabled, of course, by Pai's new regulations. So if Comcast, which has a 30 percent ownership stake in the Hulu streaming TV service, gives Hulu priority over competitors like Netflix, well then, too bad for Netflixand its customers.</p><p> Pai dismisses concerns like that as \"hypothetical harms and hysterical prophecies of doom.\" But an immutable fact of nature is that monopolies will act like monopolies.</p><p> Big tech companies like Google and Amazonare opposed to any change. Small wonder: They were able to prosper precisely because the internet was an open market. Future innovators won't find things quite so easy.</p><p> The Supreme Court or Congress will eventually have to settle this dispute. Already a U.S. Appeals Court has upheld the Obama-era rules that said the FCC can regulate the internet as a public utility. Pai argues that the ISPs that enable the internet are competing businesses that should be regulated by the Federal Trade Commission. Net neutrality will be enforced \"voluntarily,\" he said.</p><p> Sure it will.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKIA-ed987893a2bba8a944a785a361c11d51b499187</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2899E8A17A7722 NWBKIA2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R2D-T6R1-JBCN-423T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401919</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"472\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Sioux City Journal, Sioux City, IA<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Adrian Wooldridge considered it inevitable that executives at Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoftwould be seen by the public in the same malign fashion as bankers and oil barons - symbols of a greedy nerd version of avaricious capitalism.</p><p>Wooldridge was right about the backlash - but he probably didn't count on how broad an indictment critics of the tech giants would bring. It was predictable that big tech companies would stand accused of operating in monopolistic ways and of stealthily monetizing information about individuals acquired from their online activities.</p><p> But it's not just these practices that have poked holes in Silicon Valley's bubble of public regard and admiration. It's also how the tech giants have behaved in other ways.</p><p> With the release of its iPhone X, Apple joined Facebookand Googleas companies pursuing facial recognition technologies that portend an end to old concepts of privacy. Despite their insistence otherwise, those firms and Microsoft have been called de facto silent partners to U.S. intelligence agencies' attempts to vacuum up information from people around the world without their consent. And despite all the benefits they bring, Facebookand Googleare villains to both sides of the culture wars.</p><p> They're accused of enforcing left-wing speech codes on acceptable commentary and enabling the far right to spread election-skewing \"fake news\" and bigotry. ProPublica provided a new example last Thursday when it showed Facebookprovided tools for advertisers to reach anti-Semitic hate groups.</p><p> Now the backlash may be moving beyond rhetoric. In June, European Union regulators slammed Googlewith a record $2.7 billion fine for seeking to profit by manipulating online search requests.</p><p> In the U.S., the traditional American fear of giant corporations has begun to manifest itself. The same impulse that led to the breakup of Standard Oil in 1911 and AT&amp;T in 1982 is flaring as awareness grows of Google's and Facebook's hegemony in advertising and the realization sets in that Amazon may destroy more American jobs than China.</p><p>Google's troubles continued with an Aug. 30 report in The New York Times that Eric Schmidt of Google's parent company Alphabet had pressured the New America Foundation think tank - which Googlehas supported financially - to push out scholar Barry Lynn and his Open Markets research team. Lynn's sin? Publicly applauding the EU's fine against Google. Such bullying will haunt Google- at least if the anti-monopoly backlash plays out according to the traditional American script.</p><p> But that's a huge if. Standard Oil and AT&amp;T had monopolistic control of gasoline supplies and telephone service, respectively - major bills most American households pay. Google's and Facebook's chief services are addictive - and free.</p><p> Still, as everyday life makes clear, Americans are stirred up. The Trump and Sanders wings of the two largest political parties want and expect dramatic change. If they get their way, the most powerful forces in this country are likely to feel the fallout. And that is a category that very much includes Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft.</p><p> - The San Diego Union-Tribune</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMO-7131011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28995BA0E30AF6 NWBKMO2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHM-0X51-DXVP-V12X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401953</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"549\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Examiner<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

In der Zukunft ist mit weiteren massiven Belastungen <br/>aufgrund des anhaltenden Niedrigzinsumfelds sowie der unvermindert <br/>steigenden Regulationskosten zu rechnen. Auff\u00e4llig positiv <br/>behaupteten sich Institute, die Digitalisierung und zentrale <br/>Erfolgsfaktoren der Big Techs fr\u00fchzeitig adaptiert haben.</p><p>Der europ\u00e4ische Bankensektor k\u00e4mpfte auch im Gesch\u00e4ftsjahr 2018 <br/>mit strukturellen Ertragsproblemen. Zwar konnten Europas 50 <br/>Topinstitute ihre Eigenkapitalrenditen nach Steuern in Summe leicht <br/>von 6,6 % (2017) auf 7,2 % (2018) steigern. Dennoch verharrt die <br/>Rentabilit\u00e4t der Geldh\u00e4user insgesamt auf einem tiefen Niveau und <br/>liegt auch mehr als zehn Jahre nach der Finanzkrise immer noch unter <br/>den Anforderungen des Kapitalmarkts. Den meisten gro\u00dfen europ\u00e4ischen <br/>Instituten gelang es weder, nachhaltige operative Ertragssteigerungen<br/>zu realisieren, noch ihre Kostenbasis im erforderlichen Umfang zu <br/>entlasten. Zudem zeigt ein Blick nach vorn, dass sich die <br/>Wettbewerbssituation f\u00fcr europ\u00e4ische Banken weiter versch\u00e4rfen wird, <br/>was sich im Markteintritt neuer Anbieter aus dem Fin- und <br/>Big-Tech-Segment sowie in der zunehmenden Akzeptanz f\u00fcr neue, nicht <br/>bankspezifische Produkte und Services manifestieren wird. So erstaunt<br/>denn auch nicht, dass sich gerade diejenigen Banken in Europa <br/>besonders gut entwickelt haben, die ihre Gesch\u00e4ftsmodelle fr\u00fchzeitig <br/>digitalisiert haben. Ihre Profitabilit\u00e4t lag im Jahr 2018 mit 9,2 % <br/>nach Steuern nicht nur deutlich \u00fcber dem Durchschnitt der gr\u00f6\u00dften <br/>Kreditinstitute Europas, sondern auch \u00fcber den Anforderungen des <br/>Kapitalmarkts - sie sind deshalb digitale Vorreiter und Wegweiser f\u00fcr<br/>die gesamte Branche, wie die aktuelle European Banking Study 2019 <br/>(EBS) von zeb zeigt. </p><p>Die Strategie- und Managementberatung, spezialisiert auf die <br/>europ\u00e4ische Financial-Services-Industrie, hat f\u00fcr die neueste Auflage<br/>ihrer renommierten Studie erneut die 50 gr\u00f6\u00dften Banken in Europa <br/>analysiert, den Status quo der Institute anhand verschiedener <br/>Parameter untersucht und Szenarien f\u00fcr die Zukunft der Geldh\u00e4user <br/>errechnet. Die Studie wurde in dieser Form zum sechsten Mal erstellt.<br/>Sie st\u00fctzt sich auf eine Reihe, die seit 1998 fortgeschrieben wird. <br/>Dr. Dirk Holl\u00e4nder, Mitautor der EBS 2019 und Senior Partner bei zeb,<br/>erl\u00e4utert: \"Europ\u00e4ische Banken haben ihre Kapitalisierung und <br/>Liquidit\u00e4t in den letzten Jahren signifikant verbessert. Kernproblem <br/>bleibt aber nach wie vor die viel zu geringe Rentabilit\u00e4t. Reine <br/>Kostensenkungen sind daf\u00fcr nicht die L\u00f6sung, vielmehr muss es auch <br/>gelingen, die Ertragssituation fundamental zu verbessern. Nur auf <br/>einen Fortbestand der aktuell sehr g\u00fcnstigen \u00f6konomischen <br/>Rahmenbedingungen oder steigende Zinsen zu hoffen, k\u00f6nnte sich als <br/>Wunschdenken herausstellen.\" </p><p>Digitalisierung als wirksamer Hebel </p><p>Die detaillierte Analyse der derzeitigen Ergebnisse europ\u00e4ischer <br/>Banken zeigt klare Defizite auf. Dar\u00fcber hinaus wird in der aktuellen<br/>European Banking Study auch ein Blick in die Zukunft geworfen. <br/>Verschiedene Konjunkturszenarien ber\u00fccksichtigen dabei nicht nur die <br/>zuk\u00fcnftige Regulatorik, sondern auch die weltweite wirtschaftliche <br/>Ungewissheit und deren Implikationen f\u00fcr Banken. Im <br/>wahrscheinlichsten Szenario werden die Banken 2023 schlechter <br/>kapitalisiert und weniger profitabel sein als heute, sofern kein <br/>deutlicher Umbau des Gesch\u00e4ftsmodells gelingt. Damit verst\u00e4rkt sich <br/>das Kernproblem weiter. Denn ohne deutliche Ertragssteigerungen bei <br/>gleichzeitigen Kostensenkungen werden sie ihre Gewinnl\u00fccke nicht <br/>schlie\u00dfen k\u00f6nnen. </p><p>Aus diesem Grund befasst sich die aktuelle European Banking Study <br/>umfassend mit dem Themenkomplex Digitalisierung und deren Beitrag zu <br/>profitablen Gesch\u00e4ftsmodellen. Dabei stellten die Studienautoren <br/>fest, dass Banken, die sich bereits fr\u00fch und sehr aktiv mit dem Thema<br/>Digitalisierung auseinandergesetzt haben (Pioneers), in der Regel <br/>eine deutlich h\u00f6here finanzielle Performance in allen relevanten <br/>Bankkennzahlen vorweisen. Zudem lag ihre Kapitalmarktperformance <br/>deutlich \u00fcber dem Durchschnitt der 50 untersuchten europ\u00e4ischen <br/>Banken. Unter diesen digitalen Vorreitern finden sich zumeist stark <br/>privatkundenfokussierte Banken und weniger komplexe Universalbanken. <br/>Sie haben das Thema Digitalisierung fr\u00fchzeitig in den strategischen <br/>Fokus gestellt, entsprechende Ma\u00dfnahmen konsequent umgesetzt und dazu<br/>nach innen wie au\u00dfen gut wahrnehmbar und selbstbewusst kommuniziert. <br/>Dr. Florian Forst, Mitautor der EBS und Partner bei zeb, f\u00fchrt <br/>abschlie\u00dfend aus: \"Unsere Studie zeigt, dass Banken, die fr\u00fch und <br/>konsequent ihre Gesch\u00e4ftsmodelle und Prozesse digitalisiert haben, in<br/>allen relevanten Kennzahlen heute deutlich besser abschneiden als <br/>ihre Wettbewerber. Diese digitalen Vorreiter haben wesentliche <br/>Erfolgsfaktoren der Big Techs adaptiert und beschreiten damit einen <br/>Weg, der zeigt, wie Europas Banken trotz eines harten Wettbewerbs <br/>auch in Zukunft erfolgreich am Markt agieren k\u00f6nnen.\"</p><p>Informationen zur European Banking Study 2019 sind hier abrufbar: <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.zeb.eu/europeanbankingstudy\">https://www.zeb.eu/europeanbankingstudy</url></p><p>zeb wurde 1992 gegr\u00fcndet und z\u00e4hlt zu den f\u00fchrenden Strategie- und<br/>Managementberatungen f\u00fcr Financial Services in Europa.

Much like the \"digital charter\" her government <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/article-ottawa-launches-new-digital-charter-to-protect-canadians-personal/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/technology/article-ottawa-launches-new-digital-charter-to-protect-canadians-personal/</url> to protect Canadians' privacy and give them better control over data collection, it stops short of immediate legislative action - instead acting as a \"call to action\" that Ottawa hopes information-spreading tech companies will follow.</p><p>Ms. Gould <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-federal-plan-to-protect-elections-does-not-include-controls-on-social/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-federal-plan-to-protect-elections-does-not-include-controls-on-social/</url> that the Liberals would set up safeguards to prevent interference in the election, including creating a team of senior bureaucrats to inform the public if security agencies discover serious threats. Those safeguards did not include any regulations for social-media companies that could be used to spread disinformation, prompting criticism from opposition MPs.</p><p>Ms. Gould outlined a number of expectations Monday. Platforms will be expected to use any available tools to combat the spread of misinformation, including the misrepresentation of political candidates, while being transparent about when and why users see political advertising. Platforms will also be expected to remove fake accounts and inauthentic contents and help users better understand information sources. The government, meanwhile, has promised to set up dedicated points-of-contact for election-related issues, and work together with tech companies to improve digital literacy.</p><p>\"We've seen that the tools that were once used to strengthen civic engagement are being used to undermine, disrupt and destabilize democracy,\" Ms. Gould told Parliament. \"  To ensure the integrity of online content, we expect platforms to intensify efforts to combat disinformation.\"</p><p>Facebook, Microsoft and Google have agreed to support the declaration in conjunction with the federal government. A spokesperson for Twitter said the company would need to review details before commenting.</p><p>NDP MP Daniel Blaikie told the House that he was disappointed by Ms. Gould's declaration. \"She essentially signalled she's going to take the approach of begging these large social-media platforms to do the right thing, instead of requiring them to do the right thing   [and] putting a framework in place with some actual teeth,\" he said in a subsequent interview.</p><p>Kevin Chan, Facebook's Canadian head of public policy, said in a phone interview that a number of election-related initiatives will begin rolling out in June. Much like it has done <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/news/the-authorization-process-for-us-advertisers-to-run-political-ads-on-facebook-is-now-open\">https://www.facebook.com/business/news/the-authorization-process-for-us-advertisers-to-run-political-ads-on-facebook-is-now-open</url> for instance, Facebook will require multistep authentication and verification for potential political-ad buyers, and include a step in the process involving in-person authentication.</p><p>Mr. Chan also said that Facebook would make political ads available in a \"library\" that would include information such as who paid for ads, the spending range for each ad and the demographics they were set to target, including gender and geography. Facebook has also set up a Canadian advisory board to advise the company on election-related issues, with members including World Wildlife Fund head and former NDP MP Megan Leslie as well as former Stephen Harper chief of staff Ray Novak.</p><p>\"We want to work in partnership with the government of Canada to find bad actors and ensure there is no foreign interference,\" Mr. Chan said.</p><p>Google <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-google-to-ban-political-ads-ahead-of-federal-election-citing-new/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-google-to-ban-political-ads-ahead-of-federal-election-citing-new/</url> it would ban political advertising related to the federal election as part of its new transparency rules, and has made       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-fake-news-is-bad-for-canadians-and-google-alike-and-heres-how-well/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-fake-news-is-bad-for-canadians-and-google-alike-and-heres-how-well/</url> to ensure its platforms are not abused. In an e-mailed statement, Colin McKay, Google Canada's head of public policy, said that the company \"is committed to providing Canadians with information and services to help them participate in the federal election and we will continue to work with the government to deliver on these principles wherever they apply to Google's products.\"</p><p>In a tweet confirming his company's commitment to the declaration, Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote that \"We all must do our part to protect our electoral systems &amp; democratic institutions.\"</p><p>The latest in the federal Liberals' election social-media plan kicks off a week in which Canada's relationship with Big Tech is in the global spotlight.

The policy paper is just that - suggestions that are meant to inform future laws and regulations.</p><p>It doesn't commit Ottawa to immediate action, meaning it will be up to the next parliament to take up the cause.</p><p>\"(The Liberals) have ignored numerous opportunities to bring these reasonable steps forward. So is it going to happen? Not in the life of this parliament,\" said NDP MP Charlie Angus in an interview Tuesday, calling it a strong policy paper \"for 2015.\"</p><p>\"I think that's highly problematic ... The words are great, but action needs to be there and I haven't seen that yet.\"</p><p>Angus noted that Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien has been forced to take Facebook to court to try and enforce Canadian privacy laws.</p><p>Therrien, along with the privacy commissioner of British Columbia, released a long-awaited report into Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal last month. The report found that Facebook failed to obtain \"meaningful consent\" from the users who had their personal information unknowingly collected, had insufficient safeguards to protect user privacy, and failed to be accountable for information under its control.</p><p>The commissioners also said Facebook has \"outright rejected\" recommendations to comply with Canadian law to the watchdogs' satisfaction - a situation the Federal Court will now be expected to weigh in on.</p><p>\"In our view, therefore, the risk is high that Canadians' personal information will be disclosed to apps and used in ways the users may not know of or expect,\" their report warned.</p><p>The policy paper was released as part of the Liberals' push for a new \"digital charter\" to detail their expectations for how internet and tech giants collect, use and disclose Canadians' personal data.</p><p>The 10-point charter suggests Canadians should have control over \"what data they're sharing, who is using their personal data and for what purposes.\" It also promised \"strong enforcement and real accountability\" for tech and internet giants who violate Canadian law.</p><p>Currently, the maximum a company can be fined for breaking private sector privacy laws is $100,000 per offence. Business Insider calculated that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos made $160,000 per minute at his net worth's peak September 2018.</p><p>The policy paper recommends \"substantially\" increasing the range of fines the privacy commissioner can levy against a company, and be able to consider mitigating or aggravating factors to factor into the total dollar amount.</p><p>Therrien was not consulted on the government's new policy paper, according to spokesperson Tobi Cohen. But Cohen said the office welcomes the government's acknowledgement that reform is needed, as it \"has been clear for many years that PIPEDA requires extensive reform.\"</p><p>\"The commissioner called for the law to be updated to recognize that privacy is a fundamental right and a necessary precondition for the exercise of other fundamental rights, including freedom, equality and democracy,\" Cohen wrote in a statement.</p><p>\"As we saw in the Facebook-Cambridge (Analytica) scandal, a lack of respect for privacy rights can lead to very real harms, such as attempts ot influence voters in an election.\"</p><p>Dan Albas, the Conservative chair of the Commons committee in privacy and ethics, called the Liberals' Charter \"all flash and no substance.\"</p><p>\"With only five months before the federal election, it's nothing more than an election ploy to distract from the Liberals' dismal record on data and privacy issues,\" Albas wrote in a statement.</p><p>Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

So is it going to happen? Not in the life of this parliament,\" said NDP MP Charlie Angus in an interview Tuesday, calling it a strong policy paper \"for 2015.\"</p><p>\"I think that's highly problematic ... The words are great, but action needs to be there and I haven't seen that yet.\"</p><p>Angus noted that Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien has been forced to take Facebook to court to try and enforce Canadian privacy laws.</p><p>Therrien, along with the privacy commissioner of British Columbia, released a long-awaited report into Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal last month. The report found that Facebook failed to obtain \"meaningful consent\" from the users who had their personal information unknowingly collected, had insufficient safeguards to protect user privacy, and failed to be accountable for information under its control.</p><p>The commissioners also said Facebook has \"outright rejected\" recommendations to comply with Canadian law to the watchdogs' satisfaction - a situation the Federal Court will now be expected to weigh in on.</p><p>\"In our view, therefore, the risk is high that Canadians' personal information will be disclosed to apps and used in ways the users may not know of or expect,\" their report warned.</p><p>The policy paper was released as part of the Liberals' push for a new \"digital charter\" to detail their expectations for how internet and tech giants collect, use and disclose Canadians' personal data.</p><p>The 10-point charter suggests Canadians should have control over \"what data they're sharing, who is using their personal data and for what purposes.\" It also promised \"strong enforcement and real accountability\" for tech and internet giants who violate Canadian law.</p><p>Currently, the maximum a company can be fined for breaking private sector privacy laws is $100,000 per offence. Business Insider calculated that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos made $160,000 per minute at his net worth's peak September 2018.</p><p>The policy paper recommends \"substantially\" increasing the range of fines the privacy commissioner can levy against a company, and be able to consider mitigating or aggravating factors to factor into the total dollar amount.</p><p>Therrien was not consulted on the government's new policy paper, according to spokesperson Tobi Cohen. But Cohen said the office welcomes the government's acknowledgement that reform is needed, as it \"has been clear for many years that PIPEDA requires extensive reform.\"</p><p>\"The commissioner called for the law to be updated to recognize that privacy is a fundamental right and a necessary precondition for the exercise of other fundamental rights, including freedom, equality and democracy,\" Cohen wrote in a statement.</p><p>\"As we saw in the Facebook-Cambridge (Analytica) scandal, a lack of respect for privacy rights can lead to very real harms, such as attempts ot influence voters in an election.\"</p><p>Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

Not in the life of this parliament,\" said NDP MP Charlie Angus in an interview Tuesday, calling it a strong policy paper \"for 2015.\"</p><p>\"I think that's highly problematic ... The words are great, but action needs to be there and I haven't seen that yet.\"</p><p>Angus noted that Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien has been forced to take Facebook to court to try and enforce Canadian privacy laws.</p><p>Therrien, along with the privacy commissioner of British Columbia, released a long-awaited report into Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal last month. The report found that Facebook failed to obtain \"meaningful consent\" from the users who had their personal information unknowingly collected, had insufficient safeguards to protect user privacy, and failed to be accountable for information under its control.</p><p>The commissioners also said Facebook has \"outright rejected\" recommendations to comply with Canadian law to the watchdogs' satisfaction - a situation the Federal Court will now be expected to weigh in on.</p><p>\"In our view, therefore, the risk is high that Canadians' personal information will be disclosed to apps and used in ways the users may not know of or expect,\" their report warned.</p><p>The policy paper was released as part of the Liberals' push for a new \"digital charter\" to detail their expectations for how internet and tech giants collect, use and disclose Canadians' personal data.</p><p>The 10-point charter suggests Canadians should have control over \"what data they're sharing, who is using their personal data and for what purposes.\" It also promised \"strong enforcement and real accountability\" for tech and internet giants who violate Canadian law.</p><p>Currently, the maximum a company can be fined for breaking private sector privacy laws is $100,000 per offence. Business Insider calculated that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos made $160,000 per minute at his net worth's peak September 2018.</p><p>The policy paper recommends \"substantially\" increasing the range of fines the privacy commissioner can levy against a company, and be able to consider mitigating or aggravating factors to factor into the total dollar amount.</p><p>Therrien was not consulted on the government's new policy paper, according to spokesperson Tobi Cohen. But Cohen said the office welcomes the government's acknowledgement that reform is needed, as it \"has been clear for many years that PIPEDA requires extensive reform.\"</p><p>\"The commissioner called for the law to be updated to recognize that privacy is a fundamental right and a necessary precondition for the exercise of other fundamental rights, including freedom, equality and democracy,\" Cohen wrote in a statement.</p><p>\"As we saw in the Facebook-Cambridge (Analytica) scandal, a lack of respect for privacy rights can lead to very real harms, such as attempts ot influence voters in an election.\"</p><p>Dan Albas, the Conservative chair of the Commons committee in privacy and ethics, called the Liberals' Charter \"all flash and no substance.\"</p><p>\"With only five months before the federal election, it's nothing more than an election ploy to distract from the Liberals' dismal record on data and privacy issues,\" Albas wrote in a statement.</p><p>Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

Much like the \"digital charter\" her government announced earlier this month to protect Canadians' privacy and give them better control over data collection, it stops short of immediate legislative action - instead acting as a \"call to action\" that Ottawa hopes information-spreading tech companies will follow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ms. Gould said in January that the Liberals would set up safeguards to prevent interference in the election, including creating a team of senior bureaucrats to inform the public if security agencies discover serious threats. Those safeguards did not include any regulations for social-media companies that could be used to spread disinformation, prompting criticism from opposition MPs.</p><p>Ms. Gould outlined a number of expectations Monday.</p><p>Platforms will be expected to use any available tools to combat the spread of misinformation, including the misrepresentation of political candidates, while being transparent about when and why users see political advertising. Platforms will also be expected to remove fake accounts and inauthentic contents and help users better understand information sources. The government, meanwhile, has promised to set up dedicated points-of-contact for election-related issues, and work together with tech companies to improve digital literacy.</p><p>\"We've seen that the tools that were once used to strengthen civic engagement are being used to undermine, disrupt and destabilize democracy,\" Ms. Gould told Parliament. \"... To ensure the integrity of online content, we expect platforms to intensify efforts to combat disinformation.\"</p><p>Facebook, Microsoft and Google have agreed to support the declaration in conjunction with the federal government.</p><p>A spokesperson for Twitter said the company would need to review details before commenting.</p><p>NDP MP Daniel Blaikie told the House that he was disappointed by Ms. Gould's declaration. \"She essentially signalled she's going to take the approach of begging these large socialmedia platforms to do the right thing, instead of requiring them to do the right thing ... [and] putting a framework in place with some actual teeth,\" he said in a subsequent interview.</p><p>Kevin Chan, Facebook's Canadian head of public policy, said in a phone interview that a number of election-related initiatives will begin rolling out in June. Much like it has done in the United States, for instance, Facebook will require multistep authentication and verification for potential political-ad buyers, and include a step in the process involving in-person authentication.</p><p>Mr. Chan also said that Facebook would make political ads available in a \"library\" that would include information such as who paid for ads, the spending range for each ad and the demographics they were set to target, including gender and geography. Facebook has also set up a Canadian advisory board to advise the company on election-related issues, with members including World Wildlife Fund head and former NDP MP Megan Leslie as well as former Stephen Harper chief of staff Ray Novak.</p><p>\"We want to work in partnership with the government of Canada to find bad actors and ensure there is no foreign interference,\" Mr. Chan said.</p><p>Google has already said it would ban political advertising related to the federal election as part of its new transparency rules, and has made a number of commitments to ensure its platforms are not abused. In an e-mailed statement, Colin McKay, Google Canada's head of public policy, said that the company \"is committed to providing Canadians with information and services to help them participate in the federal election and we will continue to work with the government to deliver on these principles wherever they apply to Google's products.\"</p><p>The latest in the federal Liberals' election social-media plan kicks off a week in which Canada's relationship with Big Tech is in the global spotlight. Parliament's ethics committee is hosting a meeting of the International Grand Committee on Big Data, Privacy and Democracy, with representatives from countries including Britain, Germany and Mexico in attendance Monday night through Wednesday morning.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20190528rbcdsocialmedia</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W6T-D5F1-JCRP-C36T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Earlier this year, a panel released a report commissioned by Industry Minister Navdeep Bains and Guilbeault that called for \"regulatory intervention to ensure that creators of news are compensated for the use of their original content by online platform providers.\"</p><p>Observers in the technology and media spaces are divided over the issue. Some say digital firms built their platforms partly on the backs of news outlets and should pay some form of compensation as a result. Others argue that the stories shared on the platforms typically link back to the original news outlet, and so actually drive traffic.</p><p>Jesse Hirsh, an independent researcher who covers technology, said there could be some political upside for Canadian policy-makers to take on big tech firms on the issue of news sharing.</p><p>But introducing a tax on tech giants, or regulatory changes that would force them to pay for news, will require immense political willpower that Ottawa might not currently posses, he said. Canada has for the most part followed the lead from Australia, France, Germany and others on the issue.</p><p>\"They don't want to be first,\" Hirsh said. \"They want to look as if they are not necessarily being tough on Facebook, but regulating social media.\"</p><p>He said the threats made by Facebook against Australia is a clear shot across the bow aimed at other countries, and a calculation by the company that disallowing people to share news on social media sites could prove politically unpopular. Other observers argue people might actually prefer such a restriction.</p><p>\"They want the government of Canada to pay attention,\" he said. \"They want the British government, they want the European government, the U.S. government to\" contemplate the threats made against Australia.</p><p>Guilbeault said on Twitter on Wednesday that the Liberals \"remain committed\" to ensuring a more equitable digital regulatory framework in Canada - \"that includes making sure that Canadian news organizations continue to inform and empower our communities,\" he said.</p><p>\"As for Facebook's action, the Canadian government stands with our Australian partners and denounces any form of threats.\"</p><p>In June, Guilbeault told an audience at the Banff World Media Festival that \"those who benefit from the media content\" of Canadian news companies \"should be paying their fair share.\" He said he was looking at the models in France and Australia to find a \"longer-term\" solution for the declining revenues at Canadian news outlets.</p><p>Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, a lobby group that represents the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, has been critical of Ottawa's posture toward Facebook's on the issue. It recently launched a campaign targeting Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, where it portrays the billionaire as \"wanted\" by legal authorities for having stolen news content. \"Mr. Trudeau can't have it both ways,\" the organization said in a recent statement. \"Facebook behaves like an outlaw because our government lets Zuckerberg write his own rules. They pay no taxes in Canada, suffer no consequences for publishing illegal content and make billions here selling ads against content produced by others without compensation.\"</p><p>Geist says he is unconvinced that Canadian media firms could negotiate a workable agreement with Facebook and Google given the relatively small size of the country's market. Digital firms have claimed that news sharing makes up only a small portion of their business model, and thus does not justify sizable contracts for the news it shares.</p><p>\"The response from those platforms has been that the value of your content isn't worth what you're asking for in the licence,\" he said.</p><p>National Post !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.
