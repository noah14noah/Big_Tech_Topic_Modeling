Not only did these banks invest in mobile payments but they invested in e-wallet services as well, confirming that the threat of mobile money or cashless transacting is real.&lt;nl/&gt; The fact is, South Africa has a huge unbanked population, with some researchers estimating it as high as 67%, who get turned off by the banking system due to its exorbitant banking fees, Fica requirements and a general lack of trust for banks. At the same time, South Africa has one of the highest mobile penetrations in the world with 87% individual mobile phone ownership and 36% of those being smart phone owners according to Mobile in South Africa 2014 AMPS Report.&lt;nl/&gt; I do believe that in the next couple years South Africa will see a massive switch in people's mindsets regarding mobile money which will turn into another South African success story. The advantages of mobile banking are endless; mobile money can give people a means of having money on them without the constant fear of losing it or being robbed. It can give them the ability to be part of a society where they can make use of a non traditional banking system without being exploited. People can make use of their mobile phones to pay for a taxi fare, to buying groceries at a local corner shop to sending money to relatives without carrying cash.&lt;nl/&gt; Countries such as Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana and Zimbabwe are already way ahead on this front. The time has arrived for every supermarket, retailer, spaza shop, coffee shop, taxi industry to embrace mobile money as another form of payment. It's also encouraging to see more major companies in South Africa and the rest of the world working on including mobile money into their business models and allowing people to use mobile money in ways never imagined. From automated payments for parking, allowing your fridge to order milk or even automated reward system. Mobile money isn't just a solution for the under-banked but the future for all.&lt;nl/&gt; And with big tech companies like Apple, Google, Samsung getting involved in mobile banking, the industry is growing at a very rapid rate. Regulators will be forced to adapt which will make it possible for smaller businesses to adapt to mobile money and allow companies to launch their mobile money products which will contribute to country's economic growth.&lt;nl/&gt; In South Africa, the biggest factors behind the slow growth of mobile money are the limitations put in place by the regulating bodies. Another factor is the strong hold the top five banks have over the payment industry in South Africa. It's almost impossible for any company to get a banking licence in South Africa. Without a banking licence or a banking partner its illegal for a company to start a proper mobile banking company in South Africa, which means the industry's growth is limited.&lt;nl/&gt; South Africa cannot delay anymore and needs to jump on the bandwagon because on a larger scale, we are really talking about the critical subject of financial inclusion. People are already using alternative digital mediums as currency. In other African countries, we find people using airtime as a currency. Bitcoin is becoming more and more popular. I do believe that these currencies will become another form of mobile money. As banks and regulators limit the growth of mobile money people will find different forms and means of making payments. In the near future we will find more people accepting Bitcoin or airtime as a form of payment.&lt;nl/&gt; [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gatesnotes.com/2015-Annual-Letter?page=0...g=en\">http://www.gatesnotes.com/2015-Annual-Letter?page=0...g=en</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-MEME1322221424152621301682743</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEME-132222</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5F9Y-7ST1-JCMN-Y0RK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"735\"/><timeReceived>5:57 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Memeburn</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>February 17, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.organization\"><classificationItem><className>standard Bank</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Apple</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Samsung</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google Inc.</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>FNB</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nedbank</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Microsoft</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ABSA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.person\"><classificationItem><className>Bill Gates</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Mobile</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>South Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tanzania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Zimbabwe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kenya</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Botswana</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001153</classCode><className>MOBILE COMMERCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CFTE</classCode><className>MOBILE PAYMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;

In the interview, Gates credited fellow billionaire Warren Buffett[3] as one of the people who has been the most instrumental to his success. The two billionaires have been friends for nearly 30 years[4], and have long worked together to further their business and philanthropic efforts. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[5]. Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates credits billionaire investor Warren Buffett as one of the people who has played the most instrumental role in his success \u2014 including helping him to get through one of the hardest periods in his career. </p><p>In an interview last week, Gates said that the 88-year-old Buffett helped him to get through the antitrust lawsuit[6] more than 20 years ago that put Microsoft's future in jeopardy. Gates said Buffett served as a \"great counsel\" to his dominant tech company, which the US government sued in 1998[7] for using its power to destroy the competition and further the monopoly of its Internet Explorer browser. \"The toughest thing that I went through was this antitrust lawsuit, where it didn't seem very predictable,\" Gates said last week at an event hosted by venture capital firm Village Global[8]. \"Getting somebody who is successful in another domain, but yet has kind of a business-type mindset ... that was a huge gift.\" Read more: Bill Gates says startup founders should not take weekends or vacations in the early days of building a company[9] Things clearly turned out OK for Gates and Microsoft \u2014 and these days, the government has shifted its focus to Google and Facebook[10] \u2014 but Gates and Buffett have maintained a steadfast friendship[11] for almost 30 years. The pair often credits each other with sharing best business practices and entrepreneurial tips. Along with Gates' wife, Melinda, the two billionaires launched the Giving Pledge[12] in 2010 to get other wealthy people to commit to donating more than half of their riches to philanthropy. The pair's friendship has transcended business practices as well. The two have been spotted trying out mattresses[13] together, as well as working a shift at a Dairy Queen[14], a chain that Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns[15]. In the past, Gates has credited Buffett with teaching him to laugh more[16]. Gates once again echoed that sentiment in his interview this past week. \"[Buffett] has a definite way of looking at things, including this idea of how work should be fun,\" Gates said in his interview. \"He's made his work so much fun that he works more hours than I do. In the interview, conducted by Eventbrite cofounder and CEO Julia Hartz, Gates also talked about his[17] intense work schedule in the early days of Microsoft. Gates said he used to work weekends, and didn't \"believe\" in vacations. Although he doesn't mention these work habits to everyone, Gates said he stands behind his \"fairly hardcore view\" that such hard work may be needed in the early days of a company.

In an interview with Bloomberg[1], Gates explained that the two companies would potentially continue to indulge in bad behaviors, and citing that regulation is key. According to Gates: 'I don't know the last time a company was broken up but you have really think, 'Is that the best thing if there's a way that a company's behaving that you want to get rid of?'</p><p> Then you should just say, 'Hey, OK, that's a banned behavior.'Splitting a company in two and having two people doing the bad thing, you know that doesn't seem like a solution.' Gates, who founded Microsoft in 1975, isn't a stranger to anti-trust battles, saying 'I was naive about this but that was a long time ago and I didn't realize that as Microsoft gets successful we'd come under scrutiny and we went through our thing back in the 1990s and that's made us more thoughtful about this kind of activity.' [embedded content] Gates' statements come as multiple other tech giants\u2014namely Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google\u2014are each facing antitrust investigations of their own[2]. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has also spoken about breaking up tech giants[3], saying she thinks that 'big tech companies have too much power.' According to Gates, it should be up to consumers to advocate for changes and for governments to introduce and enforce them, saying 'I do think the government really needs to talk about what those rules should be. You could say I'm biased, but I see these as well-meaning, highly innovative companies. It's up to society to make sure that their innovation doesn't have negative side-effects.' What do you think about Gates thoughts on breaking up tech companies? Do you think breaking them up would increase competition or decrease innovation?

He also called for increased regulation of today's tech firms, given the critical role they play in society. The comments come as companies like Apple, Facebook, and Google are under scrutiny over their size and influence in the market and the way they gather and handle consumer data. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[2] The size and influence of tech giants like Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple have resulted in such firms coming under scrutiny in recent years, with Democratic senator and 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren calling for new regulation[3] that would break up certain companies and restrict them from competing within the same marketplaces they operate. Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist[4] Bill Gates grappled with similar antitrust concerns more than two decades ago, and says Silicon Valley has learned from his company's legal debacle. \"I, for the early years of Microsoft, bragged to people that I didn't have an office in Washington, DC, and eventually I came to regret that statement, because it was kind of almost like taunting Washington, DC, \" he said at the Economic Club of Washington DC, according to CNN[5]. \"Now, [the other tech companies] are very engaged.\" The Department of Justice sued Microsoft in 1998[6] over concerns that it was using unfair tactics to reinforce a monopolist position in the PC market. A judge ruled that Microsoft should be broken up into two parts, but that decision was blocked and then overturned on appeal. Now, Gates is calling for increased regulation of large tech firms at a time when firms like Google, Facebook, and Apple are being criticized over a number of controversies ranging from potential antitrust concerns to the way these companies protect and collect consumer data. Facebook in particular has been caught up in privacy scandals in recent years, among the biggest being the revelation in 2018[7] that Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm with ties to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, harvested data from millions of Facebook profiles. \"Technology has become so central that governments have to think: What does that mean about elections?\" Gates said, according to CNN. \"What does that mean about bullying? What does it mean about wiretapping authorities that let you find out what's going on financially or drug money laundering, things like that. So yes, the government needs to get involved.\" Gates continued to say that regulation could be critical in ensuring that technology is being used in a beneficial way. \"The fact that now this is the way that people consume media has really brought it into a realm that we need to shape it so that the benefits outweigh the negatives,\" he said.  Lawrence Lessig, who served as a special master in the Microsoft case, said the lawsuit was \"extremely successful in creating the conditions for the Silicon Valley boom in the beginning of this century,\" when speaking with Business Insider in a previous interview.[8] \"And we ought to learn that lesson.\" NOW WATCH: New York City is getting even more infested with rats.

Let's make a move.</p><p>Welcome once again, to FIRST MOVE. Good to be with you, as always as we take the pulse of the global economy this hour with Nobel Prize winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz and not forgetting our own personal pulse rates, too. The Fitbit CEO, James Park will also discuss the latest research and whether his health tracker can help join in the fight against coronavirus. Never more essential, as the U.S. reports its largest daily jump in COVID cases.</p><p>We're now talking 40,000 people infected, and of course, the U.S. isn't alone in seeing cases rising once again. Balancing the economic risks of unsafe reopening, let's be clear, versus delayed reopening, is the ongoing challenge we face around the world.</p><p>Here's a look at the global stock picture. We're mostly lower premarket, as you can see, in the United States, and keenly watching what's going on with the banks today.</p><p>U.S. regulators eased trading and investment rules for the sector yesterday and the bank shares popped higher. Then last night, the Federal Reserve ordered banks to suspend share buybacks and cap dividends, aka, they were told to hold more cash. It's clearly an indication, I think that the Fed remains very concerned about the economic stresses going forward.</p><p>Compare and contrast, Blackrock saying the European recovery is looking very V-like, at least for now, French consumer confidence numbers beat expectations this morning, too, as you can see the stock market outperforming.</p><p>Asia, the Friday session was mostly positive. China investors were out once again. Australia's Qantas was the big loser, falling more than nine percent after they announced job cuts, and a capital raise, just another airline buying time until we return to global travel in some form of normality once again. Until that time, we will take you around the world, instead.</p><p>Let's get to the drivers.</p><p>The global coronavirus crisis still deepening. Now, we're approaching nearly 10 million confirmed cases. In Latin America, Brazil alone has recorded more than 1.2 million infections. Almost wherever you look, the numbers are accelerating. In Russia, well over 600,000 cases; almost half a million in India. Look at the U.K., too, still not halting the spread of the disease with more than 300,000 infected.</p><p>But they are all dwarfed by the numbers here in the United States, Thursday bringing in new daily high of more than 40,500 new cases, with the situation in California, Florida and Texas getting rapidly worse. CNN's Lucy Kafanov is in Dallas, Texas, with more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. PETER HOTEZ, DEAN, SCHOOL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE, BAYLOR COLLEGE: Unfortunately, I don't see an end in sight. We are going to continue to have this acceleration of cases.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LUCY KAFANOV, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Nearly 6,000 people testing positive here in Texas, another single-day record for the state.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. RICHARD BESSER, FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, U.S. CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTRO: The situation in Texas is a warning shot.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAFANOV (voice-over): The state seeing record hospitalizations, too, with that number steadily increasing each day over the past two weeks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER (D-TX), HOUSTON: We started opening up in May. We'll agree that it was my opinion then we were opening too quickly, too soon.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAFANOV (voice-over): Texas was one of the first states in the country to begin reopening 56 days ago. But, now, the recent surge forcing Governor Greg Abbott to hit pause on the state's reopening plan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R-TX): We work on a daily basis and you should anticipate more orders coming out in the coming days.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAFANOV (voice-over): But his earlier reopening order would still allow many businesses already open to continue operating, including malls, restaurants, and gyms.</p><p>Neighboring Louisiana and New Mexico also pausing their reopening, trying to stop the possibility of similar increases like Texas, and other states like North Carolina, Kansas and Arizona, pausing, too.</p><p>[09:05:11]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. DOUG DUCEY (R-AZ): We expect that our numbers will be worse next week and the week following in terms of cases and hospitalizations</p><p>KAFANOV (voice-over): In California, Los Angeles County has more confirmed cases than any other county in the nation. In Florida, where 5,000 more cases have been confirmed, Governor DeSantis still resisting implementing a statewide mandate to wear masks.</p><p>And in Ohio, the state reporting a staggering number. Nearly 60 percent of new cases are people ages 20 to 49.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ASHISH JHA, DIRECTOR, HARVARD GLOBAL HEALTH INSTITUTE: They've got to get aggressive if they're going to bring this virus outbreaks under control or they are going to be forced to shut down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAFANOV (voice-over): At a CNN Town Hall, Bill Gates saying that the global and domestic picture are bleaker than expected.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL GATES, CO-CHAIR, BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION: The U.S. in particular hasn't had the leadership messages or the coordination that you would have expected.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: Basically, we're still not doing enough now on this pandemic?</p><p>GATES: No, not even close. I mean, just -- you know, people died today.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAFANOV (voice-over): Despite President Trump repeatedly insisting that the country needs to reduce testing to keep totals low.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If we didn't do testing, we would have no cases.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAFANOV (voice-over): The C.D.C. believes that for every one person who tested positive with the virus, ten have gone undiagnosed, which means that an estimated 20 million more Americans have possibly been infected.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ROBERT REDFIELD, CDC DIRECTOR: The virus causes so much asymptomatic infection. We probably recognized about 10 percent of the outbreak.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All of this, of course, risks to the strength of the economic recovery and why stress tests on banking systems are so important, while stress tests on the U.S. banks showed they are in good health, but to keep it that way, the Federal Reserve ordering large banks to suspend share buybacks and cap shareholder dividends.</p><p>Joining us now with all of the details, Clare Sebastian. It was like a pound in the head with a kick in the teeth, I think in the last 24 hours. Loosening some of the Volcker rules that kicked in after the financial crisis, but at the same time, saying, guys, you need to hold more cash and be prepared for the economic challenges going forward.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I think you put it perfectly, Julia. On the one hand, earlier in the day on Thursday, we got the news that some parts of the Volcker rule were being relaxed. Banks would be able to easily trade in derivatives and invest in venture capital funds. That sent the share prices of those bank stocks up.</p><p>But then, of course, after the market closed, we get the news about the stress test and the extra sort of protections that the Fed is putting in place just to make sure that these banks are well enough capitalized given the uncertainty ahead.</p><p>They said that so far, the banks are healthy and should be able to withstand even the most adverse scenarios, but they didn't just conduct a normal stress test, they added sort of an overlay sensitivity test that laid out three different scenarios of the pandemic, a V-shaped recovery, a U-shaped recovery and a W-shaped recovery.</p><p>And they said that in the cases of the U and W, some of the banks came pretty close to their minimum capital ratio requirements and that's why they are putting in place these extra protections.</p><p>I think not a huge surprise to many, but one thing that was perhaps a surprise is the level of oversight we're now going to see from the Fed. The banks have to submit their capital plans again later this year and they will be subject to scrutiny from the Fed Board once every quarter, Julia.</p><p>So a lot of oversight and I think that speaks again to the level of uncertainty in the economy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I couldn't agree more. And also the Federal Reserve is saying, look, we just have to be prepared here. They've been sending warnings about the risks here now for weeks and weeks, particularly to Congress as well to say step up.</p><p>You would be forgiven for thinking if you looked at the stock market that we're likely to see a V-shaped recovery, but when you look at the share prices of some of these banks, in contrast to some of the outperformers like Amazon, you see that these bank stocks are pricing in trouble.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes, they are up, most of them, since the March lows, but they're not really outperforming the market. They're sort of moving around the middle there.</p><p>I think what we know, Julia from the earnings of the last quarter is that these banks are having to set aside a lot of money for loan and loss provisions. We are about to get earnings again in the second quarter and that could show the situation worsening.</p><p>And that is what the Fed is trying to protect. They want the banks to continue to be able to lend to businesses and individuals and to be able to cushion against these losses. And there was, I should note, some opposition, even from within the Fed Board to the Fed allowing dividends to still go ahead while obviously capping them at the rate paid out in the second quarter.</p><p>Lael Brainard, one of the Fed Board members said, I do not support giving the greenlight for large banks to deplete capital, which raises the risk they will need to tighten credit or rebuild capital during the recovery.</p><p>She says this policy fails to learn a key lesson of the financial crisis and I cannot support it. So, people are extremely worried, even within the ranks of the Federal Reserve.</p><p>[09:10:06]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, shareholders rank second to borrowers in need and that must be remembered. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for that.</p><p>Wirecard's woes are escalating. The E.U. launching a preliminary investigation into the German digital payments firm involved in a massive accounting scandal. Questions have also been raised about regulators, including Wirecard's auditor, EY.</p><p>Fred Pleitgen is in Berlin, and has been following the story for us. It's got all of the makings of a movie plot, quite frankly, Fred.</p><p>But quite frankly, when an auditor comes out and says, look, we were duped, too. Hang on a second, what was your job here for a number of years?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you're absolutely right and that's exactly what some German capital investors, Julia, are actually saying. There's been a lawsuit against EY about their auditing of Wirecard that has been going on since at least Friday and the German capital investors that are part of that lawsuit are saying, look, they've been talking about this for a very long time that they believed that there was something wrong at Wirecard and that EY wasn't doing what they were supposed to do to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>But you're absolutely right, EY -- Ernst &amp; Young is saying, look, there was nothing we could do about this. This was all so elaborate that it would have duped anyone is basically what they are saying.</p><p>I want to read you part of the statement that EY put out about this. They said, and this is quote, \"Collusive fraud designed to deceive investors and the public often involve extensive efforts to create a false documentary trail that even the most robust and extended audit procedures may not uncover a collusive fraud.\"</p><p>So essentially they're saying they believe that they did their job, but as you say, they believe that they were duped themselves. Now, of course, German authorities are saying that that simply isn't good enough for them. There's a lot of criticism that's coming out from the German banking regulator, BaFin, as well who of course has also been quite self-critical, also.</p><p>They're saying that they also probably should have done more in the way of oversight to get to the bottom of what was going on there at Wirecard for such a very long time, apparently, with of course large assets just simply not being there.</p><p>And Germany's Finance Minister, we've been talking about this, also has been coming out. He's been quite self-critical over the past couple of days as well, and he said that look, Germany really needs to take a look at this regulator's process and at the way regulation is done here, and if mistakes are uncovered, those mistakes need to be corrected very, very quickly.</p><p>Obviously, the Germans do feel that this was a big embarrassment for this country as a financial marketplace, as a place to do finance business and to do business in general. And of course, the Germans understand that really part of what makes them so successful is the fact that people have trust in regulation here, trust in processes here in this country.</p><p>So, it is certainly something that the Germans are taking very serious as well. And then, of course on top of that, Wirecard itself not looking good at all for them, as we're also hearing that Mastercard, Visa, potentially going to sever any sort of ties with Wirecard and that of course, for some of these clients for Wirecard, big problem also, as well.</p><p>As you say, aptly correctly, all of this has the makings of a very, very large thriller movie here in Germany.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, not so great for investors and people who have lost money as a result there. Fred, great to have you with us on that. Thank you. Fred Pleitgen, the plot thickens.</p><p>All right, let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories making headlines around the world.</p><p>Okay, the German government is hosting a Meat Industry Summit in the wake of several COVID-19 outbreaks in processing plants. The government is pushing to increase meat prices by 45 U.S. cents per kilo to improve animal welfare and conditions for workers.</p><p>Anna Stewart joins me now. Not just a German problem, of course, we've seen this in terms of ensuring food supply chains, in terms of protecting workers all over the world. Why is it so challenging to operate this business, Anna? What have you been finding?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: It's a really worrying trend, isn't it? This is specifically meat processing plants and slaughterhouses. There have now been at least four outbreaks in the U.K. in factories like this one. This is in Wales. This is a poultry factory and I've been speaking to people in town. I've been speaking just now actually to a worker who worked here and did contract the virus early on in their outbreak.</p><p>No one knows for sure exactly why the virus seems to spread so quickly in these factories. The worker I spoke to said there was plenty of PPE. There was plenty of sanitizing stages, he felt very safe, and yet it happened.</p><p>So here's a deeper dive into why the virus is really spreading so quickly in plants like this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEWART (voice-over): It's the third meat factory in the small country of Wales to register a coronavirus outbreak in recent weeks. This one, at the 2 Sisters poultry factory is the biggest, 200 cases so far.</p><p>That's dwarfed by an outbreak at the Tonnies meat-packing plant in Germany, where over 1,500 workers have tested positive for COVID-19, leading to a local lockdown, more than 360,000 forced to quarantine.</p><p>[09:1510]</p><p>STEWART (voice-over): It's a worrying trend in meat processing plants and slaughterhouses across the world. Despite many adopting COVID-19 safety measures, PPE and social distancing where possible.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES WOOD, PROFESSOR, CAMBRIDGE INFECTIOUS DISEASES, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY: The temperature is something that is a feature particularly in cutting plants, it's harder to have a cold temperature in slaughter lines. But one of the features of a slaughter line is the fact that they're very noisy places. People have to stand close to each other and sometimes shout in order to make themselves heard.</p><p>And all of these things can promote the risk of spread of infection.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART (voice-over): In the U.K., more than two-thirds of sector workers are from other European countries. In the U.S. and Germany, migrant workers make up around a third of the workforce.</p><p>Back in the town of Llangefni, home to the closed poultry plant, the streets are practically empty.</p><p>STEWART (on camera): Many of the workers, their families and their contacts are still self-isolating at home. It's a small town and almost everyone we've spoken to knows somebody that is affected. The biggest concern has been the employees who felt sick early on in the outbreak didn't stay home as they couldn't afford to.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PADDY MCNAUGHT, UNITE REGIONAL OFFICER: These people were all paid. They don't have sick pay schemes in place. So when people have a slight temperature or something that could have been related to COVID-19, whether it's a slight cough or a slight temperature, people have been less likely to take time off and isolate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEWART (voice-over): The 2 Sisters, say unions like Unite are leveraging this crisis to improve workers' conditions, and added that all their staff are now on full pay since the factory is shut.</p><p>STEWART (on camera): There's a confluence of factors at play, as outbreaks continue to crop up at meat plants across the world, there are concerns about the safety of the workers and their communities.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEWART: Here in Wales, the lockdown is still very much in place, unlike neighboring England, and that means that the outbreak here in the factory is less likely to spread through the wider community.</p><p>But as lockdowns are lifted across areas of Europe, look at Germany, look at that huge outbreak there and the fact that 360,000 people have had to go back into lockdown, back into quarantine. That is the risk and that is why it is so important that they figure out exactly why these slaughterhouses, these meat processing plants are such hot beds for the virus and to make sure that these workers can be protected going forward -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Absolutely. It doesn't get more essential than these people when we're talking about food supply. Somehow we have to protect them better.</p><p>Anna Stewart, great job. Thank you for that.</p><p>All right, coming up here on FIRST MOVE, after the break, Nobel Prize winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz is on the show to talk people power and profits. And could your smart watch know you have COVID-19 even before you do? We'll discuss the latest research, that's next.</p><p>[09:21:06]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. U.S. futures are on target for a lower open in the final session of the week. This, as new numbers confirm that pent-up consumer demand following the lockdowns has helped boost U.S. spending.</p><p>Personal spending rose more than eight percent last month, though admittedly, from a low base and with almost 20 million Americans still collecting jobless benefits, and an unemployment rate stuck at 13 percent, at least on paper, the health of the consumer remains in question.</p><p>Nike is seeking cautious consumers. Shares are lower premarket after the company posted a surprise loss for the fourth quarter. Sales fell by a greater than expected 38 percent.</p><p>Now, despite the challenges, White House Economic Adviser, Larry Kudlow remains upbeat on U.S. growth. He still believes the economy can rebound some 20 percent in both the third and fourth quarters.</p><p>Joseph Stiglitz is a Nobel Prize winning economist and Professor at Columbia University, and also an author of the book titled \"People, Power and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent.\"</p><p>Professor Stiglitz, fantastic to have you on the show, sir. Thank you for joining us. Your view on the probability here of a V-shaped recovery. Can we rule that out?</p><p>JOSEPH STIGLITZ, NOBEL PRIZE WINNING ECONOMIST: Yes, it's a fantasy. You know, what they meant when they talked about a V-shaped recovery back in March was that you put the economy in a hospital for four weeks, eight weeks, ten weeks, and by beginning of June at the latest, the end of July, we would pick up where we left off. No one thinks that that is going to be the case.</p><p>And the best forecast, both from the Federal Reserve and from the I.M.F., is that the U.S. won't be back to where it was at the end of 2019 until 2022. I think what has been happening in the United States with the up- surge in cases makes even that look rosy.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What is your prediction based on what we're seeing? Because we know that the bar seems very high for a more sustained announcement over lockdowns, but it seems like we're going to see localized lockdowns, people being told to shelter in place again, particularly given the spikes in cases that we're seeing?</p><p>STIGLITZ: Well, the basic point that I've maintained all along is that you are not going to have an economic recovery until the pandemic is under control, and under control in almost the entire country, and in many ways throughout the world, we're very interconnected.</p><p>And as long as the disease is raging in some part of the country, people are going to be anxious. And we have now good data showing it isn't the lockdown that is really causing the economic slowdown, it's fear.</p><p>In the Great Depression, President Roosevelt said we have nothing to fear but fear itself, but in this case, we have two things to fear. We have the fear of the pandemic, which is real, and we have the fear of the inadequate government responses, economic and health responses to the pandemic.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Short-term, what can be done to at least address and support the economy? Because a lot of stimulus, whether it's from the Federal Reserve or whether it's from Congress, has been applied here. How can we make policy steps today that don't take us back to where we were in 2019, but actually facilitate growth going forward in a better and a more sustainable way? [09:25:13]</p><p>STIGLITZ: That's a really good point, that the administration talked about picking up where we left off, and where we were was not a good position.</p><p>One of the reasons why the disease is taking a devastating toll in the United States, much worse than other countries, is that our health status was the worst of the advanced countries. We have the shortest life expectancy and the one country whose life expectancy today is lower than it was in 2016.</p><p>We have a lot of inequality, a lot of racial discrimination, and we hadn't moved in a way that we should toward a knowledge economy and towards a green economy.</p><p>So there are lots of things that we should have been focused on when we put up, you know, several trillion dollars, but there was no vision of what kind of an economy that we want to emerge from the pandemic.</p><p>So, what we need to do is make sure the way we allocate the money goes in ways that supports this vision and these values, and that will also entail putting some conditions on those who received the money, that they don't spend the money for big bonuses for the CEOs, but instead pay livable wages. That's one example.</p><p>In other countries, when they give money to the airlines, they impose the condition that the carbon footprint of the airline be reduced.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: American stock capitalism ultimately needs to change and rising stock markets is only going to accelerate, I think, and see those voices that are calling for this become louder and louder. We're already seeing it with social unrest in this country.</p><p>Joseph, what's the risk and what happens if we don't see these changes and this greater scrutiny and conditions attached to money?</p><p>STIGLITZ: Well, I think what we've been seeing is exactly what we're likely to get, except it could be much worse. The social unrest. We have not been able to respond anywhere near as well as other countries to the pandemic.</p><p>New Zealand was able to actually to almost completely get rid of the disease. One of the reasons is a high degree of social cohesion, a high degree of trust in the government. The government is seen as a government of the people, for the people and by the people.</p><p>I don't think people see the American government in that way. Sometimes, I say -- I wrote an article describing it as of the one percent, for the one percent, and by the one percent, but it's more accurately by the corporations and by other special interests.</p><p>And so there needs to be trust in science, expertise. That's been denigrated.</p><p>And in responding to the crisis, we realized that we need a government. Markets are not going to take care of it. Markets couldn't even produce the masks and the tests and protective gear that we needed.</p><p>But 40 years of denigrating the role of government has meant that we were ill-prepared.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Very quickly, I have just 30 seconds or so, does leadership change fix this, Professor Stiglitz? Because you said this has been decades. This is not one administration's failure.</p><p>STIGLITZ: Yes, it's necessary. Clearly, it's necessary. And that leadership change, but with the grassroots movement of the kind that we've been seeing can, I think, actually make a difference. I think there's a clear progressive agenda of a different kind of country with a different -- reflecting, I think, the values of a vast majority of Americans.</p><p>The problem is, our democracy has not been reflecting these deep values that are held more than two to one, three to one, across the country.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: These values need to shine through and be allowed to shine through. This is at the core of your book as well, which is fantastic. I recommend our viewers read it. Professor Stiglitz, come back and join us soon, please, sir. It's always fantastic to talk to you. Thank you.</p><p>STIGLITZ: Thank you very much.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, we're oing to take a break here on FIRST MOVE. But coming up, the unfriending continues. Verizon joining the boycott against Facebook. We will discuss with tech investor and early Zuckerberg mentor, Roger McNamee. That's next.</p><p>[09:33:08]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: News just in to CNN, police in the Scottish city of Glasgow say they are dealing with an incident on West George Street, which is currently closed. They say the situation is contained at this time and that there is no danger to the general public.</p><p>The Scottish First Minister has asked the public to avoid the area. We'll bring you any further information on this as soon as we get it.</p><p>All right, for now, we'll move on and give you a quick look at what we're seeing as far as the U.S. stock markets this morning. They're open and they are moving lower.</p><p>Bank stocks are under pressure following the Fed moving to suspend their stock buybacks and limit their dividend hikes as we discussed already on the show. It's all about making sure banks have enough cash during the COVID-related crisis, and that of course sparking further uncertainty, too.</p><p>In the business world, Apple closing stores again in Florida and Texas where cases are spiking. Macy's and General Motors both announcing substantial job cuts in the last 24 hours, too, and another big market test coming this session when the New York Stock Exchange launches its first major IPO since the march lockdowns, grocery chain Albertson's making its Wall Street debut. As safe a stock as it gets, I think in these troubled times. Grocery stores.</p><p>All right, and Facebook meanwhile trying to contain the growing ad boycott over alleged misinformation on its platform. Verizon joined the stop hate for profit boycott Thursday making it one of the largest companies to join the campaign and the first telecom giant to do so.</p><p>Other major companies include Jen &amp; Jerrys, North Face, Patagonia, Magnolia Pictures and more.</p><p>Let's talk this through. Joining us now, Roger McNamee, co-founder of Elevation Partners. He was an early mentor to Mark Zuckerberg and an early investor in Facebook, too. He has also written a book called, \"Zucked: Waking up to the Facebook Catastrophe.\"</p><p>[09:35:09]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Roger, fantastic to have you on the show. Good to see you looking well. You and I have talked in the past, nothing changes for Facebook until users disappear. They're not doing it. Or until advertisers turn around and say, hey, we have a problem with this, too. What do you make of the advertising moves, a drop in the ocean or something more substantial?</p><p>ROGER MCNAMEE, CO-FOUNDER, ELEVATION PARTNERS: So Julia, I think there are two levels you have to look at. As investors, people are going to look at this and say, will it affect the revenues and the earnings? And the answer is not any time soon. But I do think there is a profound second effect you should pay attention to, and that is that when advertisers are expressing serious concern about the spread of hate speech, which is what really drives this.</p><p>Remember, the stop hate for profit is created by the NAACP, Color of Change, the Anti-Defamation League and Commonsense Media. So these are civil rights organizations and they're going to advertisers and saying, listen, what's going on right now in terms of the spread and amplification of white supremacy and other kinds of hate speech is intolerable and advertisers should not be comfortable placing their ads side by side with that.</p><p>Obviously, as we all know, Facebook has created the world's greatest advertising platform, so it's hard for marketers to give that up, even for a month, which is what this campaign is about.</p><p>But what the campaign is doing is forcing a reckoning about the impact of Facebook's business practices, because there's really no reason you can't have the good of Facebook without all the hate speech. The hate speech is there because it maximizes engagement, and Facebook's algorithms are there. They are tuned to maximize engagement, so things like hate speech, disinformation and conspiracy theories are always going to get amplified more than regular content and that's been a big issue, as we've talked about before.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Another recognition or a revelation about Facebook, and we've been here so many times before, election interference, concerns over content, and yet nothing changes at Facebook. I guess I ask you, Roger, does anything change? Because they've said, look, we'll have monitoring, moderation. Does that change anything?</p><p>MCNAMEE: This is exactly the point. For 15 years, Facebook has been able to say we're really sorry, we promise to do better, and then it goes right back to doing what it was doing before. Because people's attention is too short.</p><p>I think, though, Julia, I mean, as Professor Stiglitz just pointed out, we may be at a moment right now where the culture is changing and where expectations for what corporations should do will change with that. And in this particular moment, I think Facebook has put itself in a very uncomfortable position. Even relative to YouTube, which does all the same kinds of harm.</p><p>Facebook's essentially willingness to be a bad guy relative to election interference, it's saying that really it doesn't think that lying in political ads is a problem. That, I think, is just not going to age well. And so if there is a change in administration, Facebook, I think, looks at four different kinds of regulatory threats.</p><p>There's now actual serious talk about amending Section 230, which is the safe harbor that protects internet platforms from third-party content. There's very serious discussion about new levels of privacy. There are antitrust things going on at states as well as the Federal government level and internationally.</p><p>And then lastly, I think there are real issues in securities law because of the way that Google and Facebook in particular have managed their advertising networks.</p><p>That's four different kinds of regulation, none of which are factored into the stock price today. And you wouldn't say that the outcome is known for any of them, but those things are going to create doubt going forward and I think for investors, you just have to pay attention because the numbers are still really good, but this company has -- they have a business practice that is going to be, I think, very controversial essentially until something is done about it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It looks Teflon. Do politicians need to put their money where their mouth is? I mean, I look at the spending that President Trump, that Joe Biden is pumping into Facebook at a time when we're worried about election interference, when we're concerned about content. I mean, give me a break. The irony here is insane.</p><p>MCNAMEE: Nobody is going first. Yes. You know, Julia, nobody is going to go first. Facebook has the greatest advertising platform on Earth. That is why the stock is where it is today. But I liken it to the chemicals industry in the 1950s.</p><p>The chemicals industry in the 50s was effectively the internet. It was a fast-growing, incredibly profitable industry because they poured waste products wherever they wanted. They put toxic fumes in the atmosphere. They would pour mercury into fresh water and there was never any cost to that.</p><p>And eventually society said, you know what? You guys are harming public health. You are harming the environment. We're going to make you pay a cost to clean up, but we're also going to put things in place to keep you from doing it.</p><p>Now, I think that is what we're going to do with all the Big Tech companies. We're going to do this way to, things like facial recognition, artificial intelligence before they get too broadly deployed and then we're going to go back and look at the big things like YouTube, like Facebook, like Instagram, like Twitter, and ask what are the things that companies like that should be doing to be good citizens, as opposed to just super profitable?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's coming, but it could be a long time coming. Roger, very quickly --</p><p>MCNAMEE: Oh, they will.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I just think it's going to take too long, quite frankly. Very quickly, your tech investor mind, would you be investing at this moment, given health challenges, economic challenges?</p><p>MCNAMEE: Julia, keep in mind, I'm 64 years old, so as a consequence, you know, I'm at a point in my life where I don't have forever to earn it back.</p><p>I think what's going on in the United States right now is terrifying. The notion that the E.U., that Canada, Mexico and our trading partners in Asia will treat the United States like a plague ship, that is just terrible for our economy, it's terrible for your outlook. It is terrible for everything.</p><p>And the notion that we have no response to this rise in cases again, and even if it turns out there are a lot fewer fatalities because there's a lot more young people in the mix, this is just terrible for the economy, and it makes me incredibly nervous and for myself, again I'm not managing other people's money, but for myself I'm very conservatively postured because I don't understand how we can have a great market forever, right?</p><p>I mean, obviously I see why it's been good now. The Fed has pumped a ton of liquidity into the system, which has kept everything going really, really well, but eventually the economy matters, earnings are going to matter, and I just don't see us having any kind of predictable path out of this mess, at least until January.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I want to argue with you and I can't. Roger, always great to chat with you and get your wisdom.</p><p>MCNAMEE: Julia, it's the best -- you're the best. Thank you so much for having me on.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you, sir. Roger McNamee, co-founder of Elevation Partners, and author of \"Zucked: Waking up to the Facebook Catastrophe.\"</p><p>All right now, some very special pictures. I want to take you into orbit around the Earth. You are looking at live action from the International Space Station and a spacewalk under way right now. NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Chris Cassidy are replacing lithium batteries that provide power to the International Space Station, the third U.S. crew member on board right now is Colonel Doug Hurley, also known as Astro Doug.</p><p>And if you look closely, you'll see he is wearing a Fitbit in this picture. Yes, I see it. James Park, the CEO of Fitbit is next, and we'll be talking all things research into COVID and maybe a bit of space, too. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:46:21]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to the show. We're following breaking news from Glasgow, Scotland. Police say they have shot a male suspect and that an officer was injured during the incident.</p><p>They say the situation in West George Street is now contained and that there is no danger to the general public.</p><p>Video posted on social media shows several people leaving a building with their arms raised as armed police wait for them to exit before going in. We'll bring you further updates the moment we get them.</p><p>But for now, the police saying the situation there is contained.</p><p>All right, let's move on. So whether it's up in space or down here on Earth, there's close to 30 million active Fitbit users. If you didn't know, these are health tracking wearables.</p><p>What's interesting is that they generate one of the world's largest databases of activity, exercise and sleep, and now research is under way to see if they can give an early warning of infections like COVID-19.</p><p>With the results of the study, James Park, CEO and co-founder of Fitbit joins us now. James, fantastic to have you on the show. What can you tell us about the research?</p><p>JAMES PARK, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, FITBIT: Thanks, Julia. So it's kind of astonishing. I co-founded Fitbit 13 years ago and it's amazing to see how much more useful devices like Fitbit and smart watches and fitness trackers continue to be.</p><p>And as you pointed out just very recently, we've been doing a lot of interesting research and we do believe that wearable data can actually be used to help detect COVID-19 before symptoms start.</p><p>And this is building on research that we have been doing with Stanford University and Scripps Research in the United States, and we launched a COVID-19 study actually around this topic that right now has almost 100,000 participants who are contributing data to this effort. So, it's really a global effort.</p><p>And already we're seeing that the data that we're collecting off of our devices using metrics like your breathing rate and the timing between your heart beats, can start to change one to two days before COVID-19 symptoms are actually reported by users.</p><p>I think that's incredible and it's important not only due to the fact that there's a possibility that, you know, these devices can detect COVID-19 one to two days before symptoms start, but because existing tests like nasal swab tests are not great at detecting COVID-19 in the first few days of symptoms because of the viral load and just because it's too early in the stage where your body starts to respond. And we all know that temperature checks aren't foolproof either.</p><p>We've seen that only 50 percent to 85 percent of people who are eventually diagnosed with COVID-19 actually exhibit a fever. So, what's exciting again is that wearable data, we think can be a great addition to a comprehensive testing solution for COVID-19.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Potentially. I have to say, James, every medical expert I speak to is very cautious and concerned at this stage that we point out that this is research. It doesn't have sort of clinical evidence or proof at this stage that it actually works. This is the very early stages here. I think we have to make that clear, too. Do you agree with some of their caution? Because we don't want to give people false hope.</p><p>PARK: No, absolutely. I think, you know, the severity and seriousness of the pandemic lends itself to, you know, being pretty cautious in the solutions that are proposed. I mean, we've already seen that with kind of the varying, you know, suggestions about masks in the early days, that they weren't effective, and now we know that they can be a great tool in managing the crisis.</p><p>[09:50:08]</p><p>PARK: So, I do think we need to be cautious. But, you know, I think it's very promising in terms of the early data that we're seeing and it's great that we have some excellent research partners in Stanford and Scripps to help us in the effort.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We spoke to Oura's CEO this week, the ring that also tracks similar changes. Do you see them as potential competition going forward and smaller, perhaps more easy to use than wearing an additional watch? Could that be fierce competition?</p><p>PARK: Yes, I mean, the way I think about it is, this is a global health crisis and I think it's great that there's a lot of companies participating in a lot of different ways to help, you know, everyone in the world start to address this, whether it's just people in the community, employers, institutions, national governments, and I don't think there's a one size fits all to addressing the issue.</p><p>So, you know, I think it's great that there's a lot of different companies and solutions that are out there.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's phenomenal. We can't wait to hear more about this and come back and talk to us soon because the wearables is a fascinating space and I know you've got a lot going on. James Park, CEO and founder of Fitbit. Great to have you on the show, sir.</p><p>All right, coming up, the 30-year wait is finally over. We'll take you to Liverpool, England where football fans celebrate their first Premier League title. Yay! That's next.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Big celebrations under way in Liverpool, England, after the city's football club clinched their first league title since 1990. Wow. Fans flooding the streets outside Anfield after their team ended the 30-year drought.</p><p>Alex Thomas is live in Liverpool for us. Alex is outside broadcast. It doesn't get better than this. What was last night like?</p><p>ALEX THOMAS, CNN SPORT: It was pretty hectic, Julia. It's fair to say that people of Liverpool no doubt know how to have a good time on a night out anyway, and add into the mix this end of an agonizing 30-year wait and it was quite a party.</p><p>We can show you more social media video filmed by some of the Liverpool players who were still celebrating this morning, it seemed, judging from what Andrew Robertson, the fullback said about coming down to breakfast and finding the likes of Virgil Van Dike there, star central defender dancing and partying.</p><p>Also a video of Jurgen Klopp, the instrumental coach of this successful Liverpool team, also dancing. I think we can forgive them having hangovers and enjoying the party because it's been such a long wait.</p><p>Liverpool now the English, European and world club champions. What a turnaround for a club that's really, despite a couple of Champions League victories in the last 30 years, had not anywhere near as much success as they had in the previous 30 years from 1990 going backwards.</p><p>All morning, we've seen the clean-up operation here outside Anfield, bottles of beer, cans being cleared away.</p><p>[09:55:10]</p><p>THOMAS: But even those having to do the clearing away, doing it in cheerful spirit, knowing what the cause was, even though people were probably not social distancing at all last night, it is fair to say when we came down.</p><p>As we left after midnight, there were still people arriving at nearby Stanley Park just to join in. Let's hear from their manager, Jurgen Klopp who was pretty emotional after the win by Chelsea over Manchester City on Thursday night which handed Liverpool the title and he said, it was all about the fans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JURGEN KLOPP, MANAGER, LIVERPOOL: It's for you out there. It's for you. It's incredible. I hope you stay at home or go in front of your house, if you want, but not going out more and celebrate it. It's all here and it's all here. We will do it together in this moment. It's a joy to do it for you, I can tell you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What a win. Alex, amazing to have you with us. Thank you so much for that. Such a great moment, I think for Liverpool fans and for the players, too. No excitement clearly on my part here. Great to have you there. And for the fans, please be safe this weekend with your celebrations. We can celebrate next year when we bring it home again.</p><p>That's it for the show. You've been watching FIRST MOVE. Stay safe this weekend and we'll see you on Monday.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020062601cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6077-B8M1-DXH2-6411-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7411\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 26, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He's not a fan -- though not necessarily for the reasons you might think. The former Microsoft CEO told Bloomberg in an interview[2] that it was better to correct the specific practices than to break the companies up. </p><p>If you split them, you now have two companies \"doing the bad thing,\" he said. He wasn't completely averse to the concept, but there were a \"narrow\" set of circumstances where it would work.Gates also took a mixed approach to taxation. He agreed with tech giants that the current tax system is completely legal[3], but also felt that politicians should change the rules if they wanted to remove incentives to minimize taxes. He did agree that it was up to society (including government) to ensure that innovation in Big Tech didn't have harmful effects, such as radicalization[4] and highly partisan news.Others would disagree. Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, for instance, has called for the breakup[5] of these companies in part because of their sizes. They use their clout to buy up would-be rivals and otherwise stymie competition, she argued, and the situation won't get better if they're allowed to hold on to all their acquisitions. And Microsoft President Brad Smith might not be calling for an explicit breakup, but he has warned[6] that a lack of strong regulation could threaten the very foundations of democracy. Gates could have a point -- many would argue that the breakup of AT...ed to multiple poorly-behaving[7] carriers. However, the answer might not be as clear cut as either side is arguing.Play Video[8]Bloomberg Technology (YouTube 1)[9], (2)[10]This article originally appeared on Engadget at <url

Without mentioning Apple's name, Gates raised the prospect that the company might be on the wrong side of the encryption debate, specifically when it comes to investigating criminals, and could face government regulation if it doesn't cooperate with investigations. Offered during a discussion of 'big trends' that scare the technologist-turned-philanthropist,Gates's premise is somewhat nuanced: Even if technology companies are moving society forward, they shouldn't impede traditional governmental functions. </p><p>'The companies need to be careful,' said Gates, 'that they're not advocating things that would prevent government from being able to, under appropriate review, perform the type of functions that we've come to count on.' One example? Taking a 'view thateven a clear mass-murdering criminal's communication should never be available to the government.' When asked whether he was referring to Apple being able to unlock an iPhone,Gates said, 'There's no question of ability; it's the question of willingness.'Some might read that as requiring a universal iOS backdoor that government actors could open with a court order, but offering case-by-case assistance to investigators could have the same effect. Apple has described itself[2] as unable to decrypt content stored on iOS devices, and unwilling 'to add a backdoor into any of our products.' Even facing FBI demands for assistance unlocking the iPhone of a gunman in San Bernardino, California, CEO Tim Cook refused to budge[3], touting Apple's commitment to user privacy as more important. More recently, however, Apple has apparently offered to help the FBI[4] in ways that don't compromise its encryption system as a whole. In the interview, Gates appears to be concerned about technology's empowerment of 'a small group of people to cause damage,' including anything from nuclear to bioterror to cyber weapons, which could impact billions of people. To that end, healso questioned tech companies' 'enthusiasm about making financial transactions anonymous and invisible,' presumably allowing money to flow to dark places without consequence. While Gates may appear to be focusing heavily on Apple, he's correct in noting that the U.S. government has historically had the ability to trace transactions and examine individuals' communications during investigations. These data points have been the foundations of numerous criminal prosecutions, and if a company tries to impede reasonable investigations, it may actually be overstepping historic privacy rights.'The tech companies have to be careful that they're not trying to think their view is more important than the government's view,' said Gates, 'or than the government being able to function in some key areas.' Gates is currentlya full-time philanthropist, heading up the charitableBill ...linda Gates Foundation with his wife. Under his watch, Microsoft developed a monopoly on PC operating systems, eventually losinga historic antitrust case that forced the company to assist third-party competitors, and limit its web browser development.

There's nothing inappropriate about officials talking to big tech companies, he said, citing regrets about addressing Microsoft investigations in the 1990s. \"I was naive,\" he said. \"I didn't have an office in Washington, D.C. ... and even bragged about it. I later came to regret that. I'm sure these guys are learning better than I did that they need to come back here and start a dialogue.\" Gates was asked about the backlash against big tech and criticism that companies don't properly protect consumer data.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V0D-7801-JC8G-80WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"117\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 18, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

John Kennedy (R-La.) told Facebook officials. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)offered a more blunt warning:'You are going to have to do something about this or else we will.'

According to Gurley, one man, who represented a large mutual fund, asked, \"You don't want us to invest in this but the big tech stocks are not delivering enough growth and my competitors are getting into these startups, so what are we supposed to do?\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Gurley says he didn't have a good answer but he wasn't surprised by the sentiment, which he describes as FOMO, a slang popular among millennials that stands for \"fear of missing out.\"</p><p>It is this infectious FOMO, according to Gurley and other venture capitalists, that has created a flotilla of billion-dollar startups with ever-soaring valuations and mixed financials.</p><p>According to The Wall Street Journal's Billion Dollar Startup Club, there are now at least 73 private technology companies worth more than $1 billion dollars, versus 41 a year ago. Some, such as Uber, the $41.2 billion car hailing app backed by Gurley's Benchmark, are worth enormous sums. At least 48 companies were valued at $1 billion or more for the first time, and another 23 members moved up the ranking after raising more money.</p><p>Many investors are treating these 73 companies as if they were publicly traded, says Gurley. They are investing sums of money usually reserved for IPO offerings and, sometimes, giving away those dollars with the kind of confidence usually associated with investors who've perused regulatory filings for detailed financial information. The investors themselves are a blend of traditional venture-capital players and typically public-market investors: hedge funds, mutual funds and banks. They are sort of meeting in the middle, with the venture capitalists investing in later-stage companies than they have historically done, through new growth funds, and the institutional investors getting in before the IPO.</p><p>\"We've been calling this the private-IPO slice,\" said David York, managing director of Top Tier Capital Partners, a fund of funds. \"The valuation of risk is a public-market thought process versus a private-market thought process.\"</p><p>Gurley, who has become a vocal critic of irrational behavior in the industry, says he's also very worried about the pile-up in the \"private IPO\" market.</p><p>He's worried that venture capitalists' new bedfellows, such as mutual funds, are too new to venture capital to properly weigh the risks and realize that these billion-dollar companies are not guaranteed home runs.</p><p>\"This replaces the IPO -- but not all these companies are IPO level candidates,\" he said. \"Would you hand a teenager $200,000?\"</p><p>According to data collected by The Journal, of the 29 firms that have invested in five or more current billion-dollar startups, only about half are traditional venture-capital firms. The rest are a mix of institutional investors, such as the Dragoneer Investment Group and Tiger Global Management, and strategic investors, such as Intel and Google. Near the top of the list is Tiger with 12 investments in private billion-dollar companies, and T. Rowe Price Group with 11. In this group, Tiger also raised the most money last year, keying up $4 billion, or 12% of all venture capital raised in 2014.</p><p>With such financial heavyweights jumping in, many of their peers are wondering: Can I afford to sit out?</p><p>It's difficult to quantify exactly how much money is sloshing around at this level. Several top venture capital firms have raised large growth funds in the past few years, but total contributions from hedge funds, mutual funds and banks is practically immeasurable without knowing how much each invested in particular funding rounds. Whatever the amount, this layer of growth capital could warp prices, venture capitalists say.</p><p>\"It's like traffic on the highway, you add just 5% more cars and it slows down traffic considerably,\" said Glenn Solomon, a managing partner at GGV Capital. His firm is an investor in four companies in The Billion Dollar Startup Club.</p><p>In some ways, Gurley's firm has benefited from this influx of pre-IPO capital. His firm is an early investor in four companies in the Billion Dollar Startup Club: Uber, Square, WeWork and Jasper Technologies. All four have since raised money from a big public-market investor.</p><p>But the industry's would-be canary still has a long list of gripes.</p><p>He says he's frustrated that the industry has somewhat forgotten the value of going public, and the protections it provides for both founders and investors. He's also annoyed that a founder pursuing a $40 million IPO offering takes the process more seriously today than a founder raising $400 million in private capital. Unlike some of his peers, he isn't tempted to raise a big growth fund to get into the late-stage action because he has an idea of how that story ends.</p><p>In 1999, Benchmark raised a $900 million fund and it took roughly a decade for the fund to eke out a positive return, he said. In 2006, the firm held an internal meeting and made an explicit decision to only pursue series A and B rounds, the earliest fundraisings of a company. The firm has since pared down its fund size -- last year it raised a $425 million fund. </p><p>In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-UON3190655</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FBS-6F41-J9XT-P3FH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"921\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>February 20, 2015 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000A0L5</classCode><className>SCOTTRADE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

According to Gurley, one man, who represented a large mutual fund, asked, \"You don't want us to invest in this but the big tech stocks are not delivering enough growth and my competitors are getting into these startups, so what are we supposed to do?\"</p><p>Gurley says he didn't have a good answer but he wasn't surprised by the sentiment, which he describes as FOMO, a slang popular among millennials that stands for \"fear of missing out.\"</p><p>It is this infectious FOMO, according to Gurley and other venture capitalists, that has created a flotilla of billion-dollar startups with ever-soaring valuations and mixed financials.</p><p>According to The Wall Street Journal's Billion Dollar Startup Club, there are now at least 73 private technology companies worth more than $1 billion dollars, versus 41 a year ago. Some, such as Uber, the $41.2 billion car hailing app backed by Gurley's Benchmark, are worth enormous sums. At least 48 companies were valued at $1 billion or more for the first time, and another 23 members moved up the ranking after raising more money.</p><p>Many investors are treating these 73 companies as if they were publicly traded, says Gurley. They are investing sums of money usually reserved for IPO offerings and, sometimes, giving away those dollars with the kind of confidence usually associated with investors who've perused regulatory filings for detailed financial information. The investors themselves are a blend of traditional venture-capital players and typically public-market investors: hedge funds, mutual funds and banks. They are sort of meeting in the middle, with the venture capitalists investing in later-stage companies than they have historically done, through new growth funds, and the institutional investors getting in before the IPO.</p><p>\"We've been calling this the private-IPO slice,\" said David York, managing director of Top Tier Capital Partners, a fund of funds. \"The valuation of risk is a public-market thought process versus a private-market thought process.\"</p><p>Gurley, who has become a vocal critic of irrational behavior in the industry, says he's also very worried about the pile-up in the \"private IPO\" market.</p><p>He's worried that venture capitalists' new bedfellows, such as mutual funds, are too new to venture capital to properly weigh the risks and realize that these billion-dollar companies are not guaranteed home runs.</p><p>\"This replaces the IPO -- but not all these companies are IPO level candidates,\" he said. \"Would you hand a teenager $200,000?\"</p><p>According to data collected by The Journal, of the 29 firms that have invested in five or more current billion-dollar startups, only about half are traditional venture-capital firms. The rest are a mix of institutional investors, such as the Dragoneer Investment Group and Tiger Global Management, and strategic investors, such as Intel and Google. Near the top of the list is Tiger with 12 investments in private billion-dollar companies, and T. Rowe Price Group with 11. In this group, Tiger also raised the most money last year, keying up $4 billion, or 12% of all venture capital raised in 2014.</p><p>With such financial heavyweights jumping in, many of their peers are wondering: Can I afford to sit out?</p><p>It's difficult to quantify exactly how much money is sloshing around at this level. Several top venture capital firms have raised large growth funds in the past few years, but total contributions from hedge funds, mutual funds and banks is practically immeasurable without knowing how much each invested in particular funding rounds. Whatever the amount, this layer of growth capital could warp prices, venture capitalists say.</p><p>\"It's like traffic on the highway, you add just 5% more cars and it slows down traffic considerably,\" said Glenn Solomon, a managing partner at GGV Capital. His firm is an investor in four companies in The Billion Dollar Startup Club.</p><p>In some ways, Gurley's firm has benefited from this influx of pre-IPO capital. His firm is an early investor in four companies in the Billion Dollar Startup Club: Uber, Square, WeWork and Jasper Technologies. All four have since raised money from a big public-market investor.</p><p>But the industry's would-be canary still has a long list of gripes.</p><p>He says he's frustrated that the industry has somewhat forgotten the value of going public, and the protections it provides for both founders and investors. He's also annoyed that a founder pursuing a $40 million IPO offering takes the process more seriously today than a founder raising $400 million in private capital. Unlike some of his peers, he isn't tempted to raise a big growth fund to get into the late-stage action because he has an idea of how that story ends.</p><p>In 1999, Benchmark raised a $900 million fund and it took roughly a decade for the fund to eke out a positive return, he said. In 2006, the firm held an internal meeting and made an explicit decision to only pursue series A and B rounds, the earliest fundraisings of a company. The firm has since pared down its fund size -- last year it raised a $425 million fund. </p><p>In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmediasolutions.com\">editorial@plusmediasolutions.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-UON3190655</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FX9-GF71-DXCW-D4R9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"921\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>February 20, 2015 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000A0L5</classCode><className>SCOTTRADE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS523930 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

The Democratic Party[3] has not one, but two, major presidential candidates whose campaigns are devoted to taking on billionaire power. And former Vice President Joe Biden[4], the candidate who many well-heeled donors thought would sail to the White House, has shown some signs of weakness.As a result, the superrich residents of moderate-minded coastal communities are starting to panic. They are casting about for last-minute solutions, including a late-in-the-game bid by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and a trial balloon by Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor who's now a Bain Capital executive.'There is great fear among the monied parts of the Democratic Party that this populist insurgency is coming and that when it comes there is going to be a serious regulation of wealth that this country has not seen since the early to mid-'60s,' Gary Gerstle, a professor of U.S. history at the University of Cambridge and author of 'Liberty and Coercion: The Paradox of American Government From the Founding to the Present.' </p><p>'They see a threat to their prerogatives and their wealth that they have not had to deal with under Democrats or Republicans for 60 years. They have a right to be worried.'But the failed attempts by billionaire Jeff Bezos' company to impose its will on municipal elections in Seattle, a city of under 750,000, show how the ultrarich of the Democratic Party might struggle to shape a rowdy, unpredictable 2020 primary fight. A Near-Sweep For The Left In Seattle In late July, with the Seattle City Council's nonpartisan primary elections looming, the city's embattled left found itself on the defensive.Mayor Jenny Durkan, who has adopted an enforcement-heavy approach[5] to the city's homelessness problem since her 2017 election[6], warned residents of Seattle's diverse, working-class southeastern neighborhoods against electing progressive community organizer Tammy Morales to the City Council. 'Another socialist' like Morales, she said in a mass email[7], would 'cause more division in the city.'Morales, who went on to win the city's open 2nd District seat on Tuesday, easily pushed back against the charge, denying that she identifies with the socialist label.But for the city's community of progressive activists, it was a frightening omen that city elections would be dominated by the same homelessness crisis that had provoked a showdown with Amazon and divided them from the institutional left, including elements of organized labor.Then in October, Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, dramatically ramped up the company's involvement in the race and completely changed the dynamic. The company, which calls Seattle home, contributed an additional $1 million[8] to a $2.4 million effort by the Seattle Chamber of Commerce to defeat candidates who had either previously supported raising taxes on big business to address the homeless problem or had not expressly ruled out the idea going forward. Amazon's total contribution to the effort would end up being $1.5 million[9].Two of its biggest targets were Morales and Councilwoman Kshama Sawant, a proud socialist who served as a driving force behind the city's pioneering $15 minimum wage[10] and an effort to raise city revenue to address homelessness through a big-business-focused 'head' tax[11]. (The City Council ended up repealing the tax[12] under intense pressure from Amazon and over Sawant's objections.)The outside threat united the city's normal fractious progressive movement, according to Morales. [Bezos] was very helpful at unifying the left in the city.Seattle City Councilwoman-elect Tammy Morales Bezos 'was very helpful at unifying the left in the city. There was a clear rejection of the narrative coming out of the Chamber,' she said.The races gained national attention when the two populist presidential contenders, Sens. Bernie Sanders[13] (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren[14] (D-Mass.), weighed in in support of the progressives. Sanders even used his text message network to encourage 43,000 Seattleites to vote for the left-leaning candidates.The candidates' involvement 'kept the conversation going in a way that was very helpful,' Morales said.Many of the city's mainstream liberals, who might otherwise be wary of Sawant in particular, felt forced to choose between Amazon and the left. And to Amazon's chagrin, they chose the left, according to Laura Loe, a housing advocate who spoke to many such voters.'There are people who would never vote for a socialist, but they said, 'There was no way I was going to vote for somebody backed by Amazon money,'' recalled Loe, who is also a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.In the end, despite the cash advantage, just two out of the seven[15]City Council candidates whom Amazon backed prevailed; one of them, incumbent Debora Juarez, also received support from organized labor PACs.Markham McIntyre, a spokesman for the Seattle Chamber of Commerce PAC that served as a vehicle for Amazon's money, sounded a conciliatory note when asked about the losses. 'The business community stands ready to work with the new Seattle City Council,' McIntyre said in a statement to Reuters[16]. 'How our local government chooses to partner \u2015 or create division \u2015 matters.' 'Greed And Corruption Undermining Our Democracy' There are shades of the Seattle results in the Democratic presidential primary, in which leading candidates have turned tech executives in general, and Bezos in particular, into the faces of their calls to increase taxes on billionaires and diminish their political influence.Warren's calls to break up Amazon[17] and other large technology firms is perhaps the best-known example. Shortly after announcing her plan to disassemble the conglomerates, she held a rally in Long Island City, the New York neighborhood where local resistance scuttled a plan to build a major Amazon facility there in exchange for big tax breaks.But she has been far from alone in taking on the titans of the technology industry, to say nothing of the broader billionaire class. Sanders held his massive comeback rally[18] in October in Long Island City as well. And in a new 30-second video[19] advertisement his campaign is now airing in Iowa, Sanders says that, although Trump is the 'most corrupt president' in history, the 'greed and corruption undermining our democracy is bigger than one man.' As he says the latter, images of Bezos, oil billionaire Charles Koch and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, a former hedge fund manager, appear on screen. These two wings have existed pretty comfortably, and that comfort is being exposed as extremely uncomfortable.Gary Gerstle, University of Cambridge Andrew Yang, a millionaire entrepreneur whose candidacy is premised on the idea that corporations will be automating millions of jobs in the near future, is joining the populist parade. His first television advertisement \u2015 a 1-minute spot[20] he is spending $1 million to air in Iowa \u2015 features an image of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg as the narrator promises that Yang will create an economy in which 'Big Tech and Wall Street are held accountable.'Even South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has attracted scrutiny for the support he has received from the superrich, including many leading tech executives[21], singles out Amazon for criticism in his stump speech.In a riff on his expansive vision of freedom, Buttigieg draws applause from crowds in Iowa when he says, 'I'm not terribly interested in preserving Amazon's freedom to not pay any income taxes at all.'The responses of some of the country's leading billionaires \u2015 and, not to be excluded, mega-millionaires \u2015 is, as a first resort, to go on television with furrowed brows and denounce the criticism of their power as attacks on the very foundations of the country.Given her high standing in the polls, Warren has been the principal target of their fulminations. Hedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman has delivered the most dramatic performances, tearing up on CNBC[22] as he fretted about what Warren's 2% wealth tax might do to the country.Microsoft founder Bill Gates has expressed similar alarm[23] at Warren's wealth tax, professing he would be willing to pay double his net worth in taxes but not $100 billion. (In fact, a New York Times analysis[24] found that Gates, who is presently worth $97 billion, would still be worth $13.9 billion if Warren's wealth tax had been in place since 1982.)And in a Sunday interview on CBS[25], JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon[26], whose $31 million salary he erroneously claimed he has no say over, asked Warren, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and other progressives not to 'vilify people who worked hard.' The Billionaire Bungle? It's unlikely that the effect of these statements does anything more than strengthen Warren. A majority of Americans think that the government both does too much for wealthy people and should do more to curb income and wealth inequality in the country, according to a YouGov poll commissioned by HuffPost[27] in March. Among Democrats, those figures exceed 80%.One in five Americans and 37% of Democrats think that the existence of billionaires is a 'policy failure,' the same poll found.'Their lack of self-awareness is amazing,' a veteran Democratic campaign strategist, who asked for anonymity for professional reasons, said of the various wealthy businessmen's anti-Warren remarks. 'Do they think that a billionaire going on TV and complaining about how Warren's plans are un-American is going to help their cause? On the contrary, it's like a massive in-kind donation to Warren's campaign every time they do it \u2015 certainly in the primary election but with the general electorate, too.'Will Ritter, a Richmond, Virginia-based Republican ad maker, questioned whether veering too far to the populist left would make it harder for Democrats to appeal to the general electorate.'When the Democrats resort to demagoguery and false promises, they run the risk of not being taken seriously by an educated, moderate voter,' Ritter said.The trouble for the nation's socially liberal superrich people is that they are evidently unconvinced that Biden, or any other of the candidates they consider acceptable, has enough of a shot at winning the Democratic nomination and beating Trump. I find it laughable. ... I don't think anyone thinks the problem is we don't have enough rich people in government.Mike Mikus, Democratic strategist As a result, some billionaires have not been content to throw potshots from the sidelines. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and media mogul who is worth over $52 billion[28], announced last week that he is considering a run[29] for the Democratic presidential nomination. Bezos, the richest man on the planet, reportedly encouraged him[30] to do so.If he entered the race, Bloomberg would have virtually limitless resources to finance his bid, even if he plans to skip the first four[31] primary and caucus states.But the track record of other self-funders currently in the race does not portend well for his chances. Former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, a mega-millionaire financial entrepreneur with business-friendly policies similar to Bloomberg's, failed to qualify for the third debate despite spending nearly $27 million[32] and announcing his candidacy earlier than anyone else.Likewise, billionaire hedge fund manager Tom Steyer, who is running as an anti-establishment progressive and has poured upwards of $47 million[33] into his race, remains mired in single digits in the polls.'I find it laughable,' said Mike Mikus, a Pittsburgh-based Democratic campaign consultant. 'Whether it's a super-liberal Democrat that supports Bernie or a moderate Democrat that supports Biden, I don't think anyone thinks the problem is we don't have enough rich people in government.' A Split In The Democratic Party? But for some billionaires, the stakes of the Democratic presidential primary are about more than just who gets the chance to take on Trump. It's about whether the Democratic Party, an institution that suits many of the wealthy's preferences on so-called social issues related to race and gender, is still a place where they can feel at home \u2015 and exercise influence.Particularly since Bill Clinton's victory in 1992, the Democratic Party has functioned as a home for the multiracial working class alongside a portion of the moderate-minded, wealthy elite. The party's accommodation of not just affluent professionals but also self-styled liberal billionaires was driven partly out of self-interest: National elections require ever-larger sums of money to compete.The 2008 financial crisis and accompanying growth in the income and wealth gaps punctured a hole in that dtente, according to Gerstle of the University of Cambridge.'These two wings have existed pretty comfortably, and that comfort is being exposed as extremely uncomfortable, and so it's going to make the primary season for Democrats, particularly if Bloomberg jumps in the race, really interesting to watch,' Gerstle said.Gerstle likened the rage fueling the current left-populist wave to the disgust with concentrated wealth that last gripped U.S. society during the Gilded Age of the late 19th and early 20th century. The resentment that emerged from those movements fueled the reforms of the Progressive Era and, later on, the New Deal.One difference, he noted, is that the superrich of the present era prefer to display their wealth less ostentatiously, a phenomenon most evident in the casual dress code of tech entrepreneurs and investors concentrated on the West Coast.'Ultimately it's not going to mask their wealth and power, but it did for some time,' Gerstle said.Even if their motives are understandable, though, to some observers, billionaires' apparently indefatigable instinct to pile on against populist Democrats against all evidence of its ineffectiveness is a mystery.For Joe Sanberg, though, a successful investor and progressive activist leaning toward either Sanders or Warren, it is not a surprise. He believes many of his successful peers in the investment world are out of touch not just with workers but also with small-business owners and entrepreneurs outside of the most rarefied enclaves.'It's a lack of perspective,' said Sanberg, an early investor in Blue Apron and co-founder of the socially responsible online banking firm Aspiration. 'It's hard to bring someone out of a narrow perspective just by telling them. You have to get them out of their echo chamber.'Kevin Robillard contributed reporting.

Howard Marks broke down what is behind the stock market's recent rally in his latest published memo[2].The S&amp;#38;P 500[3] was up 50% from its March lows on Friday, driven by overall investor optimism surrounding economic stimulus and the prospect of the development of a successful COVID-19 vaccine.Technology stocks have outperformed this year, even with the economic meltdown and rebound. The Nasdaq has soared to all-time highs[4], driven by record peaks in the share price of companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, and Microsoft[5].Goldman Sachs has predicted the S&amp;#38;P 500 could rise 7%[6] from current levels and hit 3,600 points, if markets price in a \"comparatively more optimistic US GDP forecast.\"Marks, the co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital, said FAAMG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Google) are up 36% this year, against just a 4% rise in the S&amp;#38;P 500.Marks said there are a few reasons there is \"obvious merit\" in the bull argument for Big Tech: They scale more rapidly than large companies in the past, protecting them from business cycle swings.The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated their growth, as they benefit from the massive transition to digital work and learning.Despite regulatory risks, their technological advantages and network effects (value of service dependent on the number of users) give them greater protection against competitors.All 5 companies are sitting on huge cash piles, as their cash holdings exceed debt.High price-to-earnings ratio indicate that investors expect higher earnings. </p><p>Read more:Fred Liu's Hayden Capital has returned more than 100% in 2020. He breaks down the simple strategy he used to pinpoint 2 stocks that grew 10 times within just a few years.[7]\"To be bearish, one has to have a thesis on why they should fall,\" the billionaire investor wrote. \"Or else you would have to bet on the non-tech sectors to decline a great deal and pull down the averages - despite the fact that they're already down a lot.\"A current boost in tech adoption, combined with the Federal Reserve's record-low interest rates, has helped justify the high valuations of tech and software stocks.\"If instead the tech giants were flat against this backdrop - or had just performed in line with the rest of the index - we'd probably say something was wrong,\" Marks said.At the same time, he said the best companies' stocks can become overpriced. Citing examples from 1968, he said both IBM and Xerox were expected to outgrow other companies and prove their resilience during economic cycles, but their shareholders lost all their money five years later.Read more:Goldman Sachs explains the biggest factors that will drive returns in all 11 stock-market sectors amid virus uncertainty \u2014 and lays out how you should position your portfolio in

The sun was shining, a gentle breeze was blowing and, at a Silicon Valley coffee shop, Rep. Ro Khanna was sitting across from one of his many billionaire constituents discussing an uncomfortable subject: the growing unpopularity of billionaires and their giant tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There's some more humility out here,\" said Khanna, a California Democrat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The billionaire on the other side of the table let out a nervous laugh. Chris Larsen was on his third start-up and well on his way to being one of the wealthiest people in the valley, if not the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Realizing people hate your guts has some value,\" he joked.</p><p>For decades, Democrats and Republicans have hailed America's business elite, especially in Silicon Valley, as the country's salvation. The government might be gridlocked, the electorate angry and divided, but America's innovators seemed to promise a relatively pain-free way out of the mess. Their companies produced an endless series of products that kept the U.S. economy churning and its gross domestic product climbing. Their philanthropic efforts were aimed at fixing some of the country's most vexing problems. Government's role was to stay out of the way.</p><p>Now that consensus is shattering. For the first time in decades, capitalism's future is a subject of debate among presidential hopefuls and a source of growing angst for America's business elite. In places such as Silicon Valley, the slopes of Davos, Switzerland, and the halls of Harvard Business School, there is a sense that the kind of capitalism that once made America an economic envy is responsible for the growing inequality and anger that is tearing the country apart.</p><p>On a quiet weekday at a strip-mall coffee shop, the conversation between Khanna and Larsen turned to what went so wrong.</p><p>Americans still loved technology, Khanna said, but too many of them felt locked out of the country's economic future and were looking for someone to blame.</p><p>\"What happened to us?\" he imagined people in these left-behind places asking.</p><p>Part of Khanna's solution was to sign on as co-chair of the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist and independent senator who rose to the national stage by railing against \"the handful of billionaires\" who \"control the economic and political life of this nation,\" and who disproportionately live in Khanna's district.</p><p>The other part of Khanna's solution was to do what he was doing now, talking to billionaire tech executives like Larsen who worried that the current path for both capitalism and Silicon Valley was unsustainable. Boosted by a cryptocurrency spike last year, Larsen's net worth had briefly hit $59 billion (U.S.), making him the fifth-richest person in the world before the currency's value fell.</p><p>Without an intervention, he worried that wealth would continue to pile up in Silicon Valley and anger in the country would continue to grow.</p><p>\"It seems like every company in the world has to be here,\" Larsen said. \"It's just painfully obvious that the blob is getting bigger.\"</p><p>At some point, Larsen and Khanna worried, something was going to break.</p><p>The 2008 financial crisis may have revealed the weaknesses of American capitalism. But it was Donald Trump's election and the pent-up anger it exposed that left America's billionaire class fearful for capitalism's future.</p><p>Khanna was elected in 2016, just as the anxiety started to spread. In Europe, far-right nationalist parties were gaining ground. Closer to home, socialists and Trump-inspired nationalists were winning state and congressional elections.</p><p>Conversations of the sort that Khanna was having with Larsen were now taking place in some of capitalism's most rarefied circles, including Harvard Business School, where last fall Seth Klarman, a highly influential billionaire investor, delivered what he described as a \"plaintive wail\" to the business community to fix capitalism before it was too late.</p><p>The setting was the opening of Klarman Hall, a new $120-million conference centre, built with his family's donation. \"It's a choice to pay people as little as you can or work them as hard as you can,\" he told the audience gathered in the 1,000-seat auditorium. \"It's a choice to maintain pleasant working conditions ... or harsh ones; to offer good benefits or paltry ones.\" If business leaders didn't \"ask hard questions about capitalism,\" he warned that they would be asked by \"ideologues seeking to point fingers, assign blame and make reckless changes to the system.\"</p><p>Six months after that speech, Klarman was struck by how quickly his dire prediction was coming to pass. Leading politicians, such as Trump, Sanders and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, were advocating positions on tariffs, wealth taxes and changes in corporate governance that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.</p><p>Klarman wasn't opposed to more progressive taxation or regulation. But he worried that these new proposals went much too far. \"I think we're in the middle of a revolution - not a guns revolution - but a revolution where people on both extremes want to blow it up, and good things don't happen to the vast majority of the population in a revolution,\" he said.</p><p>He wasn't the only one who felt a sense of alarm. One of the most popular classes at Harvard Business School, home to the next generation of Fortune 500 executives, was a class on \"reimagining capitalism.\" Seven years ago, the elective started with 28 students. Now there were nearly 300 taking it. During that period, the students had grown increasingly cynical about corporations and the government, said Rebecca Henderson, the Harvard economist who teaches the course.</p><p>\"What the trust surveys say is what I see,\" she said. \"They are really worried about the direction in which the U.S. and the world is heading.\"</p><p>A few dozen of those students spent their winter break reading Winners Take All, a book by Anand Giridharadas, a journalist and former McKinsey consultant, that had hit the bestseller list and was provoking heated arguments in places like Silicon Valley, Davos and Harvard Business School. Giridharadas's book was a withering attack on America's billionaire class and the notion that America's iconic capitalists could use their wealth and creativity to solve big social and economic problems that have eluded a plodding and divided government.</p><p>This spring, Giridharadas took his argument to Klarman Hall. He slammed Mark Zuckerberg, taking aim at the Facebook founder's $100-million effort to fix Newark's faltering schools and his $3-billion push to end disease in a generation. \"I'm glad he's trying to get rid of all the diseases, (but) I wish Facebook wasn't a plague,\" Giridharadas said.</p><p>He trashed Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz's independent presidential run as an effort to protect the interests of the uber-wealthy. And he lambasted the notion, frequently championed by the likes of Bill Gates and Barack Obama, that Silicon Valley's innovations would disrupt old hierarchies and spread capitalism's rewards. \"Really?\" Giridharadas asked. \"Now five companies control America, instead of 100! And a lot of those companies are whiter and more male than the ones they disrupted.\"</p><p>For many of the students, schooled in the notion that business could make a profit while making the world a better place, Giridharadas' ideas were both energizing and disorienting. Erika Uyterhoeven, a second-year student, recalled one of her fellow classmates turning to her when Giridharadas was finished.</p><p>\"So, what should we do?\" her colleague asked. \"Is he saying we shouldn't go into banking or consulting?\"</p><p>Added another student: \"There was a palpable sense of personal desperation.\"</p><p>Khanna experienced a version of this desperation almost every day in his district. He grew up in an overwhelmingly white, middle-class suburb of Philadelphia. After college and Yale Law School, he moved to Silicon Valley in 2003, hoping to use his training as a lawyer to help set the rules for a lawless online world.</p><p>In 2014, backed by the tech community and a long roster of billionaire donors, Khanna challenged an eight-term incumbent in a Democratic primary and lost. The defeat caused him to reflect on what he had missed - in particular, the problems that runaway capitalism were causing in his district, where the median home value in formerly blue-collar cities surged past $2 million.</p><p>\"The best thing that happened to me was that I lost my 2014 election,\" he said. \"Had I won ... maybe I would've been a traditional neo-liberal. It really forced my self-reflection and it pointed out every weakness I ever had.\"</p><p>In California, Khanna's home is a small apartment around the corner from a Dollar Tree, one of only two in his district. His wife and two children live most of the year in Washington, where home values are cheaper.</p><p>His days are split between meetings with billionaires and his many constituents who are struggling to stay afloat amid Silicon Valley's success. \"I am an 11-year renter with a master's degree,\" a teacher told him at a meeting with school employees. Her question wasn't about whether she would ever be able to afford a home, but about a fellow teacher who couldn't afford health insurance.</p><p>A few days earlier, he had met with two activists who wanted his help pressuring big tech companies to pay contract janitorial and cafeteria workers a living wage. Khanna agreed to host a press event on their behalf.</p><p>The billionaires in Khanna's district, meanwhile, were consumed by a different worry. Mixed in with the valley's usual frothy optimism about disruption and inventing the future was a growing sense that the tech economy had somehow broken capitalism. The digital revolution had allowed tech entrepreneurs to build massive global companies without the big job-producing factories or large workforces of the industrial era. The result was more and more wealth concentrated in fewer hands.</p><p>As technology advanced, some feared things were only going to get worse. Robots were eliminating much factory work, online commerce was decimating retail and self-driving cars were on the verge of phasing out truck drivers. The next step was computers that could learn and think.</p><p>\"What happens if you can actually automate all human intellectual labour?\" said Greg Brockman, chair of OpenAI, a company backed by several Silicon Valley billionaires. Such thinking computers might be able to diagnose diseases better than doctors by drawing on superhuman amounts of clinical research, said Brockman, 30. They could displace a large number of office jobs. Eventually, he said, the job shortages would force the government to pay people to pursue their passions or simply live.</p><p>Only Andrew Yang, a long-shot presidential candidate and tech entrepreneur, supported the idea of government paying citizens a regular income. But the idea of a \"universal basic income\" was discussed regularly in the valley.</p><p>The prospect was both energizing and terrifying. OpenAI had recently added an ethicist - Brockman sometimes referred to her as a \"philosopher\" - to its staff of about 100 employees to help sort through the implications of its innovations.</p><p>To Brockman, a future without work seemed just as likely as one without meat, a possibility that many in the valley viewed as a near certainty. \"Once we have meat substitutes as good as the real thing, my expectation is that we're going to look back at eating meat as this terrible, immoral thing,\" he said.</p><p>The same could be true of work in a future era of advanced artificial intelligence. \"We'll look back and say, 'Wow, that was so crazy and almost immoral that people were forced to go and labour in order to be able to survive,' \" he said.</p><p>Khanna heard such prophecies all the time but mostly discounted them as sci-fi fantasy. His focus was on fixing the version of capitalism that existed today. He often pleaded with big tech executives to spend just 10 per cent of their time thinking about what they could do for their country and 90 per cent to their companies.</p><p>The tougher question was exactly what he wanted them to do with that 10 per cent.</p><p>On a warm spring evening, Khanna was trying to answer that question for about two dozen Silicon Valley tech executives, software engineers and venture capitalists. The group gathered at a $5-million Mediterranean-style villa perched atop a hill overlooking Cupertino, which glittered in the valley below.</p><p>Khanna described a December trip he organized to tiny Jefferson, Iowa, for a group of tech executives that included Microsoft's chief technology officer and a LinkedIn co-founder. The executives donated to the community college's scholarship fund and paid to equip its computer lab with the goal of training 25 to 35 students for software developer jobs, starting at $65,000 a year.</p><p>Khanna had made similar trips to West Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky. The total number of jobs these trips produced was small, and the pay wasn't great. Still, Khanna believed they served a larger purpose. They proved that people in Silicon Valley cared about places like Jefferson, a rural town of only 4,200. They gave people hope that even the remotest parts of the U.S. could take part in the country's tech revolution.</p><p>The next step, Khanna told the executives at the mansion in Cupertino, Calif., was a $100-million effort to build 50 technology institutes, similar to land-grant colleges, to train workers in left-behind parts of the U.S. Khanna had already introduced a bill that he admitted was unlikely to pass. But that wasn't really the point. \"It sets a blueprint,\" he said.</p><p>Khanna's blueprint reflected his broader view of how to unite an increasingly polarized country. Many Democrats blamed Trump's victory and the country's divisions on racial tensions as the nation grew more diverse and whites lost their favoured positions.</p><p>Khanna had a different view. He saw the country's problems primarily as the product of growing income inequality and a lack of opportunity.</p><p>Sometimes Khanna imagined what people in these left-behind parts of the country were thinking: their grandparents had fought in the Second World War and helped build the country's industrial-age economy. Now, they worried people like Khanna, whose parents emigrated from India, were surging past them.</p><p>\"They just got here, and they are doing really, really well,\" Khanna imagined these people saying. \"What happened to us?\"</p><p>Not everyone at the tech gathering was buying Khanna's analysis.</p><p>Atam Rao, a nuclear engineer, told Khanna that he had come to the United States from India 50 years earlier. Rao's son, who founded a successful video-game company in Los Angeles, was born in the U.S. The day after Trump was elected, his son suggested shifting some money to a bank account in India, just in case they needed to return someday.</p><p>\"Are we welcome here?\" he said his son asked.</p><p>He believed that Khanna was underestimating the racial anger in the country.</p><p>\"They found someone to blame,\" Rao said of Trump and his backers. \"This is not going to be won by logic.\"</p><p>But that wasn't the America Khanna knew. It didn't fit with his experience growing up in suburban Philadelphia or arriving in Silicon Valley, where Indians had become rock stars and CEOs of companies such as Google. And it didn't comport with the results of the 2018 election, he said, now speaking directly to Rao.</p><p>\"The same country that elected Trump just elected the most diverse Congress in the country's history,\" Khanna said.</p><p>Khanna didn't deny the problem of racism, but like Sanders he saw the country's divisions primarily through the prism of capitalism's shortcomings and the economy, not race.</p><p>A few days after the meeting at the Cupertino mansion, Khanna was standing in front of 16,000 amped-up Sanders supporters. The San Francisco skyline rose in front of him and the Golden Gate Bridge spanned the bay behind him.</p><p>In his grey suit and pressed white shirt, the two-term congressman looked a bit out of place - an emissary from establishment Washington crashing someone else's revolution. Khanna gave a brief speech introducing Sanders, who a few minutes later rushed onto the stage and into the same campaign spiel he had been delivering since the 2016 Democratic primaries.</p><p>He bashed the billionaire class and its influence over American elections. \"Democracy means one person, one vote, and not billionaires buying elections,\" Sanders yelled in his Brooklyn growl.</p><p>\"We say no to oligarchy,\" he continued. \"Yes to democracy.\"</p><p>Khanna's eyes fixed on Steve Spinner, a big tech investor in Silicon Valley and major fundraiser for Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. Spinner, who chaired Khanna's congressional win, was listening with his arms folded across his fleece vest.</p><p>\"We dragged him out here,\" Khanna said. \"He's about as far from Bernie as you can get.\"</p><p>Many of Khanna's billionaire supporters - even those who worried about capitalism and inequality - seemed genuinely puzzled by Khanna's affection for Sanders.</p><p>For Khanna, it was simple. In Sanders, Khanna found a candidate who shared his diagnosis of the country's most vexing problems: inequality and the failures of unrestrained capitalism.</p><p>Sanders wasn't a perfect match for Khanna. Sanders didn't really understand the tech industry - though he wasn't calling for the breakup of big tech companies like Warren and some other candidates. Warren's proposal, if executed, would hurt companies in Khanna's district and alienate some of his wealthiest backers.</p><p>Khanna wished Sanders would talk more about the greatness of the American economy and the power of the tech industry, when properly taxed and regulated, to lift people out of poverty. But on that score, Khanna believed he could help Sanders.</p><p>\"We can quibble over his plans to solve this issue or that issue,\" Khanna said. \"But I have no doubt that if Bernie Sanders was in the White House, he'd wake up every day thinking, 'How do I solve structural inequality in America?' \"</p><p>The 77-year-old socialist's speech had passed the one-hour mark and the crowd was still laughing, cheering, hooting and shouting.</p><p>\"We're probably not going to get a lot of support from the 1 per cent and the large profitable corporations,\" Sanders said.</p><p>A voice in the crowd screamed an expletive. \"That's OK,\" Sanders continued, \"I don't need, and we don't want, their support.\"</p><p>The congressman in the grey suit gazed out at the crowd, which stretched to the back of the park. Khanna saw Sanders's revolution as an imperfect solution to a near-impossible problem. For now, though, it was the best he could find.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019052654508859</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W6C-FT11-JBTY-W2HT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3083\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 26, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

He said tech companies have lost the public's trust because they've adapted poorly to rapid growth, and need to stop being naive or stubborn. He does not believe that increased government regulation is a quick fix, because the companies in question grow too quickly. This article is part of Business Insider's ongoing series on Better Capitalism[3]. Americans are living in a New Gilded Age[4], where the level of wealth inequality and concentration of power in the elite class is bigger than it's been since the late 19th century. But instead of oil, steel, and railroad tycoons reshaping society, we've got tech giants like Facebook and Google. </p><p>Over the past couple years, we've had both democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and Republican President Donald Trump question the legal legitimacy of trillion-dollar Amazon's size, and both Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz[5] and 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren call for the country to update its antitrust laws. Also during this time, Facebook has led the pack regarding stories of personal data breaches. The tech giant has faced investigations regarding the way it was used to potentially affect the course of the 2016 US presidential election and bolster the Myanmar government's attacks[6] on the Rohingya Muslim minority. For millions of Americans, Silicon Valley is no longer the land of startups looking to save the world, but a collection of companies that, even if they still had the best of intentions, are too big to avoid making a mess. LinkedIn cofounder and Greylock Partners investor Reid Hoffman has long been one of the Valley's power brokers, and he hasn't lost faith yet \u2014 but he recognizes that big tech players need to reconsider their place in the world and make changes that regain the public's trust. For Hoffman, it's not the size of these companies that is inherently bad, but the fact that these companies are in new territory. Without naming specific companies, Hoffman and his coauthor Chris Yeh wrote in his 2018 book \"Blitzscaling[7]\" \u2014 titled after the term he coined for the process of rapid, exponential growth through the uncertainty that the Valley is best known for \u2014 that \"blitzscaling companies grow so quickly that they often become key players in society before they've had time to fully mature.\" He's hopeful, however, that today's giants can correct for the ensuing mistakes and can then further serve as models for future \"blitzscaling\" companies, which he predicts will occur across industries well beyond tech.Determining a massive company's role in societyTo start, Hoffman rejected the idea that size (essentially revenue and employees) is either equivalent to a monopoly or is automatically bad. He also said that it is not useful to compare the trusts of the first Gilded Age with today's giants. Read more: Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz says the US has a major monopoly problem[8] \"Consumers had no alternatives and were forced to do business with them,\" he wrote. \"In contrast, companies like Apple and Amazon have to win their customers every day, and if they fail to do so, those consumers can simply buy Dell laptops and order books from Barnes ...ble.\" There are even benefits to the size of blitzscalers, he wrote, saying that it allows companies like Google to take on \"moonshots,\" expensive and highly ambitious projects, such as the autonomous vehicle experiment-turned-subsidiary Waymo. That said, Hoffman said that rapidly scaling companies can no longer be naive or obstinate about recognizing the impact they have on the world: \"Responsible blitzscaling matters because successful blitzscalers often reach a point where they are more than just a business; they actually affect the fabric of society in which they operate.\" For example, Facebook has changed the way more than 2 billion people around the world communicate and process information.Where regulation fits inAs mentioned earlier, there's a renewed interest in antitrust law in the US, which would potentially require tech giants to spin off large subsidiaries, and a general call for regulation. In his book, Hoffman made clear that he does not think having the government enforce more regulations is an easy fix. Writing about the way Russian hackers used Facebook as part of a plot to sway the American presidential election, Hoffman said, \"the default impulse is often to call for the creation of a new regulatory agency, but government regulation alone has proven too slow to keep up with the rapid changes of blitzscaling. At the same time, pure self-regulation hasn't proven sufficient. What's needed is a dynamic public/private partnership where government input meshes with private implementation.\"Identifying and fixing problemsA problem a blitzscaler is facing doesn't necessarily have to do with global politics, of course, but could also be something like a lack of diversity among employees that creates blind spots \u2014 an actual problem many tech giants that grew rapidly have today. Startups or firms with aspirations of rapidly becoming a company with thousands of employees and millions of users or customers, Hoffman said, require a bit of fake-it-til-you-make-it imprinted in the company's mission and culture: \"You should imagine a future in which the company has succeeded in becoming a global giant, and then evaluate the likely impact of that success on your key stakeholders and on society as a whole.\" This should be an exercise that grows increasingly less theoretical and more grounded in actual data as the company grows. Read more: LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman shares his secret for fast growth and getting ahead of the competition[9] And for both the rising blitzscalers and those that are already giant, special attention must be paid to systemic problems, Hoffman said. There must be a sensitivity to issues that threaten the survival of the company or could one day lead to it. He used the example of how Airbnb responded to an incident in 2011 where a guest trashed and stole from a host's home. The company initially compensated the host and worked with police but saw the backlash to its case-by-case policy. CEO and cofounder Brian Chesky then stepped in to issue a public apology and institute a new $50,000 insurance policy for every host.A warning from ReidHoffman wants tech giants, as well as future blitzscalers, to be open to working with the government and not act on hubris. But he emphatically wants to avoid a new age of sweeping regulations that would impact Silicon Valley. \"Slowing things down might make you feel more comfortable, but it comes at the cost of allowing competitors from other areas to gain lasting dominance of the global market,\" he wrote, referring to companies from nations like China. The mistakes made by tech companies that went from startups to monoliths faster than any other firms in history have already led to increased scrutiny. Hoffman hopes that scrutiny leads to a changing of norms before government forces them to transform. Hoffman's theory of blitzscaling has five stages, with the final two stages being City (thousands of employees) and Nation (tens of thousands of employees and beyond). \"Like it or not,\" he wrote, \"when your company is a City or a Nation, you need to start thinking like a mayor or a president and set rules for the good of humanity as a whole rather than just for the good of your profits.\"NOW

Eating a delicious bacon sandwich means clearing the mental hurdle of dirty slaughterhouses, battery farming, and dehydrated pigs transported great distances in crammed trucks. So if we manage that, why would we balk at the idea of lab-grown meat, made without killing a single animal?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After all a lab burger, the journalist Chase Purdy argues, is made from the same basic stuff as the real thing: animal muscle cells. With a few tweaks - added fat cells, \"scaffolding\" to imitate the stringy texture of meat - the taste and feel can be indistinguishable. And there are huge potential benefits. The meat industry slaughters billions of animals every year and causes 14 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Cultured meat could mean an end to food poisoning too: the salmonella and </p><p>                   E. coli                   </p><p> that breed in filthy abattoirs don't stand a chance in a sterile lab. Then there is the fact that climate change is threatening global food production. Lab-grown meat could make up the difference.</p><p>So where's the problem? Following various \"meat technology\" start-ups as they beaver away in the lab and race to get their products on plates, Purdy identifies three main obstacles.</p><p>One is psychological. Offered some lab-grown p\u00e2t\u00e9, Purdy can only think: \"Cells!\" It tastes right, though, and he has a second helping. The name is key; the start-ups try different labels, such as \"in vitro meat\", \"cultured meat\", \"cell-based meat\", before eventually settling on \"clean meat\", in a bid to appeal to customers. Yet that inflames an existing war with the meat industry, which understandably dislikes the implication its product is dirty. Neither does \"clean meat\" always translate well. In Dutch, a clean-meat activist says, it implies the food has been run through detergent.</p><p>Then there are some of the more enthusiastic \"clean meat\" activists. One, Koert van Mensvoort, has written a theoretical cookbook that features a recipe for \"roast raptor\", \"knitted\" meat and see-through sashimi. Among the most off-putting recipes is meat you can grow on your own skin. One particularly grim illustration shows whisky-soaked meat cubes, each labelled with a photos of pop icons such as Kanye West and Miley Cyrus. In this scenario the cubes have been grown from their stem cells.</p><p>Those creepy concoctions aside, soothing fears will require providing the public with more information. For instance, meat start-ups are secretive about what exactly is in their \"vat fluid\" in which the growing mass of cells float. This once consisted of serum drawn from foetal cows, which was vastly expensive (and unethical). Now it is plant-based - but without a recipe, customers may be hard to reassure.</p><p>Should customers \"get past the whole thought of it all\", as Purdy's sceptical aunt puts it, there is the second big obstacle: price. The first lab-grown burger, produced in 2013, was estimated to have cost $330,000 - 1lb of that beef would be $1.2 billion. But the price is falling fast. In early 2019 an Israel-based company said it had got in vitro beef down to $100 a pound. By 2022, it claims, the price will have dropped to $10 a pound.</p><p>A third barrier, Purdy says, is the \"difficult regulatory environment\" influenced by the traditional meat industry. Meat lobbyists have their own name for the vat-grown product - \"fake meat\" - and have petitioned to narrow the definition of \"meat\" to exclude it. Yet history is on the side of the outsiders. Furious lobbying by the butter industry in the late 19th century could not stop the march of margarine (even though it was restricted in 24 US states and in five had to be dyed pink). Egg companies lost their battle to squash eggless mayonnaise. Attempts by the dairy industry to stop plant-based milks using the word \"milk\" on their packaging have failed.</p><p>Purdy spends rather too long on the minutiae of the various regulatory battles, but the rest of the book bounces along, helped by accounts of his encounters with the food tech business. Purdy's character sketch of Josh Tetrick - lab meat's own Steve Jobs - is a particular treat. Purdy admires him, but Tetrick's employees do not always agree. \"Lying, manipulative, thin-skinned, attention-seeking, reactionary, incompetent,\" was one description of his management style.</p><p>Purdy leaves the reader clear about what will happen next. Clean meat is coming; it cannot be stopped because there is \"too much money, science and willpower pushing it into the market\". Indeed, some meat companies are switching sides and investing in their diminutive rivals, and rebranding as \"protein companies\". In Israel, where limited land and water to grow food are extra incentives, the technology is shooting ahead. One company, Aleph Farms, is growing meat with a vascular system - ready, it claims, in 2023.</p><p>That shouldn't surprise those who have been paying attention. In 1932 Churchill wrote \"fifty years hence, we shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium\". We may not be far off.</p><p>                   Billion Dollar Burger: Inside Big Tech's Race for the Future of Food                   Billion Dollar Burger: Inside Big Tech's Race for the Future of Food                   </p><p>                   by Chase Purdy, Piatkus, 272pp;

By Chase Purdy. June 2020. 272p. Penguin/Portfolio, $28 (9780525536949). 641.</p><p>Journalist Purdy traces the cell-cultured meat industry through the perspectives of key players: scientists, activists, lobbyists, entrepreneurs, and government regulators. For decades, the multi-billion-dollar meat industry has raised concerns related to environmental hazards. Purdy explores the development, challenges, and opportunities of cell-cultured meat, which is lab-grown using cells from live animals, and why this process can be a costly and complex venture. Taking readers from Silicon Valley to Hong Kong to Israel, Purdy brings a global perspective on how individuals and organizations are working to monitor, scale, and sustain this industry. Throughout the book, Purdy cites business reports and agricultural statistics to provide a greater context of these industries and draws on his conversations with important stakeholders, sharing their takes on cell-cultured meat. Readers interested in the restaurant and food industries, environmental economics, and food technology may find this fascinating and relevant to timely issues like environmental sustainability and global food systems.--Raymond Pun</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-627001251</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 627001251</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607W-RN51-JCBJ-K3JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"211\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 American Library Association</copyright><publicationName>Booklist</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0006-7385</issn><volume>Vol. 116</volume><issueNumber>No. 18\"</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 15, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Book review</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Publishing industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Billion Dollar Burger</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Inside Big Tech's Race for the Future of Food (Nonfiction work)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Books</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000199</classCode><className>BOOK REVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DHZK</classCode><className>FOOD SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

Image Credit: A T. Bustamante</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trust in advertising has plummeted to an all-time low \u2014 in the UK just 25 per cent think favourably of it against 40 per cent who thought so a few years ago. In spite of adtech's enhanced capabilities offering higher transparency and effectiveness in KPI measurement, the advent of digital has actually deteriorated people's trust.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Who is to blame for the widening trust deficit in an industry that is supposed to build consumers' trust in brands? Could this oxymoron be the fault of the monopolies that control the gigantic volume of digital ad spend? Or is it perhaps due to the advertisers' desire to cut costs, who without much thinking decided to reduce or even completely eradicate advertising budgets previously allocated for brand visibility in print and broadcast media and instead take to Facebook, YouTube and Google?</p><p>And what about the role of the advertising agencies themselves? Were they perhaps too quick, too eager and too willing to convince their clients that this is where the future lies?</p><p>Well, before we take out our crystal ball to see what the future of advertising might looks like, let's just take a closer look at what the situation is today.</p><p>Regulatory push back</p><p>In January last year, Google was fined $57 million under European Union's Data Privacy Law for not properly disclosing to users how data is collected across its services to present personalised ads. In March this year, the Swedish Data Protection Authority imposed a fine of 7 million euros on Google for failure to comply with the GDPR. Also, YouTube was fined $170 million to settle allegations that it collected children's personal data without their parents' consent.</p><p>Google wasn't the only one</p><p>Last year, Facebook was fined $5 billion after violating a 2012 consent order related to user privacy. In 2018, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office announced it intended to fine Facebook $663,000 over the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, this being the maximum fine allowed at the time of the breach, saying Facebook \"contravened the law by failing to safeguard people's information\".</p><p>Ever since the early days of the advent of digital advertising, trust in it was already corroding. It is now more than four years since Facebook said it had inflated the average time people spent watching video ads in the social media giant's attempt to attract more ad spend from brands wishing to increase sales and acquire market share by selling dreams and promises, or by conmen committing daylight robberies through fake ad campaigns.</p><p>Even that new-kid-on-the-block, TikTok, was fined $5.7 million in February last year for illegally collecting children's data. Meanwhile, the US Army and Navy late last year banned the use of TikTok on government-issued phones on the grounds that the service is considered a cyber threat.</p><p>So, this is where we are today: Constant breaches of data privacy have become common play, fake ads flood the ecosystem unchecked, false claims about capabilities and performance are rife and cyber threat suspicions are rife.</p><p>Raking it in</p><p>Yet, and in spite of all the criticism by industry bodies and heavy fines imposed on by regulators, Big Tech happily picks up the tab and continues with business as usual, unchallenged and undeterred.</p><p>And why is that? Because in 2019, Facebook made $69.7 billion in advertising revenue, about 98.5 per cent of its total global revenue, and the same year, Google's ad revenue amounted to $134.81 billion. Add the two and the total amount equals the GDP of New Zealand ... and higher than 135 other countries.</p><p>Thankfully, industry watchdogs are now taking a closer look at the wrongdoings. The UK's data protection regulator said in January that it would start investigating individual companies in the UK's \u00a313 billion online advertising industry, after it found widespread problems with personal data being shared illegally.</p><p>Ireland's data protection authority is investigating whether Google is illegally accessing information about people who use its services. And according to recent reports, the US Justice Department is drafting a lawsuit against Google owner Alphabet, accusing it of violating antitrust laws. Google's digital ads are at the centre of the investigation, as well as search and mobile software.</p><p>A new reality</p><p>Media spotlight and public scrutiny on Big Tech is likely to also intensify, further eroding any fragments of reputational capital still surrounding the colourful logos of the internet economy's powerhouses. In a post-pandemic world, where millions have lost their jobs or seen their salaries drastically cut, and where personal data is being used to track population movement, malpractices by corporates will be examined under the magnifying glass of an increasingly disillusioned public opinion.</p><p>Reduced trust in Big Tech will further increase mistrust in online advertising. In turn, this may eventually usher us into an era of growing advertising revenues for traditional print and broadcast media segments, which have been haemorrhaging ad revenues for years, leading many to extinctions, others to mere existence.</p><p>Data is the new oil fuelling the unprecedented growth of Big Tech for quite some time now. But the longer you leave that oil unrefined and stored in shaky structures, the longer you allow it to concentrate in the hands of a couple magnates, the more likely it is to leak and cause untold damage.</p><p>And we all know the havoc an unchecked oil leak can wreak on humanity.</p><p>George Kotsolios is Managing Partner at Leidar MENA and author of \"Back to the Future of Marketing: Provolve or Perish\".

Over the course of six-hours, US congressmen in an anti-trust sub-committee grilled the $4.5 trillion industry\u2019s elite chiefs. The tech sector, it was argued, had become too powerful, wielding its dominance against rivals, occasionally against its very own consumers and now frequently, against democracy itself as algorithms amplified political echo chambers and biases.    \u201cOur goal is (to be) the best, not the most. Apple does not have a dominant share in any market or any product category where we do business\u201d \u2013 Tim Cook to US congress    Credit: Visual Capitalist    Indeed, the Big Five Tech companies generate $900 billion, rivalling the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of countries like Netherlands and even oil-rich Saudi Arabia. Four out of five of Big Tech companies have achieved trillion-dollar market capitalisations, eclipsing Big Oil and other major industry groups to comprise some of the most valuable publicly-traded companies in the world.       With the global coronavirus pandemic, these valuations are set to rocket as digital disruption becomes the new normal. But early Thursday morning, 13 August, the Big Tech cash grab grew heated as Epic Games, maker of the popular billion dollar game- Fortnite , provoked a ban from tech giants Apple and Google in apparent violation of respective App store policies concerning in-app transactions, and in response, a lawsuit from the game developer.    These Fortnite skins are typically priced between $13 and $18 and nothing is known about Nike\u2019s revenue split with Epic Games but what is known, is that Big Tech like Apple and Google want their 30% cut of the sale of digital fashion and accessories via in-app transactions.    In normal times, greater technological adoption is the biggest driver of increased revenues. During a pandemic, in-home quarantine has sent the tech sector into overdrive as people were forced to live in a combination of virtual and physical environments. Pre-pandemic, Epic Games banked a cool $3 billion in 2018 on the back of Fortnite, an online survival video game where 100 players fight against each other in player versus player combat to be the last one standing. Fast-paced, action-packed, and not unlike The Hunger Games, it looks like real life is about to mirror the game\u2019s Battle Royale mode as tech conglomerates find new ways to earn a larger slice of the pie for themselves.    It\u2019s not hyperbole either, if the idea of an in-game Travis Scott concert might seem silly, the 12.3 million Fortnite players who attended the extravaganza in game proves that the game is more than virtual.    [embedded content]    Fortnite\u2019s app has been downloaded more than 133 million times on iPhones and iPads and brought in roughly $1.2 billion, and Apple has taken $360 million of that revenue as part of its commission \u2013 Sensor Tower on how lucrative Fortnite has been for Epic Games and Apple    Fortnite is free to play but makes money selling digital items like virtual clothing or \u201cskins\u201d. Pre-pandemic, Nike\u2019s Jordan brand teamed with the massively popular online game to show off some of the brand\u2019s signature sneakers. The #FortniteXJumpman collaboration saw two new limited edition skins for characters, wearing streetwear icon Nike Air Force 1s in a variety of colours including the signature black and red Chicago Bull\u2019s colour scheme. These Fortnite skins are typically priced between $13 and $18 and nothing is known about Nike\u2019s revenue split with Epic Games but what is known, is that Big Tech like Apple and Google want their 30% cut of the sale via in-app transactions.       It\u2019s hard to imagine but as late as August 2019, many fashion retailer senior executives were still confused as to why anyone would pay real money for virtual garments and accessories. Speaking with CNBC, Scandinavian fashion retailer Carlings approached Virtue, the creative agency owned by Vice media, to do something that would draw people to its website. Virtue pitched an idea inspired by games like \u2018Fortnite\u2019 and the concept of \u201cvirtual skinning\u201d, arguing that digital clothing was what you\u2019d have on web shops in the near future. Carlings CEO Ronny Mikalsen called it \u201cthe strangest meeting of my life. I didn\u2019t understand what they were talking about, making a digital collection \u2026 I was like, this can\u2019t be serious.\u201d       Four months later, fashion and cosmetics collaborations have hit the online gaming scene in a big way, looking for new audiences in a US$152 billion market. Earlier this year, Louis Vuitton teamed up with Riot Games to create a series of digital \u201cskins\u201d for characters in League of Legends as well as capsule collections that can be worn in real life.    Louis Vuitton\u2019s capsule collections for League of Legends including clothing and accessories which included a US$5,600 leather jacket designed by Louis Vuitton\u2019s artistic director of women\u2019s collections Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re each item possessed \u201cunique and original references true to the universes of League of Legends.\u201d       According to analytics firm Newzoo, China and the Asia-Pacific market is particularly important \u2013 in 2018, China\u2019s online gaming population (which includes mobile gamers) was made up of nearly half a billion players, with women making up more than half of this market. They also  forecasted over $40 billion in virtual gaming revenue in China.   The Pandemic makes Digital Disruption the New Normal: Nike, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Valentino are some of the new players   When the global pandemic hit and the subsequent national lockdown measures took place, the virtual environments of these online games became fashion\u2019s new battlegrounds. Free of the COVID-19, masses including A-list celebrities like Chrissy Teigen and Brie Larson have called the online world of Animal Crossing home. Such is the game\u2019s popularity that the Nintendo Switch handheld console on which it is played, has remained sold out since lockdowns began rolling out in March.    Valentino in Animal Crossing    Locked in and with no avenues to \u2018peacock\u2019 their style, sartorially minded players have taken to designing clothes for their Animal Crossing avatars, recreating high fashion and streetwear looks. At first, a majority of these virtual garments were re-created by virtual wardrobes with the creations on Animal Crossing Fashion Archive, which is run by fashion photographer and visual artist, Kara Chung. Painstakingly, Chung\u2019s Animal Crossing Fashion Archive became a source for players to don the hippest designs from Chanel, Dior, and old Celine.    Anna Sui in Animal Crossing    From virtual rip-offs to collaboration, luxury fashion brands like Marc Jacobs, Valentino and Anna Sui have gotten in on the action, allowing players to dress their characters in any item from Marc Jacobs\u2019 Animal Crossing capsule, or choose from a selection of looks.Valentino also digitised Spring/Summer 2020 and Pre-Fall 2020 collections, players can also don Moncler\u2019s puffer jackets virtually, while these fashion offerings are entirely free, the lawsuit between Fortnite creator Epic Games and Apple and Google, will shape the future of digital luxury fashion.       Marc Jacobs         Fortnite\u2019s in-game clothes have also become a status symbol of sorts among today\u2019s youth. Techspot raised the point that Fortnite is more than a player vs. player competitive title, the game also serves as a digital playground and a place to hang out and socialise with peers. As is the case with real-world playgrounds, Fortnite\u2019s digital space is ripe with bullies. And just like in the real world, one\u2019s outward appearance can be a prime target for teasing : A \u201cdefault\u201d character outfit can attract bullying, leading many to believe that having individualised in-game costume is a form of \u201cstreet-cred\u201d among pre-teens and Gen Z. Hence, fashion as a tool for expression is as vital in the virtual world as it is in the real world.    Louis Vuitton League of Legends capsule collection was available both online and offline   David versus Goliath: Epic Games versus Apple   According to Tech Crunch, Epic Games never had a problem making money. Their first game, Gear of Wars grossed $100 million on a $12 million development budget. But with Fortnite, the company redefined modern gaming by making true cross-platform experiences possible and by pulling in vast amounts of money . Epic Games is privately held and hence keeps its financials closely guarded.    Sensor Tower, a tech blog tracking the global app economy, discerned that players spent an average of $1.23 million per day in the iOS version of Fortnite in 2018, contributing a total of approximately $37 million to the game\u2019s life-to-date gross of more than $385 million. Fortnite\u2019s sixth season began in September 2018, bringing in an estimated $17.6 million in its first week on Apple\u2019s platform, an increase of 41% over the previous week. When player spending surged past the $1 billion mark amid the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, it was immediately clear to Big Tech what was at stake when Epic Games started encouraging Fortnite\u2019s mobile-app users to pay it directly, rather than through Apple or Google. The companies require that all in-app payments are handled through their eco-systems so they can collect a 30% commission, a policy that has been at the center of antitrust complaints against the companies.       According to Sensor Tower, Fortnite\u2019s app has been downloaded more than 133 million times on iPhones and iPads and brought in roughly $1.2 billion, and Apple has taken $360 million of that revenue as part of its commission, call us cynical, but it\u2019s easy to see why the Cupertino brand wouldn\u2019t give that up without a fight.    It was a war that Epic Games was apparently prepared to wage. Just after the ban, the game developer launched a snarky public relations campaign, lampooning Apple\u2019s famous Orwell 1984 advert from the Cupertino company\u2019s own fight against IBM 36 years ago. This time, it was Fortnite characters who were defying Apple\u2019s totalitarian regime. According to NYT, #FreeFortnite was the top trend on Twitter within hours as Google followed suit and also removed Fortnite from its Android Play app store later that day. That said, the Android eco-system allows for external 3rd party downloads and so, Fortnite still remains available on Android phones, hence the battle between Apple and Epic Games is the one closely watched as it sets a precedent for how brands can potentially interact with their virtual partners for years to come.    [embedded content]    Apple has been subject to anti-competitive investigation by European regulators and the US Justice Department over the last few years following complaints from App developers that Apple is taking an unfair cut of their business and in some instances, competing with their apps with its own offerings. Indeed, Apple has a business philosophy of acquiring small companies that can be easily integrated into existing company projects , in some cases, they would buy up a smaller rival of a dominant software developer and then repackage a competing product as their own.    The services business is Apple\u2019s second largest source of revenue after iPhone sales. Given increasingly competition from the likes of Huawei and Samsung, the $51.7 billion iPhone revenue has been under increasing pressure and so the 30% service commission is a vital component of the world\u2019s most valuable company\u2019s profit and growth machine. While it is clear that the $1.58 trillion company is clearly the Goliath in this fight; Epic, a North Carolina company valued at roughly $17 billion and partially owned by the Chinese internet giant Tencent, is no mere David either.    David, with sword and empty sling, poised above Goliath about to take his head. A statue in the forecourt of Seaton Delaval Hall in Northumberland, England    It appears that the strategy is to sacrifice millions of dollars in revenue in a fight that will keep Fortnite off iPhones but alienate Apple\u2019s core consumers since the game still remains available to Android users who can download it outside the official  Play  store. Fortnite announced more than 350 million registered players in May and if a percentage of those players, suddenly find themselves unable to get updates of their beloved game on iOS, Apple might witness a mass migration to Android devices instead. It\u2019s not just a battle in courts of law but also the court of public opinion.    Epic Games is not the first software company with issues against Apple. Other big players like music streamer Spotify and email app-maker Blix have also made formal complaints to regulators in Europe and the United States.    Beyond how luxury fashion might eventually sell virtual garments in online games like Carlings\u2019 digital collection which starts at $9 for a headband and up to $27 for an oversized shiny nylon puffer jacket,  Forbes senior tech contributor John Koetsier also posits that this is also a war for the future of mobile in-app payments: Will the old-school PC-centric model of a company (Apple or Google) selling a device (laptop) which the customer (you) can install any software you want on from any source win, or will the new-school locked-down one-official-place-to-get-software model win? At stake is likely tens of billions in Apple and Google annual revenue.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42837387234</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KH-24C1-F07F-84SX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2307\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Luxuo.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 14, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Democratic senator described the bill, which targets online data collection, as stronger than the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some privacy advocates applauded the bill, while critics said it could bring significant upheaval to online business models that depend on consumer data.</p><p>Wyden's bill would give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to establish minimum privacy and cybersecurity standards. It would allow the FTC to issue fines of up to 4% of a company's annual revenue on the first offense. Senior executives who lie to the FTC about their data privacy practices would face prison sentences ranging from 10 to 20 years. </p><p>The legislation would also create a national \"do not track\" system that lets consumers prohibit companies from tracking them on the web, selling or sharing their data, or targeting them with advertisements based on their personal information. Companies that wish to offer products and services conditioned on the sale or sharing of consumer data must offer an alternate but similar privacy-friendly version of their product, for which they can charge a reasonable fee. </p><p>Digital privacy expert Attila Tomaschek from the privacy tools review site ProPrivacy.com praised the legislation, saying it's \"pro-consumer.\"</p><p>But the \"do not track\" provision \"would certainly be a hard pill for major tech companies like Facebook and Google to swallow,\" Tomaschek added. \"These companies' business models are naturally based upon data collection and analysis of user activity, so it is undeniable that this legislation would have a negative impact on how big tech businesses operate.\"</p><p>Tomaschek predicted \"aggressive pushback\" from web-based companies, even though trade groups representing them have been silent about Wyden's bill so far. The Internet Association, representing Google, Facebook, Amazon, and eBay, declined to comment on the record.</p><p>The bill adds accountability for privacy violations, said Lecio de Paula Jr., data privacy director at security training vendor KnowBe4.</p><p>\"Many organizations are simply just OK with receiving a fine and a slap on the wrist, which we have seen with the past few FTC fines of the large tech players,\" de Paula said. \"When an executive is held personally accountable, that's when things start to change.\"</p><p>Still, like Tomaschek, de Paula expects some resistance to the legislation. \"The biggest challenge this bill will face is from organizations who are making millions of dollars collecting, using, and selling personal data in a nontransparent manner,\" he said.</p><p>The bill has little chance of passing given that there's not yet a Republican sponsor, said former Republican Rep. Rick Lazio, now serving on the advisory board of management consulting firm Alliantgroup. Instead, Wyden may be laying down a marker for future privacy efforts.</p><p>Lazio isn't a fan of the legislation. \"Much of the bill is punitive as to business,\" he said. \"It would be refreshing if the government model was to help the private sector protect themselves and consumers through grants, partnerships, and information sharing rather than simply proposing fines and penalties.\"</p><p>Some privacy advocates noted the Wyden bill doesn't preempt state privacy laws, meaning states would be free to pass stricter legislation. Many Republicans in Congress have pushed for a national law that would preempt wide-ranging state privacy regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, which goes into effect next year.</p><p>It's time for Congress to pass a privacy law with teeth, some privacy advocates said.</p><p>\"Big tech companies get caught red-handed violating user privacy time and time again, proving that stronger deterrents are needed,\" said Harold Li, vice president at ExpressVPN. \"Users should be in the driver's seat when it comes to control of their personal data.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2308429175</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBY-CT01-DY0W-40HV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"674\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

FBI officials have warned of \"going dark\" in investigating crimes as a result of new forms of end-to-end encryption, while civil rights advocates warn that any \"backdoor\" access could be exploited by hackers and authoritarian governments.</p><p>The proposal \"aims to kneecap encryption under the guise of protecting children online, while capitalizing on the  techlash,\" said Riana Pfefferkorn of the Stanford University Center for Internet and Society, referring to the simmering discontent with Big Tech over data protection and other issues.</p><p>Lawmakers say the bill -- Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies Act (EARN IT) -- allows companies to \"earn\" their liability protection, by gaining certification of compliance by a commission of government, industry, legal and victim group representatives.</p><p>A hearing is set for Wednesday on the measure, which is backed by victims' rights organizations.</p><p>They, along with the Justice Department, have complained that existing laws protecting platforms such as social media companies from liability for user-posted content have allowed child pornography and images of exploitation to proliferate.</p><p>- 'Shouldn't need a pass' -</p><p>Critics say the bill, if enacted, could lead to draconian internet regulation.</p><p>\"You shouldn't need to get a pass from a commission of law enforcement agencies just to set up a website,\" said Joe Mullin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p><p>\"That's the type of system we might hear about under an authoritarian regime.\"</p><p>Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group including hundreds of online firms, said the bill \"sets up the false choice between child safety and internet safety.\" </p><p>Shapiro said in a blog post that the proposed law would not stop the use of encryption but \"penalize American companies by forcing those interested in secure communication to move their business to offshore companies not governed by US law.\"</p><p>- Full implications unclear -</p><p>Eric Goldman, director of Santa Clara University's High Tech Law Institute, said authorities are already unable to investigate the vast number of potential sex exploitation cases flagged by tech firms.</p><p>\"The core presumption of the bill is that companies aren't doing enough,\" Goldman said. \"I don't think that's true. They treat this as the most toxic and most problematic kind of content.\"</p><p>The full implications of the bill remain unclear because standards would be set by a commission that would be created by lawmakers, Goldman said, adding that the panel could call for strict bans on encrypted apps or verification of the identity of all internet users, for example.</p><p>\"There is no limit to the perniciousness of the recommendations,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFP-Bill targeting online child abuse puts encryption in crosshairs </dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCH-F2V1-DY93-M04B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><timeReceived>1:52 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Agence France Presse All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Agence France Presse -- English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20278\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 8, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Major online services would be forced to do more to help fight online child exploitation or lose liability protection under a bill unveiled by senators and assailed by digital rights activists Photo: AFP / Lionel BONAVENTURE Digital rights activists have joined the tech sector in arguing this move is an indirect way to weaken online encryption in the name of better law enforcement access.They say it erodes two cornerstones of the online ecosystem: strong encryption to keep data secure, and a liability shield which enables social media platforms to allow users to post content freely. The bill \"would give government officials unprecedented powers to craft de facto regulations for online speech,\" said Emma Llanso of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a digital rights organization. </p><p>Republican US Senator Lindsey Graham (R) and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal (L) are sponsoring a bill that would force tech firms to do more to help fight child exploitation, which critics say would erode digital rights Photo: AFP / JIM WATSON \"Online service providers would almost certainly err on the side of caution and take down anything -- including a lot of lawful, constitutionally protected speech.\" Encryption has been a point of contention between tech firms and law enforcement for decades. FBI officials have warned of \"going dark\" in investigating crimes as a result of new forms of end-to-end encryption, while civil rights advocates warn that any \"backdoor\" access could be exploited by hackers and authoritarian governments. US Attorney General Bill Barr has said encryption of data on phones and messaging apps makes it harder to catch criminals and thwart exploitation Photo: GETTY IMAGES / Drew Angerer The proposal \"aims to kneecap encryption under the guise of protecting children online, while capitalizing on the techlash,\" said Riana Pfefferkorn of the Stanford University Center for Internet and Society, referring to the simmering discontent with Big Tech over data protection and other issues.Lawmakers say the bill -- Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies Act (EARN IT) -- allows companies to \"earn\" their liability protection, by gaining certification of compliance by a commission of government, industry, legal and victim group representatives.A hearing is set for Wednesday on the measure, which is backed by victims' rights organizations. Proposed US legislation aims to encourage firms to do more to curb the spread of content related to child sex abuse, but critics say it would do little Photo: AFP / Greg Wood They, along with the Justice Department, have complained that existing laws protecting platforms such as social media companies from liability for user-posted content have allowed child pornography and images of exploitation to proliferate.Critics say the bill, if enacted, could lead to draconian internet regulation.\"You shouldn't need to get a pass from a commission of law enforcement agencies just to set up a website,\" said Joe Mullin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\"That's the type of system we might hear about under an authoritarian regime.\"Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group including hundreds of online firms, said the bill \"sets up the false choice between child safety and internet safety.\"Shapiro said in a blog post that the proposed law would not stop the use of encryption but \"penalize American companies by forcing those interested in secure communication to move their business to offshore companies not governed by US law.\"Eric Goldman, director of Santa Clara University's High Tech Law Institute, said authorities are already unable to investigate the vast number of potential sex exploitation cases flagged by tech firms.\"The core presumption of the bill is that companies aren't doing enough,\" Goldman said. \"I don't think that's true. They treat this as the most toxic and most problematic kind of content.\"The full implications of the bill remain unclear because standards would be set by a commission that would be created by lawmakers, Goldman said, adding that the panel could call for strict bans on encrypted apps or verification of the identity of all internet users, for example.\"There is no limit to the perniciousness of the recommendations,\" he said. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767158363557890925876100196</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCH-TF01-F03R-N2M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"837\"/><timeReceived>2:46 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 8, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002KDX</classCode><className>GETTY IMAGES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY &amp;

The legislation floated Monday by Sens. Mark Warner, D-Va., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., goes to the heart of the tech giants' lucrative business model: harvesting data from platform users and making it available to advertisers so they can pinpoint specific consumers to target. </p><p>\"When a big tech company says its product is free, consumers are the ones being sold,\" Hawley said in a statement. \"These 'free' products track everything we do so tech companies can sell our information to the highest bidder and use it to target us with creepy ads. Even worse, tech companies do their best to hide how much consumer data is worth and to whom it is sold.\" Support for privacy law The legislation would require commercial services with more than 100 million active monthly users to disclose to their customers and financial regulators the types of data they collect. They also would have to provide their users with an assessment at frequent intervals of the data's value to them. It comes as bipartisan support grows in Congress for a privacy law that could rein in the ability of the biggest tech companies to collect and make money from users' personal data. At the same time, a House panel has opened a bipartisan investigation of Silicon Valley's market dominance. The Internet Association, the tech industry's major trade group representing Facebook, Google and dozens of other tech companies including Netflix and Airbnb, said Monday that it supports a comprehensive data privacy law. \"Data helps businesses, across all industries and of all sizes and business models, provide consumers with better products and services,\" Michael Beckerman, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement. \"The internet industry supports a comprehensive, economywide federal privacy law that covers all companies . to give consumers the protections and rights they need to take full control of the data they provide to companies.\" The statement didn't directly address the issue of requiring companies to put a value on users' data. No national law in U.S. Unlike many industrialized nations, the U.S. has no overarching national law governing data collection and privacy. Instead, it has a patchwork of federal laws that protect specific types of data, such as consumer health and financial information, and the personal data generated by younger children. A national law would be the first of its kind in the U.S. and could allow people to see or prohibit the use of their data. Companies could be required to seek permission to provide the data to third parties. A law could shrink Big Tech's crucial revenues from advertising. There's no parallel legislation in the House for the new Senate bill, called the Dashboard Act, and its prospects are unclear.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN68372326</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDY-J5V1-JC8S-D3RM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

They are too cumbersome, too expensive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In every talk I have given to banking groups in recent years, I have warned them that future competition will be nothing like what they have been used to. <br/>The biggest threats to their future will not come from other bankers, because those guys are just as confused and hesitant and invested in the past; it will not even come from Fintechs, because those guys can be co-opted to become the allies of incumbent banks \u2014 for those with the vision to partner up.</p><p><br/>No, the greater threat will come from something that's right under the bankers' noses: Big Tech. <br/>The giant companies that power everything that's happening right now on the smartphones of bankers are the ones who will pose the existential danger. <br/>Why? Because they hold so many of the crucial cards. They have global brand acceptance. <br/>DIGITAL CURRENCY<br/>They have the cuffs on billions, not millions, of people. They have the best brains working for them. They have made the greatest investments in the new technologies that will change the game. <br/>All it will take is for them to make their first foray into payments and money transfers, and the Trojan horse will be in motion \u2026<br/>Well, that first foray just happened. Facebook announced its new digital currency, Libra.<br/>On the face of it, this is nothing. It's just an in-house payment system. You know when you visit a theme park or casino, you usually have to change your dollars and shillings into tokens, use those to pay for stuff, then change what's left over back into real money as you leave? Isn't this just that?<br/>Ahem. True, Facebook would want you to buy Libra coins using your dollars, use those coins to send money to any other Facebook user in the world, and turn your Libra hoard back into dollars any time you like. <br/>E-COMMERCE<br/>This is not a cryptocurrency; it's tightly controlled and designed to be stable against major currencies, and it's meant to be bought for convenience, not speculation. Pretty harmless, huh?<br/>Think again. Here's what else Libra might be doing. It might become a no-fee way to send money across borders. It could become a major payments platform for e-commerce, sidestepping credit-cards and bank fees. <br/>And since Facebook controls not just its own dominant social network, but also Instagram and WhatsApp, that could give it billions of possible daily money movements in a stroke.<br/>The launch goal is to handle 1,000 transactions per second. Also, the blockchain platform underlying Libra could allow smart-contract settlements, loans, insurance \u2026<br/>I trust every banker in the world is now sitting up straight.<br/>DATA SAFETY<br/>Oh wait, you say. Regulators will never permit this. They've already expressed concerns. And this is Facebook, of Cambridge Analytica notoriety, reeling from a record $5 billion fine for failing to protect user data. It won't be allowed.<br/>I would just remind you that, that is exactly what you said about M-Pesa 10 years ago, bankers \u2026<br/>Facebook has actually been quite clever about this. The Libra blockchain is controlled by 100 members of a separate, neutral foundation.<br/>Facebook is keen to assure everyone that the treasure-trove of financial data that Libra will throw up will not be accessible to it (unless perhaps you give it permission \u2026 ahem again).<br/>Libra may never get off the ground, regardless. Central bankers will have deep jitters about a borderless currency on this scale. We will find out in the coming months.<br/>CHANGE<br/>But whether Libra flies or not is emphatically not the point. If you're a banker, don't hang your future on this thing getting blocked; understand what's really going on. Traditional banking and payments are broken. <br/>They are too cumbersome, too expensive, too old-world for customers in a click-click-done world. Libra is just one way forward. Many others will pop up. Some of them will fly. Some of them may kill you.<br/>What any bank should be doing right now is sitting down to work out what the hell to do to compete in a world where secure financial transactions will be completed in seconds, not weeks. <br/>Top teams should be preoccupied with how to remove frictions, improve speeds, design smart interfaces, reduce fees. That will involve fresh thinking, new talent and many collaborations. <br/>And if you haven't been doing that with any seriousness, tomorrow morning is already too late. Otherwise, prepare to be \"M-Pesa-ed\" all over again, bankers. It will hurt.<br/>Sunny Bindra's new book, The Bigger Deal, is now on sale. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sunwords.com\">www.sunwords.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUNNAT-150262876</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNNAT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNS-FDJ1-F11P-X41G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407850</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"750\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nation Media Group Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

CSIR researchers investigating the hoodia plant (used for generations by the Kalahari San to stave off hunger and thirst on long journeys) found that it could be used as an appetite suppressant.</p><p>They isolated the active ingredient, known as P57, which for pharmaceutical companies represented the key to fighting obesity in rich countries - and a slice of the R60bn weight-loss market.</p><p>The CSIR passed their work on to a British company, Phytopharm, for further development. Phytopharm's share price rocketed as traders anticipated rich returns from a drug that would revolutionise the slimming market. The company then sold the exclusive global rights to commercialise the drug to Pfizer for $21USm.</p><p>\"Africa lost out on a huge biotech opportunity,\" says Suza Adam, initiator of Lifesparks Biobasics, SA's first biotech partnering forum. \"It highlighted the lack of business acumen in some of our research institutions.\"</p><p>Since then, government has become wise to the potential of biotech in SA. A strategy to boost the sector has been implemented, there are tighter patent laws and regulations around the use of biodiversity, and increases in funding have helped put the sector on the radar screens of US analysts - though many at home still need convincing.</p><p>\"The US has an army of analysts who value biotech companies on the strength of their technology,\" says Shimoda Biotech CEO Greg Gilbert. \"Here analysts tend to stick to financials.\"</p><p>Overseas, investors are piling into biotech stocks. Publicly traded biotech companies across the globe saw revenues increase 12% in 2004 to $54,6bn, according to a report by Ernst &amp; Young. Biotech is now starting to rival traditional pharmaceutical firms, which are big cash generators.</p><p>Biotech firms are also working smarter. The Ernst &amp; Young report shows that in 2004 the pharmaceutical industry spent about $50bn on research &amp; development (R&amp; D), compared with the $16bn spent by publicly traded US biotech companies, and an estimated $20bn spent by the global biotech industry.</p><p>In spite of its large R&amp; D expenditure, the pharmaceutical industry's new drug approvals have been declining steadily while biotechs have accounted for a rising share of new drug approvals over the past five years. (See graph).</p><p>And as investors become less squeamish about genetically modified crops, cloned animals and stem cell research, biotech is set to become the next big tech boom. \"Compared with information technology, biotech is far more hi-tech, far more complex and therefore far riskier for investors,\" says Adam. \"But it holds more potential than the tech boom of the late 1990s.\"</p><p>SA's biotech industry is still embryonic. With about 50 core biotech companies, none of them listed, the country is not yet a real rival to other developing markets such as India, which now ranks in the top 10 biotech countries.</p><p>\"Development has been random and crosses many disciplines,\" says Mark Fyvie, CEO of Cape Biotech, a government-funded body that promotes biotech development. \"Most companies could be described as medium tech and product-orientated, rather than cutting-edge technology companies.\"</p><p>But he says SA is starting to develop pockets of excellence.</p><p>For one, SA has unique and rich biodiversity. This makes bioprospecting - screening natural plants for compounds with commercial potential - one area in which SA can compete.</p><p>SA also has a high prevalence of diseases such as Aids, tuberculosis and malaria, which are not always given sufficient attention by the big pharmaceutical companies, says Fyvie. These diseases can create local demand for a range of biotech activities - from diagnostics and vaccines to clinical trials and drug development.</p><p>\"We also have a strong clinical environment, low-cost R&amp; D and First-World intellectual property rights,\" he says. \"That makes us an attractive destination for partnering.\"</p><p>But as with all biotech companies, early-stage financing remains a problem. \"SA investors tend to be more risk-averse than, say, US investors,\" says Fyvie. \"But we are seeing an increase in appetite for biotech investments.\"</p><p>New listings of health-care stocks such as Enaleni and Wellco on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's AltX, the bourse for smaller firms, have helped establish a market for biotech ventures.</p><p>Thanks to government investment in the sector, investors are now willing to fund potential projects. \"The flow of public funds into the biotech sector has helped lower the risk for private investors,\" says Fyvie. \"Once riskier ventures gain traction, it has a knock-on effect on the rest of the industry.\"</p><p>There are now a number of venture capital firms and incubators willing to invest in biotech start-ups. \"It's early days, but in SA over the next five years we will probably see five full-scale pharmaceutical companies on the JSE,\" predicts Fyvie. \"We're just starting to climb the biotech curve.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TMLFM-QEAJY2333</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TMLFM2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4HJC-8XH0-TX4F-533M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163767</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"843\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2005 BDFM Publishers PTY Ltd.

The House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust held its sixth in a series of hearings July 29 examining the power of digital platforms. Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai all appeared via videoconference to defend their companies and answer questions from lawmakers about their business practices.  The companies are currently being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and nearly every state-level enforcer in the country for potential antitrust violations.  The groundswell of attention reflects a sentiment that has emerged in recent years equating the titans of today's tech industry to John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie, who are often held up as archetypes of the type of monopolist that America's antitrust laws should target. Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., head of the House antitrust panel, evoked that comparison at the close of the hearing, saying \"the names have changed, the story is the same.\"  \"Once again, their control of the marketplace allows them to do whatever it takes to crush independent business and expand their own power,\" Cicilline said. \"This must end.\"  Despite lawmakers' rhetoric, experts told Law360 it's unlikely they will attempt a wholesale breakup of any of the companies. That's partly because companies like Amazon and Facebook are so popular among their users, said Chad Elder, an antitrust partner with Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP.  Although there is bipartisan support to clamp down on the sector, Elder said the looming election could make it difficult to reach a consensus. Republicans on the panel largely used the hearing to blast the heads of Google and Facebook with accusations about anti-conservative bias and favoring Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.  President Donald Trump also tweeted ahead of the hearing that if Congress fails \"to bring fairness to big tech,\" he would do it through executive order. He's already made such an attempt to address alleged censorship, issuing an order in May that asked the Federal Communications Commission to further define Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a provision that exempts websites from lawsuits as long as they employ reasonable moderation practices.  A unit of the U.S. Department of Commerce sent a petition to the FCC last week making a formal request to jump-start a rulemaking.  Democratic FCC Commissioners Jessica Rosenworcel and Geoffrey Starks have said they believe online content issues fall outside of the agency's jurisdiction. Nevertheless, Ajit Pai, the FCC's Republican chairman, on Monday announced that the commission would fulfill its obligation to seek public comment on the issue.  \"Long-standing rules require the agency to put such petitions out for public comment 'promptly,' and we will follow that requirement here,\" Pai said. \"I strongly disagree with those who demand that we ignore the law and deny the public and all stakeholders the opportunity to weigh in on this important issue.\"  There has also been bipartisan support in the Senate for legislation that would update Section 230. But it's not clear what impact the efforts will ultimately have, if any.  \"On some level, the hearings may amount to nothing more than political venting, a shot across the bow of Big Tech firms that they are being scrutinized more closely than they previously realized,\" Elder said.  Threatening Breakups  There have been calls for more robust antitrust enforcement for years, with critics often pointing to concentration levels and other economic data as indications the agencies haven't been doing enough. But the idea of breaking up the large technology platforms gained prominence in American politics last year when Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., made the issue an important piece of her presidential campaign.  Her proposal would see legislation mandating the breakup of Facebook, Amazon and Google and would bar operators of \"platform utilities\" \u2014  defined as companies with more than $25 billion in global revenue that offer online marketplaces, exchanges or platforms used by third parties to connect with customers \u2014 from participating on their own platforms.   But R. Mark McCareins, a professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management and former co-head of Winston &amp; Strawn LLP's global competition practice, said that breaking up companies through legislation is a risky proposition.  He noted that there were calls to break up Walmart Inc. several years ago, but that its dominance in retail began to dwindle \u2014 in part because of Amazon's rise. Now Walmart has pivoted partly through acquisitions in the e-commerce space to better compete against Amazon.  Walmart adapting and surviving shows that the marketplace can work on its own, McCareins said.  \"Once we start going down this road of attempting to legislatively reengineer large successful companies, it becomes a slippery slope,\" he said.  Michael Carrier, a professor at Rutgers Law School, told Law360 that the hearing showed that lawmakers came prepared and were intent on making their points, frequently cutting off witnesses to get in some extra words.  But he said he doesn't expect any immediate action to result from the hearing, or that legislation forcing a breakup of the companies is likely. The hearing could, however, provide additional support for those pushing enforcers to take action.  \"I see the hearing as consistent with the federal and state investigations of these companies and bipartisan attention in Congress,\" Carrier said. \"My guess is that the agencies already felt pressure to act, and this will modestly increase that pressure.\"  Targeting Past Deals  Most calls for breakups of the platform companies have emphasized unwinding past acquisitions. In addition to probing the conduct of tech companies, the FTC is also currently studying past deals in the sector to see if enforcers have overlooked transactions that should have been challenged.  During the July 29 proceeding, lawmakers grilled Zuckerberg extensively about the motivations behind Facebook's $1 billion purchase of Instagram in 2012. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said internal documents uncovered during the probe show that Facebook inked the deal because it saw the photo-sharing app as a competitive threat.  \"This is exactly the kind of anti-competitive acquisition the antitrust laws were designed to prevent,\" Nadler said.  Documents flashed during the hearing show communications between Zuckerberg and other executives discussing the rationale for the deal and the purchasing of startups more generally.  Zuckerberg acknowledged at the hearing that Facebook saw Instagram as both a competitor and a complement to its services. But the FTC cleared the transaction under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act's premerger notification process, and Zuckerberg contended the agency had access to the same documents Nadler referenced.  Enforcers could still challenge the tie-up to force an unwinding, but McCareins said it hasn't been done many times before, making it a tall order.   \"Not only is there very little precedent for such an approach, but in rapidly changing markets, it is patently unfair to allow the regulators two bites at the apple,\" he said. \"My suggestion is that the DOJ and FTC do a better job up front in the HSR process of understanding the technology at issue and how a particular deal could change the competitive landscape in coming years.\"  Lawmakers confronted Bezos with questions about Amazon's $500 million purchase of Diapers.com in 2010, another deal the FTC reviewed and cleared at the time. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa., said the documents the subcommittee has seen indicate that Amazon viewed the online seller of baby products as its main competitor in the sale of diapers.  To combat pricing pressure, Scanlon said, Amazon \"hatched a plot\" to take out Diapers.com, slashing its prices for diapers below cost in order to undercut its rival. When the smaller site began to founder, she said, Amazon purchased the company and then raised the prices on diapers back up.  \"Your own documents make clear that the price war against Diapers.com worked,\" Scanlon said.  But Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., the ranking Republican on the antitrust subcommittee, concurred with Bezos during the hearing that consumers would not be helped if Amazon were forced to spin businesses off.  Sensenbrenner also criticized the breakup several decades ago of AT&amp;T by U.S. authorities, and said he did not support changing the antitrust laws. He did say, however, that he supports making sure the existing laws are enforced and that he has concerns about market dominance in the digital space, though the risk he pointed to was censorship and its potential impact on conservative consumers.  Carrier told Law360 that it is unlikely Amazon would be forced to spin off Diapers.com, but \"the evidence could be part of a monopolization claim involving predatory pricing.\"  Bradley Arant's Elder noted that \"pricing below cost to drive out a competitor or force it to merge are already clearly covered by existing antitrust law,\" meaning the DOJ already has the tools it needs to go after that type of conduct.  Watching for Potential Abuse  Concerns about Big Tech extend beyond the acquisition of potential competitors and into their powerful positions as gatekeepers of the platforms they run.  Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., hammered Bezos during the hearing about the treatment of third-party sellers that rely on Amazon's marketplace. She referenced a Wall Street Journal article suggesting Amazon employees use data from the sellers to help pick what products its private-label business should sell, contradicting testimony from an Amazon employee who spoke in front of the subcommittee last year.  Bezos responded that Amazon has a policy against using seller-specific data when making decisions for its retail business, but said he couldn't guarantee it has never been violated by employees making decisions on their own. He also said Amazon imposed this policy voluntarily and that he knows of no other retailer with something similar.  McCareins said it's premature to speculate about enforcers launching an enforcement action against Amazon based on allegations that a rogue employee violated its policy. It's also not clear if the government would be able to win such a case.  \"These are issues that will only be addressed through discovery,\" he said.  Elder said it's unlikely Amazon would be forced to sell off its private-label business, but that Congress could pass legislation to impose regulations on the company's business practices. This could, for example, provide some separation between the retail and marketplace businesses.  The allegations against Apple, meanwhile, center on its App Store and the power the company wields over the distribution of software that runs on its devices. Lawmakers during the hearing raised concerns similar to those from proposed classes of developers and consumers suing Apple alleging monopolization based on the fees collected and restrictions imposed through the store.  Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., questioned Cook about the control Apple has over the app ecosystem, including the commissions it collects and the rules it imposes on developers, such as mandating that most apps use Apple's own payment system.  But Cook insisted Apple faces competition for developers, who can choose to create apps for any number of other devices and operating systems, such as Android or Windows. On the handset side, there's a \"street fight for market share,\" he said.  He also faced questions about the introduction of Apple's Screen Time app, which allows parents to track and control the amount of time kids spend on their devices, and the subsequent removal of several apps from the store produced by third-party developers with similar functionality. Cook said the other apps were removed over safety and privacy concerns and that there are currently 30 other parental control apps in the store.  But McCareins said the type of conduct that lawmakers are targeting from Apple and the other tech giants would make tough cases for enforcers to bring. He pointed to the DOJ's failed bid to block AT&amp;T from purchasing Time Warner and a lack of precedent on challenges to vertical deals, which combine companies at different points in the supply chain.  \"I would be concerned that an overly aggressive court action against any one of these tech companies, absent compelling facts, would suffer the same fate\" as the Time Warner challenge, he said.  Cicilline accused Google of transforming itself from \"a turnstile to the rest of the web\" into a \"walled garden that increasingly keeps users within its sites.\" He said the company now uses its position to identify competitive threats and crush them, including by allegedly stealing content and threatening to delist companies that complain.  He also said Google has made it so that virtually any business that wants to be found on the internet has to pay Google a tax.  Pichai insisted the company operates in \"highly competitive and dynamic global markets, in which prices are free or falling and products are constantly improving.\" And he said Google's success depends on the success of the businesses that use its services.  European enforcers have slapped Google with a total of \u20ac8 billion ($9.4 billion) in fines for abusing its dominance through its comparison shopping service, mobile operating system and search advertising business. But McCareins said it would be tough to bring such a case in the U.S., in part because the law requires precise definitions of markets being impacted by anti-competitive activity, and the lines between markets are not clear in search, online advertising and related spaces.  \"Applying those fundamentals to an ever-changing tech sector is a challenge for the government, especially given the dearth of existing judicial precedent on these issues,\" he said.  --Editing by Alanna Weissman and Aaron Pelc.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Sponsored by Republican SenatorDeb Fischer and Democrat Mark Warner, the DETOUR Act[1]wants to make short work of user interfaces and technology design practices meant to take consumers on a ride of deception, tricking them into giving over their personal data to companies with over 100 million users. Short for the \"Deceptive Experiences To Online Users Reduction Act,\" the legislation would have prevented the creation of Facebook and Google as we know them today had it been in force back when those two were but a couple of infants dreaming of monopolies and abuse of power[2]. The two Senators behind the initiative explained how they specifically wanted to address \"dark patterns\" with the DETOUR Act, referring to misleading design practices that essentially have tech companies lie to people, misrepresenting their need for certain privacy concessions to be made on the part of their users. </p><p>The bill draft proposed in the Senate forbids companies from building data-harvesting products aimed at pre-teens, prevents them from doing A-B testing without obtaining specific consent from users, and requires them to be subjected to independent audits meant to ensure they aren't devolving into evil corporations at least once per quarter. It's a remarkably pro-consumer piece of legislation, which is precisely why cynics don't expect it to get passed anytime soon, if at all. Intentional efforts aimed at limiting users' understanding of online services and their rights, particularly as those relate to their personal data, is one of the most alarming issues plaguing the modern Internet, Senator Fischer said in a prepared statement, concluding that she hopes the DETOUR Act is just the beginning of things to come in regards to online consumer protections in the country. More than just a page from the EU's book If all of that sounds familiar, it's because the DETOUR Act is essentially a lite version of the General Data Protection Regulation, that pesky set of laws that have been troubling honest-to-God data harvesters in Europe for about a full year now. It's notasstrict and its scope appears to be significantly reduced compared to GDPR but it's a clear sign of times for big tech[3] in the United States. The land of the free is unfortunately also the land where big corporations were free to exploit every drop of the general public's goodwill in recent times, which is what indirectly led to Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, the privacy debacle that was the final nail in the Google+ coffin, etc. Despite being at its most polarizing point in recent memory, the state of mainstream politics in the U.S. still sees both the GOP and DNC easily agree Internet firms need to be regulated more aggressively, which would be an encouragingly remarkable example of bipartisanship if it wasn't primarily a reminder about how anti-consumer some of these multi-billion-dollar corporations have become.

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and John Kennedy (R-LA) reintroducing legislation Thursday to protect the data of social media users, on the same day that two Democratic senators wrote to the Federal Trade Commission asking for information on how the ongoing partial government shutdown is impacting its investigation of Facebook's data privacy policies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Social Media and Consumer Rights Act, originally introduced by Klobuchar and Kennedy in April, would give social media users the right to \"opt out\" of data tracking and collection programs, along with requiring consumers to be notified of any breach of their information within 72 hours, and mandating social media terms of service agreements be written in \"plain language.\" The bill was referred to the Senate Commerce Committee during the 115th Congress, where it was never marked up.</p><p>\"Every day, companies profit off of the data they're collecting from Americans, yet leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information, online behavior, and private messages are being used,\" Klobuchar said in a statement. \"Consumers should have the right to control their personal data.\"</p><p>Kennedy emphasized that he does not \"want to regulate Facebook or any private social media company,\" but noted that \"these platforms continue to compromise their users' private data.\"</p><p>\"In today's world, private data is the equivalent of our personal identities, and companies need to know that they'll be held accountable when they violate the public's trust and compromise our private information,\" Kennedy said. \"Our legislation does just that.\"</p><p>Sens. Edward Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) also expressed concern over social media data privacy, writing a letter to all five FTC commissioners on Thursday seeking information on how the partial government shutdown is affecting the FTC's investigation of Facebook. The investigation began last March following reports that consulting firm Cambridge Analytica obtained Facebook user data without consent in order to target political messages.</p><p>\"We believe that the FTC should have the resources and plans necessary to resume its investigation once the Commission is funded,\" Blumenthal and Markey wrote. \"When Americans' privacy is breached, they deserve a speedy and effective response. The government shutdown could have profound effects on the FTC's investigation beyond delays due to staff furloughs. Therefore, we strongly encourage the Commission to use every tool at its disposal in its investigation and we write to ensure that the FTC is able to address any detrimental impacts from the shutdown and conduct a fulsome investigation.\"</p><p>Blumenthal and Markey specifically asked for answers on what steps consumers should take if they are the victim of a data privacy invasion while the FTC is shut down; whether the FTC has an \"efficient and effective plan\" to resume its investigation of Facebook once the government reopens; and whether the FTC requires further resources to expedite the investigation.</p><p>On Wednesday, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced the American Data Dissemination Act, or the ADD Act, requiring the FTC to submit recommendations on privacy requirements to protect consumer data online. The bill would give the FTC the authority to \"promulgate a final rule\" on data privacy within 27 months of the bill's enactment if Congress fails to enact a law based on the FTC's recommendations.</p><p>\"There has been a growing consensus that Congress must take action to address consumer data privacy,\" Rubio said in a statement. \"However, I believe that any efforts to address consumer privacy must also balance the need to protect the innovative capabilities of the digital economy that have enabled new entrants and small businesses to succeed in the marketplace. That is why I am introducing the American Data Dissemination Act, which will protect small businesses and startups while ensuring that consumers are provided with overdue rights and protections.\"</p><p>Rubio continued, \"it is critical that we do not create a regulatory environment that entrenches big tech corporations. Congress must act, but it is even more important that Congress act responsibly to create a transparent, digital environment that maximizes consumer welfare over corporate welfare.\"</p><p>Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) also plans to join the data privacy conversation, telling Inside Cybersecurity this week that he will reintroduce the Data Care Act \"sometime in February.\" This legislation, originally introduced by Schatz and 14 other Senate Democrats in December, would require online service providers to \"reasonably secure individual identifying data\" and require \"prompt\" consumer notification in the event of a data breach, along with granting the FTC rulemaking authority to enforce the bill.</p><p>The measure was referred to the Senate Commerce Committee, where it did not receive a hearing. This committee however seems poised to resume discussion of data privacy during this Congress, with new Chairman Roger Wicker (R-MS) telling reporters this week that one of the panel's first hearings will focused on data privacy issues.</p><p>\"Maintaining consumer trust and confidence in this marketplace is critical to preserving prosperous and thriving digital economy in the United States,\" Wicker said. \"A priority of this committee will be to protect the privacy of consumers' data in a way that promotes industry transparency, consumer choice, and innovation.\" -- Maggie Miller (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mmiller@iwpnews.com\">mmiller@iwpnews.com</email>)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICSRTY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICSRTY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V85-9FT1-JBHM-S025-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">412529</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"930\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Inside Washington Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Inside Cyber Security</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 22, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC000858K</classCode><className>DAY COS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

ROBIN KELLY (D-ILL.) </p><p>REP. WILL HURD (R-TEXAS) </p><p>[*]GRUMET: Good afternoon. I am Jason Grumet. It is a pleasure to welcome you to this afternoon's discussion with Representatives Will Hurd and Robin Kelly on a national AI strategy. </p><p>As I think everyone is well aware we are very focused at the moment in this country on our national politics but you know we at the Bipartisan Policy Center are also thinking about what awaits the roughly 500 winners of the November elections and recognize that we are going to have a country that remains in economic and health crisis while also facing a variety of complex challenges and the question that we, of course, are asking ourselves is how do we help our government governed in a divided nation. One of the key challenges that we know we are facing is the question of how we reap the benefits and manage the challenges of the continued move towards artificial intelligence. </p><p>For the past year, we have had the pleasure to work with Representatives Kelly and Hurd to develop a national strategy for artificial intelligence. We have held about half a dozen convenings where we have heard from over 80 different organizations and individuals from industry and academia, civil society organizations. Through this process, we have created four white papers on ethics, on research and development, on national security and workforce issues; these white papers we hope our forming the basis of a resolution that members of Congress will be talking about here in just a little bit. They will also be available on our website, and I think we are going to be posting them on the chat feature via YouTube. </p><p>Today we are going to focus a lot on both these recommendations but also on the process that Congressmen Hurd and Kelly are moving forward with to actually introduce a national resolution and before we move to that discussion it's really a great honor and privilege to have the ability to kick this off with Eric Schmidt who I think just about everybody in the world knows was the former CEO of Google. He is the chair of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, and he is going to lead off this conversation by sharing his view of what is the strategy for America to win in the effort to advance artificial intelligence, and so once Eric concludes his remarks we will then have a conversation with the representatives of Congress. </p><p>We will then move to a second panel where we drill down a little bit on some of the more key technical questions. After each of these interactions, we will have an opportunity for audience Q&amp;A and just look to the live chat function on YouTube or Facebook or via Twitter with the hashtag BPClive. So with that opening stretch real pleasure Eric to turn over to you to set the stage for us. </p><p>SCHMIDT: Jason, thank you so much. You guys have done such a good job. I am really happy to be part of this. I wanted to start by saying that my comments here are as chairman of the National Security Commission for AI. This is a commission that was created by the Congress, and I am not speaking for any other groups that I am part of just literally this is this AI commission which was created by Congress in order to make some recommendations which interestingly are very similar to those of a Bipartisan Policy Commission, so I am really, really happy about that. </p><p>I also wanted to thank Representative Will Hurd and Robin Kelly, who I think both are on right now. They saw this earlier than the other folks in Congress, and frankly, there is a difference of understanding. Some people get it; most don't. These guys get it, and they worked pretty hard to help make this happen. When they talk, I think you will get a sense of why they are so good at what they do. And you know as I understand their view AI basically can play a sort of--they understand the role of both economic and social and you know for our security well-being, and so that vision led to the creation to the BPC to develop a strategy and a guide for the Congress which is sort of why we are all here. </p><p>It is interesting that in my wandering around, you know I am a scientist and technologist from Silicon Valley, there are a couple of groups that seem to be primarily in D.C. One is called the CSET, the Center for Security and Emerging Technology. Another one is the Center for New American Security, CNAS, both of whom seem to have an unusually large percentage of people who can cross the technology and the policy area. I have learned that this is a relatively small group, and these two are among the two or three of the top in the country, and they have been working very closely with the BPC. </p><p>So I just want to make sure everybody understands that the people who sort of are talking about this are inclusive, but fundamentally the group of people who are having this conversation is too small, and I want more of you to join one or more of these organizations. So basically BPC is now releasing their reports, which I am strongly recommending. </p><p>So basically what happened was the sort of lens of NASA(SP) security workforce and R&amp;D is the same path that the National Security Commission for AI decided to take again I think showing that either common wisdom or common delusion hopefully common wisdom and we--it turns out that two of our commissioners who are Jason Matheny and Bob Work are actually associated with CSET and CNAS, big surprise there. So the long port of it is that the AI commission and will be we have a series of reports, we have a big one coming out early next year believes that holding a global leadership position in emerging technology is both an economic and national security imperative. </p><p>Both are important; people want to focus on one or the other but you actually need both, you need national security for obvious reasons, but you also need economic security and economic growth for all of the reasons that you could imagine, and the two go hand in hand. And I want to emphasize that we have rediscovered the basic fact that America is an innovator, and you have to have an innovation strategy in these areas. If you don't have an innovation strategy, your competitors the Europeans or more likely the Chinese and the Russians will take over some very important part of technology, and that is a really bad thing, so we want to be really, really clear. </p><p>And this leadership model that I am talking about then also gives our government access to the best in the world. Imagine if all of the really smartest encryption people and security people worked in China, and none of them are in the U.S. how would our military and our intelligence group do any of their function? They would always be beaten by the opponent. It is obvious that we need these as national resources, and in the American system, they tend to be in the private sector, they tend to be in universities, they tend to be in research labs. They are not controlled by the government, so the synergy between the universities and the government and the military and so forth and so on is critical in the American model. </p><p>I want to be very clear that we have a new competitive threat in the form of China. China is both our biggest strategic competitor and our current larger strategic partner. We have never faced this before in terms of the size and scale of the opponent and the collaboration. At the worst points in the Soviet Union, they were a third if you will of the GDP of America. China is on its way to surpass us in many, many ways, and they are cleverly run in a way that is different from the way we would ever want to be run, but we need to take them seriously. I have spent 15 years dealing with China, mostly on the losing side of negotiating with their government. I take them very, very seriously, and I encourage everyone else to do as well. </p><p>So the thing about it is they are going to end up with a bigger economy, more R&amp;D investments, better quality research, wider applications of technology, and a stronger computing infrastructure. How is that okay? It is clearly not okay. Right? We have got to act, and the good news is we have time, and if you follow the thinking of the BPC and the AI Commission and some of the other affiliated groups, I think you will see that there is a way for us to do this. But if we don't act now in 10 or 20 years, we are going to say oh, my God, how could we have is this? </p><p>And the Chinese model is different in the form of I am going to use my own phrase here it is a sort of vision of high-tech authoritarianism which is incompatible with the way America works. I am not saluting it, I am not endorsing it in any way, but I am telling you to take it seriously, right? And it has benefits from the standpoint of a strategic execution which we need to have a good answer to and so obviously if China achieves market dominance and critical technologies it is the same argument. How would you like it if the majority of all of the things that you used during our friendly pandemic here sorry that was not a good joke for Chinese-controlled rather than U.S.? I mean, think about how difficult the pandemic is already and imagine if we were dependent on other people in this sort of horrific way. </p><p>So we have to provide a model of high-tech democracy that works, and I am concerned I will say it clearly that we collectively have not yet offered that. I think if you read the BPC reports you will see the list of actions that we have to take which I will highlight in a minute, but we seem to have forgotten in our political narratives that we need some things in order to keep winning and that winning is crucial for our economy, the stock market all of the kind of things that we care about. </p><p>And furthermore, this sort of foundation of high-tech economy is also our--our foundation of our freedoms which I take very seriously the freedom to associate, the freedom to think, the freedom of speech and so forth and so on. This technology can be shifted in the other way where it can become oppressive, and that is not acceptable to Americans, it is not acceptable to us, not acceptable to me. So--so for all of those reasons we have to provide real alternatives that are competitive, global and win in the marketplace, and that requires a refocusing on key areas of technology which we have either forgotten about, we found boring, or we haven't funded enough. </p><p>So think of it as technology leadership is a dual path, we have to protect our innovations, nobody wants their stuff stolen that is obviously not okay, but we have to innovate against our competitors, right? It is always better to run faster than your competitors and leave them behind. All of the other strategies blocking strategies or so forth they may feel good for a little while, but ultimately because of network effects and other things in competition, they end up staying around, and it becomes a real problem. We have to move faster. </p><p>So let what happens is that people say it's an arms race; that's too simplistic. The best outcome in my view is if the tech firms can outcompete their global competition to create network platforms on a global basis, that's a huge win for America and by the way if you care about the stock market, the gains of the stock market have largely been because the leading tech firms each of those establishes a global network platform which I can describe if you are interested in it and those things are at risk with the devolution with China, so it is a tricky set of issues. </p><p>So let me refer to, and I will see if I can finish up with a couple of comments the three AI reports that the BPC has published that at least I have seen one on R&amp;D, one on national security, one on the workforce. On the R&amp;D, it's pretty obvious that we need to increase our R&amp;D spending, at least in critical areas. So if you are not familiar with where we are in R&amp;D funding at the federal level we are down to a number pre-Sputnik we are roughly 0.7 percent of GDP, and that number has been as high as 2 percent, 2.5 percent. It is important that that number increases because that money doesn't come from anywhere else. It can't be made up by private philanthropy, it can't be made up from corporations, and yet it is the federal government in particular through its actions with the scientific community and working with U.S. universities that has invented things that ultimately led to things like the smartwatch and GPS and so forth and so on and obviously the Internet. We need to place some big bets on these t     hings on these areas, and we need to address this funding and the BPC agrees with this. </p><p>We also need--we need to identify some--some research areas for national security and we should prioritize those. I am very worried about some new forms of encryption and some new algorithms that are coming out, and again we need to stay focused on making sure that we keep everything safe. The second paper that BPC talks about spends a lot of time on the question of human operators and AI systems. Let me give you an example to make the point. </p><p>We have a doctrine which I fully support in America that it is human in the loop. So here you are, the time is crunched, everything is happening incredibly quickly, and the AI system says press the button. Do you really think the human is going to have the kind of judgment and quality of thinking and insight to say let me debate the accuracy of the AI system while this thing is coming right at me? This is a very complicated problem that Jason and his team have really sort of addressed and it is one that we are going to have to spend an awful lot of time, there are a lot of AI issues as well, and particularly the high-stakes situations that we find in defense and security are of concern because everything gets compressed. </p><p>The military talks about something called the (INAUDIBLE) which is observe and operate and it is calculated around human reaction. In the AI system, this stuff can occur faster than humans can react. How do we deal with that problem? There is obviously all sorts of questions about testing and evaluation that we need to focus on. And then the third focus that BPC has is around basically AI talent. We need more people doing AI; we need to get the smartest people in the rest of the countries to come to America to do AI here because there are--there are incredibly excellent people. We want all of them here, and we don't want them in the competitor countries, and we need to figure out a way to sort of keep them both safe and also keep our national security through that process. </p><p>The report represent--highlights the critical role that immigrants and the children of immigrants have played in founding and leading U.S. technology companies. I can say that from my own experience, given that one of the cofounders of Google was foreign-born. I want America to win. I think every single person who is participating in this conversation. I know that our congressional leaders want us to win. I want a strategy to win. </p><p>I am concerned I will use my own framing now that we are still doing too many reactive things rather than saying here is a global way to win my summary which is very consistent with the BPC's recommendations is that we need to invest in AI, invest in AI research, make sure the ethics are right, invest in our talent, create new industries and jobs and have American companies be the ones that dominate us globally. I just don't see any other path. </p><p>The scenario where the world gets split and the Chinese in charge of this area and the one that we are in charge of is not an acceptable one. It is too dangerous for America, and I suspect you all when you read their reports you will agree with their conclusions and I--I think, and I think the BPC would like the Congress and the executive branch to adopt these recommendations as quickly as possible and I strongly urge everybody to do so. </p><p>Thank you so much, Jason, for introducing me here. What can I do to help, and again I cannot say enough good things about you guys have done. </p><p>GRUMET: Well, Eric, really appreciate both the perspective but also the generosity of your time and spirit and the service on the National Security Commission. I think it is an incredibly important and generous thing that you are doing. </p><p>We do have time for a couple of questions, and not surprisingly, this is a somewhat more tech-savvy crowd then we often get at BPC, so I have a bunch to choose from, I'm only going to be able to probably take about two. So let me start out Eric one of the questions a couple of the questions are about this question of kind of priority and focus and so if I could summarize I think the question is should the U.S. be moving faster in some sectors than others to deploy and develop AI systems or should we be just kind of pursuing all of these ideas on kind of parallel pathways? </p><p>SCHMIDT: You know there's an explosion going on in terms of research in all of these areas. I think many of them will be taken care of in the market. So if you are a business and you need better analytics for selling things that is a problem that is both solve and where you will pay employees $1 million a person amazing salaries because the economic return to you is so--I think that is going to happen. </p><p>I think we should focus on the federal government and the state governments and, in particular, our national security area because they are the business incentives are not the same, but the importance is just as high if not more important. That is where I think your emphasis has been; I think that is where ours is. We need to retool, reimagine whatever it is we need more people who understand this who are part of every aspect of the software and security systems in America. </p><p>GRUMET: So I think let me ask you one more question which is really a perfect on-ramp to the next panel, and that is if you could wave a magic wand and have Congress enact one specific AI-related policy what would it be and why? </p><p>SCHMIDT: Find a way to double the funding for research in America over a five-year period or less in a way that doesn't take from everyone else, so where it's a real improvement in available funds. There are things that the federal government is the only potential funder of and I am including federal government, I am including the DOD, I am including the national security industry, etc. We need more money because money does drive the signals around the hiring, building organizations, making experiments, and so forth. </p><p>GRUMET: Well, again, I really appreciate your time and perspective, and we certainly a course will be taking you up on the offer to stay in touch since these are important and parallel exercises. </p><p>Now my pleasure is to turn to two people who have been kind of the inspiration for this exceptional amount of work that we have been able to do over the last few months that is Congressmen Will Hurd and Robin Kelly. I think while they need no introduction just to remind you that Congressman Hurd represents Texas 23. He is the ranking member on the Subcommittee of Intelligence and Modernization and Readiness. Congressman Kelly represents the second district in Illinois. She serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and it has really been a terrific pleasure to work with both of you and also with your exceptional staff over the last year as we have tried to help you design this process. </p><p>And I guess I just want to start out before getting kind of into any weeds maybe with you Congressman Hurd what do you want the American public to know how AI is or will be affecting our lives? </p><p>HURD: Artificial intelligence is going to impact every single point of our industries, of our lives, of our economy as--as Eric had eloquently said we are in a--a--a struggle with the communist party of China and there's a role for all of us to play and I think the federal government has a role. We can help accelerate innovation, and then there are ways to increase that research dollar. </p><p>It is by actually making the federal government more efficient, and one of the things I have worked on since I have been in Congress is IT procurement. It's not a sexy topic, but when you make the government run better and cheaper, you can use that savings sort other things and--and specifically for innovation. We can be bringing these kind of technology into the government so that the government is using these tools that we were talking about and Congress is uniquely positioned to manage the trade-offs that we are going to have to deal with with new technology and a technological explosion. </p><p>And so you know a lot of times we were review about the impact this is going to have to our current way of life; it is going to be destructive period full stop but can we take advantage of this technology before it takes advantage of us? And I want to make sure that English and the dollar continues to be the dominant in this country not Mandarin (INAUDIBLE). So these are and--and I would say in my short time in Congress we have seen members realize and appreciate the importance of these issues and so you know the fact that the National Security Commission on AI was created and they recognize that and then also what we are doing now. </p><p>So it is great to be doing this with Robin. Shout out to BPC Michelle, and John from BPC have been fantastic in this, and it is a pleasure to have--have Eric kick off such an important occasion. </p><p>GRUMET: Representative Kelly same question to you in addition to Will's 2 A.M. voicemails what convinced you to join this exercise and what do you want the general public to be thinking about? </p><p>KELLY: Well, you said the right thing, Will's 2 A.M. voicemails. Just us working together when I was the ranking, and he was the chair of the IT task force, and I think I (INAUDIBLE) our first but somewhere close we had a hearing on artificial intelligence so when he called and asked you know would I be a part of this project I said definitely yes because AI is not the future it is here with us now affecting our world. </p><p>GRUMET: So Will and I think Eric shared with us you know the view of the important work being done by the National Security Commission, the Trump administration put together an executive order on AI that I think was well received and informed a lot of our work. Talk a little bit about what kind of distinguishes this effort, why were you interested in bringing this kind of group together for a congressional? </p><p>HURD: So--so Congress has a unique role to play and--and what we want to do from these convenings and the white papers and the recommendations from the white papers is put that together, and I think we will start with a resolution that recognizes the bipartisan accomplishments in AI policy that is happened under the previous administration and the current administration. </p><p>And then we also need to assert Congresses role in establishing national priorities, funding specific research like--like Eric was talking about and we also have to stop talking about sustaining cooperation with our allies. This is not just about the public and the private sector in the United States of America working together, we have to work with our allies in order to deal with China. An authoritarian country is always going to have more data than us. They don't care about civil liberties and so we in order to--to beat them at their game we are going to need more data, or we are going to need algorithms to that work on--on less data and that is one of the things that we talk in our papers. </p><p>And so we also want to try to identify a comprehensive strategy to make sure we retain global leadership in artificial intelligence, and we tried to focus this effort over four pillars workforce development, national security, research, and development and then ethics, that is the paper that is coming out today. </p><p>We want our democratic values to drive this new technology, to drive this new tool not that of an authoritarian government like the Chinese government. And so this is one, a nod to all of the great work it is trying to put priorities down the road, and it is a framework from which future Congresses can work from. Regardless of who the next administration is going to be after this upcoming election, this is going to have to be a major issue, and major effort to make sure we maintain American dominance in advanced technology. </p><p>We have been doing that since the end of World War II and if anybody who thinks that the government the federal government can't do it I would say look to prior to World War II about one in eight folks in the military were malnourished or excuse me one in eight in the entire country was malnourished, and they couldn't even join the military. We addressed that with a national food program. Similarly, the basic education of someone going to the Army was fourth grade, and if you are not technically fit, you cannot be combat effective, right? These are things that we have been able to address, and likewise, I think the federal government can do it. </p><p>GRUMET: I would just note as an aside that our nutrition project demonstrates that today we have the opposite problem; about 20 percent of all folks are too obese to actually join the military, so I think you know words to understand. </p><p>Robin, you know we talk a lot about the public-private importance in this collaboration, and you have been an occasional critic of big tech. I think it is fair to say that in the last couple of years, the large you know dominant global firms have undercome a lot more heightened scrutiny and a growing mistrust of the role and the awesome power and influence that these companies have. I guess my question is that going to be an important dynamic? Is there a meaningful growing kind of mistrust of some of these private sector leaders, and how is that going to inform the congressional discussion going forward? </p><p>KELLY: Well, I think I don't know if there's a mistrust. I think we just want big tech companies to do things correctly, to do things ethically, to--I would love to see the big tech companies diversify. I think that would help in some of the decisions that they make if you look at the big tech companies not very diverse at all, but I think that Congress you know want to partner with big tech companies and see how we can work together to progress in artificial intelligence and in other areas. So I mean there are going to be some questions, that is our job to question. </p><p>I am on oversight and reform, so that is my job to question you know and watch and see what people do and companies do and agencies within the government how they carry out their job but I think that you know we want to be the leaders in artificial intelligence so we need public and private entities to help us you know move that along. So there might be questions but just only the best way I think not to put anyone down or keep anyone down or keep us from progressing. </p><p>HURD: And Jason, I want to add on to what said this is something that I have learned from Robin as we have worked together. We have laws on the books so let's make sure just like if you have a teller at a bank can't discriminate against issuing a home loan the algorithm can't either and whether it's the person using the algorithm is doing it in an improper way or it's the algorithm itself it is still a violation of the law and so let's make sure that we--all of those rules that we already have that we are following it. </p><p>Now I also think you can when you are developing something you have a different level of standards versus when you are providing it out to--to the commercial sector or to the public for ultimate use so you can have different regimes on looking at those kinds of information and so let's enforce the laws we already have. And if you want to make sure that you get rid of bias or don't have bias in the algorithm let's make sure you have a workforce that is representative of the country, and so I think why this workforce piece was so important, I think that is why we put out the workforce paper first because we have got to make sure that because this is going to impact every industry that people that are already in jobs are ready to transition and are able to be prepared for the future. </p><p>But we also have to prepare our kids for jobs that don't exist today, and that means we have got to prepare everyone and we have got to go into communities that haven't benefited from or--or were left out in the previous industrial revolutions that they are able to take advantage of this one and we can use algorithms to take bias out of ourselves, right? But that requires a diverse workforce, and that means whether you know you are coming into the government and working some of these jobs and going out to a high paying job in the private sector, but we have to make sure there's back and forth between the two industries so that we ultimately get this right. </p><p>KELLY: I also think there needs to be member education. This was not something you know high on my list, and I didn't know I was going to be the Ranking Member in IT, and I always say Will has a 30,000 foot view, and I have the 2,000-foot view of the everyday person. This was a part of his life; he was really into it, and I didn't realize how much it was a part of my life, so there needs to be member education too as we are asking questions and searching for answers. </p><p>GRUMET: Let me pick up on that. You know folks have commented that Congress doesn't understand this issue well enough to be partisan yet, that there are so many issues that are kind of (INAUDIBLE) by just core kind of tribal reaction, but this is such an undiscovered kind of set of questions that frankly there aren't a lot of engineers and scientists up there. So how do you understand this education process, and do you think that this is going to become a partisan issue, or are the dynamics here different than that? </p><p>HURD: You are on mute, Robin. </p><p>KELLY: Let me just say this, I know how it looks to the outside world, and it looks kind of ugly, but we get along much, much, much better than people think. I think Will would agree to that, and I think that again when it comes to moving the United States forward and looking at our country, other countries, and competitors that we all want to be first. We all want to continue to be the innovators and the leader, so I think that I--I don't really see this being so partisan when you look at President Obama and President Trump have invested in this and Will and I have invested in it, and when we have had meetings there have been different people. When we were on oversight Will, and I worked together along with Mark Meadows and Gerry Connolly, so I think we are off to a good start as far as being nonpartisan. </p><p>GRUMET: And Will, seriously, does the white space here pose a challenge, opportunity, or both? </p><p>HURD: I think it is actually an opportunity, and yes, I think the premise that we need to educate more members of Congress there is no doubt about that, but everybody recognizes number one the threat of the government of China, right? I think people understand that, and that is a nonpartisan issue, and then I think people understand the need for America to stay a global leader in advanced technology. </p><p>I think all of our colleagues recognize since World War II, that is one thing that has given us an edge, has allowed us to have the greatest economy on the planet, and so people understand those two things. And I would say that on some of these issues Congress is actually very well-equipped, right? This--this--this question around the ethics whether something is right or wrong these are things that Congress have been debating since Congress began and so you know where is the person in the process, right as Eric talked about early on. </p><p>These are--you don't have to understand machine learning and how that powers artificial intelligence in order to have a--a--a conversation or some input on those issues. I drive my car a lot of different places. I don't know how necessarily--I wouldn't be able to take the engine apart, but I know enough to make sure I take advantage of this tool and so I don't see this getting partisan and I think cybersecurity is a good example. </p><p>Cyber security, the fact that everybody in this country knows what OPM is and I think Robin this was like our second hearing with the big OPM act, 24 million records including mine and like literally before the Head of OPM came to the hearing I got the letter that my information was stolen right by the Chinese and so cybersecurity has stayed an important and bipartisan issue and being able to harden and defend our digital infrastructure. So I think topics like AI will. </p><p>Last year we passed a bill on focusing our national efforts on quantum computing. Artificial intelligence is important because you need data, we need high-powered compute, and you need the algorithms or advanced engineering in order to make these things work and the fact that historically Congress has shown that. We have shown that in our budgets since I have been in Congress, so I think we are I think this is going to be one of those few areas that you are going to see opportunity for people to get things done. </p><p>GRUMET: So I want to ask you Will, want to turn to the papers but you talked about a resolution, that was one of the kind of the animating ideas you know a year ago when we started this conversation and most of--what is that and what does it do and when are you going to do it and why what--what is a congressional resolution and what is the ambition behind it? </p><p>HURD: A resolution is basically giving you a sense of Congress that Congress says hey, this is the direction in which we are going. There is a word I can't believe I'm going to use it because I hate this word, jurisdiction, there are so many committees that getting a bill passed has to go through very different committees and they want to fight. A resolution can be a broader stroke and say this is the direction we are going, and this is going to recognize those previous bipartisan accomplishments, not only in Congress but in the executive branch under the previous and current administration. </p><p>It is going to assert our role in establishing national priorities on research and development. We are going to identify the need for a comprehensive strategy, and then we are going to propose these four pillars as guideposts to develop going down in the future, and that is on workforce national security research, development, and ethics and then the individual recommendations we can turn those into specific pieces of legislation, and there's an example already out there the solarium the cyberspace solarium was a similar model and so some of these pieces of resolution we may get turned into bills and get passed in this Congress or even in the lame-duck Congress but this is a framework for future Congresses and future administrations to work off of. </p><p>And so we are hoping that we are going to introduce in September, I'm going to say September Robin and we are in the--we are in the--somewhat on the (INAUDIBLE) did you just cross yourself and this is something that I think we can get done and make sure we have a good group of cosponsors to get this happen. So if anybody is watching that you are a member, you work for a member of Congress, reach out to Robin and I; we will get your boss on our--on our as an original cosponsor. </p><p>GRUMET: Remember, we are a 501(c)(3) organization, but I thank you for that opportunity. So just before we kind of turn to questions, and I want to remind folks you should be using the live chat function on Facebook or YouTube. Just turn to a couple of aspects of these papers. </p><p>Robin, you really kind of led the discussion around the workforce issues, and you know I think there is a consensus that AI is and will continue to profoundly affect opportunities in this country at a moment when jobs are appropriately high on the agenda. You know I think we all believe that this is not a V-shaped recovery, we are going to have tens of millions of people looking for new work. I think there is a crushing realization that you know tens of millions of jobs may never come back. What can policymakers do to prepare the workforce and make sure in fact that these jobs are available to all Americans? You are on mute again. </p><p>KELLY: I think you guys meet me then but anyway I think that you know it was interesting because yes, there will be many people losing their jobs but right now in the Chicagoland area we have about 20,000 jobs open that we cannot find people qualified to work and I think we need to start at you know from the beginning we need to with our kids we need to really get them interested in this if they can't see it though it's hard to achieve it and then my district is urban, suburban and rural and in my rural area 40 percent of my folks can't even go online. They don't have the broadband capacity which I hope changes with a bill that should be coming down the pike or has in Congress, hopefully, we can get it passed into law because I think we have to start there getting the young folks interested and then training people refocusing you know people's skills and talents towards artificial intelligence. </p><p>But workforce is a very big concern and then as you say COVID is lending to more people being out over but again we--we have jobs available right now that we don't have people qualified for so we have to get people trained, but first and foremost we have to get people interested because people are afraid of the (INAUDIBLE) too many people are of artificial intelligence. </p><p>GRUMET: So Congressman Hurd I want to kind of push you a little bit on the national security questions which I know you have focused on a great deal and the tension between on one hand we need to have a strategic focus that requires some degree of top-secret clearance and also a desire for kind of open-source access to what is happening in the black box. I think Eric Schmidt made the important point that we do not aspire to be the (INAUDIBLE) committee. How do you think about that tension between the need for security and (INAUDIBLE) core democratic values of openness and transparency that are so critical to our defense? </p><p>HURD: Well, I think the technology forces us to do that, right? When we talk about the ethics around this do we know how something made the decision that it made, right? And is it auditable? I think that is going to drive a lot of these conversations and we have to accept the fact like so many tools they are going to be dual-use and so--so I think going into--I think the difference of (INAUDIBLE) and the fourth industrial revolution is that we have a better understanding of the downside than we had in the other previous (INAUDIBLE) so we can be prepared for that. </p><p>The future of cybersecurity is going to be good AI versus bad AI and when you are moving within cyberspace as soon as something becomes available out there in the ether everybody has access to it, so the arms race in a digital environment is going to escalate in a fashion that we have never seen, and we have to be prepared and I loved how Eric mentioned we have got to out-innovate and we have got to run faster than our competitors, and that means we are going to always have to be training. We're going to always have to be getting better. We can't just get some places be complacent and drive on because the technology is--is going to evolve so fast. </p><p>The last 40 years and the technological explosion we have seen the last 40 years has been pretty significant, but the next 40 years is going to make the last 40 look insignificant, and so we have to be ready for that and what it means work with our partners. We should be strengthening our alliances, not weakening them because the only way that we are going to deal with this is by working with our friends, and I always say be nice with nice guys and tough with tough guys. </p><p>If you are going to try to steal our technology, guess what we are going to do? We are going to steal your engineers, and I want the best engineers coming here to the United States, and if that means your momma and your daddy need to come too, then let's figure that out, right? Because I want to make sure the best talent across the world is here in the United States of America because once they get here, they are going to love our way of doing business a lot better than being in some sweatshop somewhere you know in the middle of--of mainland China. </p><p>GRUMET: So I take that as a strong plug for bipartisan legal immigration reform early in 2021. </p><p>So I want to now turn to the questions, we have time for three or four, and then we will introduce our next panel. The first comes from Michael Cameron who asks how do you support the synergy between Silicon Valley and the federal government recognizing that many AI leaders are fighting to ensure that their technology is not used by the U.S. government? </p><p>Either one of you want to talk about how that partnership needs to work itself out? </p><p>HURD: Look, I--I think there's plenty of examples. I think Amazon AWS is a good example of how they are working with the intelligence community to make sure that we are transitioning in the cloud and able to take advantage of this new type of technology. Well, I guess the clouds not new, it's been around for a mile, and so I think there's plenty. </p><p>I think those disagreements are taken out of context, but we need to make sure that these American companies recognize that they have benefited from this system of--of government and the only way that we are going to make sure that we stay leaders is if the public and private sector is able to work together. Sometimes there's a little hubris in Silicon Valley, sometimes there's a little hubris in Langley and Fort Meade, right, and Arlington and so we have to realize that we have got to work together. And I don't believe that breaking up some of the great American companies is the way that we are going to be able to out-compete with China, and so there's going to ultimately be a middle way that we can pursue this, and these tensions and these debates are healthy for our democracy, so I think we are going to have some version of this conversation for quite some time and I think that is good for everybody. </p><p>GRUMET: So a follow-up question Robin which maybe ask you to respond to and it reflects on this question of public-private collaboration noting that the pay scales in the federal government do not compare very favorably with many in the private sector and that while public service provides great kind of psychological income it doesn't necessarily attract the best and brightest to government and so when dealing with this level of just substantive expertise and complexity how can we make sure the federal government is prepared to be an intellectual counterparty in these conversations moving forward? </p><p>KELLY: This is something that we definitely talked about a lot because we can't compete with the private sector, but we talked about things like Will had the idea I can't remember what you called it, but sort of like a AmeriCorps or we borrow your folks the private folks for a couple of years and they do service with the federal government that would be a fantastic public-private partnership to do that because we will never be able to pay unless we make exceptions but then you know do we make exceptions for the doctors that work for us? You know we could go on and on, and on so I am hoping that maybe that is a public-private partnership that we can work out that you loan us some of your best and brightest for a couple of years and people you know rotate in and out of government, but I don't think we will ever be able to pay you what you are used to getting paid and what you deserve. </p><p>HURD: You know on that--on that Robin I have a friend who runs a bunch of restaurants here in San Antonio, and he (INAUDIBLE) says--can you all hear--Jason, can you hear me okay? </p><p>GRUMET: Cutting in and out a little bit. </p><p>HURD: I have a friend here who runs a number of restaurants, and he always says the restaurant industry is the first grade of workforce. We teach a bunch of young kids how to be responsible, show up for work, and do all of these things. Can the federal government be kind of the first grade of high tech workers where you get people do we need to have a four-year degree for some things? Do you have to have a Ph.D. in data analytics to do some of these positions and so if we right-size some of these positions to get the right kind of--the skillset that you need will private industry believe they come in, you go work at DHS for three or four years, and you come out, and you will be even better, right? </p><p>Then as Robin said, I was calling it the Cyber National Guard. You do some time in the government, and then you go out into the private sector, and you come back, or you give you know six weeks a year to the federal government because you know how it operates. That means we are going to have to figure out how to sort out security clearances in a quick way, but there is--there is a way to make sure that we have this cross polymerization between the public and the private sector and it is the only way that we are going and academia as well and we have a number of--of--of recommendations around this topic of how making it easier for state employees to come do stuff on behalf of the federal government and kind of like fellowship program so this is something where we have some really strong recommendations in--in our white paper. </p><p>KELLY: Also the other thing is that the Congressional Black Caucus we have fellowships and internships, and we have had fellows that are architectures in all different types of disciplines that have absolutely nothing to do with--they are not going to work with the federal government, but they felt like it was still a great experience. They learned a lot, and they could give back also in their way, so I mean, I would love to see us be able to accomplish something like that on a larger scale. </p><p>GRUMET: Two more questions and then I am going to turn it over to our private sector experts, many of whom I heard barely made it through high school, so I think it kind of speaks to your point about technological capacity. </p><p>So the next question is that there is a concern about integrating AI into the workforce and that that is a loss of human capital and a loss of jobs, that the ability to make things more efficient could actually be shrinking the workforce at an incredibly awkward time for our country and I guess how do you respond to the robots taking over? What is that anxiety about, and how should we be addressing it? </p><p>HURD: Artificial intelligence is a tool for humans to use, right, plain, and simple? There has always got to be a human in the process, and one of the scenarios I always use is NGA, the National Geospatial Agency. The former director said that to be able to analyze all of the moving video that they have you would need to hire 2 million analysts. They are not going to be able to hire 2 million analysts, right? That is where it is like artificial intelligence is going to be able to help. </p><p>The category driver apparently is the most there is more drivers in the world than any other profession. We talk about autonomous vehicles. Well, those autonomous vehicles are unlikely to be able to fix themselves 100 percent of the way. There's going to have to be that point A to point B something is going to have to get done. That role may evolve and change, but there is going to be the need for a human there, but that means that in those industries where there is going to be an impact, we have to make sure that they are ready for that change in position. There is going to be disruption, it's going to be painful, but we can take advantage of technology before it takes advantage of us and we can help make sure that these folks are ready for potentially higher-paying jobs and use it as a tool. </p><p>GRUMET: A final question and I think you may both want to, but I will start with you Robin, and I am just summarizing, but it basically says hey, this all sounds great but how do we make sure, how do we know that when it comes to mortgages and bail and criminal prosecution that AI is not going to in fact be reinforcing social racism? What can we do to make sure this creates more opportunity (INAUDIBLE) liability? </p><p>KELLY: Well, we have to do our research around bias and fairness, and we have to use the same language, so we all are clear on what we are talking about and like I think we said before we have to make sure that we hire a diverse staff. There has to be all kind of people at the table, not just one type of person or another. We have to have a diverse staff. </p><p>I think you know that would help tremendously. Yeah, there's going to be some bumps along the way and those kind of things, but we have to do our research. We have to speak the same language, we have to be transparent, and we have to have diverse people at the table putting this together and implementing. </p><p>GRUMET: And, Will, you started off by saying we have an existing legal framework but build on that a little bit, please. </p><p>HURD: Well, I would like to add that this national strategy was helped develop with BPC's help by the first pair of African American legislators to--to run a committee together, right, and so--so we're--we're trying to be examples in that way. </p><p>So when humans were doing the bias, what did you need? You need regulatory agencies, you need Congress to oversee those regulatory agencies, and that same principle is here. That is why some of the points that we make in the white papers and in the recommendations is you need HUD, Housing and Urban Development, to understand artificial intelligence as a tool so that they know and can be aware if that tool is being used to discriminate against people. </p><p>And then the oversight committees that focus on HUD are able to understand this technology so they can ensure that HUD is doing their regulatory environment and so that is why educating not just improving our workforce we have to improve everybody that works within the federal government on the executive branch but also in the legislative branch because that is what we are going to need to make sure that these things are getting done and also that is why one of the areas of research that the federal government should double down in is on bias and how you prevent that and so these there--there is no magic wand. </p><p>I know in the previous segment somebody asked that question had magic wand; doesn't exist. I haven't found it. And so this is the process, and it starts with having a national strategy, it starts with having great organizations like the Bipartisan Policy Center helping to bring folks from all different walks of life, all different perspectives to advocate for--for these positions and it takes a lot of folks to implement these things and so we are off to a good start. I am excited, and it is a pleasure to have been able to do this with the woman, the myth, the legend my good friend Robin Kelly who I just love working my time in Congress and again Jason, your team with BPC has been fantastic, and a shout out and claps to everybody who participated in our convenings. We learned--we learn so much about this, and if you all are on, you are awesome. Thanks for making this reality, and now it's time to try to get this resolution done and start getting some bills passed. </p><p>KELLY: He loves me so much he is leaving me. I just had to throw that in there. </p><p>HURD: I love you too much I can't--I can't handle you know it makes my heart hurt, you know I love you so much. </p><p>KELLY: Come back and train the members you see put that on him. </p><p>GRUMET: So look I think you certainly have made clear to everybody what we have been so delighted to work with you and I think we are all just fortunate to have this kind of bipartisan substantive upbeat, optimistic leadership on an issue that I think is so important and challenging so we will obviously be looking forward to the September resolution. Hopefully, we will be able to come back together after that and have another discussion with you, so thank you both. </p><p>It is now my pleasure to turn to one of the other anchors in this process to moderate the second panel Chandler Morse who is the head of Workday's D.C. office and the senior director of U.S. policy. He is also a former Chief of Staff to Senator Jeff Flake. Chandler, really appreciate everything you have done over the last several months and thank you for joining us today, and I compliment your COVID mustache. That's--that's a nice new touch, so thank you for bringing that forward, but I turn it over to you to lead the next panel. You may be on mute. I think you are on mute buddy. </p><p>MORSE: There we go. Can you hear me? Excellent. Thank you, Jason. I appreciate the chance to moderate this panel of esteemed experts. I don't know about their high school credentials, as you mentioned earlier, but I do know that they have been very focused on a national AI strategy for Congress. </p><p>Workday was pleased to participate in the BPC's AI initiative and let me just take a moment to congratulate Congresswoman Kelly, Congressman Hurd. As--as a former staffer I am going to give a shout out to--to the staff too, their current and former staff Matt McMurray, Connor Pfeiffer and (INAUDIBLE) and obviously the BPC team Michelle, John, and Nino and our experts here today. The AI initiative was a terrific collaborative process and resulted in a substantive series of white papers and recommendations that our experts that we have today helped craft, and it really is going to move the needle on a congressional path forward for AI policy. </p><p>Speaking of our experts, so let me walk quickly through introductions. We have Helen Toner, director of Strategy for Georgetown's Center for Strategic and Emerging Technology. We have Dr. Nicol Turner Lee, the newly minted--congratulations--director for the Center for Technology at the Brookings Institution and Martijn Rasser, a Senior Fellow in the Technology and National Security Program for the Center for New American Security and I appreciate Eric Schmidt letting me know that I can pronounce that as CNAS. </p><p>Just a reminder to viewers to submit your questions using the live chat function on YouTube and Facebook or on Twitter using hashtag BPClive, and we will get to those in a bit. </p><p>I'm going to try to cover the waterfront of the issues that the AI strategy and the white papers touched on national security, R&amp;D, ethics and maybe a little bit of workforce if we can get there, so I have questions for everyone but please everyone sort of chime in if you have got feedback but let's get started with Helen. CSET is focused on AI and national security, and you helped draft the white paper addressing those issues. What were the major topics that you highlighted in that white paper, and was there synergy between this process and what CSET has been currently undertaking? </p><p>TONER: Yes, thanks, Chandler, and thanks for the introduction. It's great to be a part of this event today, and it's been really fantastic working with the representatives and BPC and all of the staff on this process the whole way through. </p><p>So yes, there is definitely huge synergy between the white paper, the national security white paper as well as also, in fact, some of the other white papers. You know it's really hard to fit everything into just 14 pages of body text in national security white papers, so I will try and hit on highlights without taking up the whole time we have allotted for this panel. </p><p>I think three big themes that we tried to bring out in the national security paper were firstly looking at trust and trustworthiness when it comes to the use of AI in national security settings. So trust means as Eric Schmidt mentioned and as has come up a few times if we are going to be using AI systems not only automated systems but also AI-assisted and human-AI teaming systems in national security context do the operators of those systems understand how they work? Do they understand when to trust them, when not to trust them? How those systems are coming to their--their recommendations or their decisions, and so that is in some ways a piece for--for the Pentagon and for you know DOD and the services and their training of their operators, but it is also very much a question for the systems involved. </p><p>So you know machine learning and deep learning the most advanced can kind of AI techniques that we are seeing used today are known for not being very robust, they are not very explainable or interpretable in terms of why they come to the decisions that they come to, and they have a number of other issues that make them hard to use reliably in high-stakes settings, so there is one piece here in terms of trust and trustworthiness that is about DOD process and--and implementing their ethics principles that they have--that they have written up for AI and there's another piece that's about R&amp;D and developing AI systems that are worthy of that trust and that really work reliably and are easy to understand as well. </p><p>A second big theme of the paper was cooperation and competition. So obviously we are in a long-term strategic competition with China. We have plenty to think about with Russia as well and so how do we best understand that competition, how can we understand where we are relative to those other countries, so it is difficult to find and measure good metrics for where different countries are at in terms of AI capabilities. We have done some work at CSET looking at various metrics in terms of you can look at funding amounts, you can look at talent, you can look at research papers and so on, and so forth. </p><p>So one piece is understanding what that competition really looks like and another piece is on the international stage looking at where we have opportunities for collaboration and cooperation and in fact where we have imperatives for collaboration and cooperation and so one piece there is certainly working with our allies which is going to be a huge factor if the U.S. is going to succeed in competing with China. But another piece is also cooperating pragmatically and selectively with those potential competitors as well because if AI is going to be changing how so many things work in the national security space, then we need to make sure that we are prepared for those. </p><p>And then, the third theme and I will wrap up the third theme in this national security paper was around investment controls and export controls and the need for those to be really carefully targeted and really strategically enforced. So it is one thing to just you know create bans or prevent transactions, it is another thing to really think about what--how are we trying to shape the space, what controls are available to the federal government, what controls can the U.S. use effectively, what controls do we need allied involvement for and really implementing those in a thoughtful and thorough way. So again hard to--hard to sum up all of that work briefly but I will leave it there for now. </p><p>MORSE: That's a great--that's a great job, and I know there's a lot in that paper but turning to Martijn, does CNAS help draft the white paper on R&amp;D? That paper concluded by noting that the U.S. had long been a leader in R&amp;D, but that prominence was sort of slowly being eroded. What are the potential impacts of that erosion trend, and how did you all recommend that we remedy it? </p><p>RASSER: Yeah, thank you, Chandler. That is a really important question, and Eric Schmidt already talked about this a little bit in his remarks, so the strategic competition the United States is in at its core it's all about technology, right. So technological leadership translates directly into economic and military power, and it also offers the means to shape international norms. </p><p>So, in other words, American competitiveness is rooted in its technological prowess. That is why this long-term trend of America's technological leadership eroding it is concerning, but it is also why the effort led by Congressman Hurd and Congresswoman Kelly is so important. So ultimately, we need a national strategy not just for AI but for technology generally to provide the framework for how we as a nation can best position ourselves to be competitive and to make sure our technology future is a beneficial one. </p><p>So once we formulate that strategy, we can make smarter decisions on investments in human capital, next-generation technologies, and of course, safeguarding and enhancing our innovation base, and so we make a view very specific recommendations. One that I would like to highlight is the need to spend more on R&amp;D, that's just a given not just for AI, but for federal spending in R&amp;D across the board. Specifically, for AI, we called for $25 billion to be spent annually by the year 2025. Now that seems like a big number, but if you put it in the broader perspective, it only comes up to being about 19 percent of total R&amp;D spending in FY '19 so that say very realistic and doable amount and it's also an amount that is very important because AI is going to be such a fundamental enabling technology in the 21st century that we cannot afford to shortchange ourselves there. </p><p>More broadly, though, and Mr. Schmidt referred to this as well earlier is federal spending on R&amp;D is vitally important, particularly because so much of federal R&amp;D spending is in basic research, and that is where the true breakthroughs come from. So just because we are advocating for a lot of spending in AI R&amp;D does not mean we should neglect other science and technology areas. Thank you. </p><p>MORSE: That is great. That doubling of R&amp;D spending is a pretty easy punch line or a tagline to remember. Nicol, you were an active participant in the BPC-hosted discussion about AI and ethics, and I was there, and that was an active discussion. As you and I have discussed in the past those--these--these ethics issues are they issues affecting AI that usually have the broadest range of opinions associated with them, so out of that discussion, what were the main points of consensus that emerged and did any of them surprise you? </p><p>TURNER  LEE: So yeah, so Chandler, yeah. That was a really robust discussion that we had, and I also was like one of the first people that moderated a session between Congressman--Congresswoman Kelly and Congressman Hurd around this, which made it even more interesting right because it was the first time that we actually delved into bias. </p><p>I mean let me put it like this, and for people that don't know what I do at Brookings in this new role, I lead our Center for Technology Innovation where we are particularly focused on you know regulatory legislative issues like this and in addition to that  lead our project on artificial intelligence in the area of bias. So out of the three pillars that we work on at Brookings national security, governance, and bias, I am totally immersed in this space and what I can appreciate about the BPC process and actually the conversations that we actually had is that this is a really complicated conversation, right, when it comes to defining ethics. </p><p>As a sociologist and not a scientist, a lot of what comes out of this is whose principles are we basing it on, right? Who is actually the guidepost for how we actually determine what is fair, what is ethical, what is just and at the end of the day I think all of us had common agreement that it is important to develop AI frameworks that lead with ethical--ethical principles as well as some type of fairness model that ensures that there will be minimized discrimination or harm to the consumers that the AI is touching and I appreciate the work of BPC, Jason, John, Michelle, and others who really wanted to figure out then what role does Congress play because I think when you start to look at issues of discrimination generally it becomes very complicated and when you overlay that with technology the question becomes at what part of a black box are we interested in? </p><p>Are we interested in the inputs, are we interested in the outputs and I think this is where our conversation primarily found ourselves? What I think was most surprising, and I can actually say this with a lot of confidence, is that this report lands on this issue of multicultural sensitivities. I want to say that the best conference congresspeople in the entire world, the best representatives actually dealing with this issue and they were people of color as it was mentioned in the remarks and that I think brought it to a different place around looking at diversity and inclusivity and the recommendations that are actually proposed in the report but it also I think heightens the reason why we need to have these conversations. </p><p>When we look at the state of discriminatory affairs that impacts people of color, people who are in rural communities, people who are stricken by a host of other issues their age, I mean just look at what the pandemic has done, take all of the people that have been discriminated against in the pandemic and then try and apply that model to how we actually discern you know fairness and ethics when we start looking at AI systems. What came out of this process is that we need to first start in acknowledging that bias exists and Chandler that is not always the case because we come out of a culture where it is all about building it quickly, breaking things fast and then coming back and saying I am sorry and what this process basically revealed was that having guard rails or some understanding upfront actually helps us to navigate in creating better-performing systems and systems that are inclusive, fair and diverse from both the representation side, of who was sitting at the table to the type of performance th     at we are looking at and our ability to go back and evaluate when the systems act in ways that are unlawful, unfair and unethical. </p><p>So I appreciated a lot of bad, and I also appreciated the fact when you are looking at AI systems, and again I will close here I am a sociologist, I am not a scientist. I deal in systems and structural discrimination, the pressures that create to a variety of systemic inequalities but the ability to talk to a host of policymakers in addition to companies that have a vested interest in getting it right really begins to help us sort of thing through we can do this with an all hands on deck approach and I think that was really in terms of surprise right that was interesting that we could actually get that far on issues that have potential pain points when it comes to you know very sensitive topics that can pretty much determine whether or not a person has a successful trajectory in navigating through heightened quality of life or someone's experiences are minimized due to the fact that an AI system delivered a wrong prediction that results in the rejection of a loan, housing, credit or other things that act     ually contribute to furthering inequality. </p><p>MORSE: Yeah, I think that--I think raising the multidisciplinary nature of how--of how we are going to attack these issues is certainly a take-home that I have had as well in all of these discussions so that--that is great to raise that. </p><p>Helen, I want to come back to you. You talked about how global cooperation is really important in the national security context that--that's--and Eric Schmidt mentioned this, that is sort of whether we are partnering with our allies or sort of keeping the ion our competitors. Either way, touching briefly, can you just highlight a little bit more on why that global cooperation is so important in the national security context and with EU looking at a new AI regulatory regime is it also important in the non-security context as well? </p><p>TONER: Yeah, it absolutely is. So in terms of thinking about why global cooperation is so important, I think is makes sense to break it down into two pieces. One is the allies piece and so if we are in a long-term cooperation--a long-term competition with a country the size of China it's just common sense that the United States is going to be in a much stronger position if we can make use of this really unique asset that is our alliance and partnership structure which really no other country around the globe certainly not China has a comparable structure. </p><p>One talking point that I am going to steal from a colleague of mine Melissa Flagg is to illustrate this point is to look at R&amp;D spending over time. So if you look at 1960 the United States was almost 70 percent of the total R&amp;D spending around the world. That has shrunk, that relative proportion has shrunk over time and now in I think 2018 it was below 30 percent, so the U.S. used to be by far you know the largest R&amp;D spender in the world and is now still very large but well below half, and obviously, some of that change has been due to an increase in spending by China, but it has also been due to an increase in spending by a wide range of other countries as well. </p><p>And what is really interesting about that figure is that if you look at what the proportion is of the United States plus a relatively small number of close allies, then it bumps back up above the 50 percent number. So basically, the take-home lesson there is the United States by itself is in a very different position versus the United States working closely together with allies, so that is the allied piece. I do think this piece about collaborating and cooperating with adversaries and competitors is really important as well and here it is really in the interest of all sides to make sure that as the strategic environment is changing that we have a common picture of how it is changing and what that means. </p><p>And so you know obviously the go-to example here is nuclear weapons and the way that they changed the overall strategic picture dramatically in the 1950s and '0s, and you have things like the Cuban missile crisis, and the escalation dynamics you saw there which were brand-new from all of the leaders involved prompting new types of cooperation even if very limited and even - may even though the situation between the United States and the Soviet Union at that time was much more hostile than the situation we have between the United States and--and China now. So there in the nuclear case you saw things like the red phones being installed to enable better communication between leaders. </p><p>You also saw things like permissive action links, which are technology that you put onto a nuclear weapon essentially to--to prevent accidental use and--and the United States shared that technology with the Soviets because it was in everyone's interest to have that technology kind of on all sides. So I think it's really important as AI shows the potential to shift the strategic picture in similar ways that we are having those conversations and making sure that we have the ability to--to build a shared picture on those really important topics. </p><p>MORSE: That's great. So--so Martijn I sort of drove into your swim lane into Helen's, and now I am going to drive Helen's swim lane into--into yours. You know we have talked about R&amp;D, and I want to pick on this a little bit more, and I deep dove into your background, so I have a feeling I know where this answer is going to lie but when you think about R&amp;D is it just the U.S. competitiveness issue, is it a national security issue, is it both? Like how do you sort of--how do you sort of think about both of those? </p><p>RASSER: Yeah, it's absolutely both. Ultimately you have as I--as I mentioned before like so much of U.S. competitiveness is tied up into our ability to you know develop technological prowess on a range of levels, and that is very much at the root of our national security posture now, and it also determines how we are able to interoperate with our allies and how we engage with our allies and how we stand up to our adversaries. So we made a few specific recommendations on these points. </p><p>I think one which is a very important one is what the National Security Commission on AI put forward in terms of working better with our allies on these issues, so they recommend first starting off with the Five Eyes partners then working with NATO to really evaluate what our collective strengths are in artificial intelligence and then come up with a game plan to ensure that our militaries are interoperable because that ultimately goes to the core of the alliance. That is what it is all about if the individual NATO members can't effectively fight together, then the alliance as a whole kind of falls apart. </p><p>But more broadly, of course, there's a lot of innovation in the civilian sector which is critical because if you think about how much shared interest and common goals that the United States and its allies, as well as some of our competitor countries, have it is an area like AI safety, robustness, resilience, transparency. So there is a lot that we can do together, but specifically for America's allies, we propose things like multinational innovation prize competitions. This would be similar to like the XPRIZES, which have been very successful in tackling some very difficult technological challenges, and I think ideas like this would help us to overcome some of the hurdles that we have been talking about today. </p><p>So, somebody earlier mentioned the need to be able to develop algorithms that aren't as data-hungry or as energy-intensive. So there some very important fundamental breakthroughs that we can make that really can shift the game in artificial intelligence overall. </p><p>Another area that we talked about was you know having the National Science Foundation work with its foreign counterparts in order to affect personnel exchanges because, again, we have to remember that there's a lot of AI centers of excellence around the world. Now, fortunately, a lot of them are based in allied countries, but we want to be able to benefit from that expertise and exchange ideas because so much of the scientific process is rooted in that. So ultimately I am very heartened that there is so much emphasis on multinational cooperation and collaboration on these issues. I think it's a fundamentally important tenet of what America's approach to artificial intelligence should be, and I really command BPC and the congressmen for--for really focusing on that point. </p><p>MORSE: Nicol, I am going to go back to you. Let's talk a little bit more about AI trustworthiness. Trust you know is a critical component of realizing the potential benefits of AI, but there are these persistent concerns around harmful bias and discriminatory outcomes. I think those concerns have grown with the growing attention to social and racial injustice. You and I have talked about these issues in the past, so I know you have got some ideas. It is a bit open-ended, but are there specific steps that you think both the government and private sector could take? </p><p>TURNER LEE: Yeah, I am going to try and keep this like a pastor and keep it to four points on each side because I know we are short for time. You know I think in terms of bias and discrimination clearly, I think what we discussed in our working group was really trying to think through what is the framework, right, and what are we sort of mitigating against? What are we identify when it comes to bias, and how do we actually create the right type of mitigation strategies whether it is risk assessments or these interdisciplinary conversations. </p><p>I would also suggest that I think what I love about the conversations that we had is that it is very important to make sure that algorithms and AI systems are lawful. There are laws on the books that have been litigated that define housing, fair housing, fair credit you name it you know there have been people like the Honorable John Lewis rest in peace there, that actually marched for those things to happen and so we do need to make sure that these digital systems that have sort of redefined accommodations and redefined the type of equity that has been fought for are still lawful and in the assessment of fairness we cannot make the trade-offs that just because a judge can sort of use a criminal justice algorithm to better get through caseloads that you know the idea that he may you know incarcerate or detain one less person than he would in a face to face interaction is still bad because there's overcriminalization that happens among African American men in particular in this society. So I think that was      really important and I really command BPC for coming full with that because that is near and dear to my heart. </p><p>I think what we also have to understand on the government side is what use cases do we particularly care about? During this pandemic, I have watched a lot of movies, a lot of movies, and I've gotten served a lot of recommendations of additional movies to watch. It doesn't mean that I want the government to sort of come in and legislate which movies I should watch and which movies I shouldn't but when it comes to my credit, when it comes to my employment, when it comes to my healthcare, when it comes to my use of other services they will be use cases that actually might actually need the guidance of federal regulation to ensure again that they are lawful, they are ethical and that the trade-offs are really not dismissive of my protected traits to be able to participate equitably in this economy. </p><p>I think that is really important when we start thinking about things like algorithmic disclosures. I am sorry to tell a lot of people, but Credit Karma is not going to get you a house, right? Equifax and TransUnion will because they have been sort of debated against adverse factors but most people don't understand that in the algorithmic economy so I think a lot of what we talked about in our working groups is how do you make that message known in ways that are both you know pretty clear and transparent around eligibility. </p><p>I think on the government side, the investment in anti-bias experimentation and research what we are seeing right now with NIST is absolutely fantastic when it comes to standards around facial recognition technology and other technologies that have the potential for bias. We need more of that, and I think Martijn kind of talk about you know investment in NSF. We should be investing dollars, appropriating dollars towards more anti-bias research that will allow us to multiply the inclusivity of training datasets. </p><p>I'm sorry there are facial recognition systems that cannot identify me because of the hue of my complexion or when I change my hair. Since I'm going to continue to change my hair and I'm going to continue to be black, we are going to need disclosures to tell me that those systems have limitations or the investment in research that finds out ways to include me. I think that is particularly important. </p><p>And finally, where are the areas on the government side to allot permissions to co-involve and co-innovate? It is really particularly important we start thinking about these use cases, and where we actually might need more representation or better representation to do a better job, and honestly I think the four thing that government can do which we are seeing in the paper is figure out ways to create more streams of inclusivity within these tech companies. </p><p>In the broadcast communication space, you are pretty much, it is an enforceable rule if you don't have broadcast diversity. We don't impose that on tech companies, we just want tech companies to do the right thing. Most recently, I started talking about equity dashboard that might actually be a way to sort of put out there in a voluntary manner, just how well you are doing. As others have said it is good business when tech companies are diverse. It is good business when AI is (INAUDIBLE) and Chandler you know that based on the work that you guys do at Workday. </p><p>I would just say quickly on the industry's side best practices, best practices, best practices. When it comes to quelling bias, it is important that we know what are the technical best practices, what are the hiring and workforce best practices and where are the areas that together we can learn from those things? I--I have talked to a lot of engineers who talk about blind algorithms but then use loaded proxies when it comes to actually to making determinations. We need to figure out what that looks like and I think the other thing that we need to do on the side of industry is to figure out and acknowledge that bias exists and develop a toolkit whether it's an impact assessment or bias statements or whatever the case may be that companies can sort of go into and exercise those tools to be able to eliminate and reduce the type of discrimination and harm that we don't want to see. </p><p>And so you know one last thing within the absence of federal privacy legislation all of this becomes really difficult and so I think that there should be on the industry side just more support to come up with a collaborative and cooperative strategy around privacy. I think Chandler taken together and I love John and BPC, and Michelle and what they are doing and John and I have talked about this it then leads us I think to a pragmatic stage of maybe coming up with what is next in terms of coming up with that better housekeeping seal that ensures that we are actively weeding out bias and creating more equitable and inclusive AI systems. </p><p>So that is the work that I do but again I love the fact that BPC was talking about it among a collaborative group of stakeholders so that we can move this needle along and really get to a place where we can develop and innovate you know at a central place that is not a seer of discrimination. </p><p>MORSE: That was--there--there is a lot there. You-- </p><p>TURNER LEE: I know. I know, Chandler, I know. I was trying you gave me you know-- </p><p>MORSE: I do--we do have an audience question so we will get to that in a second, but I want to--I want to piggyback on that and just offer this to Helen and Martijn because I think it builds on best practices, best practices. The national AI strategy that BPC has laid out has called for a voluntary risk management framework to help foster some AI fairness, and I think that can lead to that. </p><p>It is consistent with the National Security Commission on AI's recommendations to create a framework for the ethical and responsible use of AI and with language that was tucked into the House-passed NDAA that calls for NIST to stand up a framework. If we are going to move forward with a framework building process what--what should be a part of that? I think--I think some of that answer was in Nicol's answer but what should be a part of that framework to make it successful? </p><p>TONER: Yeah, I can jump on--jump in on this. I mean, I think Nicol laid out an enormous amount of the critical components here. One thing that I would just stand would be that it has to be--these kinds of frameworks have to be tied into the technical realities of the technology of what we can do and what we can't do and what direction the research is moving in that we might be able to do in the future and what direction it's really not and that are really more fundamentally impossible. </p><p>So I think it's really important for these frameworks to be built not solely from the perspective of what is desirable and what would we have in an ideal world but also what can we actually practically achieve and also where do we need to invest more in R&amp;D for you know it to be able to achieve better in the future? </p><p>MORSE: Martin, did you want to add to that or I can--I can-- </p><p>RASSER: Sure, I will just say well, Nicol and Helen covered it extremely well my--my two cents would be you know be creative in who you reach out to when you talk about ethics. You know talk to historians, anthropologists, philosophers. There--there is a tendency to just focus on a small subset of disciplines that could provide valuable insight, and I think you know just a very broad view of who would have important insight into these matters would be interesting to explore. </p><p>MORSE: Nicol, as our resident sociologist or human science studies do you want--do you want--is there anything you want to add on to that answer? </p><p>TURNER LEE: No. No, I actually think my colleagues actually tied it together and I totally, totally want to say amen to Helen because I think without the technical realities being invented in real-time conversations it is really hard for us to come to a central place to have a conversation around this because right now we are sort of talking over each other and that is why as a sociologist who is really focused on systems and structures it is so neat to have conversations with folks who are scientists because we can come together and I think create an interdisciplinary approach again in those use cases that really matter. </p><p>MORSE: So we have all talked about spending more, R&amp;D, research, I think--I think no matter what, and the question we got from Michael Chekam was so where does this money come from because we happen to be in the middle of a COVID economic downturn? So I just pitch that into your lap and kind of walk away if you have ideas. </p><p>TURNER LEE: I--I would say this. I mean, some of the work that I am doing at Brookings has a lot to do with like this AI label or better housekeeping seal, right? I think it is important that the money actually come in many respects from the stakeholders who are creating and developing these products and services. </p><p>At the end of the day, we are no longer in a brick and mortar society. COVID-19 has basically demonstrated just how important it is to be digitally connected and so as a result of that the game is now you know much more higher in terms of stakes of companies trying to win the trust of consumers, and we are going to come out of this really with winners around the data currency that has been expanded and those that are good stewards of our information in ways that they have high-performing algorithms as well as these abilities to address bias or remedy quickly or have feedback loops that can come back to consumers to verify you know check and verify who they are. They are going to be the winners and they don't make a lot of money, and that money needs to be at the invested back into the R&amp;D of companies to continue to not break things and say sorry later but to be much more innovative and progressive going forward. </p><p>I don't personally think that the federal government can take this on by itself. Where the federal government probably needs to spend money is trying to think through how do we enforce any of these violations that come with bias and discrimination, but I do think there will be enough change out there for companies who want to continue to win the trust of consumers to invest in themselves and to invest in these structures that make sense in this new economy. </p><p>MORSE: Helen or Martijn, anything to add? Final words? We are-- </p><p>RASSER: Oh, sure, yeah. I would just well, it is an investment in our future ultimately, right if you look at what our economy 20, 30 years from now will be based on it is the investments we make in R&amp;D today, and yes, there will be some trade-offs. That money has to come from somewhere but if you look at historically how R&amp;D investments translate into economic growth our entire economy right now is built on technologies that we funded in the '60s and '70s you know the Internet, GPS, the transistor that is what our entire economy is right now and so we can't keep coasting on those investments that we did decades ago, so we have to look to the future with this. </p><p>MORSE: And on that, I think I'm going to--Helen unless you have a short, a short addition--great. Okay, look, it's been wonderful. Thank you for a great discussion, and it's been so--such a pleasure to work with all of you, and with that Jason, I will turn it right back over to you. </p><p>GRUMET: Yeah, look, all I have to say is you guys are fantastic, and that was I think really one of the best discussions we have had a chance to host, and we are really delighted to have had a chance to do this work together, and I guess now it is time to see what the members of Congress do and then figure out if there is you know and act two. Just want to thank everybody for tuning in and really appreciate everybody's thoughtful contributions and 5 o'clock. Have a good night. </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60PD-CHY1-F15W-H0ND-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Happy Monday. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Monday, June 24th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your stop stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have breaking news this morning. A new threat from Iran, a top official warning that Tehran is capable of shooting down more American drones and calling the United States, of course, the enemy. Russia now says there could be a situation similar to the Cuban missile crisis if things escalate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite rises tensions, futures are pointing to a higher opening to the stock market. Dow futures up 55 points right now, S&amp;P futures up 6. And the Nasdaq futures higher by 20 points, quarter of a percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Investors are waiting on a slew of economic data. It is a busy week later this week, including the final reading on first quarter GDP and the consumer confidence numbers out tomorrow. This after markets edged lower on Friday.</p><p>For the week, the major indices were all higher by at least 2 percent for the week. But Friday capped the week with a decline of about 34 points on the Dow, 3 points lower on the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq lower by 19.</p><p>Global markets this morning are mixed. Take a look at European indices where the FT 100 is struggling to stay positive, up just 1 point right now. The CAC 40 in Paris is down 9 and the DAX is lower by 70.</p><p>In Asia overnight -- pardon me --0 gains across the board on optimism over trade ahead of the G-20 meeting, of course, which begins on Friday. The Shanghai composite up a quarter of a percent in China.</p><p>Little bit of a merger Monday this morning on Wall Street, Eldorado acquiring Caesars in a deal valued at more $17 billion. Check out Caesars stock this morning, Caesar's Entertainment up 14 percent on that premium. Emrise rise down 4.5 percent, owner of Eldorado.</p><p>Jeffrey the Giraffe is back. Toys r Us is opening stores this year. Find out when the chain returns coming up.</p><p>And a serious scare on the baseball diamond, a woman hit in the head by a line drive foul ball. We will bring you all the details.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Jackie DeAngelis, \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath, and PWC Partner Mitch Roschelle. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK, CORRESPONDENT: Good to be here.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: Good morning.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's on your mind?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Where do we start -- Iran? G-20? Markets? GDP?</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot happening this week and you've got all that economic data as well giving us that further window in terms of how slow are things becoming?</p><p>You've got yields dropping below 2 percent last week on the 10-year. A lot of worry that we're going to see a slowdown in the economy. We're going to get the latest data this week.</p><p>HILSENRATH: You know, one of the puzzles here is you're getting two different messages from the markets. On the one hand, you have the bond market sending bond yields very low and that suggests that the economy is slowing.</p><p>Then you have stock prices, you know, hitting record highs, which suggests that the economy isn't in such bad shape. So really mixed signals.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:: But I have another way of looking at that. Bond yields are going down because people are buying them, right. And the fact that there's a lot of bid for U.S. Treasuries also says something good about our economy. And that's all happening while we have this Iran story.</p><p>You would not think that bond yields would go down, the stock market -- the futures would be up, when we've got this Iran story.</p><p>HILSENRATH: But people buy bonds when they want safety, when they see increased risk. It makes sense that they would buy bonds when all this the Iran stuff is going on because people are worried that, you know, that that could hurt the economy.</p><p>What I don't completely get -- so when interest rates go down, that usually pushes (AUDIO GAP) but the stock market isn't going rally when we're going into a recession. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think you've got to look at all of this as a victory. I think this market would be down much more given the worries and the uncertainty over China. We've got the G-20 starting on Friday, the President will meet with President Xi.</p><p>if there was real upset and uncertainty around that, I think this market would be plummeting.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right. And it's not which is why I'm saying the market is telling us maybe things aren't as bad.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's confidence there -- exactly.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning. You saw the futures with a firmer tone. Joining the conversation this morning, Texas Congressman Henry Cuellar and Roger Williams joining us to talk Iran as well as ICE and the issues at the border. Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano is here, along with pro golfer, Bryson Dechambeau.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big two hours right here.</p><p>We kick it off this hour with this. Breaking news on Iran, Iran's naval chief is threatening the United States, saying that the rogue regime is capable of shooting down more American drones. This as the U.S. is planning to implement additional sanctions on Tehran today.</p><p>Plus Russia is now warning of a crisis comparable to the Cuban missile crisis if this continues. Oil prices have moved on all of this, they are moving higher this morning once again after last week's big 8 percent surge on the price of crude. It is now up another three quarters of a percent to $57.84.</p><p>Futures pointing to gains in stocks as well, as you saw, up 48 points on the Dow futures right now.</p><p>I spoke with House Armed Services Committee member Mike Turner yesterday. He gave me his take on the President's handling of the tensions with Iran.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where is the President on this in your view in terms of the potential military answer?</p><p>REP. MIKE TURNER (R), OHIO: Well, I think he's in the right place. And that is both he has very strict sanctions in place, he's increasing those. He's working with our European allies. And he's call for Iran to come to the table so that we can renegotiate the nuclear deal to ensure that there is no nuclear Iran.</p><p>And also very clearly calling out the dangerous maligned activities of Iran that are destabilizing in the Middle East, calling on them to, of course, end their dangerous military actions that has resulted in the tanker attacks and the drone attacks.</p><p>So he's giving them both an out at the same time he's putting on pressure and indicating that he's willing to use military force.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Florida Congressman, House Armed Services Committee member, former White House policy advisor for Defense Secretaries Gates and Rumsfeld, and former Green Beret himself, Michael Waltz. Good to see you sir.</p><p>REP. MICHAEL WALTZ (R), FLORIDA: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks very much for all of your service to our great country.</p><p>WALTZ: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Give me your sense of the seriousness of the situation. Do you expect this to end or at some point turn to military conflict?</p><p>WALTZ: Well, I do think the Iranians will continue to push. They're like a school yard bully that will continue taking lunch money until they're stopped. So that was some of my concern with not conducting the strike was that at some point the Iranians will have to be met with force. They are emboldened by weakness and they are deterred by strength.</p><p>But I do fully support the President and his maximum pressure campaign. The sanctions are working. Inflation is sky high in the Iranian economy right now. Its oil exports have gone from 2.5 million per day to 200,000 to 400,000 -- so a marked decrease in its ability to export its oil and its dealing with daily labor unrest throughout Iran and throughout the economy.</p><p>And the most important thing that I'm encouraged is we're getting consistent reporting of its proxies, Hezbollah, the Shia militias all over the Middle East and in Iraq not being able to make its payroll because Iran no longer is flush with cash to support terrorism across the region.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:: Congressman -- good morning, Mitch Roschelle.</p><p>One of the things that these sanctions do is actually penalize those -- I'm talking about the escalated sanctions that the President tweeted about over the weekend, that penalizes those who trade with Iran and hopefully putting those people on sort of our side.</p><p>Do you think that's an effective strategy to put pressure on western European trading partners of Iran to get them to put pressure in turn on Iran themselves to back off the rhetoric.</p><p>WALTZ: Yes. I do think so. And I am encouraged to see the President going to those secondary sanctions. We have to remember, and I remind my Democratic colleagues of this all the time, the reason that Iran came to the table in 2012 for the Iran deal in the first place was that we were uniform around the world in terms of the sanctions. They became desperate.</p><p>The thing that the regime cares about the most is not the Iranian people, it's its own pocketbook and its own survival. And once they became desperate, they do two things -- one they try to externalize and create a crisis somewhere else. That diverts its populace and hopefully from their perspective, unifies them.</p><p>That's what they're doing now. They've done it before, whether it was the Beirut bombings in the 80s or attacking U.S. soldiers in Iraq.</p><p>But secondly, they finally came to the table and the President has been very clear, that's where he hopes to get them again. But this time, we will cut a better deal that will also deal with its ballistic missile program, its support for terrorism and, again, right now as we speak Iran is holding Americans hostage. A Princeton PhD student, a U.N. worker and others, all of those things need be covered and that's what the Iran deal so badly missed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I'm really glad you mentioned that.</p><p>I mean Jackie -- you've covered energy and the oil space for a long time. It's a amazing to me that this is a country that has the potential -- it has one of the biggest oil and gas reserves of any country. They could be an incredibly rich nation.</p><p>They don't use that money and they don't sell that oil and use that money for the people. Instead, they use it on supporting terrorism.</p><p>DEANGELIS: They do. I think the problem is that you're not dealing with a regime that's looking at this in a rational way or like a business. It's religiously motivated. And those deep-rooted and deep-seated religious values really have sort of taken over and when that happens, you see how drastic and how dire it becomes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Congressman, I wanted to throw a question back at you regarding the retaliation that the U.S. was considering last week for the drone strikes. How do you think the Chinese and the Russians read American intentions when they see us considering a retaliatory strike but then pulling back. Is that seen as a sign of strength, of humanitarian considerations, or is it seen as a sign of weakness?</p><p>WALTZ: Well, I think from their perspective, they're looking at what are the President's red lines. And it's an indicator for them of what's proportional. This is consistent -- actually, the President has been consistent in this regard.</p><p>We sent a message through the Omani government through the Iranians that this was coming to give them an opportunity to either kind of clear those bases, those radar and missile installations out. He did the same thing for the strikes in Syria in response to chemical attacks that gave the Russians the chance to move their soldiers out.</p><p>So the President has been very clear he does not want to escalate. But at the same time, we do have to respond and we do have to show strength.</p><p>But at the end of the day, he does want to use this as leverage to drive people back to the table and have a diplomatic solution.</p><p>So for everyone wringing their hands that this president is a war monger, I think he's showing them that they're absolutely wrong. But that he will use a military option if pushed and the United States will respond.</p><p>And I think that is a very kind of clear-eyed and pragmatic approach.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about defense spending and the debate about that. The Democrat controlled House passing a nearly $1 trillion spending package for fiscal 2020 last week. This bill is allocating $733 billion to defense and national security, $17 billion less than what the White House requested. Zero republicans voted for this bill.</p><p>Congressman, your take? Is this something you would vote on or vote for.</p><p>WALTZ: I didn't vote for it. I voted no. It's $17 billion less than what the President requested and what the senate is considering. And really my issue with it was it seeks to tie the President's hand as commander in chief all over the place. From shutting down Guantanamo to repealing the Authorization for the Use of Military Force which is an authorization for us to conduct counter-terrorism activities, to seeking to overly tie the President's hands on Iran.</p><p>You know, it really was politics at its worst, frankly, and, you know, really going after I think the President in a very personal way. So I voted no. But at the end of the day, I think we as a country have to take -- and us as leaders have to take a hard look at how do we continue to fight extremism, modernize and keep pace with China, but also have a nuclear deterrent with Russia while overlaid with $22 trillion in debt and growing and that to me is the strategic question of the day that we have to get to the bottom of setting politics aside.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And as strategic is of course the question around the debt.</p><p>Let me ask you, Congressman real quick. Do you think if the President gets a second term he's going to try to attack the entitlements? I mean putting Defense spending here, putting other spending there, I mean, something's got to give, right, given $22 trillion in debt.</p><p>WALTZ: No, I'm so glad you brought that up, Maria because this is all the discretionary part of the budget. What's blowing up our debt is the nondiscretionary -- the mandatory spending which has all of those pieces and really what's within that is the exploding cost of healthcare. Whether that's in our entitlements, it's the fastest growing part of our defense budget.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you think the President will try to attack it?</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>WALTZ: Well, I think he's going to get at the cost of health care and that does not mean for the government to absorb it like Medicare (AUDIO GAP) driving down the cost, whether it's portability, selling across state lines -- all of those pieces is what he's going to get at.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman -- it's great to get your insights on everything.</p><p>WALTZ: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you.</p><p>WALTZ: All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman Michael Waltz joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, Jeffrey's come back, Toys r Us planning to open stores nearly two years after filing for bankruptcy.</p><p>Then Elon Musk's astronomical mistake, the SpaceX head confusing mars with something else. Wait until you hear this. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Bit of a merger Monday in the gambling industry. Cheryl Casone with the details now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: We'll see but it's a gamble. Eldorado Resorts buying Caesar's Entertainment in a stock and cash deal. Eldorado going to pay a 28 percent premium and see those closing price from Friday. The deal worth about $17.3 billion that does includes some debt. The plan is backed by activist investor Carl Icahn.</p><p>Included in the buy out, Caesar's Palace and the Heros (ph) Hotel chain. There is Caesar's in the premarket shooting up almost 13 percent higher in the premarket right now.</p><p>Well, another U.S. tourist has died in the Dominican Republic. 56-year-old Vittorio Caruso after becoming critically ill at a resort in Santo Domingo. And he is the 11th American tourist to die in the DR since last year. Caruso's sister-in-law telling Fox News Caruso passed away after drinking something.</p><p>Well, parents, listen up. More than 23,000 containers of baby formula are being recalled nationwide. (INAUDIBLE) voluntarily recalling Parents' Choice Advantage. Infant formula, milk based protein with iron -- milk- based powder with iron because it may contain metal.</p><p>This is sold exclusively at Walmart stores across the country. There have so far been no reports though of injury or illness to any babies.</p><p>Well, staying with the owners of Toys r Us gearing up to open new stores in time for the holidays. The plans have reportedly been in the works for months with the goal to open a half dozen or so stores and an online marketplace. Of course, that is a far cry from the 600 mega stores that closed for good last year. This new stores would also be about half the size of the all-locations but bringing back the Toys r Us brand for the holidays, seems like kind of fun for (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's great.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good for them that they were able to do that.</p><p>Thank you Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, crude surging. Mideast tensions sending oil prices higher. Up 8 percent last week. It is set to hit your wallet as well.</p><p>Then this, \"Toy Story 4\" taking the top spot at the box office this weekend, but the opening was weaker than expected. We've got all the numbers for your weekend watch.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Oil prices are up this morning amid increasing tensions between the U.S. and Iran. Joining us right now is Lipow Oil Associates president Andy Lipow. Andy -- good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ANDY LIPOW, PRESIDENT, LIPOW OIL ASSOCIATES: Good morning-- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you expect further increases to the price of oil, given these uncertainties around Iran now?</p><p>LIPOW: Well, I do, because we've seen a number of these low grade attacks by Iranian proxies in Saudi Arabia. The most recent on a desalination plant a week ago on an airport arrival call. In May there was a drone attack on a pipeline and all these attacks makes the oil market very nervous, including the explosions we saw on those the two tanker.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Even though Iran oil is not where you would expect on the global market -- I mean yes, there is still deals because of waivers that the Trump administration put out there, but you're not really seeing the kind of oil on the market from Iran that -- you're not expecting it.</p><p>LIPOW: No, I'm not expecting Iranian oil to return to the market. In fact, I mean, the Trump administration has eliminated all of the waivers. We are seeing some Iranian oil leak out from companies that are still willing to do business with them. But the Iranian oil is off the market. The Venezuelan oil production is way down. These are just supportive for oil prices.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Andy -- we always talk about how much oil is coming out of the United States now and it certainly is remarkable. But I always remind people that it's different grades. It's lighter here than what we see coming out of the Middle East, for example, and that's why you saw that 8 percent move.</p><p>But still on a relative basis last week, that wasn't a huge move for oil. So how do you see that balance between the two mixes of crude and these percentage moves, depending on how high this escalates?</p><p>LIPOW: Well, you're absolutely right that the (AUDIO GAP) this lighter grade of crude oil but (AUDIO GAP) is that the rest of the world are find rest of the world is being able to adapt to that quality.</p><p>In fact we're now seeing cargoes go to places like Vietnam or Indonesia where they are just looking for alternative supplies. So while it's not exactly the same quality, the refining industry is able to cope and it is helping to make up some of the shortfall that we're losing from others areas.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Hey Andy -- this is a bit of a hypothetical but let's say the United States did not have a fracking boom going on right now, where would the oil price be, if the U.S. hadn't turned into such a big producer? How big a crisis would we be in with what's going on in the Middle East and Iran right now?</p><p>LIPOW: Well, if we didn't have this fracking boom and to keep in mind that we're producing over 12 million barrels a day, up from about 5 million barrels a day five to seven years ago -- frankly the world would see much higher prices, well north of $100, probably between $120 and $140 a barrel, because the reserves or the reserve production capacity in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the emirates is only about 3 million barrels a day. So oil prices would go up to encourage production elsewhere in the world.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Is it fair to say we would be in recession right now, with an oil price of $120 to $140 a barrel?</p><p>LIPOW: Well, we probably would, because this harkens back to the days of 2014 or 2008 when we did see oil prices spike to about $140 a barrel and the world economy was slowing down.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Andy -- Mitch Roschelle. Real quickly, who are the primary traders with Iran? We've been talking about sanctions all morning. I know we're talking about secondary sanctions. But who are the countries that are most impacted by not being able to buy Iranian oil?</p><p>LIPOW: Well, the most impacted are countries like China, India, Japan, Korea and Taiwan, because of course the Iranian oil didn't come to the U.S. Meanwhile, in Europe you had countries like Greece, France, Italy and Spain which were large importers of Iranian oil prior to the sanctions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Andy -- you've got all these uncertainties about Iran. How do you see this playing out? What's your best case scenario here in terms of the Iran conflict and its impact on oil?</p><p>LIPOW: Well, I don't think the Iran conflict is going to go away anytime soon. The Iranians are not interested in talking to the U.S. and so as a result I'm expecting that Brent prices are going to move towards $70 a barrel and WTI prices are going to increase to between $60 and $62 a barrel because these tensions just are not going away in the near term.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Andy -- great to get your insights this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>LIPOW: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Andy Lipow and really, what a stunning answer to your question -- really important question that you asked, $100 plus oil would be and potentially recession, if not for the U.S. fracking boom.</p><p>HILSENRATH: That changes not just the economic landscape but also the geopolitical landscape for us. It completely changes how we deal with countries like Iran or Venezuela when we've got a problem like this. This is a worry that we don't have to have on the table.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Talk about national security, it's right there.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. Great interview there.</p><p>Coming up, the FBI is looking into a healthcare startup and its billing methods. More on the investigation right after this.</p><p>And then Mars mix-up. Tesla, SpaceX chief Elon Musk confusing the red planet with another astronomical body. His out-of-the world mistake coming up.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, June 24th. Your top stories right now, 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>We have breaking news this morning and that is the new threat from Iran. A top official warning that Tehran is capable of shooting down more American drones and calling the United States the enemy. U.S. Special Representative Brian Hook says the U.S. is prepared to restore diplomatic ties with Iran and lift sanctions if Tehran is willing to do a deal but a deal must come first. The U.S. is expected to put additional sanctions on Iran today.</p><p>Despite rising tensions, Futures are showing a market that will open higher this morning, Dow Futures up 54 points, S&amp;P Futures up five and the NASDAQ Future right now up 19 points.</p><p>On top of fractional losses on Friday, the S&amp;P actually hit a new high intraday but was unable to keep the gains by the close. The DowIndustrials were down 34, the S&amp;P was down three points and the NASDAQ was lower by 19.</p><p>In Europe this morning, much of a mixed story. Take a look, FT-100 has now turned negative, down two points. The CAC Quarante in Paris is down seven and the DAX Index in Germany is lower by 72.</p><p>In Asia overnight slight gains across the board as China confirms President Xi is headed to the G20 this week where he will meet with President Trump. That is expected this Friday.</p><p>The FBI investigating uBiome. The lab testing company is accused of improper billing and unnecessary tests. The role the doctors played coming up.</p><p>Plus, a fan hit in the head by a foul ball at Dodger Stadium, renewing calls for extending nets.</p><p>Plus, this, Elon Musk's out-of-this world mistake, the Twitter backlash coming up. All those stories coming up this Monday morning.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour, investigating the investigators. On \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" I spoke with former House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy about the mysterious FBI transcripts related to the Russia probe that have yet to see the light of the day.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Talk to us a bit more about those transcripts that have the power to persuade. What exactly are we looking for? What's most damning?</p><p>TREY GOWDY, FORMER CHAIRMAN, HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE: Well, I think any time law enforcement talks to a target or a potential target, they're either going to record that conversation or they're going to monitor it in real-time and take notes. Some of us have seen transcripts of those conversations. And I was supportive of Mueller. I was supportive of the idea to initiate -- to investigate what Russia did. But when I saw this transcript, it actually changed my perspective.</p><p>This really matters. When you have exculpatory information and you don't share it with a court, when you give two different kinds of defensive briefings to the candidates depending on who you like and who you don't, then your bias begins to impact the investigation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano. And judge, it's always great to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think what Trey Gowdy was talking about there was the conversation between George Papadopoulos who says he had informants run at him and the government -- I don't know that I want to say, this informant was working with the west or working with international intelligence. But there's a transcript there that shows George Papadopoulos actually did nothing wrong and that transcript was not given to the FISA court.</p><p>There's also a situation as you know, Christine (INAUDIBLE), she was the number two person at the State Department or at the DOJ working in Europe. She did her due diligence on the -- on the Christopher Steele work, the dossier, and she wrote in her memos to the FBI director, Jim Comey, saying Christopher Steele is not credible. His Steele dossier is not credible. This information, we should not be believing. That memo was not given to the FISA court. Your reaction?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, even the drip, drip, drip continues of obvious FBI and Intelligence Community bias against the candidacy of Donald Trump and the use of the levers of power in order to disrupt his candidacy or as we know after he was inaugurated disrupt his presidency. I'm disgusted by this but I'm not surprised by it (AUDIO GAP) lives.</p><p>And I've mentioned, being on the bench on an era before computers and before even word processers, and in that prior life I was scandalized at times by bias on the part of prosecutors but quite frankly, I've not seen anything like this.</p><p>Now, when you go to a judge, whether it's a FISA court judge or a judge hearing applications for a criminal search warrant, as I did hundreds and hundreds of times. You often -- the judge expects that you're going to lay out everything that you know and rarely does that happen. Usually the people going to the judge will only tell her or him enough to get her or him to sign the search warrant. I can remember years later --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And judge, there's no obligation to provide everything at that point?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: There is no obligation to provide everything at that point and the government knows it. I remember trying a case once, and I looked at this information and I said how did you get a search warrant based on this? Turns out I had signed the search warrant two years earlier. But they didn't tell me what I learned on the court room. So, on the bench during the trial, I invalidated the search warrant that I had signed two years earlier which kept them from telling this stuff to the jury because it was obtained by tricking me. That is effectively what happens when FBI agents or NSA agents with FISA don't tell the court the full story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's FISA abuse. I mean --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- you know, if you have actual data showing that one of the leadership people at the DOJ in Europe says Christopher Steele's information should not be trusted and you don't even put that in front of the FISA court, I would say that sounds like abuse to me. You're only putting the selective things in front of the court to get a warrant to --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: And what did they do to hide the transcript or the statement from this woman who years ago that the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, well they've been sitting on it.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: -- stuff was invalid. Look, the Christopher Steele stuff is extremely troublesome and problematic. He was a double agent. He was an agent for the Brits while he was being employed by the FBI. That is a profound violation of the group of the Five Eyes, the five western countries that share intelligence regularly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And of course, the Steele dossier was paid for by the Clinton campaign, so by a political opponent.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Were these -- were these investigations damaging to the Trump candidacy or to the Trump presidency? What were they more damaging to?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I don't think they were damaging to the Trump candidacy at all. I mean, he prevailed. Were they damaging to the president say, sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, how about damaging to the country for the last 2-1/2 years, we've been having our heads on fire talking about the president colluding with Russia?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You know, he sometimes puts spin on things but he makes a very strong case when he says the first year -- first two years of his president were materially damaged by this. I don't know that this is what they expected. I think they expected something down and dirty and fast which would have prevented him from becoming president in the first place.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, after all, Peter Strzok told us what he wanted. He wanted an insurance policy, so there you go.</p><p>We got to move on to your tech and your data, because this is also really important. A bipartisan effort from two senators looking to crack down on companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon to force them to reveal the value of user information. I spoke with House Intel Committee member Devin Nunes on this on Sunday, asking him about his lawsuit. Nunes is now suing Twitter. They have a court date on the calendar in August. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have sued Twitter as well as McClatchy. Tell us about that.</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): Well, the Twitter one is important. We start the discovery process tomorrow. So we will be sending out a bunch of subpoenas and ask him for information from all the folks that were involved in allowing Twitter to not only develop content but also shadow ban me so your viewers and Americans couldn't see my tweets for a period of time. We don't even know how long.</p><p>So I'm very worried about this for the next election, whether -- you know, I call the tech oligarchs, whether it's Twitter or Google or Facebook. It always seems like most of the time it's the conservatives that get kicked off and you can't see our platforms or we -- you can't see us on their platforms where the left, they get away with murder.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is exactly what you brought up earlier, Jon Hilsenrath. And judge, what about this? Because apparently there was a situation just recently where there were some negative commentary about Alexandria Ocasio- Cortez that was taken down immediately. Meanwhile, there's all these other additional accounts against Nunes, Devin Nunes' mother and all this stuff that's fake and they're not taken down.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, I think that Congressman Nunes is doing the right thing. He can do two things. He can -- he can sue because he's an American citizen, he has access to the courts. He's also a very significant member of Congress and he can introduce legislation to regulate this. I hope he doesn't do the latter. The worst thing that can happen would be for the government to be regulating free speech. Even though it is apparent that his free speech was crushed and materially interfered with by Twitter. It is a private entity, it's not regulated by the first -- by the First Amendment. The last thing we want is the Feds or some entity controlled by the Feds telling Twitter what to omit and what to permit.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But they -- but they are looked at differently, right? Because they're not -- they're not seen as media companies. They say we're not media companies, we're just internet companies. So what's the difference in terms of how they are overseen?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, they were -- they would have certain protection if they were media companies. For example, not revealing sources or publishing information which was stolen but which is true, the Julian Assange model. They would argue in that case they are media companies.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I don't think -- I would think they would want to be seen as media companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what you said earlier.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH: They're protected by the First Amendment.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes, well, anybody that speaks is insist protected from the government by the First Amendment. But the harm to Congressman Nunes is as a person, not as a -- not as a member of Congress. This is -- the government is not involved in his case other than providing the forum in which he's pushing his lawsuit.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: But if you have a news platform and you use Twitter or social media as your then platform to launch it, you yourself are protected by the First Amendment, correct? (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes. So, look, I don't know where this is -- this is going to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Pretty big story.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: But the government should not be -- it's a huge story. But the government should not be in the business of regulating speech. If Twitter --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what do they do then? I mean, you want a competitive element.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I do -- I do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You want somebody to come in and take it away from Twitter.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I realize that there are barriers to entry because of the cost is enormous and Twitter is a humongous in size but competition improves the product.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Google has 90 percent of all searches?</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: It's going to be hard to get in there with that kind of market share.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Google and Twitter, they're just going to a one day touch the wrong raw nerve and all of a sudden competition will emerge.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, is that the government's way into this, not in as a First Amendment issue but as a monopoly issue, that these companies dominate the airwaves and the search waves and t they need to be --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: This is -- this is not a true monopoly like AT&amp;T was before the breakup of the Bell System where the government said, you're a monopoly and nobody can effectively compete with you. This is one of those things where people go to them because they deliver the goods that people want and they don't charge for it.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: By the way, there is a Chinese alternative to Google, so --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: What is that called? The Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Speaking of government interference, I don't think there'll be a problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, there you go. Judge, really important topics. I know that we'll keep talking about them. Thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Pleasure guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Judge Andrew Napolitano there.</p><p>Coming up, a scary moment at Dodger Stadium, a foul ball hit a woman in the head yesterday. Her condition, the very latest, next.</p><p>And then \"Toy Story\" miss, the film taking it to infinity but not beyond Box Office expectations. The numbers, coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The FBI is investigating a promising medical startup. Cheryl Casone with the details in headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, that's right, Maria. The FBI is looking into lab testing startup uBiome. Agents looking into whether the company used improper billing codes for insurance claims. This is according to a report in the Wall Street Journal and also that they sought payment for unnecessary testing. And this investigation also involves the doctors who ordered those tests. uBiome raised $83 million in financing last fall.</p><p>Well, Beyond Meat's brand-new products hitting shelves today. You can now get plant based ground beef at several grocery chains including Whole Foods and Wegmans. The ground beef is a blend of pea, mango bean and rice. This comes just about a week after Beyond Meat introduced a new patty. The company stock slightly lower in the premarket, only $150 in change right now. This has been a big IPO this year, we should say.</p><p>And then, Elon Musk triggering an out-of-this world Twitter storm after mixing up the moon and Mars. Musk tweeted a picture of the moon yesterday with a caption, occupy Mars. Well, many of his Twitter followers had to correct the SpaceX CEO. An Australian scientist with a Twitter handled the Jupiter girl tweeted, super space genius, that's the moon with a total lunar eclipse, oops.</p><p>All right, and there is this, \"Toy Story 4\" lit up the Box Office over the weekend but it didn't quite go to infinity and beyond.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WOODY: Change of plans. Jessie, Hamm, Buzz, Bo, Rex, Potato Heads.</p><p>MR. POTATO HEAD: Watch it, buddy.</p><p>MRS. POTATO HEAD: What do we do?</p><p>WOODY: Let's go save a spork.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: The Pixar sequel earned $118 million in its debut. That was actually below the $140 million Pixar's parent company Disney expected to get for this film. But it did finish way ahead of the competition. \"Child's Play\" was a distant second, followed by \"Aladdin\". There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm surprised Elton John is not on that list.</p><p>CASONE: I know, so much buzz about \"Rocketman\".</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly, \"Rocketman\".

Now this, another fan injured by a foul ball at Major League Baseball. Jared Max with the story now, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Maria, safety measures are coming soon to protect baseball fans. But for now, many remain in the line of baseball fire. Yesterday's Dodger's game, a young woman got hit in the forehead by a foul ball here hit by the Dodgers' Cody Bellinger. The fan was hospitalized for precautionary tests.</p><p>Last August the Dodger Stadium a foul ball proved fatal to one woman. Last month a young cubs fan was badly injured by a foul ball. And last week, the White Sox said that they are going to add protective netting that will extend all the way to both foul balls. A measure that Cody Bellinger yesterday agreed with after the accident. He says to protect those fans in the front row that don't have the reaction time.</p><p>Dodgers made baseball history yesterday, first team to win three straight games on walk-off hits by rookies. The rookies beat the Rockies, will smith with the homerun.</p><p>Just over four hours until kickoff, Women's World Cup soccer, it is a must win today for team USA against Spain. We are into the knockout stage of the Women's World Cup. The loser goes home. The winner moves to the quarter finals against France on Friday.

This story reads like something out of the Jetsons cartoon. But in 2024 at the Paris Olympics, there's a chance that people will be able to hail flying taxis to get from the Gaulle Airport right into the city.

In its Annual Report, released at its annual general meeting (AGM) on Sunday in Switzerland, the BIS contends sans frills that the vulnerabilities are 'worrisome', given the more limited room for policy manoeuvre relative to pre-crisis of the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) that engulfed the world a decade ago. Since 2008, it said, historically low, even negative interest rates and unprecedentedly large central bank balance sheet have provided important support for the global economy and contributed to the gradual convergence of inflation towards objectives. Yet, central banks the world over were largely left to \"bear the burden of the recovery, with other policies, not least supply side structural ones, failing to take the baton\".</p><p><br/> Stating that as a consequence the recovery was unbalanced and central banks were overburdened, BIS maintained that since the crisis both public and private debt has soared in relation to gross domestic product (GDP). Easy financial conditions have led to more leveraged households or corporates in many economies with the depreciating U.S dollar fanning a build-up in dollar-denominated debt in emerging markets. These vulnerabilities have heralded problems in previous episodes, including recessions, the BIS warned.<br/> In his remarks at the AGM, BIS General Manager Agustin Cartsens argued that even as the current economic upswing noticeable in the global economy still relies on extraordinary support from central banks, the latter might find it difficult to manage both financial stability and price stability objectives of the apex bank. Pointing out that the stronger performance of the world economy gives \"a window to pursue necessary reforms and recalibrate policies, he warned that the opportunity\" should not be missed. The BIS report duly cautioned that the role of financial forces in business fluctuations has grown substantially since the early 1980s across the globe when financial liberalisation took hold. And post-crisis (2008), the weight of non-bank intermediaries, such as asset managers and institutional investors, has risen substantially and is likely to sway the dynamics of any future episodes of financial stress in familiar but also some unexpected ways. One possible trigger of an economic slowdown or downturn could be an escalation of protectionist measures, it said adding that the impact could be very significant if such escalation was seen as threatening the open multilateral trading system. Without referring to the US tariff hike on aluminum and steel on China and a host of other trading majors with equally strong trade reprisals from the rest, the BIS said \"there are signs that the rise in uncertainty associated with the first protectionist steps and the ratcheting up of rhetoric have already been inhibiting investment\". It further cautioned that \"were the recent reversal in the U.S dollar depreciation to continue, trade negotiations would become more complicated\".<br/> A second possible trigger could be an abrupt decompression of historically low bond yields or snapback in core sovereign bank yields, notably in the U.S as a fall-out of only mild inflation surprises, following the steady reversal of ultra low-interest policy. If US yields jump, that would spread tighter financial conditions around the world. The latest tightening of financial conditions, including the dollar appreciation, has already sparked stress in some emerging markets such as Argentina and Turkey. Thirdly, a reversal in global risk appetite could push core yields the other way, fanning the buildup of vulnerabilities. This could be triggered by concerns about sovereign debt sustainability or political events, for instance, as recently seen in the euro area periphery as well as some emerging markets.<br/> Laying out a raft of measures for global financial market stability, BIS said the first line of action is to redouble efforts to implement structural policies, which remain by far the only way to raise sustainable growth without generating inflationary pressures. It said structural policies, in particular, can alleviate the dilemmas monetary policy is now facing and that are narrowing its room for maneuver. The essence of the reforms is to render product and labour markets flexible, enabling them to allocate resources more efficiently and to absorb technical innovations more easily.<br/> The second line of action is to strengthen further the resilience of the financial system, which requires completing and consistently implementing the post-crisis financial regulatory reforms. Ideally, where appropriate, this should be complemented by steps to remove structural impediments to banks' efforts to attain sustainable profitability, which is critical to absorb any losses smoothly and swiftly should these materialise at some point. Instances of such steps encompass tackling the obstacles to the necessary consolidation and cost-cutting. This is also especially important at the current juncture when banks have been facing the dual interest margins and growing competition from new technology-savvy players such as big tech and fin-tech companies. Without much ado, BIS states that strengthening resilience also requires the active deployment of macro-prudential measures in those economies where financial imbalances have been building up and the improvement of macro-prudential frameworks more generally. Macro-prudential framework is meant as the use of (primarily) prudential tools to target specifically systemic risk and mitigate its macroeconomic costs. Thus the macro-prudential approach to regulation and supervision differs from the more traditional micro-prudential one as the latter focuses on the assessment of the risks institutions face on a standalone basis, with little consequence to the financial system as a whole or the macro-economy. The third line of action is to ensure the sustainability of public sector finances and to preclude pro-cyclical fiscal expansions. The importance of this cannot be emphasised enough, it said adding that public debt has risen to new peacetime highs in both advanced and emerging market economies. As fiscal space is likely to be overestimated in countries where financial imbalances have been imperceptibly building up, fiscal consolidation is a priority. This is a principal takeaway from this year's thoughtful BIS tome as India is facing a general election next year with the incumbent government fain to indulge in all sorts of sops and populism to get itself re-elected with scant regard to the much-needed fiscal consolidation and in extension the financial stability of the economy, policy wonks wryly say. With India's Urjit R Patel, Governor, RBI being a member of the Board of Directors of this prestigious grouping of the BIS and who relentlessly battled the inflation demon to get the blame for being not pro-growth, how would he handle the situation if the North Block is slack on the fiscal front to score some brownie points by way of patronising the vote banks with no fear for the cruelest form of taxation as inflation is so grimly and graphically portrayed?<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MILPNW-n10560267</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MILPNW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SN5-KC81-DYDW-72WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1232\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Millennium Post Newspaper</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 26, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001Z8E</classCode><className>BANK FOR INTERNATIONAL SETTLEMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000797</classCode><className>GLOBALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A51F</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CRISIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001768</classCode><className>US DOLLAR</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000913</classCode><className>INFLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000436</classCode><className>CURRENCIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008WZA</classCode><className>ECONOMIC DECLINE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009890</classCode><className>PROTECTIONISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001457</classCode><className>RECESSION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008X0S</classCode><className>ECONOMIC RECOVERY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000816</classCode><className>GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000094</classCode><className>ANNUAL REPORTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000542</classCode><className>ANNUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

Rutenberg[1] Thomas H. Wagner[2] Polsinelli PC[3] Polsinelli BitBlog | FinTech [4] The end of July saw continued regulatory activity in the digital assets space. This entry of BitBlog will cover some of the highlights.1) The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') continues to dole out bits of guidance via their rulings as to when digital assets can be sold and under which circumstances they can or cannot be considered securities. In this case, the SEC issued a no-action relief letter to Pocketful of Quarters, a company developing a video game currency platform that leverages blockchain technology to reduce fragmentation in the in-game currency market. This no-action relief follows on the heels of the no-action relief received by TurnKey Jet in April but goes significantly further, allowing greater flexibility in the use of the ERC-20 standard that is built on and exchanged through the public Ethereum blockchain. </p><p>In both the Pocketful of Quarters and TurnKey letters the SEC identified important factors in its decision making, such as the network being fully developed and operational before the tokens are issued and that the tokens are to be immediately capable of being redeemed for their intended purpose as a currency and not as an asset to be traded. The Pocketful of Quarters no-action letter represents an important step forward for market innovators attempting to develop functional and compliant digital assets in concert with the SEC's efforts to provide clarity regarding the regulation of digital assets. For more information on this subject please see our blog post[5].2) The New York Department of Financial Services ('DFS') announced that it was setting up a Research and Innovation Division[6]. This new division is designed to encourage innovation in the financial services marketplace and maintain New York's status as a competitive financial innovation hub. The DFS will be responsible for licensing and supervising virtual currencies. Given that New York is known for its beleaguered, expensive, cumbersome and generally problematic BitLicensing process, the fact that the state is working to foster innovation is good news. DFS Superintendent Linda Lacewell stated that the establishment of the Division, 'positions DFS as the regulator of the future, allowing the Department to better protect consumers, develop best practices, and analyze market data to strengthen New York's standing as the center of financial innovation.' Time will tell if this new division lives up to its promise.3) Before going into its summer recess, the U.S. Congress continued its slate of hearings related to the FinTech space. These hearings received extensive public attention, particularly those held on July 16th and July 17th related to the announcement by Facebook of its intention to launch a digital currency called Libra. During the hearing legislators expressed a large degree of skepticism and Facebook representatives appeared surprised and somewhat unprepared for the level of opposition Libra received. These hearings continued on a somewhat more optimistic note with the Senate Banking Committee testimony on July 30 in a hearing entitled, 'Examining Regulatory Frameworks for Digital Currencies and Blockchain[7].' At the July hearing the many senators appear open to innovation in this space as long as it was regulated and they expressed particular concern about potential abuses on the part of 'big tech companies.' Although Congress is on break for the remainder of August, more hearings are expected in the fall, notably the House Financial Services Committee will hold hearings on securities law exemptions including regulation A+, which is a limited form of public offerings that is increasingly being eyed for use in the digital assets space, particularly by Blockstack.4) On July 31, 2019, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published its final guidance regarding crypto-asset activities and the scope of its regulation. This guidance has been in progress for a long time and is the product of much consultation with regulators and market participants. Unlike in the SEC where crypto-asset regulation is divided among many regulators, both state and federal, in the UK the FCA is responsible for the implementation of the vast majority of financial regulations. A core purpose of these guidelines is to help the FCA and market participants determine whether the activities they are conducting are regulated.The FCA divides digital tokens into three groups; 1) Exchange Tokens, 2) Utility Tokens and 3) Security Tokens. However, even after considerable feedback the distinction between these types of tokens is not altogether clear. Bitcoin and Ethereum are classified as Exchange tokens and are, at least for now, outside of FCA regulations. This is in contrast with Security Tokens which covers shares, debentures and units in a collective scheme under FCA regulation. Utility Tokens exist in the gray area between Security Tokens and Exchange Tokens. These tokens do not meet the definition of a security but may still be subject to e-money rules. With Facebook's Libra looking to be only the first of many private currencies we will see if these guidelines become the basis for some sort of global regulation.Separate from this guidance, and somewhat more controversially, the FCA also just proposed to ban retail investors from investing in all types of crypto derivatives. FCA proposes ban on sale of crypto-derivatives to retail consumers[8] PS19/22: Guidance on Cryptoassets[9] Guidance on Cryptoassets: Feedback and Final Guidance to CP 19/3[10] 6) Back in the United States the litigation related to Mt. Gox looks to continue for the foreseeable future. The Japanese exchange at one point handled over 70 percent of all bitcoin transactions, but collapsed in 2014 amid allegations of hacks, fraud and theft. On July 30 Philadelphia District Judge Robert Kelly ruled that a class action lawsuit against Mt. Gox CEO Mark Kapeles can proceed after denying a request to dismiss for lack of jusidisction. Discovery might prove very interesting in this one.

Kirby[1] Big Bitcoin news dropped today. In a series of tweets, President Donald Trump attacked Bitcoin, Facebook's Libra, and cryptocurrencies in general. His tweets are reproduced here: I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. </p><p>Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity. .Similarly, Facebook Libra's 'virtual currency' will have little standing or dependability. If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National and International. We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar! He's got crypto all wrong. Cryptocurrencies (and especially Bitcoin) ARE money. This is basic finance. Money is whatever people agree upon it being and people all over the world are constantly using Bitcoin to buy and sell things. So what if cryptos are volatile? So are a lot of other financial products. People should know that before they buy them. In fact, many people buy them BECAUSE they are volatile. Don't restrict our freedom of choice, Mr. President. Bitcoin is not based on thin air. It is the product of electricity and computing power. A strong argument can be made for Bitcoin having more intrinsic value than the US Dollar. If you are concerned about cryptocurrencies being unregulated, Mr. President, then why don't you regulate them? Please let us know what the rules are. Please stop with your hypocrisy here. Bitcoin is not the currency of choice for illicit drug sales and other unlawful activity. The US Dollar is. Bitcoin transactions are INHERENTLY traceable while national currencies such as the US dollar are not. If he wants to stop the sale of illicit drugs, then he should try going after the Central Intelligence Agency and the big banks, not Bitcoin. If Facebook's Libra has little standing or credibility, then why do you care about it? Let it fail. This is the free market, Mr. Trump. I thought you were a big supporter of free trade. If you think that Facebook's Libra operates like a bank, then go ahead and regulate it as such. That's fine. We're waiting. Bitcoin, on the other hand does not operate like a bank and should not be regulated as such. I'm afraid you're stuck with it, Mr. President. You couldn't stop it if you tried. If you do try by putting onerous regulations on cryptocurrencies, then other countries will simply issue much lighter regulations and those countries will be the ones to take the lead in the crypto space.Declare Your Independence! Profit outside the rigged system! Protect yourself from tyranny and economic collapse. Learn to live free and spread peace!Counter Markets Newsletter - Trends ...rategies for Maximum FreedomThe US dollar is not stronger than ever, Mr. President. It was much stronger before it was taken off the gold standard by your friend Nixon. Further, the US Dollar was much, much better off before the private United States Federal Reserve Bank came into existence in 1913. If Trump does not support crypto, then he must end his hypocrisy and provide us with a better US Dollar. The only way to effectively do that is to get rid of the current Federal Reserve Bank situation. He has spoken out against the Fed, but simply speaking out is not enough. He needs to DO SOMETHING and he has made no apparent and significant moves against the Fed thus far. There's been lots of talk, but nothing of substance. Backing the US Dollar with precious metals would be a good idea, but we have seen no substantive moves in this direction. Put up or shut up, Donald. We're tired of the private Fed's tyranny and we are repulsed by your hypocrisy. Bitcoin is the free market solution to the Fed's destruction of the US Dollar. It is no secret that some of the most, if not THE most powerful forces behind the rise of Bitcoin are in this game because they are fully aware of the Fed's financial tyranny and want a better alternative. When Trump bashes Bitcoin, he is speaking in favor of the private Federal Reserve Bank and their monopoly over the issuance of currency and credit. This is hypocrisy because, while he positions himself as a big critic of the Fed, he also speaks out against the free market alternative to their product.Let me clarifyBeing that this piece is an op-ed, let me opine further. Don't get me wrong, I still love Donald Trump and I understand his position. I just disagree with him here. When it comes to President Donald Trump, there's a lot to like. On his rise to the presidency he took out the two most powerfully corrupt political dynasties in the Country: the Bushes and then the Clintons. He crushed ISIS like the limp-wristed Obama never did. He's securing the border. He's standing up to the deep state, China and all the other great tyrannies of the world. He's making peace on the Korean peninsula. The economy is doing great. He got rid of the TPP. Big Tech is on their heels. I still have faith that the chemtrail issue is being addressed and that they will cease under a Donald Trump presidency. Especially for Libertarians and Conservatives, it suffices to say that this president's positive achievements just go on and on, and he's not even half-way done. Further, I understand his position. He is defending our National currency. He is defending America. That's his job and he is doing it. Bitcoin holds tremendous potential to wreck the US dollar and national currencies around the world, and it therefore has the potential to wreck the entire global financial system; which is based on national currencies. If Bitcoin wrecks the global financial system, in the short-term, it will only be good for those who hold Bitcoin and that is currently a very small fraction of American society. Although an argument could easily be made for people to simply get off their butts and buy Bitcoin, Trump is not here to do that. Trump apparently likes to play hardball, so the tone of this piece should not be a problem. Please feel free to hit me up anytime for a round of golf, Mr. President. Peter A.

Pseudonym-Nakamoto ran chat rooms where cryptographers worked on developing the code behind bitcoin, but then suddenly stopped participating. No one knew why, and the question of Nakamoto's identity became one of the greatest sources of online conspiracy theories. Government agent, criminal, employee of a big tech company? All were in play.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So the potential revelation that he was just an incredibly smart, slightly odd, 64-year-old Japanese American train enthusiast from the suburbs of Los Angeles sent the bitcoin community in a tizzy. But even though the man that Newsweek found has a name, biography and libertarian values - \"He would say, 'Pretend the government agencies are coming after you.' And I would hide in the closet,\" his daughter recalled - that lines up almost perfectly with the pseudonym-Nakamoto's online persona, it's still unclear whether he is bitcoin's \"founder,\" what that means, or if it really matters.</p><p>Newsweek says the Satoshi Nakamoto it tracked down is \"the face behind bitcoin,\" but perhaps he's just \"a face.\" Quotes from human-Nakamoto indicate he played a role in bitcoin at some point, but the level of his involvement remains vague at best.</p><p>\"I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,\" he told the magazine. \"It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.\"</p><p>Nakamoto later denied any involvement in bitcoin, telling the Associated Press he first heard of the cryptocurrency three weeks ago after a reporter contacted his son.</p><p>On the Internet, things that look like a duck and talk like a duck aren't necessarily a duck. \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" could still be a pseudonym. As Jason Pontin, editor of the MIT Technology Review, points out, there could still be a group of developers who simply needed a name and lifted it from that very smart man who had helped them with a couple of questions.</p><p>One of the chief protests about this Nakamoto being <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">the </emphasis>Nakamoto is that the writing done by pseudonym-Nakamoto doesn't sound like the words of human-Nakamoto. Threads on Reddit and elsewhere point out that pseudonym-Nakamoto used elegant British English in online chats during the cryptocurrency's development. </p><p>The human-Nakamoto doesn't appear to have the same grasp of the language in his later writings. On top of that, pseudonym-Nakamoto posted during times that lined up with a working day in London - not California. So while human-Nakamoto could have been involved in the start of the project, there is still no additional evidence that he was the one typing on behalf of pseudonym-Nakamoto all those years. He could have passed that work on.</p><p>But all of this winds back to perhaps the most interesting question: Why care? Bitcoin is its own beast. The origins of Satoshi Nakamoto have made for fun fairy tales, but whether he invented it or not the cryptocurrency is off to the races. </p><p>The value of bitcoin didn't shift noticeably on the news. The New York Times now calls it \"a brand.\" Governments and regulators are still going to ask all the same questions.</p><p>The one sticking point is that pseudonym-Nakamoto is sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoin and human-Nakamoto should probably hire security guards. No one's sure quite why it hasn't been spent, but if pseudonym-Nakamoto were to cash out, it would probably cause bitcoin to fall in value, at least in the short term.</p><p>Another theory is that such a huge transaction could out his identity. Even though it is often characterized as a currency for those who wish to stay anonymous online, bitcoin does have anonymity issues - outside of being tracked down by reporters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>This man, identified by Newsweek as bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, is the center of media attention as he leaves his home in Temple CityLos Angeles County.

The price of one bitcoin has since rebounded to just north of $12,000.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whew! What's driving this breakneck volatility?</p><p>Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst with ThinkMarkets FX, said that bitcoin's spike above $10,000 on June 21 sent a strong signal to average retail investors that bitcoin was back. It was the first time bitcoin eclipsed the $10,000 level since March 2018.</p><p>Several other cryptocurrencies, including ethereum, XRP, litecoin and EOS, have soared as well. </p><p>But Lennon Sweeting, director of institutional trading with Coinsquare Capital Markets, said the recent surge also led to the subsequent drop. Larger investors looked to quickly cash in on the violent short-term moves.</p><p>\"There are some key players who hold a lot of bitcoin and can rattle the market,\" Sweeting said.</p><p>Facebook validating cryptocurrencies?</p><p>Several fundamental reasons to explain the rapid moves in bitcoin and other so-called alt-coins as well. </p><p>Facebook's planned launch of a cryptocurrency called Libra is an event that Aslam said helps legitimize bitcoin. He said he wouldn't be surprised to see Amazon and other big tech and retail players look to get more involved with digital currencies.</p><p>Amazon was not immediately available for comment about any possible cryptocurrency plans.</p><p>But Facebook's Libra proposal is controversial, especially since the social network is still dealing with questions about its influence on several global elections over the past few years and a scourge of fake news on the platform.</p><p>Some politicians, including Democratic Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren have even called for Facebook -- which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp -- to be broken up.</p><p>So it should come as no surprise that Congress has its sights set on Libra. A Senate Banking committee hearing about Facebook's crypto plans will be held on July 16, followed by a House Financial Services committee hearing a day later.</p><p>And Sweeting said some investors may have gotten too excited about what Libra might mean for bitcoin. </p><p>Bitcoin and the blockchain are not one and the same</p><p>He said that it's important to note that there's a difference between blockchain -- the digital ledger that serves as the backbone for cryptocurrency transactions -- and bitcoin. Facebook's Libra push might lead to a wider adoption of the blockchain, but not necessarily bitcoin.</p><p>\"Some investors have viewed any positive blockchain story as being good for bitcoin,\" Sweeting said.</p><p>Still, Aslam remains bullish on bitcoin. He thinks it will soon top its all-time high of near $20,000 from December 2017, and could eventually approach $50,000 over the next few years.</p><p>His rationale? More institutional investors may start to add bitcoin to their portfolios as a hedge and a way to diversify. He notes that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange now has futures contracts for bitcoin, and that money management giant Fidelity is dipping its toe into bitcoin trading.</p><p>Aslam adds that he thinks it's only a matter of time before the Securities and Exchange Commission eventually approves an ETF backed by bitcoin. </p><p>The SEC has taken a cautious approach to proposed crypto ETFs so far and is currently reviewing several applications. But Aslam believes that all it will take is for one ETF to get the regulatory green light before the floodgates open.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

If you think it's Bitcoin, which accounts for about 70% of all the digital-asset world's market value, you're probably wrong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While concrete figures on trading volumes are hard to come by in this often murky corner of finance, data from CoinMarketCap.com show that the token with the highest daily and monthly trading volume is Tether, whose market capitalization is more than 30 times smaller. Tether's volume surpassed that of Bitcoin's for the first time in April and has consistently exceeded it since early August at about $21 billion per day, the data provider says.</p><p>With Tether's monthly trading volume about 18% higher than that of Bitcoin, it's arguably the most important coin in the crypto ecosystem. </p><p>Tether's also one of the main reasons why regulators regard cryptocurrencies with a wary eye, and have put the breaks on crypto exchange-traded funds amid concern of market manipulation.</p><p>\"If there is no Tether, we lose a massive amount of daily volume - around  $1 billion or more depending on the data source,\" said Lex Sokolin, global financial technology co-head at ConsenSys, which offers blockchain technology. \"Some of the concerning potential patters of trading in the market may start to fall away.\"</p><p>Tether is the world's most used stablecoin, a category of tokens that seek to avoid price fluctuations, often through pegs or reserves. </p><p>It's also a pathway for most of the world's active traders into the crypto market. In countries like China, where crypto exchanges are banned, people can pay cash over the counter to get Tethers with few questions asked, according to Sokolin. From there, they can trade Tethers for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, he said.</p><p>\"For many people in Asia, they like the idea that it's this offshore, opaque thing out of reach of the U.S. government,\" said Jeremy Allaire, chief executive officer of Circle, which supports a rival stablecoin called USD Coin. \"It's a feature, not a problem.\"</p><p>Tether, which is being sued by New York for allegedly commingling funds including reserves, says using a know-your-customer form and approval process is required to issue and redeem the coin.</p><p>Asian traders account for about 70% of all crypto trading volume, according to Allaire, and Tether was used in 40% and 80% of all transactions on two of the world's top exchanges,  Binance and Huobi, respectively, Coin Metrics said earlier this year.</p><p>Many people don't even know they use Tether, said Thaddeus Dryja, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Because traditional financial institutions worry that they don't sniff out criminals and money launderers well enough, most crypto exchanges still don't have bank accounts and can't hold dollars on behalf of customers. So they use Tether as a substitute, Dryja said.</p><p>\"I don't think people actually trust Tether - I think people use Tether without realizing that they are using it, and instead think they have actual dollars in a bank account somewhere,\" Dryja said. Some exchanges mislabel their pages, to convey the impression that customers are holding dollars instead of Tethers, he said.</p><p>The way Tether is managed and governed makes it a black box. While Bitcoin belongs to no one, Tether is issued by a Hong Kong-based private company whose proprietors also own the Bitfinex crypto exchange. </p><p>The exact mechanism by which Tether's supply is increased and decreased is unclear. </p><p>Exactly how much of the supply is covered by fiat reserves is in question, too, as Tether is not independently audited. In April, Tether disclosed that 74% of the Tethers are covered by cash and short-term securities, while it previously said it had a 100% reserve.</p><p>The disclosure was a part of an ongoing investigation into Tether by the New York Attorney General, which accused the companies behind the coin of a coverup to hide the loss of $850 million of comingled client and corporate funds.</p><p>John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said that half of Bitcoin's runup in 2017 was the result of market manipulation using Tether. </p><p>Last year, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Justice Department is investigating Tether's role in this market manipulation. </p><p>\"Being controlled by centralized parties defeats the entire original purpose of blockchain and decentralized cryptocurrencies,\" Griffin said. </p><p>\"By avoiding government powers, stablecoins place trust instead in the hands of big tech companies, who have mixed accountability. So while the idea is great in theory, in practice it is risky, open to abuse, and plagued by similar problems to traditional fiat currencies.\"</p><p>On the other hand, because Tether is key to their growth, many crypto exchanges would likely be willing to bail it out if needed, said Dan Raykhman, who is developing a platform for issuing digital assets and used to be head of trading technologies for Galaxy Digital.</p><p>\"There's this implicit support from all these exchanges to help Tether stay afloat,\" he said.</p><p>While dozens of stablecoins have come out in the past year, many of them independently audited and regulated, Tether remains the favorite, by far.</p><p>\"Tether has been around since 2014 - ancient antecedents in crypto - and has retained its value,\" said Aaron Brown, an investor and a writer for Bloomberg Opinion. </p><p>\"I don't say it's perfect, but its convenience outweighs its risk for many people.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VAPILT-VA0103421238</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VAPILT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X6R-KSS1-JBM5-R202-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144571</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"899\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Virginian-Pilot Companies LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Virginian - Pilot (Norfolk, VA.)</publicationName><edition>1ST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 6, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>crypto</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DEW4</classCode><className>DIGITAL CURRENCY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN32</classCode><className>BLOCKCHAIN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N525910MM</classCode><className>EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001076</classCode><className>MARKET CAPITALIZATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DLZ7</classCode><className>MARKET MANIPULATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000108</classCode><className>APPROVALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp;

In other announcements, the rise of decentralized exchanges continues with news from Kyber and Binance launching their decentralized exchanges.Google and Twitter appear to be following Facebook's lead in announcing they will impose a blanket ban on all cryptocurrency-related advertising across all of their properties, including Adwords and YouTube. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, however, is predicting that Bitcoin will be the single currency of the internet. </p><p>Featured stories by Colin Harper, David Hollerith, Erik Kuebler, Nick Marinoff and Aaron van Wirdum Stellar Gears Up to Implement Lightning Network[1] Hot on the heels of last week's announcement[2] from Lightning Labs, the Stellar network team has announced[3] that they will be integrating said product. That makes Stellar among the first projects to formally announce integration of the Lightning Network since the beta release Founder Jed McCaleb said, 'There's three main benefits: There's the scalability benefit, obviously \u2014 Stellar can scale pretty well right now but Lightning takes that much, much further; there's privacy benefits, as Lightning allows transactions to be kept off the public ledger; and then there's also interoperability,' referring to the prospect of Atomic Swaps. Decentralized Exchanges on the Rise With Kyber and Binance Developments[4] Decentralized exchanges promise a world in which cryptocurrency can be traded without a centralized middlemen. Most exchanges currently work in a centralized fashion, but recently, both Binance[5] and Kyber Network[6] released news of progress toward the future of decentralized exchanges: Binance announced the launch of a decentralized exchange, and Kyber Network made their decentralized exchange beta available to the general public. Decentralized exchanges don't rely on a third party to conduct trades or store cryptocurrency. Instead, they use blockchain technology to enable peer-peer trading without an additional third party. Because decentralized exchanges don't have to be for-profit entities, they can provide fee-less or close-to-free trading, but that usually comes at the cost of usability. What Big Tech's Ban Might Mean for Cryptocurrency Advertising[7] Following Facebook's lead, Google announced it will ban all cryptocurrency advertising on its platforms starting June 2018; that includes YouTube and any site that accepts Google ads. Just days later, Sky News reported[8] that Twitter will ban a range of cryptocurrency advertising by April 2018, Twitter has not confirmed or denied the report. Matthew Frankel with the Motley Fool suggests[9], the main purpose of Google's ban could be to protect investors without harming those already currently involved in the industry for the sake of positive development of the blockchain technology business ecosystem as a whole. With Facebook and Google controlling[10] about 65 percent of the ad market in the U.S., this ban will severely limit the available channels for crypto advertising. However, digital strategist with BTC Inc Rick Hanna, suggests that other social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Medium and Reddit will be used more often unless they follow suit with similar bans. Twitter and Square's Jack Dorsey: Bitcoin Will Be World's Single Currency[11] Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey had some remarkably positive remarks about bitcoin. Predicting the future of finance, he suggested that the 'father of cryptocurrencies' is likely to become the world's only currency within the next 10 years, namely Bitcoin. Dorsey's optimism comes at a time when cryptocurrencies have been deemed 'not that significant' by varying regulators. 'Real Users\": Bitcoin Donations Helped These Earthquake Survivors Recover[12] This is the second in a series by Aaron van Wirdum focusing on real people who use cryptocurrencies. In this installment, he visits the town of Norcia, Italy, after it was devastated by an earthquake. Meet Ilaria, Lorenzo and Alessia, who, thanks to the efforts of Guido Baroncini Turricchia and Helperbit, were given their first bitcoins to help rebuild their lives.

At the time, it seemed ridiculous; Bitcoin was this weird internet money that wasn't quite money and that cost a couple hundred dollars per coin just a year ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The second most popular cryptocurrency at the time, Ethereum, had an even crazier run: from about 10 bucks early in the year to $480. Both cryptocurrencies then continued to rally before crashing far below those levels in 2018.</p><p> Now, Bitcoin is once again on the brink of reaching $10,000, and Ethereum is very near $300, for the first time in nearly a year.</p><p> In some ways, this bull run \u2014 and it's definitely a bull run at this point \u2014 is very different from the last one. The market has matured; institutional investors have more avenues to invest in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has solved some of the issues that plagued it in 2017; Ethereum is on the way to a total overhaul of its core technology, which may launch as soon as late 2019.</p><p> A familiar run</p><p> But price-wise, it's amazing how closely the current situation resembles the one in late 2017. It took three months for the price of Bitcoin to rise from $3,000 to $10,000. Right now, the price of Bitcoin is $9,791 according to CoinMarketCap. Three months ago, it was $4,083, and just four months ago, it was at $3,393.</p><p> Just like in 2017, trading was choppy, with the prices sometimes dropping by more than $1,000 in a matter of days. But the bearish periods were short, and the price recovered quickly. Ethereum's growth has been a little less explosive than in 2017, but largely followed a similar pattern. Right now, the price of Ethereum is $286.</p><p> The $10,000 and the $300 price levels for Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively, are important psychological barriers, and not only because they're nice and round. Last time, those levels were when the \"cab driver\" effect was in full swing: Everyone was talking about Bitcoin; Coinbase was adding hundreds of thousands of users on a weekly basis. People who'd never even considered stocks were suddenly stocking up on Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies.</p><p> Another important mark has been reached on Friday: The collective market cap of all cryptocurrencies surpassed $300 billion again, according to CoinMarketCap. This hasn't happened in exactly one year.</p><p> In it for the tech? Good.</p><p> I've taken a look at the developments on the market this May, and things remained largely unchanged since then. Same warning applies: Just because Bitcoin once went crazy and surged a hundred percent after it had hit $10,000, doesn't mean it'll happen again.</p><p> But it's a good moment to take a step back and look at how the technology has evolved since 2017.</p><p> Bitcoin's core developers have stayed true to their mantra of doing things slowly but surely, with the system's security being the highest priority. As a result, Bitcoin has kept its security record pristine (exchange hacks, scams and swindles of all sorts are another matter, but they aren't Bitcoin's fault). The block size debate that raged throughout 2017 has died down, partially due to an upgrade called SegWit, which alleviated the problem somewhat. A mobile app for Lightning Network, a promising scalability solution that's been in development for years, was released as alpha software a few days ago. Technologies like Schnorr signatures and Taproot are being implemented right now, with the goal of increasing scalability and privacy.</p><p> Opponents will point at Bitcoin development being glacially slow, but Bitcoin has remained relevant by staying secure and not doing much. It hasn't become a widely used payment solution, but it's solidifying its position as digital gold; an asset that most investors buy because they expect for it to retain value, while at the same time considering it to be an anchor for some portion of the global financial system (the verdict on whether Bitcoin really is a good store of value is still out, and might not be settled for many more years).</p><p> Ethereum, a platform for decentralized apps, hasn't fully solved its scalability issues, meaning that you still can't run software with millions of daily active users on top of Ethereum. But Ethereum developers are hard at work on Ethereum 2.0, a major upgrade to the system which introduces a new, proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which wastes far less energy than proof-of-work (used today by both Bitcoin and Ethereum), as well as sharding, a complex solution for making Ethereum more scalable.</p><p> In 2017, one of the main drivers for Ethereum's growth was the initial coin offering or ICO, a way of crowdfunding a startup by selling blockchain tokens to investors. The ICOs are now largely gone, stifled by more stringent regulations, but they've been replaced by the IEO (initial exchange offering), which is essentially the same thing, only organized and vetted by a cryptocurrency exchange. The success of some recent IEOs, especially those ran by Binance, have added a new wave of optimism to the space.</p><p> If bitcoin breaks 10k, you can bet it's going to break 15k...??????</p><p> \u2014 Tyler Winklevoss (@tylerwinklevoss) June 19, 2019</p><p> Then there's the white-and-blue elephant in the room. Days ago, Facebook, together with a very strong list of partners, launched Libra, a new open-source blockchain that will host a non-volatile cryptocurrency of the same name. Libra will be integrated into Facebook products such as Messenger and WhatsApp via Calibra, a proprietary digital wallet from Facebook. With a launch date set for the first half of 2020, the Libra announcement sent strong ripples throughout the cryptocurrency industry, both as a threat and as a sign of potential mainstream adoption.</p><p> And all of this is just a tiny portion of what's happening in the crypto space.</p><p> As always, cryptocurrency price movements appear to be decoupled from actual developments in the space, driven instead by speculation. But technological progress has been made, and governments, institutions and big tech companies appear far more interested in crypto now than they were two years ago. Let's see how things unravel this time around.</p><p> Disclosure: The author of this text owns, or has recently owned, a number of cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Bitcoin is on a tear again.
