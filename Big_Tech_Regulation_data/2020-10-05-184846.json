Speaking out for the first time about the harvesting of Facebook user data by a British firm linked to Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, Zuckerberg admitted Wednesday to betraying the trust of its two billion users, and promised to \"step up.\" Vowing to stop data leaking to outside developers and to give users more control over their information, Zuckerberg also said he was ready to testify before US lawmakers -- which a powerful congressional committee promptly asked him to do.

The data scandal erupted at the weekend when a whistleblower revealed that British consultant Cambridge Analytica (CA) had created psychological profiles on 50 million Facebook users via a personality prediction app, developed by a researcher named Aleksandr Kogan. The app was downloaded by 270,000 people, but also scooped up their friends' data without consent -- as was possible under Facebook's rules at the time. - 'Breach of trust' - Facebook says it discovered last week that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted the data as it certified -- although the British firm denies wrongdoing. \"This was a major breach of trust and I'm really sorry that this happened,\" Zuckerberg said in an interview with CNN, after publishing a blog post outlining his response to the scandal. \"Our responsibility now is to make sure this doesn't happen again.\" With Facebook already under fire for allowing fake news to proliferate during the US election, Zuckerberg also said \"we need to make sure that we up our game\" ahead of midterm Congressional elections in November, in which American officials have warned Russia can be expected to meddle as it did two years ago. Cambridge Analytica has maintained it did not use Facebook data in the Trump campaign, but its now-suspended CEO boasted in secret recordings that his company was deeply involved in the race. And US special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race, is reportedly looking into the consultant's role in the Trump effort. 'Abused and misused' Zuckerberg's apology followed a days-long stream of damaging accusations against the world's biggest social network, which now faces probes on both sides of the Atlantic. In Washington on Thursday, leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee urged Zuckerberg to testify without delay, saying a briefing a day earlier by Facebook officials had left \"many questions\" unanswered. \"We believe, as CEO of Facebook, he is the right witness to provide answers to the American people,\" said a statement from the panel, calling for a hearing \"in the near future.\" America's Federal Trade Commission is reportedly investigating Facebook over the scandal, while Britain's information commissioner is seeking to determine whether it did enough to secure its data. On Thursday, Israel's privacy protection agency said it had informed Facebook of a probe into the Cambridge Analytica revelations, and was looking into \"the possibility of other infringements of the privacy law regarding Israelis.\" Meanwhile, EU leaders were due to press digital giants \"to guarantee transparent practices and full protection of citizens' privacy and personal data,\" according to a draft summit statement obtained by AFP. A movement to quit the social network has already gathered momentum -- with the co-founder of the WhatsApp messaging service among those vowing to #deletefacebook -- while a handful of lawsuits risk turning into class actions in a costly distraction for the company.

Speaking out for the first time about the harvesting of Facebook user data by a British firm linked to Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, Zuckerberg admitted Wednesday to betraying the trust of its two billion users, and promised to \"step up.\" Vowing to stop data leaking to outside developers and to give users more control over their information, Zuckerberg also said he was ready to testify before US lawmakers -- which a powerful congressional committee promptly asked him to do. With pressure ratcheting up on the 33-year-old CEO over a scandal that has wiped some $60 billion off Facebook's value, the initial response suggested his promise of self-regulation had failed to convince. </p><p>\"Frankly I don't think those changes go far enough,\" Britain's culture and digital minister Matt Hancock told the BBC. \"It shouldn't be for a company to decide what is the appropriate balance between privacy and innovation and use of data,\" he said. \"The big tech companies need to abide by the law and we are strengthening the law.\" In Brussels, European leaders were sending the same message as they prepared to push for tougher safeguards on personal data online, while Israel became the latest country to launch an investigation into Facebook. The data scandal erupted at the weekend when a whistleblower revealed that British consultant Cambridge Analytica (CA) had created psychological profiles on 50 million Facebook users via a personality prediction app, developed by a researcher named Aleksandr Kogan. The app was downloaded by 270,000 people, but also scooped up their friends' data without consent -- as was possible under Facebook's rules at the time. - 'Breach of trust' - Facebook says it discovered last week that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted the data as it certified -- although the British firm denies wrongdoing. \"This was a major breach of trust and I'm really sorry that this happened,\" Zuckerberg said in an interview with CNN, after publishing a blog post outlining his response to the scandal. \"Our responsibility now is to make sure this doesn't happen again.\" With Facebook already under fire for allowing fake news to proliferate during the US election, Zuckerberg also said \"we need to make sure that we up our game\" ahead of midterm Congressional elections in November, in which American officials have warned Russia can be expected to meddle as it did two years ago. Cambridge Analytica has maintained it did not use Facebook data in the Trump campaign, but its now-suspended CEO boasted in secret recordings that his company was deeply involved in the race. And US special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race, is reportedly looking into the consultant's role in the Trump effort. 'Abused and misused' Zuckerberg's apology followed a days-long stream of damaging accusations against the world's biggest social network, which now faces probes on both sides of the Atlantic. In Washington on Thursday, leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee urged Zuckerberg to testify without delay, saying a briefing a day earlier by Facebook officials had left \"many questions\" unanswered. \"We believe, as CEO of Facebook, he is the right witness to provide answers to the American people,\" said a statement from the panel, calling for a hearing \"in the near future.\" America's Federal Trade Commission is reportedly investigating Facebook over the scandal, while Britain's information commissioner is seeking to determine whether it did enough to secure its data. On Thursday, Israel's privacy protection agency said it had informed Facebook of a probe into the Cambridge Analytica revelations, and was looking into \"the possibility of other infringements of the privacy law regarding Israelis.\" Meanwhile, EU leaders were due to press digital giants \"to guarantee transparent practices and full protection of citizens' privacy and personal data,\" according to a draft summit statement obtained by AFP. A movement to quit the social network has already gathered momentum -- with the co-founder of the WhatsApp messaging service among those vowing to #deletefacebook -- while a handful of lawsuits risk turning into class actions in a costly distraction for the company. World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee described it as a \"serious moment for the web's future\". \"I can imagine Mark Zuckerberg is devastated that his creation has been abused and misused,\" tweeted the British scientist. \"I would say to him: You can fix it. It won't be easy but if companies work with governments, activists, academics and web users we can make sure platforms serve humanity.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NTION-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NTION2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S1T-WV61-JCBN-04GB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220765</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"813\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nation News Network Co., Ltd.

Speaking out for the first time about the harvesting of Facebook user data by a British firm linked to Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, Zuckerberg admitted Wednesday to betraying the trust of its 2\u00a0billion users\u00a0and promised to \"step up.\" Vowing to stop data leaking to outside developers and to give users more control over their information, Zuckerberg also said he was ready to testify before US lawmakers   which a powerful congressional committee promptly asked him to do. </p><p>With pressure ratcheting up on the 33-year-old CEO over a scandal that has wiped $60 billion off Facebook's value, the initial response suggested his promise of self-regulation had failed to convince critics he was serious about change. \"Frankly I don't think those changes go far enough,\" Matt Hancock, Britain's culture and digital minister, told the BBC. \"It shouldn't be for a company to decide what is the appropriate balance between privacy and innovation and use of data,\" he said.\u00a0\"The big tech companies need to abide by the law, and we are strengthening the law.\" In Brussels, European leaders were sending the same message as they prepared to push for tougher safeguards on personal data online, while Israel became the latest country to launch an investigation into Facebook. The data scandal erupted at the weekend when a whistle-blower revealed that British consultant Cambridge Analytica had created psychological profiles on 50 million Facebook users via a personality prediction app, developed by a researcher named Aleksandr Kogan. The app,\u00a0downloaded by 270,000 people, scooped up their friends' data without consent   as was possible under Facebook's rules at the time. 'Breach of trust' Facebook said it discovered last week that Cambridge Analytica might not have deleted the data as it certified,\u00a0although the British firm denied\u00a0wrongdoing. \"This was a major breach of trust and I'm really sorry that this happened,\" Zuckerberg said in an interview with CNN, after publishing a blog post outlining his response to the scandal. \"Our responsibility now is to make sure this doesn't happen again.\" With Facebook already under fire for allowing fake news to proliferate during the U.S. election, Zuckerberg also said \"we need to make sure that we up our game\" ahead of midterm congressional elections in November, in which American officials have warned Russia can be expected to meddle as it did two years ago. Cambridge Analytica has maintained it did not use Facebook data in the Trump campaign, but its now-suspended CEO boasted in secret recordings that his company was deeply involved in the race. WATCH: Facebook Under Fire for Data Misuse And U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race, is reportedly looking into the consultant's role in the Trump effort. 'Abused and misused' Zuckerberg's apology followed a dayslong stream of damaging accusations against the world's biggest social network, which now faces probes on both sides of the Atlantic. In Washington on Thursday, leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee urged Zuckerberg to testify without delay, saying a briefing a day earlier by Facebook officials had left \"many questions\" unanswered. \"We believe, as CEO of Facebook, he is the right witness to provide answers to the American people,\" said a statement from the panel, calling for a hearing \"in the near future.\" America's Federal Trade Commission is reportedly investigating Facebook over the scandal, while Britain's information commissioner is seeking to determine whether it did enough to secure its data. On Thursday, Israel's privacy protection agency said it had informed Facebook of a probe into the Cambridge Analytica revelations, and was looking into \"the possibility of other infringements of the privacy law regarding Israelis.\" Meanwhile, European Union leaders were due to press digital giants \"to guarantee transparent practices and full protection of citizens' privacy and personal data,\" according to a draft summit statement obtained by AFP. A movement to quit the social network has already gathered momentum   with the co-founder of the WhatsApp messaging service among those vowing to #deletefacebook   while a handful of lawsuits risk turning into class actions in a costly distraction for the company. World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee described it as a \"serious moment for the web's future.\" \"I can imagine Mark Zuckerberg is devastated that his creation has been abused and misused,\" tweeted the British scientist. \"I would say to him: You can fix it. It won't be easy but if companies work with governments, activists, academics and web users, we can make sure platforms serve humanity.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10AS1309121521760033152251762100029</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10AS-130912</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXV-MMJ1-JB5Y-N1J4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"838\"/><timeReceived>11:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Voice of America</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 22, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Silicon Valley Technology</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

CEO over a scandal that has wiped some $60 billion off Facebook's value, the initial response suggested his promise of self-regulation had failed to convince.</p><p>\"Frankly I don't think those changes go far enough,\" Britain's culture and digital minister Matt Hancock told the BBC.</p><p>\"It shouldn't be for a company to decide what is the appropriate balance between privacy and innovation and use of data,\" he said.</p><p>\"The big tech companies need to abide by the law and we are strengthening the law.\"</p><p>In Brussels, European leaders were sending the same message as they prepared to push for tougher safeguards on personal data online, while Israel became the latest country to launch an investigation into Facebook.</p><p>The data scandal erupted at the weekend when a whistleblower revealed that British consultant Cambridge Analytica (CA) had created psychological profiles on 50 million Facebook users via a personality prediction app, developed by a researcher named Aleksandr Kogan.</p><p>The app was downloaded by 270,000 people, but also scooped up their friends' data without consent -- as was possible under Facebook's rules at the time.</p><p>'Breach of trust'</p><p>Facebook says it discovered last week that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted the data as it certified -- although the British firm denies wrongdoing.</p><p>\"This was a major breach of trust and I'm really sorry that this happened,\" Zuckerberg said in an interview with CNN, after publishing a blog post outlining his response to the scandal.</p><p>\"Our responsibility now is to make sure this doesn't happen again.\"</p><p>With Facebook already under fire for allowing fake news to proliferate during the US election, Zuckerberg also said \"we need to make sure that we up our game\" ahead of midterm Congressional elections in November, in which American officials have warned Russia can be expected to meddle as it did two years ago.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica has maintained it did not use Facebook data in the Trump campaign, but its now-suspended CEO boasted in secret recordings that his company was deeply involved in the race.</p><p>And US special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race, is reportedly looking into the consultant's role in the Trump effort.</p><p>'Abused and misused'</p><p>Zuckerberg's apology followed a days-long stream of damaging accusations against the world's biggest social network, which now faces probes on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>In Washington on Thursday, leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee urged Zuckerberg to testify without delay, saying a briefing a day earlier by Facebook officials had left \"many questions\" unanswered.</p><p>\"We believe, as CEO of Facebook, he is the right witness to provide answers to the American people,\" said a statement from the panel, calling for a hearing \"in the near future.\"</p><p>America's Federal Trade Commission is reportedly investigating Facebook over the scandal, while Britain's information commissioner is seeking to determine whether it did enough to secure its data.</p><p>On Thursday, Israel's privacy protection agency said it had informed Facebook of a probe into the Cambridge Analytica revelations, and was looking into \"the possibility of other infringements of the privacy law regarding Israelis.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, EU leaders were due to press digital giants \"to guarantee transparent practices and full protection of citizens' privacy and personal data,\" according to a draft summit statement obtained by AFP.</p><p>A movement to quit the social network has already gathered momentum -- with the co-founder of the WhatsApp messaging service among those vowing to #deletefacebook -- while a handful of lawsuits risk turning into class actions in a costly distraction for the company.</p><p>World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee described it as a \"serious moment for the web's future\".</p><p>\"I can imagine Mark Zuckerberg is devastated that his creation has been abused and misused,\" tweeted the British scientist.</p><p>\"I would say to him: You can fix it. It won't be easy but if companies work with governments, activists, academics and web users we can make sure platforms serve humanity.\"</p><p>CAPTION(S):</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, in his first public statement on the scandal engulfing the company, said the social network must \"step up\" and do more to protect user data.

Thanks so much, Neil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking right now, everyone, as Neil said, we are minutes away from <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>much anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers expect to grill the tech CEO for failing to protect user data and for failing to rid out fake news during the 2016 election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech stocks, meanwhile soaring today to most trade fears. They're beginning to ease.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>President Xi </nameText></person>announcing today that China will reduce tariffs on imported automobile. Well, kind of seems like some of this tough talk on trade may actually be paying of. I mean, do not forget, everyone, I keep saying this, we are China's biggest paying customer.</p><p>They need us. They actually kind of need us more than we need them. So, with that in mind, they ought to be willing to play ball, right?</p><p>I'm Trish Regan. Welcome, everyone, to THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT.</p><p>As we watch market that's up 433 points, we're waiting right now on the big <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>hearing that's about to get underway. Now, I want to revisit for you some of these troubles. First of all, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has admitted that the data firm, Cambridge Analytica, gains information for as many as 87 million <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users. Remember, I thought it was around 50 million, turned out to be 87 million and possibly even more.</p><p>The firm basically stole everyone's information for campaign research and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>effectively allowed that to happen. We also know that Russia used <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>to meddle in the 2016 election. The tech company said it failed to have proper protocols in place to deter bad actors from using its ad tools. In other words, you want to buy an ad on <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>here you go. We don't care if you happen to be Russian and you're trying to manipulate the election one way or another, we just sell you the ad.</p><p>Well, then we've got the whole privacy issue. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>stores all of our data. And lawmakers want to know if <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is doing enough to protect it users.</p><p>The other component to all of this is of course that memo that we've got out recently in which the senior executives basically said that we connect people at all costs. Meaning, it doesn't matter if we're connecting terrorists, it doesn't matter if we're connecting bullies at school and someone dies as a result. Above all, we just connect people. No sense of responsibility whatsoever.</p><p>So you can anticipate a lot of fireworks coming up this hour, specifically from Capitol Hill where we find our very own Deirdre Bolton right now. Hi, Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Hi, Trish. I'm just a few spaces away from literally the hot seat where <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>founder, CEO, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is going to find himself in a few moments. So, our sources are saying he is already in this building. He came in through a back way. He went up to another level through a freight elevator and is now in a holding room.</p><p>My source also tells me that his wife has accompanied him here. He did post just about an hour ago on <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>I'll read part of this, Trish, he said, \"In an hour I'm going to testify in front of the Senate about how <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>needs to take a broader view of our responsibility, not just to build tools, but to make sure those tools are used for good. I will do everything I can to make <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>a place where everyone can stay closer with the people they care about, and to make sure it's a positive force in the world.\"</p><p>Trish, you said it, he is going to take so many tough questions from the members, of course, of this Senate, Commerce, and Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Earlier, Senator Grassley spoke to us. Here's what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), CHAIRMAN, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: So, this brings up what can we do either, through legislation, regulation, or better yet, if the companies will do it themselves to make sure that people know about the restrictions that they have on privacy. And are they going -- once they have good rules, are they going to abide by those rules, because quite frankly they presumed they had those rules but they didn't enforce them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: Senator Grassley also told us that he thinks how <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>performs here today is really going to affect and influence the kinds of regulations that may be imposed on <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>I want to mention as well, Trish, that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is actually offering a bounty of anywhere between $500 and $40,000 if you find the next Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>We know that in the past 48 hours that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has actually shut-off connections to two third-party developers because they felt like they were getting close to abusing data and becoming the next Cambridge Analytica. One is called AIQ, and that was generating the kind of quizzes that we saw through Cambridge Analytica. So, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>shut that down about 48 hours ago. And there was another one called CUBE, C-U-B-E, and, again, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>shut that down.</p><p>Just to note to all the developers out there, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>will pay you anywhere between $500 and $40,000 if you find the next Cambridge Analytica on their system. Trish, we're waiting, we're probably about half an hour before <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>sits in that hot seat. In the meantime, back to you.</p><p>REGAN: All right. Well, it kind of seems like it might be worth a little more than 40-k if you actually go out and you find that Cambridge Analytica, thereby, saving <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>the pain, which it is about to endure momentarily today. Thank you so much, Deirdre Bolton. We'll keep checking back with you.</p><p>Joining me right now is Republican Congressman from New York, Chris Collins, who will be questioning <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>at tomorrow's House hearing. It's good to see you, Representative.</p><p>REP. CHRIS COLLINS (R), NEW YORK: Good to be with you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN: What do you want to know from him?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, I'm going to ask for assurances that as we hold them accountable on the privacy front, there were some disturbing comments that came out a couple days ago that somebody indicated, sure, we'll let people keep their data private but we may charge them money to do that. Well, that would be totally unacceptable.</p><p>And I think the transparency we need isn't that when they update their, you know, the terms and conditions of using <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>it's not, you know, 20 pages, you just click I accept, but rather right up front a privacy document that says, \"Here are things that I'm willing to share. Here are things that I will not share. Here are the kinds of organizations you can share with.\"</p><p>You know, if my wife wants to share some shopping information with the department stores that might give her some ideas, that's fine. But if on the other hand, no, I don't want to share my data with somebody on the political front to hit me with a bunch of pop-up ads, I think there needs to be more transparency on the privacy front on what things we want.</p><p>REGAN: All right. Let me just stop you for a minute because let's not forget, Congressman, how <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>make its money.</p><p>COLLINS: That's right.</p><p>REGAN: <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>makes its money based off of our data that they then turn around and sell. So, if we're suddenly saying to them, no, no, don't use our data, what does that do to their business model?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, that's something they're going to have to answer to now. And I think a lot of people do want to share their data in a lot a lot of cases but not in all cases. Certainly, the political front lists than any place would somebody want their data to be use so they get pop-up political ads. Those are annoying enough as it is.</p><p>So, you know, in this case, I've said before that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has united Republicans and Democrats, which is not an easy thing to do in this midterm year, and saying they've gone above and beyond. You know, we'll go back a few years ago when they were certainly in the liberal bend, certainly favoring liberal media and news stories versus conservative news stories. Now here they are, you know, with the recent disclosure that these little quizzes were disclosing all kinds of data.</p><p>You know, I'm sure that what we're going to hear, call it the apology tour, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is going to admit things were done incorrectly. They took their eye off the ball. They're going to do better. I think to call that as happy place, he'll be returning to that statement --</p><p>REGAN: Yes, but do you buy that?</p><p>COLLINS: --again and again and again, well, it comes down to action speak louder than words. And I sit on Energy and Commerce and Telecommunications and Oversight. So, as he makes promises, and I'm going to ask him very directly for a commitment and promise they will never charge users to keep their data or any part of their data private. And then we'll have additional hearings if need be and hold them accountable.</p><p>REGAN: So, you know, I don't know, I'm wondering if the business model that they have, though, is really going to work ultimately, because, you know, the kids these days don't even like Snapchat, right? I mean, that suddenly becoming out of favor. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>as well, especially with younger folks who have seen this sort of kind of the old folks' platform.</p><p>So, I wonder if there is a competitor, Congressman, that we haven't even been talking about that's going to come up and say, \"Hey, you know what? We will protect your data, we will not sell your information and we'll find out other ways to make money?\"</p><p>COLLINS: Yes, the issue here, Trish, is they've got over two billion users. Everybody is on this particular platform now. It's going to be hard to for anyone to catch traction and move on up, you know, if you will to challenge them but they are going to have to answer to this privacy issue, be respectful of it and be very careful because if they don't they're going to see additional regulations into our legislation. I think right now --</p><p>REGAN: And do you think he should be willing to pay it all for it? Congressman, I'm just asking, 99 cents, a buck 99, kind of like, you know, you rent music, kind of like, you know, is there a model there where we insure some kind of protection? You don't want to see that?</p><p>COLLINS: Well, if they want to charge users to be on <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>that's fine.</p><p>REGAN: OK.</p><p>COLLINS: But not to say it's free, however, if you want to keep your information private. Now you have to pay. I think that's the nuance to the difference there.</p><p>REGAN: Yes.</p><p>COLLINS: It's one thing to say we're a paid platform. It's another thing to say we're free, but we're going to take your data and possibly abuse it. I think that's the nuance that's a little different.</p><p>REGAN: All right. Congressman Collins, we look forward to seeing you there questioning <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>tomorrow.</p><p>COLLINS: Very good, Trish.</p><p>REGAN: And we look forward to watching the Senate momentarily. Thank you, sir.</p><p>COLLINS: I do as well.</p><p>REGAN: All right. Meanwhile, President Trump is still fuming over yesterday's FBI raid of his personal attorney's office in New York. The President tweeting, \"Attorney-client privilege is dead. And a total witch- hunt.\"</p><p>Agents raided Michael Cohen's office, seizing records on a whole range of topics, including $130,000 payment that was made to an adult film star that goes by Stormy Daniels. Our Edward Lawrence is live at the White House with the latest on all of this.</p><p>And I can assure you though, Edward, the market isn't too concerned because we're up almost 500. Go for it.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Right, yes, exactly. The President known for those long rants when he's angry on Twitter was remarkably short as you saw there on Twitter. But we're told that he's still very upset here inside of the White House.</p><p>The President referring to that evidence that was taken from those raids by the FBI and it included communication between the President and his personal attorney, Michael Cohen. Now, an attorney for Cohen says that was privileged information.</p><p>Well, Senators on Capitol Hill are talking about those raids.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't believe he'll fire Mueller. And if he does, it will be a terrible mistake. But Mueller would be replaced by someone else who would continue the work. So, the best thing that could happen to the President and the country was for Mueller to be able to finish his work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: Now here at the White House, we're also waiting to see what's the U.S. reaction in Syria will be to the chemical attacks that happened this past weekend. The President is saying that this will not go unpunished. We are waiting to see exactly what will happens.</p><p>However, Democratic Senators on Capitol Hill are saying, \"Wait a minute, any reaction needs to come through Congress first.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA SENATOR: The White House should not wage unilateral war against anybody without Congress unless it's an imminent defense to the United States. I don't think the action that the White House took against Syria year ago was lawful. If they want to initiate military action against Syria, they got to come to Congress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: Now, also making headlines, it seems that the President has brought China to the table or at least around to his way of thinking on tariffs. Chinese <person><nameText>President Xi Jinping </nameText></person>in the Asian Summit has says, basically, he wants to open up the Chinese economy. He says that Chinese are willing to reduce tariffs on goods, including automobiles going forward coming into their country, also enforce intellectual property laws on foreign firms.</p><p>The President was cautiously optimistic. He did tweet few minutes ago about the situation. The President is saying, thankful for <person><nameText>President Xi's </nameText></person>kind words on tariffs and looking forward in the automobile barriers. He's also looking forward to moving forward to a more friendly trade negotiation.</p><p>Now, sources here in the White House, I can tell you, say that they are cautiously optimistic. However, they want to see some substance behind the words because they've heard China talk about this stuff before but not follow through. Trish?</p><p>REGAN: Edward, thank you very much.</p><p>All right. Again, I just want to remind people, we are rallying right now. The markets near the highs of the session right now, up almost 500 points and it's in part because of these remarks from Chinese <person><nameText>President Xi Jinping </nameText></person>this morning.</p><p><person><nameText>President Xi </nameText></person>trying to ease some of those trade tensions with the U.S., promising to lower import tariffs and to open China's economy. Have we heard that one before and is now any different?</p><p>Joining me right now, National Taxpayers Union Senior Fellow, Mattie Duppler. Mattie, good to have you hear.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: Are you encouraged?</p><p>DUPPLER: Well, I'm not surprised, let's put it that way. It should not be surprising to anyone to hear China talk about liberalizing its markets. They've got 1.5 billion people. They know every industrial nation on earth wants access to those markets.</p><p>So, what we heard really wasn't super surprising. I think it would be a mistake to claim victory in those remarks. However, it's also mistake to say that the blunt instrument of tariffs is a right way to go about trying to find an equilateral agreement with China where we have a fair and free open trade process.</p><p>There's been a lot of discussion about how we accomplish that. Tariffs, of course, are ways to hold American consumers hostage for problems that all of the world faces right now. The entire global community really needs to be in join to try and put pressures on China to not only liberalize their economies, but also to have better trading practices with their partners.</p><p>REGAN: There I say might that be a TTP 2.0? In other words, this, in fact, the President recently referenced this. We tried to hold China more accountable by creating a Trans-Pacific trade Partnership in which we would have joined forces with other countries over there and said, \"OK, China, you know, if you want to do business with any of us you're going to have to play by the rules.\"</p><p>DUPPLER: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: We didn't do so. And now, we're kind of going it on our own. That said, Mattie, we are their number one biggest customer. So yes, I hear you.</p><p>DUPPLER: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: And that it hurts average Americans. And, you know, we don't quite have the threshold for that kind of pain that may be a Chinese regime does because they're there no matter what.</p><p>DUPPLER: Right.</p><p>REGAN: We can vote our folks out. But, nonetheless, we do have power that we have not used. Do you think that the use of this now with the promise of more tariffs in addition to steel is scaring China in any way?</p><p>DUPPLER: I think there is certainly a scare tactic here. But I would argue that tariffs should only be that, a scare tactic, because tariffs in practice are attacks on consumers. And you're right, you know, we have democracy here which China does not. They have not only don't have a democracy, they have centralize economy.</p><p>So, they have far less elasticity than our economy, like we do here in the United States. But we also have global supply chains. We might be the number one partner for China but we want to be the number one partner worldwide.</p><p>So what we need to be focus on hear in the United States is making sure that America is the number one place to do business. That means, having American businesses stay here and invest here, which they're starting to do, thanks to the reform bill that was passed last year. But also bringing businesses from around the world to be domiciled in the United States, to hire American workers and to give American consumers broad choice --</p><p>REGAN: OK. Let me back up. I agree with everything you just said.</p><p>DUPPLER: There you go.</p><p>REGAN: But back to China for a second.</p><p>DUPPLER: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: I mean, how is it fair that they charge tariffs on our goods, we don't charge it on theirs? And I know what you're going to say, \"Oh, but it makes it cheaper for everybody to buy all the stuffs that they want to buy at Walmart.\" But in the interim, what happens? If you do not have a level playing field, what happens to your ability to produce as a nation?</p><p>DUPPLER: Well, I would take argue with the notion of a level playing field being that we can charge the exact same thing for every product. We don't make every single consumer good here and that's OK because what we do is build processes here, build industrial mechanics that allows us to not only produce products, but to trade globally. And that's not just with China, that's with every country in the world.</p><p>REGAN: Right. But what do you do when they start stealing all your intellectual property and they start stealing your technology so that --</p><p>DUPPLER: Trish, I'm with you. I'm totally with you there. I think --</p><p>REGAN: -- in other words, it's great that we do it.</p><p>DUPPLER: -- right.</p><p>REGAN: But if they can do it as well because they steal it from us, then where do we windup?</p><p>DUPPLER: I agree. I believe that we need extremely strong protections for intellectual property. That goes back to what we're talking about before where the United States as a democratic nation has very strong protections for I.P. And we need to export those around the world.</p><p>China has long been a villain in this cause. They need to be held to task for that.</p><p>REGAN: Yes.</p><p>DUPPLER: And I completely agree, I do not believe that brash tariffs are the way to accomplish that. We have a global community putting pressure on China and something like the TPP would be a way to do that.</p><p>REGAN: You know, but then you've got to get everybody on board, and you know it's a headache.</p><p>DUPPLER: Absolutely.</p><p>REGAN: If we have power, if we have economic power, you know, and maybe we're saying the same thing here because you're saying the threat of tariffs are not bad, tariffs in action are kind of bad. But we do have a pretty powerful threat, and if you're going to make a threat you've got to be willing to follow through on that threat. I don't believe in, you know, just throwing out rhetoric and not being willing to see it through, Mattie.</p><p>DUPPLER: Yes, I agree with you there. But the American economy is a Trump card in and off itself and we should play it to its greatest strength, not to its greatest weakness.</p><p>REGAN: It's certainly a very interesting time. And it's nice to see the market recovering here on hope that China will actually start to level that playing field. Mattie, thank you very much. Good to have you here. Very interesting conversation.</p><p>DUPPLER: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: At any moment, I want to remind everyone, guess who? <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is going to be there on Capitol Hill. He is getting set to testify there before the Senate.</p><p>It comes as his company is facing all kinds of questions as to how it handles our personal data, what it does with that data. How politics is influenced and buys our data. How Russians may have influenced the election with our data. And also the lack of responsibility this company feels, not just to protect our data, but also in terms of any kind of consequences that may result from tariffs connecting with each other, bullies from connecting with each other. Apparently, it doesn't matter so long as they're connected.</p><p>You can imagine there are going to be many politicians that don't like any of this. So expect some fireworks for Mr. <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>momentarily. We're back with it right after this.</p><p>REGAN: All right, everyone, we are awaiting on <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>who's going to be testifying there on Capitol Hill. Lot of questions he's going to be facing from lawmakers.</p><p>And as we await that, we're looking at a market that's trading up rather nicely, near highs of the session right up. It's up 454, because I tell you what, all those worries about the trade war, well, they're beginning to disintegrate and that's because the Chinese President is promising to open China's markets to cut import tariffs and perhaps level the playing field a little bit more.</p><p>Let's take a look at shares of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>right now. Let's pull those up. They were higher earlier. We'll see how they do as Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is there testifying before the Senate where, as I have been saying, you can imagine, he's going to face some pretty fiery politicians who are going to use this opportunity, perhaps to go after the very company that many of them probably needed or used data for their campaigns, up $3.77 right now on <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>So, recovering there indeed.</p><p>Let's go down to the NYSE. Nicole Petallides is following all of that. Hey, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Hey, Trish, you're right. So, you see <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>up for the second day in a row. Everybody is talking about what we'll hear today. Will there be, you know, obviously a lot of ethics and will there has to be legislation going forward, or will the tech companies take over and do the things that they need to do?</p><p>The markets, the Dow is up 458 points, had been up 532 points. It has had more than 300-point moves 14 days in a row. We've never seen that ever in history.</p><p>We're looking at the S&amp;P that's up 1.7 percent. The Dow winners are dominated by industrials, financials, Boeing, Goldman Sachs, Caterpillar, those are among the best performers. Tech stocks, also with the up arrows.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>front and center today as I noted, you see right now that's up 161. Apple up 3.21 at 173. Microsoft, Alphabet Google also higher.</p><p>And we have the Sprint, T-Mobile move here today, big move for Sprint. In fact, Sprint has had the biggest move, the largest percent increase since 2016, since the end of the summer in 2016. Right now, it's up almost 20 percent, Trish, all on that on the talk that they rekindled.</p><p>Sprint and T-Mobile have restarted their talk of deal. And this appeared a combination they've talked about for the third time in four years. We'll see what happens. Back to you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN: Nicole, thank you very much.</p><p>All right. As we await <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>testimony we are joined right here by Belpointe Chief Strategist, David Nelson, Tematica Research CIO, Chris Versace, along with our own Deirdre Bolton who is live there down in D.C., getting ready for all these fireworks.</p><p>And, David, do you think there will be some?</p><p>DAVID NELSON, BELPOINTE CHIEF STRATEGIST: There will. He's going to be talking, he's going to be, you know, apologizing, going to start off there. And, you know, I would encourage everyone, you know, take a hard look at his written testimony, very important.</p><p>He talks about nefarious actors. He talks about bad actors everywhere from Macedonia to Russia. And I think the Senators are going to come down pretty hard.</p><p>I would take Senator John Kennedy's, his words just yesterday to heart. He says very clearly that this problem may be too big for <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>to fix it on their own. And I think that's probably where we're going.</p><p>REGAN: Wow. And if that's where we're going, you know what that means, Chris?</p><p>NELSON: Regulation.</p><p>REGAN: Yes, regulation. Regulation, or let me throw this one out there, too, as long as we've been talking about antitrust and Amazon, of course, has <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>gotten too big for its own good, Chris?</p><p>CHRIS VERSACE, CIO, TEMATICA RESEARCH: Has <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>gotten too big for its own good? It certainly has grown extremely fast from around $7 billion revenue about a decade ago to over $40 billion last year. I think the big problem for the company, Trish, is really understanding as its grown does it have the right checks and balances and processes in place?</p><p>And when we look at <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>written testimony one of the things that I step back on and think about is, yes, he's admitting it his fault. Yes, he is saying that they need to do more. What I haven't heard anybody say, though, is the incremental cost that this is going to amount to <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>And it's not going to be cheap. It's going to hit them, it's going to hit them hard.</p><p>And I think a lot of people haven't really braced for that. We haven't seen their earnings expectations for first quarter, second quarter move at all in the last 30 days. And I think investors are going to be surprised.</p><p>But, you know, as far as antitrust goes, I don't think so. I think there's enough competition out there. We have other players.</p><p>REGAN: I don't know. I mean, we were just talking about the --</p><p>NELSON: I would disagree.</p><p>REGAN: -- over two billion users on <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>NELSON: Seventy-three percent of online ads right now are Google and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>alone. So, that is pretty big, that's an enormous number.</p><p>REGAN: I mean, two companies that are quite big. And they're antitrust --</p><p>NELSON: There are almost sovereign countries at this point.</p><p>REGAN: -- that are being floated about, Amazon one would think you'd have to include <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Google, Alphabet in that list.</p><p>NELSON: Yes.</p><p>REGAN: In terms of its ability, though, to continue its earnings stream, let's take a look at the stock, which is trading higher right now. And, Deirdre, Chris makes a very good point. In other words, this is a company that makes money off of data. And now it has to go out and protect all that data and not be so willing to sell it so easily to whoever comes along, well, that presents a very different earnings scenario in the future, does it not?</p><p>BOLTON: It certainly does. It points to center profit margins as you and your guests have been speaking about. We've already heard <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>say this week that instead of having 10,000 engineers on board who are safety and security, who are going through and looking for fake news and looking for bad activity, they're going to double that amount, Trish.</p><p>So they are hiring an additional 10,000 engineers before this year is up. So, 20,000 in total just on that team. So, yes, of course, humans cost money and that is going to be just one of the activities that does eat into <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>profit margin.</p><p>I want to tell you a little bit of something about the color and the feel that we're getting. I mean, it's quite close. We're expecting him to walk in any minute.</p><p>As I may have mentioned, he came up through a freight elevator, according to a source. His wife is here as well. Also here are protesters. You had Code Pink, you had people standing up and saying stop corporate spying. They were holding big placards.</p><p>They actually haven't been kicked out. They are still in the crowd but their signs are down. There's also a woman who is dressed like a troll. Basically it looks like Halloween costume. It's hairy, I do think.</p><p>REGAN: All right. What does that mean, to dress like a troll like from the movie, \"Trolls\" or something?</p><p>BOLTON: And so I think it double on Sandra (ph) is when you get trolled on social media, she's actually here in this physical embodiment of a troll. So, definitely lots of colorful characters here.</p><p>Here he is. All right watching just now --</p><p>REGAN: He's watching -- so there are lawmakers there. You can see the media frenzy around this right now is obviously significant. This has become one of the most powerful media companies there is, David. And that's why we get back to the question this question of has it gotten too big, is it, in fact, in your view a monopoly?</p><p>NELSON: In terms of social media, almost at this point. And big tech in general, you know, big data is big money. And at some point in time we're going to have to address this.</p><p>You have to ask yourself, is <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>good for America? And the best I can come up with right now is maybe, maybe. You know, we're certainly divided as a nation, social media is certainly been an unwitting accomplice.</p><p>And for investors, and I'm part of that community, our moral compass is money, you know. So, we're about making money. So maybe we're going to have to look somewhere else to see how we're going to fix this.</p><p>REGAN: What their compass has been all about as well, I mean, and I keep citing this letter and this memo from one of the top executives there that still works there, who basically said, \"Look our goal, our job is to connect people at all costs. And some of those costs might be quite horrific, but we're out there connecting and that's our number one goal.\"</p><p>And, again, I just want to reiterate the media frenzy. I mean, we haven't seen a lot of tech CEOs out there testifying, certainly the financial CEOs went through their thick of it back in 2008.</p><p>NELSON: Well, nobody looks good in front of a Senate Congressional Committee. You start to look like Michael Corleone, and nobody wants to do that. And <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>this gentleman that has political aspirations somewhere beyond <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>It wasn't that long ago he toured the country in an almost campaign-like fashion.</p><p>REGAN: Yes, I would be surprised to see him do something politically. But then again, who knows. He has not spoken out in this kind of large setting. He hasn't given many interviews. He hasn't spoken before many groups but here he is today.</p><p>Let's listen in.</p><p>GRASSLEY: We welcome everyone today's hearing on <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>social media privacy and the use and abuse of data.</p><p>Although not unprecedented, this is a unique hearing. The issues we will consider range from data privacy and security to consumer protection and the Federal Trade Commission enforcement touching on jurisdictions of these two committees.</p><p>We have 44 members between our two committees, that may not seem like a large group by <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>standards but it is significant here for a hearing in the United States Senate. We will do our best to keep things moving efficiently given our circumstances. We will begin with opening statements from the chairmen and ranking members of each committee, starting with Chairman Thune, and then proceed with Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>opening statement.</p><p>We will then move onto questioning. Each member will have five minutes to question witnesses.</p><p>I'd like to remind the members of both committees that time limits will be and must be strictly enforced given the numbers that we have here today. If you're over your time, Chairman Thune and I will make sure to let you know. There will not be a second round as well.</p><p>Of course there will be the usual follow-up written questions for the record. Questioning will alternate between majority and minority and between committees. We will proceed in order based on respective committee seniority.</p><p>We will anticipate a couple short breaks later in the afternoon.</p><p>And so it's my pleasure to recognize the Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Chairman Thune, for his opening statement.</p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD), CHAIRMAN, COMMERCE COMMITTEE: Thank you, Chairman Grassley.</p><p>Today's hearing is extraordinary. It's extraordinary to hold a joint committee hearing. It's even more extraordinary to have a single CEO testify before nearly half of the United States Senate.</p><p>But then, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is pretty extraordinary. More than 2 billion people use <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>every month. One point four billion people use it every day; more than the population of any country on Earth except China, and more than four times the population of the United States. It's also more than 1,500 times the population of my home state of South Dakota.</p><p>Plus, roughly 45 percent of American adults report getting at least some of their news from <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>In many respects, <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>incredible reach is why we're here today. We're here because of what you, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>have described as a breach of trust.</p><p>A quiz app used by approximately 300,000 people led to information about 87 million <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users being obtained by the company Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>There are plenty of questions about the behavior of Cambridge Analytica and we expect to hold a future hearing on Cambridge and similar firms. But as you've said, this is not likely to be an isolated incident, a fact demonstrated by <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>suspension of another firm just this past weekend.</p><p>You've promised that when <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>discovers other apps that had access to large amounts of user data, you will ban them and tell those affected. And that's appropriate, but it's unlikely to be enough for the 2 billion <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users.</p><p>One reason that so many people are worried about this incident is what it says about how <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>works. The idea that for every person who decided to try an app, information about nearly 300 other people was scraped from your service is, to put it mildly, disturbing. And the fact that those 87 million people may have technically consented to making their data available doesn't make those people feel any better.</p><p>The recent revelation that malicious actors were able to utilize <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>default privacy settings to match e-mail addresses and phone numbers found on the so-called Dark Web to public <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>profiles potentially affecting all <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users only adds fuel to the fire.</p><p>What binds these two incidents is that they don't appear to be caused by the kind of negligence that allows typical data breaches to happen. Instead they both appear to be the result of people exploiting the very tools that you created to manipulate users' information.</p><p>I know <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has taken several steps, and intends to take more to address these issues. Nevertheless, some have warned that the actions <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is taking to ensure that third parties do not obtain data from unsuspecting users, while necessary, will actually serve to enhance <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>own ability to market such data exclusively.</p><p>Most of us understand that whether you are using <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>or Google or some other online services, we are trading certain information about ourselves for free or low-cost services. But for this model to persist, both sides of the bargain need to know the stakes that are involved. Right now I am not convinced that <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>users have the information that they need to make meaningful choices.</p><p>In the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been willing to defer to tech companies' efforts to regulate themselves, but this may be changing.</p><p>Just last month, in overwhelming bipartisan fashion, Congress voted to make it easier for prosecutors and victims to go after websites that knowingly facilitate sex trafficking. This should be a wake-up call for the tech community.</p><p>We want to hear more, without delay, about what <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and other companies plan to do to take greater responsibility for what happens on their platforms.</p><p>How will you protect users' data? How will you inform users about the changes that you are making? And how do you intend to proactively stop harmful conduct instead of being forced to respond to it months or years later?</p><p>Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>in many ways you and the company that you created, the story that you've created represents the American Dream. Many are incredibly inspired by what you've done. At the same time, you have an obligation, and it's up to you, to ensure that that dream does not becalm a privacy nightmare for the scores of people who use <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>This hearing is an opportunity to speak to those who believe in <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and those who are deeply skeptical about it. We are listening, America is listening and quite possibly the world is listening, too.</p><p>GRASSLEY: Thank you.</p><p>Now Ranking Member Feinstein.</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA), RANKING MEMBER, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>Chairman Grassley, Chairman Thune, thank you both for holding this hearing.</p><p>Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>thank you for being here. You have a real opportunity this afternoon to lead the industry and demonstrate a meaningful commitment to protecting individual privacy.</p><p>We have learned over the past few months, and we've learned a great deal that's alarming. We've seen how foreign actors are abusing social media platforms like <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>to interfere in elections and take millions of Americans' personal information without their knowledge in order to manipulate public opinion and target individual voters.</p><p>Specifically, on February the 16th, Special Counsel Mueller issued an indictment against the Russia-based Internet Research Agency and 13 of its employees for interfering operations targeting the United States. Through this 37-page indictment, we learned that the IRA ran a coordinated campaign through 470 <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>accounts and pages. The campaign included ads and false information to create discord and harm Secretary Clinton's campaign, and the content was seen by an estimated 157 million Americans.</p><p>A month later, on March 17th, news broke that Cambridge Analytica exploited the personal information of approximately 50 million <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users without their knowledge or permission. And, last week, we learned that number was even higher, 87 million <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users who had their private information taken without their consent.</p><p>Specifically, using a personality quiz he created, Professor Kogan collected the personal information of 300,000 <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users, and then collected data on millions of their friends. It appears the information collected included everything these individuals had on their <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>pages and, according to some reports, even included private direct messages between users.</p><p>Professor Kogan is said to have taken data from over 70 million Americans. It has also been reported that he sold this data to Cambridge Analytica for $800,000 dollars. Cambridge Analytica then took this data and created a psychological warfare tool to influence United States elections.</p><p>In fact, the CEO, Alexander Nix, declared that Cambridge Analytica ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign, and its data informed all the strategy for the Trump campaign.</p><p>The reporting has also speculated that Cambridge Analytica worked with the Internet Research Agency to help Russia identify which American voters to target, which its -- with its propaganda.</p><p>I'm concerned that press reports indicate <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>learned about this breach in 2015, but appears not to have taken significant steps to address it until this year.</p><p>So this hearing is important, and I appreciate the conversation we had yesterday. And I believe that <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>through your presence here today and the words you're about to tell us, will indicate how strongly your industry will regulate and/or reform the platforms that they control.</p><p>I believe this is extraordinarily important. You lead a big company with 27,000 employees, and we very much look forward to your comments.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>GRASSLEY: Thank you, Senator Feinstein.</p><p>The history and growth of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>mirrors that of many of our technological giants. Founded by Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>in 2004, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has exploded over the past 14 years. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>currently has over 2 billion monthly active users across the world, over 25,000 employees, and offices in 13 U.S. cities and various other countries.</p><p>Like their expanding user base, the data collected on <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users has also skyrocketed. They have moved on from schools, likes and relationship statuses. Today, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has access to dozens of data points, ranging from ads that you've clicked on, events you've attended and your location based upon your mobile device.</p><p>It is no secret that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>makes money off this data through advertising revenue, although many seem confused by or altogether unaware of this fact. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>generates -- generated $40 billion in revenue in 2017, with about 98 percent coming from advertising across <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Instagram.</p><p>Significant data collection is also occurring at Google, Twitter, Apple, and Amazon. And even -- an ever-expanding portfolio of products and services offered by these companies grant endless opportunities to collect increasing amounts of information on their customers.</p><p>As we get more free or extremely low-cost services, the tradeoff for the American consumer is to provide more personal data. The potential for further growth and innovation based on collection of data is unlimitedless (ph). However, the potential for abuse is also significant.</p><p>While the contours (ph) of the Cambridge Analytica situation are still coming to light, there was clearly a breach of consumer trust and a likely improper transfer of data. The Judiciary Committee will hold a separate hearing exploring Cambridge and other data privacy issues.</p><p>More importantly, though, these events have ignited a larger discussion on consumers' expectations and the future of data privacy in our society. It has exposed that consumers may not fully understand or appreciate the extent to which their data is collected, protected, transferred, used and misused.</p><p>Data has been used in advertising and political campaigns for decades. The amount and type of data obtained, however, has seen a very dramatic change. Campaigns including Presidents Bush, Obama and Trump all use these increasing amounts of data to focus on microtargeting and personalization over numerous social media platforms, and especially <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>In fact, Presidents -- Obama's campaign developed an app utilizing the same <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>feature as Cambridge Analytica to capture the information of not just the app's users, but millions of their friends.</p><p>The digital director for that campaign for 2012 described the data-scraping app as something that would quote, \"wind up being the most groundbreaking piece of technology developed for this campaign,\" end of quote.</p><p>So the effectiveness of these social media tactics can be debated. But their use over the past years, across the political spectrum, and their increased significance cannot be ignored. Our policy towards data privacy and security must keep pace with these changes.</p><p>Data privacy should be tethered to consumer needs and expectations. Now, at a minimum, consumers must have the transparency necessary to make an informed decision about whether to share their data and how it can be used.</p><p>Consumers ought to have clearer information, not opaque policies and complex click-through consent pages. The tech industry has an obligation to respond to widespread and growing concerns over data privacy and security and to restore the public's trust.</p><p>The status quo no longer works. Moreover, Congress must determine if and how we need to strengthen privacy standards to ensure transparency and understanding for the billions of consumers who utilize these products.</p><p>Senator Nelson.</p><p>SEN. BILL NELSON (D-FL), RANKING MEMBER, SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>good afternoon.</p><p>Let me just cut to the chase. If you and other social media companies do not get your act in order, none of us are going to have any privacy anymore. That's what we're facing.</p><p>We're talking about personally identifiable information that, if not kept by the social media -- media companies from theft, a value that we have in America, being our personal privacy -- we won't have it anymore. It's the advent of technology.</p><p>And, of course, all of us are part of it. From the moment that we wake up in the morning, until we go to bed, we're on those handheld tablets. And online companies like <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>are tracking our activities and collecting information.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has a responsibility to protect this personal information. We had a good discussion yesterday. We went over all of this. You told me that the company had failed to do so.</p><p>It's not the first time that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has mishandled its users' information. The FTC found that <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>privacy policies had deceived users in the past. And, in the present case, we recognize that Cambridge Analytica and an app developer lied to consumers and lied to you, lied to <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>But did <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>watch over the operations? We want to know that. And why didn't <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>notify 87 million users that their personally identifiable information had been taken, and it was being also used, why were they not informed for unauthorized, for political purposes?</p><p>So, only now, and I appreciate our conversation, only now, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has pledged to inform those consumers whose accounts were compromised.</p><p>I think you are genuine. I got that sense in conversing with you. You want to do the right thing. You want to enact reforms. We want to know if it's going to be enough. And I hope that will be the in the answers today.</p><p>Now, since we still don't know what Cambridge Analytica has done with this data, you heard Chairman Thune say, as we have discussed, we want to haul Cambridge Analytica in to answer these questions at a separate hearing.</p><p>I want to thank Chairman Thune for working with all of us on scheduling a hearing. There's obviously a great deal of interest in this subject. I hope we can get to the bottom of this. And, if <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and other online companies will not or cannot fix the privacy invasions, then we are going to have to, we, the Congress.</p><p>How can American consumers trust folks like your company to be caretakers of their most personal and identifiable information? And that's the question.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>GRASSLEY: Thank you, my colleagues and Senator Nelson.</p><p>Our witness today is <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>founder, chairman, chief executive officer of <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>launched <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>February 4th, 2004, at the age of 19. And, at that time, he was a student at Harvard University.</p><p>As I mentioned previously, his company now has over 40 billion of annual revenue and over 2 billion, monthly, active users. Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>along with his wife, also established the Chan <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>Initiative to further philanthropy causes.</p><p>I now turn to you. Welcome to the committee, and, whatever your statement is orally, if you have a longer one, it'll be included in the record. So, proceed, sir.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK ZUCKERBERG, </nameText></person>CEO, <person><nameText>FACEBOOK</nameText></person>: Chairman Grassley, Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Feinstein and Ranking Member Nelson and members of the committee, we face a number of important issues around privacy, safety and democracy. And you will rightfully have some hard questions for me to answer. Before I talk about the steps we're taking to address them, I want to talk about how we got here.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is an idealistic and optimistic company. For most of our existence, we focused on all of the good that connecting people can do. And, as <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has grown, people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love, for making their voices heard and for building communities and businesses.</p><p>Just recently, we've seen the \"Me Too\" movement and the March for our Lives organized, at least in part, on <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>After Hurricane Harvey, people came together to raise more than $20 million for relief. And more than 70 million businesses -- small business use <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>to create jobs and grow.</p><p>But it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm, as well. And that goes for fake news, for foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.</p><p>We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. And it was my mistake. And I'm sorry. I started <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here.</p><p>So, now, we have to go through our -- all of our relationship with people and make sure that we're taking a broad enough view of our responsibility.</p><p>It's not enough to just connect people. We have to make sure that those connections are positive. It's not enough to just give people a voice. We need to make sure that people aren't using it to harm other people or to spread misinformation. And it's not enough to just give people control over their information. We need to make sure that the developers they share it with protect their information, too.</p><p>Across the board, we have a responsibility to not just build tools, but to make sure that they're used for good. It will take some time to work through all the changes we need to make across the company, but I'm committed to getting this right. This includes the basic responsibility of protecting people's information, which we failed to do with Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>So here are a few things that we are doing to address this and to prevent it from happening again.</p><p>First, we're getting to the bottom of exactly what Cambridge Analytica did, and telling everyone affected. What we know now is that Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed some information about millions of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>members by buying it from an app developer.</p><p>That information -- this was information that people generally share publicly on their <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>pages, like names and their profile picture and the pages they follow.</p><p>When we first contacted Cambridge Analytica, they told us that they had deleted the data. About a month ago, we heard new reports that suggested that wasn't true. And, now, we're working with governments in the U.S, the U.K. and around the world to do a full audit of what they've done and to make sure they get rid of any data they may still have.</p><p>Second, to make sure no other app developers out there are misusing data, we're now investigating every single app that had access to a large amount of information in the past. And, if we find that someone improperly used data, we're going to ban them from <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and tell everyone affected.</p><p>Third, to prevent this from ever happening again, going forward, we're making sure that developers can't access as much information now. The good news here is that we already made big changes to our platform in 2014 that would have prevented this specific situation from -- with Cambridge Analytica from occurring again today.</p><p>But there's more to do, and you can find more details on the steps we're taking in my written statement.</p><p>My top priority has always been our social mission of connecting people, building community and bringing the world closer together. Advertisers and developers will never take priority over that, as long as I am running <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>I started <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>when I was in college. We've come a long way since then. We now serve more than 2 billion people around the world. And, every day, people use our services to stay connected with the people that matter to them most.</p><p>I believe deeply in what we are doing. And I know that, when we address these challenges we'll look back and view helping people connect and giving more people a voice as a positive force in the world.</p><p>I realize the issues we're talking about today aren't just issues for <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and our community. They're issues and challenges for all of us as Americans.</p><p>Thank you for having me here today, and I'm ready to take your questions.</p><p>GRASSLEY: I'll remind members that, maybe, weren't here when I had my opening comments that we are operating under the five-year -- the five- minute rule. And that applies to, the five-minute rule. And that applies to those of us who are chairing the committee, as well.</p><p>I'll start with you.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>handles extensive amounts of personal data for billions of users. A significant amount of that data is shared with third-party developers who utilize your platform.</p><p>As of this -- early this year, you did not actively monitor whether that data was transferred by such developers to other parties. Moreover, your policies only prohibit transfers by developers to parties seeking to profit from such data.</p><p>Number one, besides Professor Kogan's transfer and now, potentially, Cubeyou, do you know of any instances where user data was improperly transferred to third party in breach of <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>terms? If so, how many times has that happened, and was <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>only made aware of that transfer by some third party?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Mr. Chairman, thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTELR-2018041001cb232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2X-D3K1-JB20-G254-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437067</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8829\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>INTELLIGENCE REPORT</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 10, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Thanks so much, Neil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking right now, everyone, as Neil said, we are minutes away from  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg much anticipated testimony on Capitol Hill.   Lawmakers expect to grill the tech CEO for failing to protect user data and  for failing to rid out fake news during the 2016 election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech stocks, meanwhile soaring today to most trade fears.  They're  beginning to ease.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Xi announcing today that China will reduce tariffs on imported  automobile.  Well, kind of seems like some of this tough talk on trade may  actually be paying of.  I mean, do not forget, everyone, I keep saying  this, we are China's biggest paying customer.</p><p>They need us.  They actually kind of need us more than we need them.  So,  with that in mind, they ought to be willing to play ball, right?</p><p>I'm Trish Regan.  Welcome, everyone, to THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT.</p><p>As we watch market that's up 433 points, we're waiting right now on the big  Facebook hearing that's about to get underway.  Now, I want to revisit for  you some of these troubles.  First of all, Facebook has admitted that the  data firm, Cambridge Analytica, gains information for as many as 87 million  Facebook users.  Remember, I thought it was around 50 million, turned out  to be 87 million and possibly even more.</p><p>The firm basically stole everyone's information for campaign research and  Facebook effectively allowed that to happen.  We also know that Russia used  Facebook to meddle in the 2016 election.  The tech company said it failed  to have proper protocols in place to deter bad actors from using its ad  tools.  In other words, you want to buy an ad on Facebook, here you go.  We  don't care if you happen to be Russian and you're trying to manipulate the  election one way or another, we just sell you the ad.</p><p>Well, then we've got the whole privacy issue.  Facebook stores all of our  data.  And lawmakers want to know if Facebook is doing enough to protect it  users.</p><p>The other component to all of this is of course that memo that we've got  out recently in which the senior executives basically said that we connect  people at all costs.  Meaning, it doesn't matter if we're connecting  terrorists, it doesn't matter if we're connecting bullies at school and  someone dies as a result.  Above all, we just connect people.  No sense of  responsibility whatsoever.</p><p>So you can anticipate a lot of fireworks coming up this hour, specifically  from Capitol Hill where we find our very own Deirdre Bolton right now.  Hi,  Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Hi, Trish.  I'm just a few spaces  away from literally the hot seat where Facebook founder, CEO, Mark  Zuckerberg is going to find himself in a few moments.  So, our sources are  saying he is already in this building.  He came in through a back way.  He  went up to another level through a freight elevator and is now in a holding  room.</p><p>My source also tells me that his wife has accompanied him here.  He did  post just about an hour ago on Facebook.  I'll read part of this, Trish, he  said, \"In an hour I'm going to testify in front of the Senate about how  Facebook needs to take a broader view of our responsibility, not just to  build tools, but to make sure those tools are used for good.  I will do  everything I can to make Facebook a place where everyone can stay closer  with the people they care about, and to make sure it's a positive force in  the world.\"</p><p>Trish, you said it, he is going to take so many tough questions from the  members, of course, of this Senate, Commerce, and Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Earlier, Senator Grassley spoke to us.  Here's what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), CHAIRMAN, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  So, this  brings up what can we do either, through legislation, regulation, or better  yet, if the companies will do it themselves to make sure that people know  about the restrictions that they have on privacy.  And are they going --  once they have good rules, are they going to abide by those rules, because  quite frankly they presumed they had those rules but they didn't enforce  them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON:  Senator Grassley also told us that he thinks how Mark Zuckerberg  performs here today is really going to affect and influence the kinds of  regulations that may be imposed on Facebook.  I want to mention as well,  Trish, that Facebook is actually offering a bounty of anywhere between $500  and $40,000 if you find the next Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>We know that in the past 48 hours that Facebook has actually shut-off  connections to two third-party developers because they felt like they were  getting close to abusing data and becoming the next Cambridge Analytica.   One is called AIQ, and that was generating the kind of quizzes that we saw  through Cambridge Analytica.  So, Facebook shut that down about 48 hours  ago.  And there was another one called CUBE, C-U-B-E, and, again, Facebook  shut that down.</p><p>Just to note to all the developers out there, Facebook will pay you  anywhere between $500 and $40,000 if you find the next Cambridge Analytica  on their system.  Trish, we're waiting, we're probably about half an hour  before Mark Zuckerberg sits in that hot seat.  In the meantime, back to  you.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Well, it kind of seems like it might be worth a little  more than 40-k if you actually go out and you find that Cambridge  Analytica, thereby, saving Facebook the pain, which it is about to endure  momentarily today.  Thank you so much, Deirdre Bolton.  We'll keep checking  back with you.</p><p>Joining me right now is Republican Congressman from New York, Chris  Collins, who will be questioning Mark Zuckerberg at tomorrow's House  hearing.  It's good to see you, Representative.</p><p>REP. CHRIS COLLINS (R), NEW YORK:  Good to be with you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  What do you want to know from him?</p><p>COLLINS:  Well, I'm going to ask for assurances that as we hold them  accountable on the privacy front, there were some disturbing comments that  came out a couple days ago that somebody indicated, sure, we'll let people  keep their data private but we may charge them money to do that.  Well,  that would be totally unacceptable.</p><p>And I think the transparency we need isn't that when they update their, you  know, the terms and conditions of using Facebook it's not, you know, 20  pages, you just click I accept, but rather right up front a privacy  document that says, \"Here are things that I'm willing to share.  Here are  things that I will not share.  Here are the kinds of organizations you can  share with.\"</p><p>You know, if my wife wants to share some shopping information with the  department stores that might give her some ideas, that's fine.  But if on  the other hand, no, I don't want to share my data with somebody on the  political front to hit me with a bunch of pop-up ads, I think there needs  to be more transparency on the privacy front on what things we want.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Let me just stop you for a minute because let's not  forget, Congressman, how Facebook make its money.</p><p>COLLINS:  That's right.</p><p>REGAN:  Facebook makes its money based off of our data that they then turn  around and sell.  So, if we're suddenly saying to them, no, no, don't use  our data, what does that do to their business model?</p><p>COLLINS:  Well, that's something they're going to have to answer to now.   And I think a lot of people do want to share their data in a lot a lot of  cases but not in all cases.  Certainly, the political front lists than any  place would somebody want their data to be use so they get pop-up political  ads.  Those are annoying enough as it is.</p><p>So, you know, in this case, I've said before that Facebook has united  Republicans and Democrats, which is not an easy thing to do in this midterm  year, and saying they've gone above and beyond.  You know, we'll go back a  few years ago when they were certainly in the liberal bend, certainly  favoring liberal media and news stories versus conservative news stories.   Now here they are, you know, with the recent disclosure that these little  quizzes were disclosing all kinds of data.</p><p>You know, I'm sure that what we're going to hear, call it the apology tour,  Mark Zuckerberg is going to admit things were done incorrectly.  They took  their eye off the ball.  They're going to do better.  I think to call that  as happy place, he'll be returning to that statement --</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, but do you buy that?</p><p>COLLINS:  --again and again and again, well, it comes down to action speak  louder than words.  And I sit on Energy and Commerce and Telecommunications  and Oversight.  So, as he makes promises, and I'm going to ask him very  directly for a commitment and promise they will never charge users to keep  their data or any part of their data private.  And then we'll have  additional hearings if need be and hold them accountable.</p><p>REGAN:  So, you know, I don't know, I'm wondering if the business model  that they have, though, is really going to work ultimately, because, you  know, the kids these days don't even like Snapchat, right?  I mean, that  suddenly becoming out of favor.  Facebook as well, especially with younger  folks who have seen this sort of kind of the old folks' platform.</p><p>So, I wonder if there is a competitor, Congressman, that we haven't even  been talking about that's going to come up and say, \"Hey, you know what?   We will protect your data, we will not sell your information and we'll find  out other ways to make money?\"</p><p>COLLINS:  Yes, the issue here, Trish, is they've got over two billion  users.  Everybody is on this particular platform now.  It's going to be  hard to for anyone to catch traction and move on up, you know, if you will  to challenge them but they are going to have to answer to this privacy  issue, be respectful of it and be very careful because if they don't  they're going to see additional regulations into our legislation.  I think  right now --</p><p>REGAN:  And do you think he should be willing to pay it all for it?   Congressman, I'm just asking, 99 cents, a buck 99, kind of like, you know,  you rent music, kind of like, you know, is there a model there where we  insure some kind of protection?  You don't want to see that?</p><p>COLLINS:  Well, if they want to charge users to be on Facebook, that's  fine.</p><p>REGAN:  OK.</p><p>COLLINS:  But not to say it's free, however, if you want to keep your  information private.  Now you have to pay.  I think that's the nuance to  the difference there.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.</p><p>COLLINS:  It's one thing to say we're a paid platform.  It's another thing  to say we're free, but we're going to take your data and possibly abuse it.   I think that's the nuance that's a little different.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Congressman Collins, we look forward to seeing you  there questioning Mark Zuckerberg tomorrow.</p><p>COLLINS:  Very good, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  And we look forward to watching the Senate momentarily.  Thank you,  sir.</p><p>COLLINS:  I do as well.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  Meanwhile, President Trump is still fuming over  yesterday's FBI raid of his personal attorney's office in New York.  The  President tweeting, \"Attorney-client privilege is dead.  And a total witch- hunt.\"</p><p>Agents raided Michael Cohen's office, seizing records on a whole range of  topics, including $130,000 payment that was made to an adult film star that  goes by Stormy Daniels.  Our Edward Lawrence is live at the White House  with the latest on all of this.</p><p>And I can assure you though, Edward, the market isn't too concerned because  we're up almost 500.  Go for it.</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Right, yes, exactly.  The  President known for those long rants when he's angry on Twitter was  remarkably short as you saw there on Twitter.  But we're told that he's  still very upset here inside of the White House.</p><p>The President referring to that evidence that was taken from those raids by  the FBI and it included communication between the President and his  personal attorney, Michael Cohen.  Now, an attorney for Cohen says that was  privileged information.</p><p>Well, Senators on Capitol Hill are talking about those raids.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't believe he'll fire Mueller.  And if he does, it  will be a terrible mistake.  But Mueller would be replaced by someone else  who would continue the work.  So, the best thing that could happen to the  President and the country was for Mueller to be able to finish his work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now here at the White House, we're also waiting to see what's  the U.S. reaction in Syria will be to the chemical attacks that happened  this past weekend.  The President is saying that this will not go  unpunished.  We are waiting to see exactly what will happens.</p><p>However, Democratic Senators on Capitol Hill are saying, \"Wait a minute,  any reaction needs to come through Congress first.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TIM KAINE (D), VIRGINIA SENATOR:  The White House should not wage  unilateral war against anybody without Congress unless it's an imminent  defense to the United States.  I don't think the action that the White  House took against Syria year ago was lawful.  If they want to initiate  military action against Syria, they got to come to Congress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Now, also making headlines, it seems that the President has  brought China to the table or at least around to his way of thinking on  tariffs.  Chinese President Xi Jinping in the Asian Summit has says,  basically, he wants to open up the Chinese economy.  He says that Chinese  are willing to reduce tariffs on goods, including automobiles going forward  coming into their country, also enforce intellectual property laws on  foreign firms.</p><p>The President was cautiously optimistic.  He did tweet few minutes ago  about the situation.  The President is saying, thankful for President Xi's  kind words on tariffs and looking forward in the automobile barriers.  He's  also looking forward to moving forward to a more friendly trade  negotiation.</p><p>Now, sources here in the White House, I can tell you, say that they are  cautiously optimistic.  However, they want to see some substance behind the  words because they've heard China talk about this stuff before but not  follow through.  Trish?</p><p>REGAN:  Edward, thank you very much.</p><p>All right.  Again, I just want to remind people, we are rallying right now.   The markets near the highs of the session right now, up almost 500 points  and it's in part because of these remarks from Chinese President Xi Jinping  this morning.</p><p>President Xi trying to ease some of those trade tensions with the U.S.,  promising to lower import tariffs and to open China's economy.  Have we  heard that one before and is now any different?</p><p>Joining me right now, National Taxpayers Union Senior Fellow, Mattie  Duppler.  Mattie, good to have you hear.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  Are you encouraged? </p><p>DUPPLER:  Well, I'm not surprised, let's put it that way.  It should not be  surprising to anyone to hear China talk about liberalizing its markets.   They've got 1.5 billion people.  They know every industrial nation on earth  wants access to those markets.</p><p>So, what we heard really wasn't super surprising.  I think it would be a  mistake to claim victory in those remarks.  However, it's also mistake to  say that the blunt instrument of tariffs is a right way to go about trying  to find an equilateral agreement with China where we have a fair and free  open trade process.</p><p>There's been a lot of discussion about how we accomplish that.  Tariffs, of  course, are ways to hold American consumers hostage for problems that all  of the world faces right now.  The entire global community really needs to  be in join to try and put pressures on China to not only liberalize their  economies, but also to have better trading practices with their partners.</p><p>REGAN:  There I say might that be a TTP 2.0?  In other words, this, in  fact, the President recently referenced this.  We tried to hold China more  accountable by creating a Trans-Pacific trade Partnership in which we would  have joined forces with other countries over there and said, \"OK, China,  you know, if you want to do business with any of us you're going to have to  play by the rules.\"</p><p>DUPPLER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  We didn't do so.  And now, we're kind of going it on our own.  That  said, Mattie, we are their number one biggest customer.  So yes, I hear  you.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  And that it hurts average Americans.  And, you know, we don't quite  have the threshold for that kind of pain that may be a Chinese regime does  because they're there no matter what.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Right.</p><p>REGAN:  We can vote our folks out.  But, nonetheless, we do have power that  we have not used.  Do you think that the use of this now with the promise  of more tariffs in addition to steel is scaring China in any way?</p><p>DUPPLER:  I think there is certainly a scare tactic here.  But I would  argue that tariffs should only be that, a scare tactic, because tariffs in  practice are attacks on consumers.  And you're right, you know, we have  democracy here which China does not.  They have not only don't have a  democracy, they have centralize economy.</p><p>So, they have far less elasticity than our economy, like we do here in the  United States.  But we also have global supply chains.  We might be the  number one partner for China but we want to be the number one partner  worldwide.</p><p>So what we need to be focus on hear in the United States is making sure  that America is the number one place to do business.  That means, having  American businesses stay here and invest here, which they're starting to  do, thanks to the reform bill that was passed last year.  But also bringing  businesses from around the world to be domiciled in the United States, to  hire American workers and to give American consumers broad choice --</p><p>REGAN:  OK.  Let me back up.  I agree with everything you just said.</p><p>DUPPLER:  There you go.</p><p>REGAN:  But back to China for a second.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  I mean, how is it fair that they charge tariffs on our goods, we  don't charge it on theirs?  And I know what you're going to say, \"Oh, but  it makes it cheaper for everybody to buy all the stuffs that they want to  buy at Walmart.\"  But in the interim, what happens?  If you do not have a  level playing field, what happens to your ability to produce as a nation?</p><p>DUPPLER:  Well, I would take argue with the notion of a level playing field  being that we can charge the exact same thing for every product.  We don't  make every single consumer good here and that's OK because what we do is  build processes here, build industrial mechanics that allows us to not only  produce products, but to trade globally.  And that's not just with China,  that's with every country in the world.</p><p>REGAN:  Right.  But what do you do when they start stealing all your  intellectual property and they start stealing your technology so that --</p><p>DUPPLER:  Trish, I'm with you.  I'm totally with you there.  I think --</p><p>REGAN:  -- in other words, it's great that we do it.</p><p>DUPPLER:  -- right.</p><p>REGAN:  But if they can do it as well because they steal it from us, then  where do we windup?</p><p>DUPPLER:  I agree.  I believe that we need extremely strong protections for  intellectual property.  That goes back to what we're talking about before  where the United States as a democratic nation has very strong protections  for I.P.  And we need to export those around the world.</p><p>China has long been a villain in this cause.  They need to be held to task  for that.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes.</p><p>DUPPLER:  And I completely agree, I do not believe that brash tariffs are  the way to accomplish that.  We have a global community putting pressure on  China and something like the TPP would be a way to do that.</p><p>REGAN:  You know, but then you've got to get everybody on board, and you  know it's a headache.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Absolutely.</p><p>REGAN:  If we have power, if we have economic power, you know, and maybe  we're saying the same thing here because you're saying the threat of  tariffs are not bad, tariffs in action are kind of bad.  But we do have a  pretty powerful threat, and if you're going to make a threat you've got to  be willing to follow through on that threat.  I don't believe in, you know,  just throwing out rhetoric and not being willing to see it through, Mattie.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Yes, I agree with you there.  But the American economy is a Trump  card in and off itself and we should play it to its greatest strength, not  to its greatest weakness.</p><p>REGAN:  It's certainly a very interesting time.  And it's nice to see the  market recovering here on hope that China will actually start to level that  playing field.  Mattie, thank you very much.  Good to have you here.  Very  interesting conversation.</p><p>DUPPLER:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  At any moment, I want to remind everyone, guess who?  Facebook CEO  Mark Zuckerberg is going to be there on Capitol Hill.  He is getting set to  testify there before the Senate.</p><p>It comes as his company is facing all kinds of questions as to how it  handles our personal data, what it does with that data.  How politics is  influenced and buys our data.  How Russians may have influenced the  election with our data.  And also the lack of responsibility this company  feels, not just to protect our data, but also in terms of any kind of  consequences that may result from tariffs connecting with each other,  bullies from connecting with each other.  Apparently, it doesn't matter so  long as they're connected.</p><p>You can imagine there are going to be many politicians that don't like any  of this.  So expect some fireworks for Mr. Mark Zuckerberg momentarily.   We're back with it right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>REGAN:  All right, everyone, we are awaiting on Mark Zuckerberg, who's  going to be testifying there on Capitol Hill.  Lot of questions he's going  to be facing from lawmakers.</p><p>And as we await that, we're looking at a market that's trading up rather  nicely, near highs of the session right up.  It's up 454, because I tell  you what, all those worries about the trade war, well, they're beginning to  disintegrate and that's because the Chinese President is promising to open  China's markets to cut import tariffs and perhaps level the playing field a  little bit more.</p><p>Let's take a look at shares of Facebook right now.  Let's pull those up.   They were higher earlier.  We'll see how they do as Mr. Zuckerberg is there  testifying before the Senate where, as I have been saying, you can imagine,  he's going to face some pretty fiery politicians who are going to use this  opportunity, perhaps to go after the very company that many of them  probably needed or used data for their campaigns, up $3.77 right now on  Facebook.  So, recovering there indeed.</p><p>Let's go down to the NYSE.  Nicole Petallides is following all of that.   Hey, Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Hey, Trish, you're right.  So, you  see Facebook up for the second day in a row.  Everybody is talking about  what we'll hear today.  Will there be, you know, obviously a lot of ethics  and will there has to be legislation going forward, or will the tech  companies take over and do the things that they need to do?</p><p>The markets, the Dow is up 458 points, had been up 532 points.  It has had  more than 300-point moves 14 days in a row.  We've never seen that ever in  history.</p><p>We're looking at the S&amp;P that's up 1.7 percent.  The Dow winners are  dominated by industrials, financials, Boeing, Goldman Sachs, Caterpillar,  those are among the best performers.  Tech stocks, also with the up arrows.</p><p>Facebook front and center today as I noted, you see right now that's up  161.  Apple up 3.21 at 173.  Microsoft, Alphabet Google also higher.</p><p>And we have the Sprint, T-Mobile move here today, big move for Sprint.  In  fact, Sprint has had the biggest move, the largest percent increase since  2016, since the end of the summer in 2016.  Right now, it's up almost 20  percent, Trish, all on that on the talk that they rekindled.</p><p>Sprint and T-Mobile have restarted their talk of deal.  And this appeared a  combination they've talked about for the third time in four years.  We'll  see what happens.  Back to you, Trish.</p><p>REGAN:  Nicole, thank you very much.</p><p>All right.  As we await Zuckerberg's testimony we are joined right here by  Belpointe Chief Strategist, David Nelson, Tematica Research CIO, Chris  Versace, along with our own Deirdre Bolton who is live there down in D.C.,  getting ready for all these fireworks.</p><p>And, David, do you think there will be some?</p><p>DAVID NELSON, BELPOINTE CHIEF STRATEGIST:  There will.  He's going to be  talking, he's going to be, you know, apologizing, going to start off there.   And, you know, I would encourage everyone, you know, take a hard look at  his written testimony, very important.</p><p>He talks about nefarious actors.  He talks about bad actors everywhere from  Macedonia to Russia.  And I think the Senators are going to come down  pretty hard.</p><p>I would take Senator John Kennedy's, his words just yesterday to heart.  He  says very clearly that this problem may be too big for Facebook to fix it  on their own.  And I think that's probably where we're going.</p><p>REGAN:  Wow.  And if that's where we're going, you know what that means,  Chris?</p><p>NELSON:  Regulation.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, regulation.  Regulation, or let me throw this one out there,  too, as long as we've been talking about antitrust and Amazon, of course,  has Facebook gotten too big for its own good, Chris?</p><p>CHRIS VERSACE, CIO, TEMATICA RESEARCH:  Has Facebook gotten too big for its  own good?  It certainly has grown extremely fast from around $7 billion  revenue about a decade ago to over $40 billion last year.  I think the big  problem for the company, Trish, is really understanding as its grown does  it have the right checks and balances and processes in place?</p><p>And when we look at Zuckerberg's written testimony one of the things that I  step back on and think about is, yes, he's admitting it his fault.  Yes, he  is saying that they need to do more.  What I haven't heard anybody say,  though, is the incremental cost that this is going to amount to Facebook.   And it's not going to be cheap.  It's going to hit them, it's going to hit  them hard.</p><p>And I think a lot of people haven't really braced for that.  We haven't  seen their earnings expectations for first quarter, second quarter move at  all in the last 30 days.  And I think investors are going to be surprised.</p><p>But, you know, as far as antitrust goes, I don't think so.  I think there's  enough competition out there.  We have other players.</p><p>REGAN:  I don't know.  I mean, we were just talking about the --</p><p>NELSON:  I would disagree.</p><p>REGAN:  -- over two billion users on Facebook.</p><p>NELSON:  Seventy-three percent of online ads right now are Google and  Facebook alone.  So, that is pretty big, that's an enormous number.</p><p>REGAN:  I mean, two companies that are quite big.  And they're antitrust --</p><p>NELSON:  There are almost sovereign countries at this point.</p><p>REGAN:  -- that are being floated about, Amazon one would think you'd have  to include Facebook and Google, Alphabet in that list.</p><p>NELSON:  Yes.</p><p>REGAN:  In terms of its ability, though, to continue its earnings stream,  let's take a look at the stock, which is trading higher right now.  And,  Deirdre, Chris makes a very good point.  In other words, this is a company  that makes money off of data.  And now it has to go out and protect all  that data and not be so willing to sell it so easily to whoever comes  along, well, that presents a very different earnings scenario in the  future, does it not?</p><p>BOLTON:  It certainly does.  It points to center profit margins as you and  your guests have been speaking about.  We've already heard Mark Zuckerberg  say this week that instead of having 10,000 engineers on board who are  safety and security, who are going through and looking for fake news and  looking for bad activity, they're going to double that amount, Trish.</p><p>So they are hiring an additional 10,000 engineers before this year is up.   So, 20,000 in total just on that team.  So, yes, of course, humans cost  money and that is going to be just one of the activities that does eat into  Facebook's profit margin.</p><p>I want to tell you a little bit of something about the color and the feel  that we're getting.  I mean, it's quite close.  We're expecting him to walk  in any minute.</p><p>As I may have mentioned, he came up through a freight elevator, according  to a source.  His wife is here as well.  Also here are protesters.  You had  Code Pink, you had people standing up and saying stop corporate spying.   They were holding big placards.</p><p>They actually haven't been kicked out.  They are still in the crowd but  their signs are down.  There's also a woman who is dressed like a troll.   Basically it looks like Halloween costume.  It's hairy, I do think.</p><p>REGAN:  All right.  What does that mean, to dress like a troll like from  the movie, \"Trolls\" or something?</p><p>BOLTON:  And so I think it double on Sandra (ph) is when you get trolled on  social media, she's actually here in this physical embodiment of a troll.   So, definitely lots of colorful characters here.</p><p>Here he is.  All right watching just now --</p><p>REGAN:  He's watching -- so there are lawmakers there.  You can see the  media frenzy around this right now is obviously significant.  This has  become one of the most powerful media companies there is, David.  And  that's why we get back to the question this question of has it gotten too  big, is it, in fact, in your view a monopoly?</p><p>NELSON:  In terms of social media, almost at this point.  And big tech in  general, you know, big data is big money.  And at some point in time we're  going to have to address this.</p><p>You have to ask yourself, is Facebook good for America?  And the best I can  come up with right now is maybe, maybe.  You know, we're certainly divided  as a nation, social media is certainly been an unwitting accomplice.</p><p>And for investors, and I'm part of that community, our moral compass is  money, you know.  So, we're about making money.  So maybe we're going to  have to look somewhere else to see how we're going to fix this.</p><p>REGAN:  What their compass has been all about as well, I mean, and I keep  citing this letter and this memo from one of the top executives there that  still works there, who basically said, \"Look our goal, our job is to  connect people at all costs.  And some of those costs might be quite  horrific, but we're out there connecting and that's our number one goal.\"</p><p>And, again, I just want to reiterate the media frenzy.  I mean, we haven't  seen a lot of tech CEOs out there testifying, certainly the financial CEOs  went through their thick of it back in 2008.</p><p>NELSON:  Well, nobody looks good in front of a Senate Congressional  Committee.  You start to look like Michael Corleone, and nobody wants to do  that.  And Mark Zuckerberg, this gentleman that has political aspirations  somewhere beyond Facebook.  It wasn't that long ago he toured the country  in an almost campaign-like fashion.</p><p>REGAN:  Yes, I would be surprised to see him do something politically.  But  then again, who knows.  He has not spoken out in this kind of large  setting.  He hasn't given many interviews.  He hasn't spoken before many  groups but here he is today.</p><p>Let's listen in.</p><p>GRASSLEY:  We welcome everyone today's hearing on Facebook's social media  privacy and the use and abuse of data.</p><p>Although not unprecedented, this is a unique hearing.  The issues we will  consider range from data privacy and security to consumer protection and  the Federal Trade Commission enforcement touching on jurisdictions of these  two committees.</p><p>We have 44 members between our two committees, that may not seem like a  large group by Facebook standards but it is significant here for a hearing  in the United States Senate.  We will do our best to keep things moving  efficiently given our circumstances.  We will begin with opening statements  from the chairmen and ranking members of each committee, starting with  Chairman Thune, and then proceed with Mr.  Zuckerberg's opening statement.</p><p>We will then move onto questioning.  Each member will have five minutes to  question witnesses.</p><p>I'd like to remind the members of both committees that time limits will be  and must be strictly enforced given the numbers that we have here today.   If you're over your time, Chairman Thune and I will make sure to let you  know.  There will not be a second round as well.</p><p>Of course there will be the usual follow-up written questions for the  record.  Questioning will alternate between majority and minority and  between committees.  We will proceed in order based on respective committee  seniority.</p><p>We will anticipate a couple short breaks later in the afternoon.</p><p>And so it's my pleasure to recognize the Chairman of the Commerce  Committee, Chairman Thune, for his opening statement.</p><p>SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD), CHAIRMAN, COMMERCE COMMITTEE:  Thank you, Chairman  Grassley.</p><p>Today's hearing is extraordinary.  It's extraordinary to hold a joint  committee hearing.  It's even more extraordinary to have a single CEO  testify before nearly half of the United States Senate.</p><p>But then, Facebook is pretty extraordinary.  More than 2 billion people use  Facebook every month.  One point four billion people use it every day; more  than the population of any country on Earth except China, and more than  four times the population of the United States.  It's also more than 1,500  times the population of my home state of South Dakota.</p><p>Plus, roughly 45 percent of American adults report getting at least some of  their news from Facebook.</p><p>In many respects, Facebook's incredible reach is why we're here today.   We're here because of what you, Mr. Zuckerberg, have described as a breach  of trust.</p><p>A quiz app used by approximately 300,000 people led to information about 87  million Facebook users being obtained by the company Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>There are plenty of questions about the behavior of Cambridge Analytica and  we expect to hold a future hearing on Cambridge and similar firms.  But as  you've said, this is not likely to be an isolated incident, a fact  demonstrated by Facebook's suspension of another firm just this past  weekend.</p><p>You've promised that when Facebook discovers other apps that had access to  large amounts of user data, you will ban them and tell those affected.  And  that's appropriate, but it's unlikely to be enough for the 2 billion  Facebook users.</p><p>One reason that so many people are worried about this incident is what it  says about how Facebook works.  The idea that for every person who decided  to try an app, information about nearly 300 other people was scraped from  your service is, to put it mildly, disturbing.  And the fact that those 87  million people may have technically consented to making their data  available doesn't make those people feel any better.</p><p>The recent revelation that malicious actors were able to utilize Facebook's  default privacy settings to match e-mail addresses and phone numbers found  on the so-called Dark Web to public Facebook profiles potentially affecting  all Facebook users only adds fuel to the fire.</p><p>What binds these two incidents is that they don't appear to be caused by  the kind of negligence that allows typical data breaches to happen.   Instead they both appear to be the result of people exploiting the very  tools that you created to manipulate users' information.</p><p>I know Facebook has taken several steps, and intends to take more to  address these issues.  Nevertheless, some have warned that the actions  Facebook is taking to ensure that third parties do not obtain data from  unsuspecting users, while necessary, will actually serve to enhance  Facebook's own ability to market such data exclusively.</p><p>Most of us understand that whether you are using Facebook or Google or some  other online services, we are trading certain information about ourselves  for free or low-cost services.  But for this model to persist, both sides  of the bargain need to know the stakes that are involved.  Right now I am  not convinced that Facebook's users have the information that they need to  make meaningful choices.</p><p>In the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been  willing to defer to tech companies' efforts to regulate themselves, but  this may be changing.</p><p>Just last month, in overwhelming bipartisan fashion, Congress voted to make  it easier for prosecutors and victims to go after websites that knowingly  facilitate sex trafficking.  This should be a wake-up call for the tech  community.</p><p>We want to hear more, without delay, about what Facebook and other  companies plan to do to take greater responsibility for what happens on  their platforms.</p><p>How will you protect users' data?  How will you inform users about the  changes that you are making?  And how do you intend to proactively stop  harmful conduct instead of being forced to respond to it months or years  later?</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, in many ways you and the company that you created, the  story that you've created represents the American Dream.  Many are  incredibly inspired by what you've done.  At the same time, you have an  obligation, and it's up to you, to ensure that that dream does not becalm a  privacy nightmare for the scores of people who use Facebook.</p><p>This hearing is an opportunity to speak to those who believe in Facebook  and those who are deeply skeptical about it.  We are listening, America is  listening and quite possibly the world is listening, too.</p><p>GRASSLEY:  Thank you.</p><p>Now Ranking Member Feinstein.</p><p>SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D-CA), RANKING MEMBER, SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:   Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>Chairman Grassley, Chairman Thune, thank you both for holding this hearing.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg, thank you for being here.  You have a real opportunity this  afternoon to lead the industry and demonstrate a meaningful commitment to  protecting individual privacy.</p><p>We have learned over the past few months, and we've learned a great deal  that's alarming.  We've seen how foreign actors are abusing social media  platforms like Facebook to interfere in elections and take millions of  Americans' personal information without their knowledge in order to  manipulate public opinion and target individual voters.</p><p>Specifically, on February the 16th, Special Counsel Mueller issued an  indictment against the Russia-based Internet Research Agency and 13 of its  employees for interfering operations targeting the United States.  Through  this 37-page indictment, we learned that the IRA ran a coordinated campaign  through 470 Facebook accounts and pages.  The campaign included ads and  false information to create discord and harm Secretary Clinton's campaign,  and the content was seen by an estimated 157 million Americans.</p><p>A month later, on March 17th, news broke that Cambridge Analytica exploited  the personal information of approximately 50 million Facebook users without  their knowledge or permission.  And, last week, we learned that number was  even higher, 87 million Facebook users who had their private information  taken without their consent.</p><p>Specifically, using a personality quiz he created, Professor Kogan  collected the personal information of 300,000 Facebook users, and then  collected data on millions of their friends.  It appears the information  collected included everything these individuals had on their Facebook pages  and, according to some reports, even included private direct messages  between users.</p><p>Professor Kogan is said to have taken data from over 70 million Americans.   It has also been reported that he sold this data to Cambridge Analytica for  $800,000 dollars.  Cambridge Analytica then took this data and created a  psychological warfare tool to influence United States elections.</p><p>In fact, the CEO, Alexander Nix, declared that Cambridge Analytica ran all  the digital campaign, the television campaign, and its data informed all  the strategy for the Trump campaign.</p><p>The reporting has also speculated that Cambridge Analytica worked with the  Internet Research Agency to help Russia identify which American voters to  target, which its -- with its propaganda.</p><p>I'm concerned that press reports indicate Facebook learned about this  breach in 2015, but appears not to have taken significant steps to address  it until this year.</p><p>So this hearing is important, and I appreciate the conversation we had  yesterday.  And I believe that Facebook, through your presence here today  and the words you're about to tell us, will indicate how strongly your  industry will regulate and/or reform the platforms that they control.</p><p>I believe this is extraordinarily important.  You lead a big company with  27,000 employees, and we very much look forward to your comments.</p><p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p><p>GRASSLEY:  Thank you, Senator Feinstein.</p><p>The history and growth of Facebook mirrors that of many of our  technological giants.  Founded by Mr. Zuckerberg in 2004, Facebook has  exploded over the past 14 years.  Facebook currently has over 2 billion  monthly active users across the world, over 25,000 employees, and offices  in 13 U.S. cities and various other countries.</p><p>Like their expanding user base, the data collected on Facebook users has  also skyrocketed.  They have moved on from schools, likes and relationship  statuses.  Today, Facebook has access to dozens of data points, ranging  from ads that you've clicked on, events you've attended and your location  based upon your mobile device.</p><p>It is no secret that Facebook makes money off this data through advertising  revenue, although many seem confused by or altogether unaware of this fact.   Facebook generates -- generated $40 billion in revenue in 2017, with about  98 percent coming from advertising across Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Significant data collection is also occurring at Google, Twitter, Apple,  and Amazon.  And even -- an ever-expanding portfolio of products and  services offered by these companies grant endless opportunities to collect  increasing amounts of information on their customers.</p><p>As we get more free or extremely low-cost services, the tradeoff for the  American consumer is to provide more personal data.  The potential for  further growth and innovation based on collection of data is unlimitedless  (ph).  However, the potential for abuse is also significant.</p><p>While the contours (ph) of the Cambridge Analytica situation are still  coming to light, there was clearly a breach of consumer trust and a likely  improper transfer of data.  The Judiciary Committee will hold a separate  hearing exploring Cambridge and other data privacy issues.</p><p>More importantly, though, these events have ignited a larger discussion on  consumers' expectations and the future of data privacy in our society.  It  has exposed that consumers may not fully understand or appreciate the  extent to which their data is collected, protected, transferred, used and  misused.</p><p>Data has been used in advertising and political campaigns for decades.  The  amount and type of data obtained, however, has seen a very dramatic change.   Campaigns including Presidents Bush, Obama and Trump all use these  increasing amounts of data to focus on microtargeting and personalization  over numerous social media platforms, and especially Facebook.</p><p>In fact, Presidents -- Obama's campaign developed an app utilizing the same  Facebook feature as Cambridge Analytica to capture the information of not  just the app's users, but millions of their friends.</p><p>The digital director for that campaign for 2012 described the data-scraping  app as something that would quote, \"wind up being the most groundbreaking  piece of technology developed for this campaign,\" end of quote.</p><p>So the effectiveness of these social media tactics can be debated.  But  their use over the past years, across the political spectrum, and their  increased significance cannot be ignored.  Our policy towards data privacy  and security must keep pace with these changes.</p><p>Data privacy should be tethered to consumer needs and expectations.  Now,  at a minimum, consumers must have the transparency necessary to make an  informed decision about whether to share their data and how it can be used.</p><p>Consumers ought to have clearer information, not opaque policies and  complex click-through consent pages.  The tech industry has an obligation  to respond to widespread and growing concerns over data privacy and  security and to restore the public's trust.</p><p>The status quo no longer works.  Moreover, Congress must determine if and  how we need to strengthen privacy standards to ensure transparency and  understanding for the billions of consumers who utilize these products.</p><p>Senator Nelson.</p><p>SEN. BILL NELSON (D-FL), RANKING MEMBER, SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE:  Thank  you, Mr. Chairman.  Mr. Zuckerberg, good afternoon.</p><p>Let me just cut to the chase.  If you and other social media companies do  not get your act in order, none of us are going to have any privacy  anymore.  That's what we're facing.</p><p>We're talking about personally identifiable information that, if not kept  by the social media -- media companies from theft, a value that we have in  America, being our personal privacy -- we won't have it anymore.  It's the  advent of technology.</p><p>And, of course, all of us are part of it.  From the moment that we wake up  in the morning, until we go to bed, we're on those handheld tablets.  And  online companies like Facebook are tracking our activities and collecting  information.</p><p>Facebook has a responsibility to protect this personal information.  We had  a good discussion yesterday.  We went over all of this.  You told me that  the company had failed to do so.</p><p>It's not the first time that Facebook has mishandled its users'  information.  The FTC found that Facebook's privacy policies had deceived  users in the past.  And, in the present case, we recognize that Cambridge  Analytica and an app developer lied to consumers and lied to you, lied to  Facebook.</p><p>But did Facebook watch over the operations?  We want to know that.  And why  didn't Facebook notify 87 million users that their personally identifiable  information had been taken, and it was being also used, why were they not  informed for unauthorized, for political purposes?</p><p>So, only now, and I appreciate our conversation, only now, Facebook has  pledged to inform those consumers whose accounts were compromised.</p><p>I think you are genuine.  I got that sense in conversing with you.  You  want to do the right thing.  You want to enact reforms.  We want to know if  it's going to be enough.  And I hope that will be the in the answers today.</p><p>Now, since we still don't know what Cambridge Analytica has done with this  data, you heard Chairman Thune say, as we have discussed, we want to haul  Cambridge Analytica in to answer these questions at a separate hearing.</p><p>I want to thank Chairman Thune for working with all of us on scheduling a  hearing.  There's obviously a great deal of interest in this subject.  I  hope we can get to the bottom of this.  And, if Facebook and other online  companies will not or cannot fix the privacy invasions, then we are going  to have to, we, the Congress.</p><p>How can American consumers trust folks like your company to be caretakers  of their most personal and identifiable information?  And that's the  question.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>GRASSLEY:  Thank you, my colleagues and Senator Nelson.</p><p>Our witness today is Mark Zuckerberg, founder, chairman, chief executive  officer of Facebook.  Mr. Zuckerberg launched Facebook February 4th, 2004,  at the age of 19.  And, at that time, he was a student at Harvard  University.</p><p>As I mentioned previously, his company now has over 40 billion of annual  revenue and over 2 billion, monthly, active users.  Mr. Zuckerberg, along  with his wife, also established the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to further  philanthropy causes.</p><p>I now turn to you.  Welcome to the committee, and, whatever your statement  is orally, if you have a longer one, it'll be included in the record.  So,  proceed, sir.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  Chairman Grassley, Chairman Thune, Ranking  Member Feinstein and Ranking Member Nelson and members of the committee, we  face a number of important issues around privacy, safety and democracy.   And you will rightfully have some hard questions for me to answer.  Before  I talk about the steps we're taking to address them, I want to talk about  how we got here.</p><p>Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company.  For most of our  existence, we focused on all of the good that connecting people can do.   And, as Facebook has grown, people everywhere have gotten a powerful new  tool for staying connected to the people they love, for making their voices  heard and for building communities and businesses.</p><p>Just recently, we've seen the \"Me Too\" movement and the March for our Lives  organized, at least in part, on Facebook.  After Hurricane Harvey, people  came together to raise more than $20 million for relief.  And more than 70  million businesses -- small business use Facebook to create jobs and grow.</p><p>But it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from  being used for harm, as well.  And that goes for fake news, for foreign  interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data  privacy.</p><p>We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a  big mistake.  And it was my mistake.  And I'm sorry.  I started Facebook, I  run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here.</p><p>So, now, we have to go through our -- all of our relationship with people  and make sure that we're taking a broad enough view of our responsibility.</p><p>It's not enough to just connect people.  We have to make sure that those  connections are positive.  It's not enough to just give people a voice.  We  need to make sure that people aren't using it to harm other people or to  spread misinformation.  And it's not enough to just give people control  over their information.  We need to make sure that the developers they  share it with protect their information, too.</p><p>Across the board, we have a responsibility to not just build tools, but to  make sure that they're used for good.  It will take some time to work  through all the changes we need to make across the company, but I'm  committed to getting this right.  This includes the basic responsibility of  protecting people's information, which we failed to do with Cambridge  Analytica.</p><p>So here are a few things that we are doing to address this and to prevent  it from happening again.</p><p>First, we're getting to the bottom of exactly what Cambridge Analytica did,  and telling everyone affected.  What we know now is that Cambridge  Analytica improperly accessed some information about millions of Facebook  members by buying it from an app developer.</p><p>That information -- this was information that people generally share  publicly on their Facebook pages, like names and their profile picture and  the pages they follow.</p><p>When we first contacted Cambridge Analytica, they told us that they had  deleted the data.  About a month ago, we heard new reports that suggested  that wasn't true.  And, now, we're working with governments in the U.S, the  U.K. and around the world to do a full audit of what they've done and to  make sure they get rid of any data they may still have.</p><p>Second, to make sure no other app developers out there are misusing data,  we're now investigating every single app that had access to a large amount  of information in the past.  And, if we find that someone improperly used  data, we're going to ban them from Facebook and tell everyone affected.</p><p>Third, to prevent this from ever happening again, going forward, we're  making sure that developers can't access as much information now.  The good  news here is that we already made big changes to our platform in 2014 that  would have prevented this specific situation from -- with Cambridge  Analytica from occurring again today.</p><p>But there's more to do, and you can find more details on the steps we're  taking in my written statement.</p><p>My top priority has always been our social mission of connecting people,  building community and bringing the world closer together.  Advertisers and  developers will never take priority over that, as long as I am running  Facebook.</p><p>I started Facebook when I was in college.  We've come a long way since  then.  We now serve more than 2 billion people around the world.  And,  every day, people use our services to stay connected with the people that  matter to them most.</p><p>I believe deeply in what we are doing.  And I know that, when we address  these challenges we'll look back and view helping people connect and giving  more people a voice as a positive force in the world.</p><p>I realize the issues we're talking about today aren't just issues for  Facebook and our community.  They're issues and challenges for all of us as  Americans.</p><p>Thank you for having me here today, and I'm ready to take your questions.</p><p>GRASSLEY:  I'll remind members that, maybe, weren't here when I had my  opening comments that we are operating under the five-year -- the five- minute rule.  And that applies to, the five-minute rule.  And that applies  to those of us who are chairing the committee, as well.</p><p>I'll start with you.</p><p>Facebook handles extensive amounts of personal data for billions of users.   A significant amount of that data is shared with third-party developers who  utilize your platform.</p><p>As of this -- early this year, you did not actively monitor whether that  data was transferred by such developers to other parties.  Moreover, your  policies only prohibit transfers by developers to parties seeking to profit  from such data.</p><p>Number one, besides Professor Kogan's transfer and now, potentially,  Cubeyou, do you know of any instances where user data was improperly  transferred to third party in breach of Facebook's terms?  If so, how many  times has that happened, and was Facebook only made aware of that transfer  by some third party?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Mr. Chairman, thank you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

San Francisco: Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos will defend the Internet giants they built, painting them as US success stories in a fiercely competitive world during a major antitrust hearing Wednesday.    The unprecedented hearing will also feature chief executives Tim Cook of Apple and Sundar Pichai of Google and its parent firm Alphabet.    The CEOs of four of the most powerful companies in the world will testify remotely at the hearing, which comes less than 100 days before the US election.    Zuckerberg is to say that the internet giant would not have succeeded without US laws fostering competition, but that the rules of the internet now need updating.    \u201cFacebook is a proudly American company,\u201d Zuckerberg said in prepared remarks ahead of what will be a closely watched House Judiciary Committee hearing.    \u201cOur story would not have been possible without US laws that encourage competition and innovation.\u201d    Bezos will paint the online giant as a vibrant American \u201csuccess\u201d story, while accepting a need for scrutiny.    \u201cI believe Amazon should be scrutinized,\u201d Bezos said in prepared remarks posted online ahead of the hearing.    But he struck a defiant note, too, saying that \u201cwhen you look in the mirror, assess the criticism, and still believe you\u2019re doing the right thing, no force in the world should be able to move you.\u201d    It will be the first time Bezos has testified before Congress.    But Zuckerberg also acknowledged \u201cconcerns about the size and perceived power that tech companies have.\u201d    \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve called for a more active role for governments and regulators and updated rules for the internet.\u201d    The showdown in the House of Representatives comes amid rising concerns over Big Tech dominance, which has become even more pronounced during the coronavirus pandemic.    \u201cUltimately, I believe companies shouldn\u2019t be making so many judgments about important issues like harmful content, privacy, and election integrity on their own,\u201d Zuckerberg\u2019s prepared remarks read.    Big vs bad    Questions at the hearing are expected to veer into issues ranging beyond whether the technology titans are abusing their power in marketplaces.    Current US antitrust laws make it difficult for enforcers to target companies simply for being large or dominant without also showing they cause harm to consumers or abuse their market power.    \u201cWe believe in values\u2014democracy, competition, inclusion and free expression\u2014that the American economy was built on,\u201d Zuckerberg is to say.    \u201cMany other tech companies share these values, but there\u2019s no guarantee our values will win out.\u201d    He is to cite the example of China building and exporting a version of the internet focused on \u201cvery different ideas\u201d from the US model.    \u201cI believe it\u2019s important to maintain the core values of openness and fairness that have made America\u2019s digital economy a force for empowerment and opportunity here and around the world,\u201d Zuckerberg is to say.    Tech company chiefs are expected to stress how they benefit consumers, particularly during the pandemic, and face competition\u2014particularly from China.    Bezos will spotlight increasing competition among online retail platforms.    \u201cOur success may help explain the wide proliferation of marketplaces of all types and sizes around the world,\u201d Bezos said.    \u201cThis includes US companies like Walmart, eBay, Etsy, and Target, as well as retailers based overseas but selling globally, such as Alibaba and Rakuten.\u201d    The antitrust debate is being muddled by a rising \u201ctechlash\u201d over a range of issues from privacy to economic inequality to political bias.    \u201cFacebook is a successful company now, but we got there the American way: we started with nothing and provided better products that people find valuable,\u201d Zuckerberg is to say.    \u201cAs I understand our laws, companies aren\u2019t bad just because they are big. Many large companies that fail to compete cease to exist.    Social media giants face attacks for allegedly using their dominance to stifle conservative views\u2014a claim made by President Donald Trump.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42712802404</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-GFX1-F07F-80D3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"751\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Asian Age</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There are also growing concerns over the volume of personal data sucked up and used by the tech players, often unknown to users.</p><p>\"If the rules for the internet were being written from scratch today, I don't think people would want private companies to be making so many decisions around speech, elections and data privacy without a more robust democratic process,\" Mr Zuckerberg said on an earnings conference call yesterday.</p><p>\"For harmful content, I think there should be a public process for determining what's allowed and required for keeping harmful content to a minimum that could be through government or industry, but having common standards is critical since people use so many different services to share content.\" Mr Zuckerberg said that in elections there had long been laws defining political advertising, but updates were needed to better reflect today's threats, such as interference in votes.</p><p>Facebook was widely blamed for Russia's meddling in the 2016 US election, ahead of Donald Trump becoming president.</p><p>\"Those threats are often not covered by today's laws and I think we'd be better off if -companies didn't define those policies themselves,\" Mr Zuckerberg said.</p><p>It was a tumultuous quarter for Facebook, which is facing a multi-billion-dollar fine from the US for sharing user data with Cambridge Analytica as well as an increase in scrutiny from regulators.</p><p>This includes the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission probing Facebook and Google this year and flagging the creation of a new regulator as well as an examination of the social networks' secretive algorithms.</p><p>The chief executive outlined plans to get ahead of the issue, elaborating on Facebook's new \"privacy-focused vision for the future of social networking\".</p><p>\"The basic idea here is that in our lives, we have public spaces like that town square and private spaces like our living rooms and in our digital lives we also need both public and private spaces. For the last 15 years, Facebook and Instagram have become the digital equivalent of the town square. We can do almost anything you want with lots of people at once,\" he said.</p><p>\"Our plan is to build this the way we've developed WhatsApp, focused on the most fundamental and private use case messaging, make it as secure as possible with end-to-end encryption and then build more ways for people to interact on top of that.\" In its quarterly results Facebook set aside $US3bn for an expected fine from the US Federal Trade Commission over privacy issues, cutting into the social-media giant's profits even as its underlying business remained strong.</p><p>Facebook posted $US15.08bn in revenue in the March quarter, up 26 per cent from $US11.97bn in the same period last year, but profits of only $US2.43bn in the first quarter, as the one-time reserve cut in.</p><p>US regulators have been probing whether Facebook violated terms of an earlier consent decree when data of tens of millions of its users was transferred to Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that did work for the campaign of the US President.</p><p>Despite the controversies, investors sent shares in Facebook up more than 10 per cent to $US200.50 in after-hours trading, meaning the company has largely recovered from its share price hit last year.</p><p>Analysts doubt whether the company can actually pull off its change of direction, though many still rate the stock a \"buy\".</p><p>Charles Sturt University course director Travis Holland said: \"Facebook isn't moving this direction just because it feels like doing so. There are both legal and user-base reasons. (Europe's) GDPR has in part forced their hand toward default encryption while there has been a huge uptake of messaging services like the Facebook-owned WhatsApp, Apple's iMessage, and Snapchat, all of which are about one-to-one or small-group conversations.</p><p>\"Facebook's history of data use and abuse would suggest good reasons to be cautious about what implications these changes could have for users, but in general it is encouraging to see them acknowledge the need to change what they've been doing.\" He said Mr Zuckerberg's note mentioned that the company \"won't store sensitive data in countries where it might be improperly accessed\", which could be taken as a reference to Australia's Assistance and Access Bill - passed last year - which forces companies to break encryption.</p><p>Social media expert and RMIT lecturer Lucio Ribeiro, told The Australian that Facebook's motives were selfish.</p><p>\"My opinion is that the high costs of compliance to government standards will actually firm even further Facebook as a monopoly, cutting out any entrant and competitor who doesn't have the capital to invest on costs of governance,\" he said.</p><p>\"Don't misguide Mark Zuckerberg and company as 'reformed' good citizens, they still have the old deceiving mindset. The legislation means big companies like Google and Facebook are more dominant than ever in their markets.\" RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney said it would take time for the company to earn back trust. \"We do not believe that messaging encryption and data portability really decentralises control of individuals' data from Facebook,\" Mr Mahaney said.</p><p>Tom Sulston, from Digital Rights Watch, said Mr Zuckerberg was correct in saying governments had failed to build sufficiently robust regulations to look after citizens' privacy.\"This is a good thing for him to be asking for, and he's welcome to join the chorus of people and institutions that have been asking for better regulation of internet companies,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-43cd425c672111e9997712cf9010b514b243e42f8c4841d08f9f674ea0b41737</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYT-D5J1-JD3N-50S4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1039\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 26, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There are also growing concerns over the volume of personal data sucked up and used by the tech players, often unknown to users.</p><p>\"If the rules for the internet were being written from scratch today, I don't think people would want private companies to be making so many decisions around speech, elections and data privacy without a more robust democratic process,\" Mr Zuckerberg said on an earnings conference call yesterday.</p><p>\"For harmful content, I think there should be a public process for determining what's allowed and required for keeping harmful content to a minimum that could be through government or industry, but having common standards is critical since people use so many different services to share content.\" Mr Zuckerberg said that in elections there had long been laws defining political advertising, but updates were needed to better reflect today's threats, such as interference in votes.</p><p>Facebook was widely blamed for Russia's meddling in the 2016 US election, ahead of Donald Trump becoming president.</p><p>\"Those threats are often not covered by today's laws and I think we'd be better off if -companies didn't define those policies themselves,\" Mr Zuckerberg said.</p><p>It was a tumultuous quarter for Facebook, which is facing a multi-billion-dollar fine from the US for sharing user data with Cambridge Analytica as well as an increase in scrutiny from regulators.</p><p>This includes the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission probing Facebook and Google this year and flagging the creation of a new regulator as well as an examination of the social networks' secretive algorithms.</p><p>The chief executive outlined plans to get ahead of the issue, elaborating on Facebook's new \"privacy-focused vision for the future of social networking\".</p><p>\"The basic idea here is that in our lives, we have public spaces like that town square and private spaces like our living rooms and in our digital lives we also need both public and private spaces. For the last 15 years, Facebook and Instagram have become the digital equivalent of the town square. We can do almost anything you want with lots of people at once,\" he said.</p><p>\"Our plan is to build this the way we've developed WhatsApp, focused on the most fundamental and private use case messaging, make it as secure as possible with end-to-end encryption and then build more ways for people to interact on top of that.\" In its quarterly results Facebook set aside $US3bn for an expected fine from the US Federal Trade Commission over privacy issues, cutting into the social-media giant's profits even as its underlying business remained strong.</p><p>Facebook posted $US15.08bn in revenue in the March quarter, up 26 per cent from $US11.97bn in the same period last year, but profits of only $US2.43bn in the first quarter, as the one-time reserve cut in.</p><p>US regulators have been probing whether Facebook violated terms of an earlier consent decree when data of tens of millions of its users was transferred to Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that did work for the campaign of the US President.</p><p>Despite the controversies, investors sent shares in Facebook up more than 10 per cent to $US200.50 in after-hours trading, meaning the company has largely recovered from its share price hit last year.</p><p>Analysts doubt whether the company can actually pull off its change of direction, though many still rate the stock a \"buy\".</p><p>Charles Sturt University course director Travis Holland said: \"Facebook isn't moving this direction just because it feels like doing so. There are both legal and user-base reasons. (Europe's) GDPR has in part forced their hand toward default encryption while there has been a huge uptake of messaging services like the Facebook-owned WhatsApp, Apple's iMessage, and Snapchat, all of which are about one-to-one or small-group conversations.</p><p>\"Facebook's history of data use and abuse would suggest good reasons to be cautious about what implications these changes could have for users, but in general it is encouraging to see them acknowledge the need to change what they've been doing.\" He said Mr Zuckerberg's note mentioned that the company \"won't store sensitive data in countries where it might be improperly accessed\", which could be taken as a reference to Australia's Assistance and Access Bill - passed last year - which forces companies to break encryption.</p><p>Social media expert and RMIT lecturer Lucio Ribeiro, told The Australian that Facebook's motives were selfish.</p><p>\"My opinion is that the high costs of compliance to government standards will actually firm even further Facebook as a monopoly, cutting out any entrant and competitor who doesn't have the capital to invest on costs of governance,\" he said.</p><p>\"Don't misguide Mark Zuckerberg and company as 'reformed' good citizens, they still have the old deceiving mindset. The legislation means big companies like Google and Facebook are more dominant than ever in their markets.\" RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney said it would take time for the company to earn back trust. \"We do not believe that messaging encryption and data portability really decentralises control of individuals' data from Facebook,\" Mr Mahaney said.</p><p>Tom Sulston, from Digital Rights Watch, said Mr Zuckerberg was correct in saying governments had failed to build sufficiently robust regulations to look after citizens' privacy.\"This is a good thing for him to be asking for, and he's welcome to join the chorus of people and institutions that have been asking for better regulation of internet companies,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-43cd425c672111e9997712cf9010b51402514ee74f972adf616647686dd80402</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYV-4V51-F0JP-W44M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1039\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 26, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In the days since the news first broke this weekend, he had not commented publicly on the crisis.</p><p>That contrasts with how other tech chief executives have addressed crises at their firms.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook.html\">Kevin Roose and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT report:</url></p><p>So why did it take so long for Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to respond? Kate Losse, an early Facebook employee and Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>\u2019s former speechwriter, told the NYT: \u201cMy guess is that what is giving <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked.\u201d</p><p>Peter Eavis\u2019s take: There was something missing from <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg</nameText></person>\u2019s response \u2013 a full explanation of why Facebook took so long to disclose the misuse of its data. As Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>noted, Facebook found out in 2015 that Aleksandr Kogan had violated company policies by sharing user data with Cambridge Analytica. Facebook users might ask why the abuse wasn\u2019t disclosed at the time. Often it has taken pressure from outsiders to get Facebook to reveal abuses of its network. An alternative approach would have been for Facebook to proactively disclose as much information as possible about the wrongdoing. Facebook users would most likely welcome a strong commitment from Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to do just that.</p><p>Takeaways from Powell\u2019s first Fed meeting.</p><p>The Federal Reserve, as widely expected, raised interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point. The bigger questions were about the strength of the economy and pace of future rate increases.</p><p>On those matters, the Federal Reserve has expressed more confidence in the strength of the economy.</p><p>Dot plot: Fed officials signaled they would raise rates at a quicker pace over the next three years. Policymakers now expect to hike rates three times this year, three times in 2019 and twice in 2020. At its December meeting, policymakers expected three rate hikes this year, but just two in 2019.</p><p>Economic projections: Officials raised their median estimates for economic growth this year to 2.7 percent, up from 2.5 percent in December. Fed policymakers also expect inflation to run above 2 percent by 2019 and 2020.</p><p>Mr. Powell\u2019s news conference: The new Fed chairman expressed optimism about the current economic picture and said officials were trying to strike a balance between raising rates too slowly or too quickly. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to take that middle ground.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year, depending on economic conditions. \u201cLike any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could change up. It could change down\u201d</p><p>On inflation, he added: \u201cThere is no sense in the data that we\u2019re on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation. We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation. And we seem to be seeing more of that.\u201d</p><p>Why driverless cars are essential to Uber\u2019s future.</p><p>The answer has to do with car ownership.

Sign up here.</p><p><person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has broken his silence on the Cambridge Analytica crisis.</p><p>Facebook's chief executive posted a statement on his Facebook page, saying he was taking action to prevent people's data on the social network from being misused.</p><p>  ''We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you,'' Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>wrote. ''I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again.''</p><p>  Here are the steps the company is taking to address the issue:</p><p>   ''We will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity.''</p><p>   ''We will restrict developers' data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse.''</p><p>   ''We want to make sure you understand which apps you've allowed to access your data. In the next month, we will show everyone a tool at the top of your News Feed with the apps you've used and an easy way to revoke those apps' permissions to your data.''</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>had drawn criticism for his response to how Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users. In the days since the news first broke this weekend, he had not commented publicly on the crisis.</p><p>  That contrasts with how other tech chief executives have addressed crises at their firms.</p><p>  Kevin Roose and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT report:</p><p>  When a former engineer revealed a pattern of sexual harassment at Uber last year, <person><nameText>Travis Kalanick, </nameText></person>then the company's chief executive, said he would immediately open an investigation.</p><p>  When users complained about bugs and problems with the Apple Maps app in 2012, Tim Cook, the company's chief executive, released a statement that said ''we fell short.''</p><p>  And in 2011, when Netflix tried to split off its mail-order DVD business into a company called Qwikster, its chief executive, <person><nameText>Reed Hastings, </nameText></person>wrote a letter to the public. ''I messed up,'' he said. ''I owe everyone an explanation.''</p><p>  So why did it take so long for Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to respond? Kate Losse, an early Facebook employee and Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>former speechwriter, told the NYT: ''My guess is that what is giving <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked.''</p><p>  Peter Eavis's take: There was something missing from <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>response -- a full explanation of why Facebook took so long to disclose the misuse of its data. As Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>noted, Facebook found out in 2015 that Aleksandr Kogan had violated company policies by sharing user data with Cambridge Analytica. Facebook users might ask why the abuse wasn't disclosed at the time. Often it has taken pressure from outsiders to get Facebook to reveal abuses of its network. An alternative approach would have been for Facebook to proactively disclose as much information as possible about the wrongdoing. Facebook users would most likely welcome a strong commitment from Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to do just that.</p><p>  Takeaways from Powell's first Fed meeting.</p><p>  The <person><nameText>Federal Reserve, </nameText></person>as widely expected, raised interest rates on Wednesday by a quarter of a percentage point. The bigger questions were about the strength of the economy and pace of future rate increases.</p><p>  On those matters, the <person><nameText>Federal Reserve </nameText></person>has expressed more confidence in the strength of the economy.</p><p>  Dot plot: Fed officials signaled they would raise rates at a quicker pace over the next three years. Policymakers now expect to hike rates three times this year, three times in 2019 and twice in 2020. At its December meeting, policymakers expected three rate hikes this year, but just two in 2019.</p><p>  Economic projections: Officials raised their median estimates for economic growth this year to 2.7 percent, up from 2.5 percent in December. Fed policymakers also expect inflation to run above 2 percent by 2019 and 2020.</p><p>  Mr. Powell's news conference: The new Fed chairman expressed optimism about the current economic picture and said officials were trying to strike a balance between raising rates too slowly or too quickly. ''We're trying to take that middle ground.''</p><p>  Mr. Powell left the door open to more or fewer than three increases this year, depending on economic conditions. ''Like any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time,'' he said. ''It could change up. It could change down''</p><p>  On inflation, he added: ''There is no sense in the data that we're on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation. We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation. And we seem to be seeing more of that.''</p><p>  Why driverless cars are essential to Uber's future.</p><p>  The answer has to do with car ownership. For years, Uber and its rivals have promoted the idea that people living in urban areas will turn to Uber to get to and from work and to run errands rather than buy a car.</p><p>  If Uber can become an alternative to car ownership, that would greatly increase its potential market.</p><p>  A study last year from the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute, and Columbia University suggested that people might make the switch.</p><p>  But for people give up their cars, the cost of using Uber would most likely have to fall far below current levels. The need for this drop in costs came up when Dara Khosrowshahi, the C.E.O. of Uber, recently sat down for an interview with David Solomon, president and C.O.O. of Goldman Sachs.</p><p>  Here's the write-up of the autonomous car portion of their conversation in a recent Goldman note to clients:</p><p>  ''Uber stressed the importance not only of autonomous technology for the future of the company, but also the value it can create from developing that technology within its existing network. In order for Uber to truly become a legitimate alternative to car ownership it must take its per mile cost below the cost of car ownership, or $0.80-$0.90/mile, from the $2.50/mile it costs on average today for an UberX, according to management. While initiatives like pooling (50% of rides in some cities) and driver density can help to lower costs, autonomous is the single most transformative piece of the equation. Uber expects to partner aggressively on this front, noting that 'winning' is making sure every single autonomous player is plugged into its network.''</p><p>  Calculating the fallout from the Uber self-driving car death.</p><p>  The pedestrian fatality in Arizona is perhaps Dara Khosrowshahi's first major test as Uber's C.E.O., leaving him with a difficult choice: keep spending on a technology that Uber considers essential to its future, or dial back to reduce risks ahead of an I.P.O.?</p><p>  Investigators are also looking into whether the victim's actions -- suddenly stepping onto a darkened street -- could limit Uber's liability.</p><p>Toyota has paused its self-driving tests; Ford and G.M. have yet to do so. Separately, Uber has hired Tammy Albarran from Covington and Burling as its deputy general counsel, replacing Angela Padilla.</p><p>  Elsewhere in tech: The Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky Labs has reportedly exposed a U.S. cyberespionage operation focused on ISIS. Expect a merger frenzy in lithium. Expedia's Orbitz disclosed a breach that affects about 880,000 payment cards. And Amazon has surpassed Alphabet as the second-biggest publicly traded company by market value.</p><p>Tesla's shareholders approve Musk's pay package.</p><p>  The electric car maker's investors backed the board's proposal to grant Elon Musk, its C.E.O., stock options valued at $2.6 billion, Bloomberg reports.</p><p>  The stock options won't vest unless a set of ambitious financial goals are met. ''Mr. Musk will earn one-12th of the options every time Tesla hits a pair of goals: one tied to its market value and the other linked to either revenue or earnings excluding certain charges. For Musk to get all the options, Tesla would have to become worth $650 billion -- more than Facebook Inc. -- and produce more revenue than Procter &amp; Gamble Co.,'' Bloomberg reports.</p><p>  Pete Peterson is dead at 91</p><p>  The billionaire -- whose career highlights include being C.E.O. of a major industrial company at 36, serving in the Nixon administration, running Lehman Brothers, cofounding the Blackstone Group and doggedly arguing for reducing the U.S. deficit -- died yesterday.</p><p>  Mr. Peterson was always self-deprecating, once describing himself to the NYT as a ''kind of a closet, second-rate intellectual.'' And this is from a 2007 Lunch with the FT:</p><p>  ''Let's be honest,'' he says, ''dumb luck can play a huge role in life. It is all too easy in the 1990s for people to say I must be a genius investor because I got returns of 30 percent or whatever. If you combine a lot of leverage with a booming stock market it isn't all that difficult to make a lot of money, so I don't think we should get carried away with ourselves, frankly.''</p><p>  What to expect from the forthcoming spending bill</p><p>  Courtesy of our colleague Tom Kaplan:</p><p>Bayer takes a big step toward closing its Monsanto deal</p><p>  European antitrust regulators conditionally approved Bayer's $56 billion acquisition of its American rival, Monsanto, today, an important step for the deal as the agrochemical sector continues to consolidate.</p><p>  The deal is still awaiting approval from American regulators, with the German chemicals giant saying on Wednesdaythat it was ''working closely'' with the Justice Department and other United States authorities. Bayer hopes to close the transaction by the end of the second quarter.</p><p>  To win approval of European regulators, the companies said they would sell a variety of businesses, including agreeing to sell parts of Bayer's crop science business to BASF for about $7 billion in October.</p><p>Bayer has committed to sell its entire vegetable seeds business as part of its concessions, European regulators said in a news release on Thursday. Bayer previously said it was in exclusive talks with BASF about the sale of that business.</p><p>  -- Chad Bray</p><p>  Does Facebook need a new regulator?</p><p>  Investors have sliced off $50 billion off the company's market capitalization. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether it has violated a privacy agreement. Britain's data protection watchdog has warned Facebook away from its Cambridge Analytica investigation. And a founder of WhatsApp urged his Twitter followers to delete their accounts.</p><p>  Given all that, Paul Ford asks in Bloomberg Businessweek whether the U.S. needs a digital protection agency, comparing its potential scope to that of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p><person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>silent so far, is expected to speak about Facebook's latest scandal within the next 24 hours, according to Axios.</p><p>  Critics' corner</p><p>   Sandy Parakilas, a former Facebook employee involved in its apps platform, writes: ''Facebook has systematically failed to enforce its own policies. The only solution is external oversight.'' (WaPo)</p><p>   Shira Ovide says the damage may be permanent. (Gadfly)</p><p>   Nick Thompson and Fred Vogelstein say Facebook may have taken the wrong lesson from past scandals: ''All of those crises have passed with limited damage. And perhaps that's why the company appears to have underestimated the power of the storm clouds moving in.'' (Wired)</p><p>   John Gapper writes, ''Facebook has never implemented safeguards that match the power of the data machine it created.'' (FT)</p><p>  Elsewhere in big tech:  Go inside ''Zucktown,'' the neighborhood Facebook is developing in Menlo Park, Calif.Google is investing $300 million to support journalism, even though it and Facebook inevitably hurt publishers to some degree. And Canada, South Korea and Australia are becoming worried about Huawei.</p><p>  The race to avoid U.S. tariffs</p><p>  At the Group of 20's meeting in Buenos Aires, finance ministers from France, Argentina, South Korea and elsewhere peppered Steven Mnuchin with requests for exemptions from President Trump's forthcoming tariffs on imported metal. The U.S. Treasury secretary said, ''This is all about free and fair and reciprocal trade.''</p><p>  The problem: The White House hasn't said exactly what would qualify a country for an exemption (it has made vague references to protecting national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits).</p><p>  Meanwhile, the White House is ready to announce more tariffs and limits on Chinese investments as soon as tomorrow -- risking a trade war that it can't win on its own, Michael Schuman argues on Bloomberg View.</p><p>  Elsewhere in trade: The White House's efforts to renegotiate Nafta now include a bid to limit warning labels on junk food, according to the NYT.</p><p>  The political flyaround</p><p>Congress continues to discuss its $1.3 trillion spending bill. The deadline is Friday. (Bloomberg)</p><p>   President Trump welcomed Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House, reaffirming his support of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler. (NYT)</p><p>Citigroup's C.E.O. Michael Corbat said he was unaware of a pending loan to Kushner Companies when he met with Jared Kushner. (Bloomberg)</p><p>   Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claims to have had an affair with Mr. Trump, sued to be released from a legal agreement restricting her ability to speak. (NYT)</p><p>   Mr. Trump defeated a watchdog group's lawsuit that challenged his administration's use of self-destructing message apps like Confide and Signal. (Bloomberg)</p><p>  Waiting an extra day for the AT&amp;T fireworks</p><p>  The latest (ugh, seriously) snowstorm barreling toward the Northeast has postponed the first day of oral arguments in the Justice Department's lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner.</p><p>  When the trial picks up again tomorrow, here's what to expect, courtesy of Cecilia Kang of the NYT: roughly 60 witnesses, 519 exhibits from the Justice Department alone and at least six weeks of testimony. Key witnesses will include Randall Stephenson of AT&amp;T and Jeff Bewkes of Time Warner.</p><p>  Elsewhere in media: A Fox News analyst resigned from the network, calling it Trump propaganda. Bill O'Reilly is seeking dismissal of the defamation suit. And two books about Mike Pence's pet bunny are duking it out on Amazon.</p><p><person><nameText>Travis Kalanick's </nameText></person>next act</p><p>  He's buying control of a distressed real-estate concern named Cloud Storage Systems for $150 million, and installing himself as C.E.O. In a statement, Mr. Kalanick said that part of the goal is to expand C.S.S.'s expansion into kitchens and retail space for on-demand services. (The deal took about a tenth of his liquid net worth, Bloomberg notes.)</p><p>  Mr. Kalanick's successor at Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, congratulated him on Twitter -- and suggested the two companies might work together.</p><p>  Elsewhere in tech deals</p><p>Salesforce agreed to buy Mulesoft, whose software helps connect platforms and which went public only last year, for $6.5 billion in its biggest-ever acquisition.

In the piece, Zuckerberg stated that he was advocating for more government regulation of online content.On one hand, he acknowledged that Big Tech's approach to the free speech/'hate speech' debate has been problematic, observing that 'we have too much power over speech.' On the other hand, Zuckerberg touted the fact that Facebook is working with the French officials to assess content review systems, which in their recent Article 13 ban on memes, is worrisome to free speech advocates.'I believe we need a more active role for governments and regulators,' he wrote 'By updating the rules for the internet, we can preserve what's best about it   the freedom for people to express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things   while also protecting society from broader harms.'His approach to freedom of speech was one that simultaneously appeared friendly but sinister to those who have been paying attention. 'Facebook gives everyone a way to use their voice, and that creates real benefits   from sharing experiences to growing movements. </p><p>As part of this, we have a responsibility to keep people safe on our services.' The idea of safety on the internet is a fraught topic, considering how some see the safety from offensive ideas and critique as vital as physical safety itself. He also directly addressed his website's role in 'deciding what counts as terrorist propaganda, hate speech and more,' while acknowledging 'we'll always make mistakes and decisions that people disagree with.'While he first said a talking point that would reassure conservative free speech advocates by saying 'Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree.' He followed this up by announcing the creation of an 'independent body so people can appeal our decisions.' This seems like a fresh change of pace at first glance up until he mentions 'We're also working with governments, including French officials, on ensuring the effectiveness of content review systems.'In November of this past year Newsbusters reported[2] that the French government issued the 'Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace' as part of a wide initiative to combat cyberattacks, foreign meddling, and 'hate speech.' That same month, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that French regulators will be given access to Facebook's content moderation in 2019 and oversee their campaign against 'hate speech.'The Verge observed that these European regulators will have the inside scoop on how Facebook officials remove content that 'may discriminate against or target minority groups or others based on gender, sexuality, or religion.'

In the piece, Zuckerberg stated that he was advocating for more government regulation of online content.On one hand, he acknowledged that Big Tech's approach to the free speech/'hate speech' debate has been problematic, observing that 'we have too much power over speech.' On the other hand, Zuckerberg touted the fact that Facebook is working with the French officials to assess content review systems, which in their recent Article 13 ban on memes, is worrisome to free speech advocates.'I believe we need a more active role for governments and regulators,' he wrote 'By updating the rules for the internet, we can preserve what's best about it \u2014 the freedom for people to express themselves and for entrepreneurs to build new things \u2014 while also protecting society from broader harms.'His approach to freedom of speech was one that simultaneously appeared friendly but sinister to those who have been paying attention. 'Facebook gives everyone a way to use their voice, and that creates real benefits \u2014 from sharing experiences to growing movements. </p><p>As part of this, we have a responsibility to keep people safe on our services.' The idea of safety on the internet is a fraught topic, considering how some see the safety from offensive ideas and critique as vital as physical safety itself. He also directly addressed his website's role in 'deciding what counts as terrorist propaganda, hate speech and more,' while acknowledging 'we'll always make mistakes and decisions that people disagree with.'While he first said a talking point that would reassure conservative free speech advocates by saying 'Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree.' He followed this up by announcing the creation of an 'independent body so people can appeal our decisions.' This seems like a fresh change of pace at first glance up until he mentions 'We're also working with governments, including French officials, on ensuring the effectiveness of content review systems.'In November of this past year Newsbusters reported[2] that the French government issued the 'Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace' as part of a wide initiative to combat cyberattacks, foreign meddling, and 'hate speech.' That same month, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that French regulators will be given access to Facebook's content moderation in 2019 and oversee their campaign against 'hate speech.'The Verge observed that these European regulators will have the inside scoop on how Facebook officials remove content that 'may discriminate against or target minority groups or others based on gender, sexuality, or religion.'

Zuckerberg is one of four Big Tech CEOs expected to appear before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law Wednesday. Others include the heads of Amazon , Apple and Google . The hearing is expected to look at how those companies\u2019 influence could stifle innovation and establish something close to a monopoly.   In the remarks, Zuckerberg praises the U.S. laws around antitrust that allow more competition. He says they\u2019re \u201cvital because it ensures that the playing field is level for all.\u201d   \u201cAt Facebook, we compete hard because we\u2019re up against other smart and innovative companies that are determined to win,\u201d he says, according to the transcript. \u201cWe know that our future success is not guaranteed, especially in a global tech industry defined by rapid innovation. The history of technology is often the history of failure, and even industry leading tech companies fail if they don\u2019t stay competitive.\u201d   Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks push the innovations that have come with other affiliated applications like Instagram , WhatsApp and Oculus , built through the \u201cintense competitive pressures we face [that] push us to experiment with new ideas,\u201d according to Politico.   \u201cWe know that if we don\u2019t constantly keep improving, we will fall behind,\u201d he says.   He also pushes the social good Facebook\u2019s products have done, including the Safety Check tool to let people know their loved ones are safe, and the nonprofit No Kid Hungry , used to help raise millions of dollars to feed hungry children across the U.S.   Zuckerberg says he understands the concerns people have about privacy and the size of companies like his own, according to the transcript. But he says he\u2019s called for regulators to take a more active role in updating the internet\u2019s rules to preserve what\u2019s good about the internet and adds that Facebook has taken precautions in protecting people from harmful content and false information.   According to the transcript, Zuckerberg concludes by saying Facebook is ready to exist in a landscape of competitors, explaining: \u201cMany large companies that fail to compete cease to exist.\u201d   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    New PYMNTS Study: Subscription Commerce Conversion Index \u2013 July 2020     Staying home 24/7 has consumers turning to subscription services for both entertainment and their day-to-day needs.

It\u2019s unknown what Zuckerberg spoke about over the course of his two-day virtual testimony, but the testimony does show that the FTC is still going forward with the investigation it opened in June of last year, according to the CNBC report.   Facebook spokesman Joe Osborne said the company is \u201ccommitted to cooperating with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission\u2019s inquiry and answering the questions the agency may have,\u201d CNBC reported.   Competition and antitrust issues have roiled Big Tech as of late, with numerous entities questioning how such firms\u2019 prominence and power affects competitors or other companies trying to gain a foothold in the sphere. Critics have called Facebook out before on privacy issues, usually dealing with how users\u2019 data is disseminated for advertising or other means.   Zuckerberg, for his part, has contended that competition is important to Facebook as it helps the social media company continue to innovate.   He said the number of firms coming up with new ideas is what prompted Facebook to experiment with purchases like Instagram , WhatsApp and Oculus , and so the U.S.\u2019s focus on antitrust laws is a good thing in his opinion. He said the history of technology is often one of failure, so it is important for his company to keep innovating.   Zuckerberg also appeared in a much-publicized Congressional hearing in July alongside the CEOs of Amazon , Apple and Google parent Alphabet , in which they spoke virtually about the influence their companies have had over the market.   PYMNTS weighed in on this, arguing that none of the companies truly has a monopoly because they\u2019re all working to gain users in various fields, including social media, delivery, advertising, entertainment, news and more.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    NEW PYMNTS REPORT: THE FI\u2019S GUIDE TO MODERNIZING DIGITAL PAYMENTS       Instant payouts have become the name of the game for vendors and suppliers facing crumbling revenue streams, but banks can find themselves struggling to facilitate faster B2B payments.

According to Zuckerberg, the digital currency would serve consumers with limited access to means to transfer money, but the legislators expressed concerns about privacy and security, power concentration in the Libra Association governing the system, and the potential for systemic issues arising resulting from widespread adoption. Several of the committee members also pressed the Facebook official on the company's approaches to discriminatory advertising and issues surrounding employee diversity. </p><p>Libra. In June 2019, the Libra Association (a consortium of organizations, including Facebook's Calibra subsidiary) announced[2] plans to develop Libra, a currency that would be built on a blockchain and backed by a reserve of real assets called the Libra Reserve. Calibra would develop a digital wallet for Libra that would be available both as a standalone app and through Facebook's Messenger and WhatsApp products. Libra is designed to target more mainstream users than traditional cryptocurrencies, particularly those who do not engage with the traditional financial system but have access to a mobile phone FSC Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Cal) opened the discussion[3] by urging Facebook to address its other privacy and advertising concerns before jumping into the cryptocurrency arena. According[4] to Zuckerberg, however, the primary purpose of Libra is not strictly to act as a cryptocurrency but to promote financial inclusion for the unbanked and underbanked with a safe, efficient means of sending and receiving payments around the world. Money should be able to move as quickly as a message, he said. In his view, the financial structure in United States is outdated, and a more modern approach could serve the financial system as a whole. In response to Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), Zuckerberg stressed that Facebook does not ultimately control the Libra Association and would not be involved the Libra project if approval from U.S. regulators cannot be obtained. '[W]e support Libra delaying its launch until it has fully addressed U.S. regulatory concerns,' Zuckerberg stated. Regarding risks, several committee members asked why individuals and businesses should trust Facebook given its history of failing to protect private information. Zuckerberg reiterated that compliance with U.S. regulations will be a prerequisite of Facebook's involvement in the Libra project, and 'know your customer' and anti-money laundering regulations, as well as other federal regulations, will apply. In addition, there is and will remain a clear separation between Facebook's social data and Calibra's financial data, he explained. Zuckerberg stressed that the goal is to create global payment system not a currency, and the United States needs to innovate to ensure that the dollar continues to lead. Representative Andy Barr (R-Ky) agreed that it is always better to be on the side of innovation, and Zuckerberg noted that there are also risks to not trying new things. Legislation and regulation could put the United States at odds with counterparts around the world, including China, which is moving forward with a system similar to Libra. Assets would be used to underpin Libra, and protections would be in place for unauthorized transactions, Zuckerberg explained. However, Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Cal) stated, 'when something threatens the dollar, we get nervous.' When asked why companies including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, and eBay have dropped out of the Libra Association, Zuckerberg noted that the Libra project is an innovative project that comes with a certain amount of risk. Over 20 companies remain in the association, and other entities have expressed interest in getting involved, he stated. Calibra is only one member of the group, and Facebook does not expect to continue leading Libra efforts; the Libra Association now has a governance structure in place and will be driving the project going forward, according to Zuckerberg. Chuy Garcia (D-Ill) questioned Zuckerberg on the potential for Facebook to overpower traditional financial institutions, noting his introduction of the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act[5], which is designed to prohibit large platforms from becoming financial institutions or being affiliated with financial institutions, as well as to prohibit them from establishing or operating a digital asset intended to be broadly used as medium of exchange. Garcia asked whether Libra should be regulated as a bank, and Zuckerberg stated that, although Libra is a different type of payment system, the SEC should ultimately decide. Garcia replied that blurring the lines between banking and commerce tends to cause problems. Other concerns. Several committee members also questioned Zuckerberg regarding potential discrimination in connection with Facebook advertisements and diversity issues in employment. He acknowledged that as part of a settlement, those who seek to advertise housing, employment, or credit opportunities are now required to go through a special advertisement purchasing process that prohibits targeting by age, gender, or zip code. Separately, he noted that Facebook has made diversity a priority in hiring and plans; within the next five years, Facebook plans to have women, people of color, and other underrepresented groups make up at least 50 percent of its workforce, Zuckerberg said. Diversity leads to 'better decisions, better products, and better culture,' he concluded.

Now Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he wants the company to focus on making things private.While tech commentators have debated his motivations, Zuckerberg vowed a new commitment to private information in a March 6 memo[1]. He proclaimed, 'People expect their private communications to be secure and to only be seen by the people they've sent them to -- not hackers, criminals, over-reaching governments, or even the people operating the services they're using.'He spoke to the fears of many of his users in this digital age where anything one types can come back to destroy careers. '[Users] should not have to worry about what they share coming back to hurt them later. </p><p>So we won't keep messages or stories around for longer than necessary to deliver the service or longer than people want them,' he added.Privacy In the Global Digital AgeZuckerberg gave a nuanced take on how managing privacy is an ongoing ethical and legal battle.He specifically addressed the 'growing awareness that the more entities that have access to your data, the more vulnerabilities there are for someone to misuse it or for a cyber attack to expose it.' But he also noted the general concerns over the scope and power of big tech in modern life.'There is also a growing concern among some that technology may be centralizing power in the hands of governments and companies like ours. And some people worry that our services could access their messages and use them for advertising or in other ways they don't expect, he added.'However, he also mentioned how Facebook has fought in the past to keep tyrannical foreign governments from accessing private data. He recounted how 'In the last year, I've spoken with dissidents who've told me encryption is the reason they are free, or even alive.'He elaborated on this story: 'Governments often make unlawful demands for data, and while we push back and fight these requests in court, there's always a risk we'll lose a case -- and if the information isn't encrypted we'd either have to turn over the data or risk our employees being arrested if we failed to comply. This may seem extreme, but we've had a case where one of our employees was actually jailed for not providing access to someone's private information even though we couldn't access it since it was encrypted.' Zuckerberg also has a history of cooperating with foreign governments in the western world to crack down on 'hate speech.' 'Hate speech' is all too often a coded phrase many conservatives know to mean 'politically incorrect' facts and opinions. NewsBusters covered the scandal when Facebook allowed French regulators to observe content censorship[2] and help push for hate speech regulation[3].But the battle is not only the privacy over users versus governments, but also over how privacy and freedom inevitably allow some criminal activity to slip through the cracks. Zuckerberg soberly commented on how, 'When billions of people use a service to connect, some of them are going to misuse it for truly terrible things like child exploitation, terrorism, and extortion. We have a responsibility to work with law enforcement and to help prevent these wherever we can.'Reducing Permanence: A Clean Slate to Protect Your Future?Zuckerberg spoke to a modern fear of many in the digital age when he mentioned how users fear old posts and messages they wrote online may come back to ruin their careers and reputations. He pushed the increasingly popular concept of expiring messages.He said that Facebook understands this fear. 'We increasingly believe it's important to keep information around for shorter periods of time. People want to know that what they share won't come back to hurt them later, and reducing the length of time their information is stored and accessible will help,' Zuckerberg explained.The way he suggested this would work was phrased in hypotheticals, 'For example, messages could be deleted after a month or a year by default. This would reduce the risk of your messages resurfacing and embarrassing you later.'He also proposed that users would have direct control over this process: 'Of course you'd have the ability to change the timeframe or turn off auto-deletion for your threads if you wanted. And we could also provide an option for you to set individual messages to expire after a few seconds or minutes if you wanted.'

Now Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he wants the company to focus on making things private.While tech commentators have debated his motivations, Zuckerberg vowed a new commitment to private information in a March 6 memo[1]. He proclaimed, 'People expect their private communications to be secure and to only be seen by the people they've sent them to -- not hackers, criminals, over-reaching governments, or even the people operating the services they're using.'He spoke to the fears of many of his users in this digital age where anything one types can come back to destroy careers. '[Users] should not have to worry about what they share coming back to hurt them later. </p><p>So we won't keep messages or stories around for longer than necessary to deliver the service or longer than people want them,' he added.Privacy In the Global Digital AgeZuckerberg gave a nuanced take on how managing privacy is an ongoing ethical and legal battle.He specifically addressed the 'growing awareness that the more entities that have access to your data, the more vulnerabilities there are for someone to misuse it or for a cyber attack to expose it.' But he also noted the general concerns over the scope and power of big tech in modern life.'There is also a growing concern among some that technology may be centralizing power in the hands of governments and companies like ours. And some people worry that our services could access their messages and use them for advertising or in other ways they don't expect, he added.'However, he also mentioned how Facebook has fought in the past to keep tyrannical foreign governments from accessing private data. He recounted how 'In the last year, I've spoken with dissidents who've told me encryption is the reason they are free, or even alive.'He elaborated on this story: 'Governments often make unlawful demands for data, and while we push back and fight these requests in court, there's always a risk we'll lose a case -- and if the information isn't encrypted we'd either have to turn over the data or risk our employees being arrested if we failed to comply. This may seem extreme, but we've had a case where one of our employees was actually jailed for not providing access to someone's private information even though we couldn't access it since it was encrypted.' Zuckerberg also has a history of cooperating with foreign governments in the western world to crack down on 'hate speech.' 'Hate speech' is all too often a coded phrase many conservatives know to mean 'politically incorrect' facts and opinions. NewsBusters covered the scandal when Facebook allowed French regulators to observe content censorship[2] and help push for hate speech regulation[3].But the battle is not only the privacy over users versus governments, but also over how privacy and freedom inevitably allow some criminal activity to slip through the cracks. Zuckerberg soberly commented on how, 'When billions of people use a service to connect, some of them are going to misuse it for truly terrible things like child exploitation, terrorism, and extortion. We have a responsibility to work with law enforcement and to help prevent these wherever we can.'Reducing Permanence: A Clean Slate to Protect Your Future?Zuckerberg spoke to a modern fear of many in the digital age when he mentioned how users fear old posts and messages they wrote online may come back to ruin their careers and reputations. He pushed the increasingly popular concept of expiring messages.He said that Facebook understands this fear. 'We increasingly believe it's important to keep information around for shorter periods of time. People want to know that what they share won't come back to hurt them later, and reducing the length of time their information is stored and accessible will help,' Zuckerberg explained.The way he suggested this would work was phrased in hypotheticals, 'For example, messages could be deleted after a month or a year by default. This would reduce the risk of your messages resurfacing and embarrassing you later.'He also proposed that users would have direct control over this process: 'Of course you'd have the ability to change the timeframe or turn off auto-deletion for your threads if you wanted. And we could also provide an option for you to set individual messages to expire after a few seconds or minutes if you wanted.'

Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the committee's top Republican, said he didn't want Congress's scrutiny of Facebook to restrict innovation.</p><p>\"I have my own qualms about Facebook and Libra and the shortcomings of Big Tech, there are many,\" McHenry said in his prepared opening remarks. \"But if history has taught us anything, it's better to be on the side of American innovation, competition, and most importantly the freedom to build a better future for all of us.\"</p><p>Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., warned that stifling innovation or projects like Libra could have negative implications for national security.</p><p>\"I was very interested in your testimony, Mr. Zuckerberg, when you alluded to the risks of not innovating and the danger of the U.S. falling behind some other countries or foreign companies who are creating similar platforms,\" Barr said. \"I think that the American competitiveness angle and the competition with China is a national security issue and the fact that Facebook and the Libra Association is launching into innovation ... is positive for our national security.\"</p><p>In an interview with American Banker, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., said that Zuckerberg gave the committee \"high-level\" answers about how Libra would be regulated but that he did not provide enough details.</p><p>\"To me, there were still a lot of holes to be filled in here ... and even from today's hearing, there's plenty of questions that I think we need to get to the bottom of,\" Gottheimer said. \"He's addressing certain issues and he's doing so in certain high-level answers and I think the details are still important to understand.\"</p><p>Following the hearing, other Democrats expressed frustration with what they viewed as Zuckerberg's lack of preparedness to create a digital currency like Libra.</p><p>Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, told reporters she was surprised that the Libra Association did not have a board chair.</p><p>\"I learned that they have no chair of the board at the association, which completely stunned me,\" Garcia said. \"You don't form an association and not have someone to be the chair of the board.\"</p><p>Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., said Zuckerberg didn't give the committee the details they needed.</p><p>\"He distanced himself from all details - it's in formation, it's in discussion, it's in negotiation,\" Dean told reporters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000016d-f997-d1b2-a16d-f9bf2cab0000-205</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBJ-V591-JCRW-50N9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"990\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia, Inc.

Under heavy pressure, the co-founder and CEO of Facebook plans to testify next month before a committee of the House of Representatives about the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the firm that obtained data from millions of users of the most popular social network on the planet to benefit his political clients, including Donald Trump. </p><p> The scandal sparked the worst crisis in the company's 14-year history, sparked the debate over whether social networks should be subject to more regulation and led lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic to demand that <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>himself provide explanations and answer your concerns. The British Parliament asked him to travel to London, and three committees of the United States Congress \"invited\" him to testify. </p><p> Although <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>already declined the invitation of the British Parliament, his presence in the US Congress could happen in just a few weeks. </p><p> Several media in the United States said <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has decided to accept at least one of the invitations - from the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House - and attend the Capitol early next month. A committee spokeswoman, Elena Hernandez, said that \"the committee is working with Facebook to determine what day and at what time Mr. <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>will testify.\" </p><p> If it takes place, the appearance before the Congress will be an event, at least exceptional: although it happened in the past, it is very rare for a CEO of a company to answer questions from the legislators face to face. It happened, for example, in 1994, when the CEOs of the seven most important tobacco companies in the country testified that they believed that nicotine was not addictive, or after the global financial crisis, when the main leaders of Wall Street went to explain how They spent the ransom money orchestrated by Washington. </p><p> Now the scene could well be repeated with some of the technological giants, known as the big tech. The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Republican Chuck Grassley, invited <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and Google CEOs, Sundar Pichay, and Twitter, <person><nameText>Jack Dorsey, </nameText></person>to attend an agenda hearing for April 10 on privacy and social networks. </p><p>Facebook faces, in addition to the scrutiny of Congress, an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), one of the regulatory bodies of the federal government.

In leaked audio recordings of open meetings with employees this summer, Mr. Zuckerberg can be heard saying that the company would sue if Ms. Warren were to enact the plan as president.</p><p>\u201cIf she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDoes that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. That\u2019s not like the position you want to be in. We care about our country and want to work with our government to do good things,\u201d he added. \u201cBut look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d</p><p>Shortly after The Verge published Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks, Ms. Warren responded by renewing her criticism of Facebook.</p><p>\u201cWhat would really \u2018suck,\u2019\u201d she said, mimicking Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s language, \u201cis if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d </p><p>The surfacing of grievances between Ms. Warren and Mr. Zuckerberg has the effect of publicly pitting one of the leading Democratic candidates for president against the head of the world\u2019s largest social network, at a time when Silicon Valley in general and Facebook in particular <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html\">continue to be scrutinized for their efforts to combat disinformation</url> and prevent election interference in 2020 and beyond.</p><p>In the audio recording clipped and published by The Verge, Mr. Zuckerberg ties his criticism of Ms. Warren\u2019s plan to concerns about election interference. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that breaking up these companies, whether it\u2019s Facebook or Google or Amazon, is not actually going to solve the issues,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, you know, it doesn\u2019t make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can\u2019t coordinate and work together.\u201d</p><p>After the leaked audio was published and Ms. Warren responded, Mr. Zuckerberg <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html\">commented on the episode in a Facebook post</url>.</p><p>\u201cEvery week I do a Q&amp;amp;A at Facebook where employees get to ask me anything and I share openly what I\u2019m thinking on all kinds of projects and issues,\u201d he said. \u201cThe transcript from one of my Q&amp;amp;As a few months ago just got published online \u2014 and even though it was meant to be internal rather than public, now that it\u2019s out there, you can check it out if you\u2019re interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I\u2019m thinking and telling employees on a bunch of topics.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Warren, meanwhile, used the renewed focus on the issue as an opportunity to reiterate that she is \u201cnot afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable.\u201d</p><p>In her proposal, Ms. Warren argues that the tech giants have essentially developed monopolies \u2014 they have \u201cbulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\u201d</p><p>Her plan calls for legislation that would prohibit platforms like Amazon from both offering a marketplace for commerce and participating in that marketplace; appointing regulators to undo some tech mergers; and rolling back some acquisitions by tech giants, such as Facebook\u2019s deals for WhatsApp and Instagram. </p><p>Later Tuesday, she pressed the issue, firing off <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html\">a five-tweet thread</url> that began: \u201cLet\u2019s talk a bit about my plan to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html\">#BreakUpBigTech</url> and why it\u2019s got Mark Zuckerberg so worked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFacebook is doing pretty well right now,\u201d Ms. Warren said, citing its acquisitions as evidence that tech companies had amassed significant power and face little competition. </p><p>\u201cImagine Facebook and Instagram trying to outdo each other to protect your privacy and keep misinformation out of your feed, instead of working together to sell your data, inundate you with misinformation, and undermine our election security,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we need to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html\">#BreakUpBigTech</url>.\u201d</p><p>By offering a steady diet of detailed policy proposals, Ms. Warren has grown her following significantly and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html\">risen to the top of the polls</url>. Her plans to reshape the government extend to areas like the economy and education, where she has called for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html\">a wealth tax</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html\">canceling student loan debt</url>. </p><p>\u201cWe have these giant corporations \u2014 do I have to tell that to people in Long Island City? \u2014 that think they can roll over everyone,\u201d Ms. Warren told a crowd there earlier this year, after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/elizabeth-warren.html\">Amazon pulled out of plans to build a new campus</url> in the neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019m sick of freeloading billionaires.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, in a leaked recording (PHOTOGRAPH BY SAMUEL CORUM/GETTY IMAGES)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-100000006745748</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5V-J3X1-JBG3-64J5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><timeReceived>11:13 EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times <br/></publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 1, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It makes it more likely because now the companies can't coordinate and work together.\"</p><p>After the leaked audio was published and Ms. Warren responded, Mr. Zuckerberg commented on the episode in a Facebook post.</p><p>\"Every week I do a Q&amp;amp;A at Facebook where employees get to ask me anything and I share openly what I'm thinking on all kinds of projects and issues,\" he said. \"The transcript from one of my Q&amp;amp;As a few months ago just got published online - and even though it was meant to be internal rather than public, now that it's out there, you can check it out if you're interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I'm thinking and telling employees on a bunch of topics.\"</p><p>Ms. Warren, meanwhile, used the renewed focus on the issue as an opportunity to reiterate that she is \"not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable.\"</p><p>In her proposal, Ms. Warren argues that the tech giants have essentially developed monopolies - they have \"bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\"</p><p>Her plan calls for legislation that would prohibit platforms like Amazon from both offering a marketplace for commerce and participating in that marketplace; appointing regulators to undo some tech mergers; and rolling back some acquisitions by tech giants, such as Facebook's deals for WhatsApp and Instagram. </p><p>Later Tuesday, she pressed the issue, firing off a five-tweet thread that began: \"Let's talk a bit about my plan to #BreakUpBigTech and why it's got Mark Zuckerberg so worked up.\"</p><p>\"Facebook is doing pretty well right now,\" Ms. Warren said, citing its acquisitions as evidence that tech companies had amassed significant power and face little competition. </p><p>\"Imagine Facebook and Instagram trying to outdo each other to protect your privacy and keep misinformation out of your feed, instead of working together to sell your data, inundate you with misinformation, and undermine our election security,\" she said. \"That's why we need to #BreakUpBigTech.\"</p><p>By offering a steady diet of detailed policy proposals, Ms. Warren has grown her following significantly and risen to the top of the polls. Her plans to reshape the government extend to areas like the economy and education, where she has called for a wealth tax and canceling student loan debt. </p><p>\"We have these giant corporations - do I have to tell that to people in Long Island City? - that think they can roll over everyone,\" Ms. Warren told a crowd there earlier this year, after Amazon pulled out of plans to build a new campus in the neighborhood. \"I'm sick of freeloading billionaires.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006745748</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5Y-0R21-DYR7-C0M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"906\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 3, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The leader of Facebook is clear: if necessary, he will fight.<br/>\"If she (Warren) is elected president, then I would bet we'll have a legal challenge and bet we'll win that legal challenge. And that still sucks for us? Yes. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something so existential, you go to the mat and fight,\" Zuckerberg said, according to audio released by The Verge.<br/>Warren has an initiative to 'break' the big tech companies, like Amazon, Facebook or Alphabet, and separate their activities in order to avoid monopoly practices. Faced with content disseminated by The Verge, U.S. policy issued a replica emphasizing its quest to maintain users' \"privacy\" and generate antitrust policies.<br/>Tweet<br/>Other policy figures who have supported this initiative include Democrat Bernie Sanders or Senator Kamala Harris. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has an open antitrust investigation into Facebook and a group of state attorneys general, led by New York, are also investigating the company.<br/>Other audio highlights highlighted by The Verge are the executive's position on the request to attend hearings with European privacy regulators.<br/>\"I'm not going to go to every audience in the world. A lot of different people want to do that. When the problems arose last year around Cambridge Analytica I held hearings in the United States. I did hearings in the EU, it just doesn't make sense for me to attend hearings in all the countries that want me to introduce myself,\" Zuckerberg said to his employees. Who also extolled his opinion on these kinds of meetings and where he calls them \"dramatic.\"<br/>\"Public things, I think, tend to be a little more dramatic. But a more important part is private engagement with regulators around the world, and I think they are often more substantive and less dramatic. And those meetings are not for on-camera, that's where a lot of the discussions and details become clearer,\" the executive declares to his employees on recordings released by the American media.<br/>In the face of the statements, Expansi\u00f3n sought out Facebook, which clarified that while these audios are the product of the executive's talks with its employees,<br/>security efforts<br/>and to the global regulation, the company has made efforts to design more robust security measures where the information of its users is the most important.<br/>In addition Zuckerberg himself<br/>broadcast a message on Facebook<br/>in order to clarify that this filtered conversation speaks of many unfiltered topics, as these are talks that the executive has with his employees and where he does not seek to generate controversy.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-8812825</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X63-5H41-JBJN-M0D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"576\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 1, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Introducing to center stage, Facebook, which has been thrust into the limelight by Cambridge Analytica hiding in one wing, and an unnamed swarm of Russian influence-bots in the other. The actors may seem new, and the arena different, but if history can tell us anything it is that this is a play that we have already seen several times over. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Western economies have grown over the centuries through repeated cycles of unbound and often catastrophic growth, followed by periods of anguish, grievance and eventually regulation. Similar theatrical genres that have captured our hearts, minds and economies have included Wild West renditions of industrialists gaining economic strongholds through railroads, oil and steel corporations - not too dissimilar to the current genre of China's investment on the African continent - and the more recent motion picture of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Bank </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Heist</emphasis>: the inside job that stole the global economy, depicting the financial institutions' rampant and unfettered speculation on, well, anything, which forced us to turn to the government for a fix. \"Too big to fail\" is what we heard back then. The theme tune of today's social media crisis can be sung to the lyrics \"too big to regulate\". </p><p>Facebook, however, has not found itself in this arena alone. It is a founding member of the Frightful Five - Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon. Frightful not just because of their financial dominance but also because of their undue influence over (dis)information and global politics. Their complicated relationships to Ireland notwithstanding, these American-founded corporations pose an implicit threat to the jurisdictions of world governments. They sit in a lonely group of five through the creation of a massive and defensible moat called the network effect which surrounded their technology platform in the early 2000s. This has since allowed them to fully control an entirely new market around communication, media and civil society.</p><h>Money trail Arguments have been made that it is the enlightened investors who should have predicted that so few companies would hold such power. Others have gone further to say that this crisis is the horse that the investors didn't only back, but bred, jockeyed and fed more than just hay. In a capitalist America, technology venture investors are heroes responsible for blowing oxygen into the flame of the American Dream. Across the Atlantic in a social-led Ireland, many are fast to demonise the money trail that leads to problems like Facebook's social and information inequality. </h><p>It isn't just Facebook and the other four whose power is growing exponentially; it is the perilously high levels of power of the executives themselves. Mark Zuckerberg has created Facebook in a way such that as his company grows, so too does his reach within the company through a dual-class shareholder system. In a regular \"one share, one vote\" system, Facebook's large growth and entrance to the public markets would have seen him owning an increasingly small slice of the Facebook pie and having heightened governance by outside influences. The opposite is true here, as Zuckerberg clings on to controlling nearly 60 per cent of the stock. This is important; ownership of a company does not just pertain to a legal right to the profits achieved by that company, but also conveys the right to participate in how that company is governed.</p><p>Free from the shackles of regulation, Zuckerberg has assembled a community that is larger than any religion or country, controlling the most valuable global data. But who controls him? In a free-market economy run by our western ideology, we believe we will enjoy the upside of increased profits and high growth while being able to self-regulate and steer ourselves away from the downside. The unregulated dual-shares system that Facebook has employed is increasingly raising alarms, even to the early investors, who see the clear risks of power corruption.</p><p>The crucial issue is not Cambridge Analytica or Russian bots but is instead Facebook and Big Tech accountability; first, who can protect the users and consumers of the Facebook product, and second, who can protect the shareholders? Neither Zuckerberg nor his number two in command, Sheryl Sandberg, has addressed one of the largest technology crises to erupt of recent times.</p><h>Beast to be tamed Whil</h><p>e enjoying the friendliness, utility and all-encompassing convenience of social media, we have created a situation whereby the most powerful person in the world cannot be removed from office. We have, like by like and share by share, created a global information autocrat. Facebook is too big to regulate and its leader is nowhere to be found. We have, perhaps unwittingly and through lack of considerate regulation, created a beast that cannot be tamed. </p><p>So who will regulate? Prior to the \"tech bubble\", a European company of this size and holding an operating strength in so many industries would have been long broken up in the interest of market and shareholder protection. The mislabelling of Facebook as a social media instead of a purely media platform provides robust protection, which won't change anytime soon in the United States. There is intellectual dispersion surrounding the regulatory methodology of the five, with the academic left seeking anti-trust reform and the political right being elusive as the tech industry uses its consequential fortunes to lobby. It is sure that the new information war will break out, as many other wars have done before, on the European continent.</p><p>As the US looks to Europe, which houses deep technical and regulatory expertise in this industry, one ponders about the director who is brave enough to write the script for the final act. If nothing else, we can be sure that the curtain won't close on this show without industry heads rolling and the onset of a long period of shameful reflection, as prescribed to us in every historical play that has come before. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>Sin\u00e9ad O'Sullivan is a Sainsbury management fellow at Harvard Business School.

Elizabeth Warren, was due to take the stage with a grab bag of other presidential hopefuls.</p><p>In conversation with honorary Harvard professor and former White House regulatory official Cass Sunstein, Zuckerberg outlined Facebook's support for some regulatory proposals while making clear the company's deep disdain at the idea\u2014espoused by Warren in particular\u2014that big tech be broken up. The conversation took place at a festival held by the Aspen Institute, a centrist think tank.</p><p>Zuckerberg called Sen. Mark Warner and Sen. Amy Klobuchar's Honest Ads Act, which would regulate online campaign ads in a bid to weed out disinformation from foreign actors, \u201ca good floor for what should be passed,\u201d adding that Facebook is already complying with many of its requirements. \u201cHaving a bill like that passed as a floor would be positive,\u201d Zuckerberg said.</p><p>Going on the offensive against Congress and federal agencies, Zuckerberg blamed a regulatory vacuum for many of the platform's woes and pointed the finger at the government for failing to prevent foreign adversaries from meddling in U.S. political life. Specifically, he decried the absence of U.S. retaliation against Russia after the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>\u201cAs a private company, we don't have the tools to make the Russian government stop,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cWe can defend as best we can but our government is the one that has the tools to make [them] stop\u2014not us. That's something that is a little bit above our pay grade.\u201d</p><p>Signaling that Facebook was happy to lose some battles if it wins the war, he called for privacy guidelines \u201ctelling companies what to do\u201d and said his company supports regulation that would stipulate data portability requirements.</p><p>The mood shifted when Zuckerberg was asked about disassembling Facebook and unwinding the many acquisitions that have helped the platform stay two steps ahead of competitors while growing into the behemoth it is today.</p><p>\u201cI can get why politically saying that you want to break up the companies feels nice,\u201d Zuckerberg said.</p><p>In one of his less believable arguments, Zuckerberg asserted that breaking up Facebook would actually make the platform's systemic problems like harassment and election security worse. Pointing to Twitter and Reddit, two much smaller companies, he argued that those problems don't just go away, and due to a lack of pooled resources among Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp \u201cyou'd still have those issues\u2014you'd just be less equipped to deal with them.\u201d</p><p>He had little answer for arguments that Facebook engages in anti-competitive behavior beyond declaring that companies like Instagram have a \u201cmuch richer platform\u201d and reach \u201cmany more people\u201d than they did prior to being acquired. The logic was in line with the company's long history of equating big with \u201cgood\u201d and pursuing growth for its own sake\u2014at any cost.</p><p>\u201cIf it were always the case that mergers were bad for innovation we would not allow any mergers in our society,\u201d Zuckerberg said, dismissing the argument that Instagram would have inspired more innovation on its own as \u201ccounterfactual.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-2247993002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFD-9FC1-JBHT-D37B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 27, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>ASPEN INSTITUTE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

(AP Photo/Francisco Seco)LONDON (AP) \u2014 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg met top European Union officials on a visit to Brussels on Monday, days before the bloc is expected to release new proposals on regulating artificial intelligence. The billionaire social network founder is the latest U.S. tech executive to make the trip to the headquarters of the EU, which is becoming an increasingly important player in technology regulation. </p><p>Zuckerberg's visit came as the company warned that potential regulation risked stifling innovation.  Zuckerberg met Margrethe Vestager, the EU's powerful executive vice president in charge of making Europe 'fit for the digital age.' He also had audiences with Thierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market, and Vera Jourova, vice president for values and transparency. Vestager is set on Wednesday to release the first draft of the EU's proposed regulations on artificial intelligence, including facial recognition, and a digital strategy, which could have major implications for tech giants such as Facebook, Google and Apple. The EU has already pioneered strict data privacy rules and issued multibillion-dollar antitrust fines against the likes of Google. In an op-ed published in the Financial Times, Zuckerberg said big tech companies such as Facebook need closer government supervision.  'I believe good regulation may hurt Facebook's business in the near term but it will be better for everyone, including us, over the long term,' he wrote. He said new rules should be clear and balanced and it shouldn't be left up to individual companies to set their own standards.  Also Monday, Facebook released a 'white paper' on content regulation outlining challenges and principles for authorities to consider when drawing up new rules on how to deal with harmful material such as child sexual exploitation or terrorist recruitment. (Ad) A brand-new technology - code named \"Halo-Fi\" - could kill off your overpriced cable company for good... beaming lightning-fast internet to your home for an estimated $7 a month. This is undoubtedly the beginning of the end for \"Big 3\" internet providers. Forward-thinking investors in Halo-Fi are lining up to get rich before March 9th. Well-designed frameworks for regulating harmful content can outline clear ways for governments, companies, and civil society to share responsibilities and work together, the company said. 'Designed poorly, these efforts risk unintended consequences that might make people less safe online, stifle expression and slow innovation.'  Facebook said tech companies shouldn't be punished for publishing illegal speech, because it would be impractical to require internet platforms to approve each post. 'Retrofitting the rules that regulate online speech for the online world may be insufficient. New frameworks are needed,' the paper said.

The FaceBook CEO facing fierce questions on fact-checking political ads, trust, and his proposed crypto currency.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>All right, we've got a big show this morning.</p><p>Joining the conversation, Fox Business' Dagen McDowell, attorney and Fox News contributor Emily Compagno is here, and \"The Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman.</p><p>Great to see you.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Good to be here. Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Editorial --</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Aren't you lucky, James Freeman, to be surrounded by all these super smart women. Count your -- count your blessings.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. Just like -- just like when I'm at home.</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) this morning.</p><p>FREEMAN: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Director or is this something new?</p><p>FREEMAN: No. No.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, OK. No, OK.</p><p>So, in other words, social media obviously one of the big stories this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mark Zuckerberg on Capitol Hill yesterday. I've got to get your reaction to what you heard.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I think -- yes, make Zuck's coming into his own. I think this is good news that he's saying, we are not going to be the arbiters of political disputes. We're not going to get into fact checking. We're going to let this -- this raucous democracy we have play it out and people debate online and people say the messages they want to say. I also think this is good news that despite the loss of some partners and a lot of political heat, he's pressing ahead on his crypto currency plan.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>FREEMAN: So we can -- we can use that innovation. Maybe it's good for consumers. Who knows?</p><p>BARTIROMO: But there's a lot of pushback because of what we learned in his other businesses. The FaceBook CEO testified before House lawmakers yesterday, answering a variety of questions on China, crypto currency, Libra and election security.</p><p>House Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters kicked things off. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): Given the company's size and reach, it should be clear why we have serious concerns about your plans to establish a global digital currency that would challenge the U.S. dollar. In fact, you have opened up a series discussion about whether FaceBook should be broken up.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: I actually don't know if Libra is going the work, but I believe that it's important to try new things. And as long as you're doing so responsibly. That's what has made America successful and it's why our tech industry has lead the world.</p><p>I probably, 10 years ago, would have been more optimistic that trying to work in China could have contributed to making a more open society. And today it seems that, in some cases, working in China not only does not do that but compromises Americans companies' ability to promote our values abroad and around the world.</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Well, Congressman, I think lying is bad. And I think if you were to run an ad that had a lie, that would be bad. That's different from it being -- from it -- from -- in our position, the right thing to do to prevent your constituents or people in an election to seeing that you had lied.</p><p>OCASIO-CORTEZ: So we can -- so you won't take down lies or you will take down lies? I mean that's just a pretty simple yes or no.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, what a grilling.</p><p>Emily, what did you thing?</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I actually thought the most interesting grilling came from Congressman Sherman from California, who basically said, look, this Libra association, you cannot hide behind it should something go horribly wrong. And he challenged that notion of independents that up until now Zuckerberg's really been championing. And obviously we know that a lot of companies have dropped off from it, so it's not necessarily the shiny gold star that Zuckerberg portrayed it to be in the beginning.</p><p>And I also think there was explosive news coming out lately is that we now have 47 attorneys general who have joined the statewide campaign investigation into the anti-trust nature of FaceBook. I think those are the things that FaceBook really has to watch out for because ultimately it won't be defensible if this is totally hijacked by those with nefarious intent, even though, as we heard yesterday, Zuckerberg says, well, it's for the poor and disenfranchised.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-huh.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, the sanctimony of those liberal Democrats. Now they're all -- and \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial page has written out this. Now they're all upset about free speech. We need to police speech, particularly on FaceBook, because it's moved against them. \"The Wall Street Journal\" wrote recently that many -- that many liberals, the elite consensus held that the free-wheeling debate advanced Democratic government and liberal social causes and they loved what FaceBook was doing when it benefited President Barack Obama's 2012 presidential campaign --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Where you could get access the essentially the data and behavior of the friends of friends, the social graph, if you will. FaceBook did away with that in 2015, but since Donald Trump won the presidential election, and the Cambridge Analytica scandal came to light, now they are incensed that FaceBook isn't doing more to crack down on free speech. They could do something. They could remove the liability waiver that social media companies have --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what they should do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Have for user-generated content. Maybe they will. Maybe they won't. But this was high comedy coming from the left.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, my favorite was when Maxine Waters got into it with him and they were talking about whether politicians lie. Did you see that?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I mean, if they were -- if they had to fact-check every message from --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>FREEMAN: The honorable, esteemed members of that congressional panel, obviously they couldn't get much else done.</p><p>But I thought he -- that was exactly the right analysis on China. This is - -</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: This is essentially the central problem which is we opened up trade with this country thinking that capitalism would be a liberalizing force. That hasn't happened.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>FREEMAN: That government is getting more repressive and I think I -- he didn't -- I don't know if he mentioned the NBA, but you're seeing that intimidation that's causing U.S. companies to have to not just be silent but seemingly sometimes even endorse repression.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, like --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mark Zuckerberg, this has been -- this is kind of a flair in the air, if you will, for a warning to American companies, that if you side with China versus western values, you might have some problems.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I -- he's on -- he's on the right side of the Constitution here, although the First Amendment doesn't apply to that country (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO: I really like that, actually. And good for you for highlighting Shaq O'Neil.</p><p>FREEMAN: Oh, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I totally called that out yesterday as well. Because to see Shaq come out and say, this is what we do, we have freedom of speech --</p><p>FREEMAN: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And that's just the way it is, China, as opposed to LeBron James, who said Morey didn't know what he was talking about and he was uneducated on the subject.</p><p>We've got to talk earnings for a second. Tesla is soaring this morning. The company crushing expectations last night, sending the stock up 17.5 percent. The results calming investor fears about production growth impacting profitability.</p><p>Microsoft reporting strong earnings as well, attribute it to the cloud computing business. That stock's up about 1 percent.</p><p>Ford missed its third quarter expectations. It lowered its year-end guidance. And look at Ford shares, having a move up in the last day or so, but it's been a -- it's been a tough week there. As you can see, Twitter will be out in about an hour and a half and Amazon is reporting after the bell tonight.</p><p>So, so far, in terms of the earnings reporting season, comments?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, generally good. Some misses. Not across the board positive news. I think -- I think along with these earnings today it's going to be interesting. We'll get some more manufacturing data from the Census Bureau, from HIS Market puts its latest PMI out. So we've had kind -- some kind of soft data on industrial production with the exception of the Richmond Fed. So I think between the earnings and some of these industrial production readings, we may get a better sense of the overall economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll see about manufacturing. Don't forget, you've got Boeing and GM as a big impact in those manufacturing numbers.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we're waiting on that to see really what -- we'll get the clarity on really how weak the manufacturing sector is.</p><p>Go ahead, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just, Tesla, what an incredible report. And, you know, it surprising to the upside, not only surprising on a profit for the most recent quarter, but saying it would continue to be profitable, although new products could hurt the company's margins. A record delivery figure helping that stock.</p><p>But, again, talk about people underestimating the potential of that company. An 18 percent gain the pre-market is kind of astonishing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really incredible.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, but are they kind of -- are they -- I'm just wondering if they're overdoing it in the -- this direction now because even though it was a surprising profit, the production, it's a record, but it's still not really where they want to be. I mean they're going to have a -- they're going to have to be working pretty hard and pretty long hours this quarter to meet their annual target on deliveries.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is the -- this is the land you want to live in if Elizabeth Warren becomes the president. That's all I'll tell you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That -- that's true.</p><p>Well, look, the banking is trying to get ahead of that. They are certainly shaking in their boots with Elizabeth Warren's promises to break up the major banks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But I'm not saying that that's why the stock is up. But, again, the delivery number came in early October, so people should have known that the results would be better.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The impeachment proceedings getting heated, Emily. What's your take on all of this? Republican lawmakers storming into a secure meeting room, delaying the testimony of a Pentagon witness. This was done to protest the nature of the House's impeachment inquiry, calling for more transparency. We know that things have been leaked selectively, like the most recent testimony, the opening statement is leaked and then John Ratcliffe apparently, you know, throws a whole bomb into all of that and totally undoes what -- what the leaked opening statement says and yet we don't know what the questioning is, we only see the opening statements. So there's select -- the bottom line is they are releasing things selectively.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. And I think for the average American, this is equal parts exhausting and infuriating. What they are subjected to, what they are seeing is that legislators are essentially creating spectacles back and forth, that things are being selectively leaked and then we have allegations of security breaches when the leaks come from cell phone photos and ultimately the end of the day this is dealing with non-classified information, in classified rooms, with issues of transparency back and forth.</p><p>The average American deserves to see all the evidence and the Constitution talks about a consensus, right? That's what we pay our legislators to come to during this inquiry, during this entire investigation. So the fact that all we see is bickering doesn't bode well with the average voter certainly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, I agree with the editorial board this morning with this -- with the blunder. It is. It's Pelosi's impeachment blunder.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is. But this kind of show doesn't really help because clearly some of these House members on the Republican side were violating the rules. So, again, how are you going make the argument that Nancy Pelosi isn't playing by -- there are no impeachment rules in the Constitution, but certainly the precedent of the Clinton and the Nixon impeachment, but some phones were taken into the skiff (ph).</p><p>And Emily raises a great issue, that the one -- the -- potentially punishing these congressional members who barged into the skiff, the secured area, without permission is the fact that even though the deposition was being held in a classified space, the deposition itself was not classified. So therein lies the problem of actually punishing these individuals.</p><p>I don't know if this went off the way that they wanted it to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So I think -- I think all of this -- every day we get another situation that we're sort of unpacking, if you will. I think the American people are getting just -- they just want to get the stuff done and they want to see progress and they're not getting anything done.</p><p>I think, at the end of the day, that's what's going to be remembered in the part of the American voter.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, I'll just add that at the root of it we now have essentially everyone, including the Bidens, agreeing that the deal was inappropriate and I -- I think there is a great public interest in finding out exactly how the intelligence surveillance tools of the U.S. government got turned against on opposition political party in 2016.</p><p>So on the two underlying issues, I think a reasonable person would say those ought to be looked at.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're absolutely right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They are being looked at, though.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're parallel investigations with the IG report on the FISA abuse coming out and also the John Durham investigation, which has -- again, continues to expand. Clapper and Brennan are certainly on his radar now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have more Hunter Biden news. It's in \"The Wall Street Journal\" today. I'm going to sit on it and make you wait.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, you're going to sit on it. You're going to tell us at some point during the show.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. You have to wait.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll take a short break. We are just getting started. And there's that. So, stay with us.</p><p>Also on deck, the assistant to the president for trade and manufacturing policy, Peter Navarro is here on China trade. We'll see where we are on that and USMCA, by the way. Hewlett Packard Enterprise CEO Antonio Neri is here on the business of cloud and, of course, cloud computing is what is driving the better than expected earnings on a number of companies. Texas Congressman and House Appropriations Committee member Henry Cuellar on the impeachment inquiry. He's going to give us his take on all of this. And the former chief economic adviser under George W. Bush, Ed Lazear, on USMCA. Former Ford CEO Mark Fields joining the conversation as well. He'll join us at 8:00 a.m.</p><p>Stay with us. We've got a big show coming up.</p><p>We'll take a break.</p><p>First, though, path to peace. President Trump lifts all sanctions on Turkey, declaring a ceasefire in Syria permanent. We'll talk about it.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Lawmakers will pay tribute to Congressman Elijah Cummings today.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Maria.</p><p>So the late Maryland congressman is going to lie in state at the U.S. Capitol today. That's quite an honor. An arrival ceremony will include speeches from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch Mcconnell. The public will be allowed to pay their respects before a wake and funeral is going to be held in Baltimore tomorrow. Cummings died last week due to complications from long-standing health issues. He was 68 year's old.</p><p>Well, lawyers for former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn have requested that financial misconduct charges be dismissed. Ghosn's legal team claims there was collusion between prosecutors, government officials and Nissan executives to drum up criminal allegations in order to remove him as chairman of a company.</p><p>And then there is this, news from deep in the heart of Texas. The Washington Nationals are another game closer to winning their first ever World Series. They beat the Astros at home in Houston again last night. It was a killer game. Stephen Strasburg outpitching fellow ace Justin Verlander, overcoming a shaky start to help the Nationals beat the Astros 12-3.</p><p>And you'll flip and twist for this. Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles threw out the first game's pitch. The game's first pitch.</p><p>Oh, she's so cute. I love her. Anyway, that was one to remember for sure. She looked like she had a great time. But, who, Nationals on fire, people. Man, 12-3.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love that.</p><p>CASONE: In Houston.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You should see her standing next to the catcher, though.</p><p>CASONE: Oh she's -- because she's so little.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She's so little.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She's amazing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love that she did that right before the pitch.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I tweeted that last night.</p><p>COMPAGNO: (INAUDIBLE), she got the autograph after he was signing the ball. But she should have been the one that was signing the ball, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, yes, right. Yes. What a pitch.</p><p>All right, a quick break.</p><p>Thank you, Cheryl. A quick break.</p><p>And then, closer to a deal. Workers at General Motors plant in Michigan OK a tentative contract. We've got all the details.</p><p>And then a spiritual journey. Burger King prepped for Halloween with this Ghost Whopper. We'll tell you who got the first bite.</p><p>And then we are keeping an eye on Tesla this morning. The stock is up almost 20 percent after revenue beat and posting the largest one-day gain on record.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Focus on Amazon this morning, reporting earnings after the bell tonight. Investors are waiting to see what kind of growth the company's web service's division will contribute to the overall bottom line. The effects of new shipping methods, that could weigh on profit.</p><p>Joining us right now is the CEO of Applico, Alex Moazed.</p><p>Alex, great to see you. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>ALEX MOAZED, CEO, APPLICO: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Give us -- give us sort of a backdrop in terms of tech right now and where the growth comes from.</p><p>MOAZED: I mean you nailed it on the head, these large tech monopolies are considered growth companies. Trillion dollar growth companies, but still growth companies nonetheless.</p><p>Amazon is on fire. Microsoft beat earnings on -- on earnings and revenue yesterday. But, still, their stock is down because they -- the investors didn't see enough growth, particularly with Azur (ph) as they wanted to see.</p><p>So all of these companies are evaluated from a growth perspective. Amazon probably being top pick amongst all of the big tech stocks that are out there right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Amazon is your top pick?</p><p>MOAZED: They're on fire right now. They just have so many new business initiatives in addition to just e-commerce, which they do about $277 billion in total through put (ph) for 2018, growing at say 20 percent every quarter. And still consumer retail in the United States is $2.5 trillion. There's so much growth just in their core business, let alone the other new businesses that they're spinning up quite successfully.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Can Amazon get away with anything, though, because there's been a real spotlight on them selling say expired food? Today \"The Journal\" reports that they offer a steady stream of clothing from dozens of Bangladeshi factories that are shunned by other leading retailers. They behave like they can't be touched, but there's certainly a greater spotlight on their behavior.</p><p>MOAZED: It's a great point. So their real kind of vulnerability from say a regulatory standpoint is how do they treat their sellers. The FTC just recently is now investigating how is Amazon treating sellers on the marketplace. This vesture (ph) at the EU, who heads up their regulation, is also looking at this.</p><p>I think the one actual vulnerability that Amazon has is, is how do they treat their sellers? Do they take advantage of them because they absolutely are a monopoly when you look at where you can sell products online as a third party seller.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There was a similar criticism that Wal-Mart faced for years and years because it would force all the people who sold to Wal-Mart to just cut the prices.</p><p>MOAZED: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Go ahead, James, sorry.</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, just -- I was going to ask about the web services. This has been a very high-margin business for them. It's also, I think, pretty high margin for Microsoft, for Google.</p><p>Services companies usually aren't in high margin business and yet they all seem to be getting margins like softwares or intellectual property kind of businesses. Do they each have their own unique IP or how can this be such a great business for all of them?</p><p>MOAZED: It's a great question. Basically it's a commodity storage product when you think about it.</p><p>FREEMAN: Right.</p><p>MOAZED: The platform network effect dynamic is that they have these apps that third party developers are making, that you can then use if you are a customer of AWS or Azur. And, interesting enough, if you look at the top three cloud storage players, Amazon, one, Microsoft, tow, Google, three, and you look at how many third party apps they have in their app stores, it literally ranks the same way, Amazon has the most, Microsoft has the second most, Google the third most. So --</p><p>FREEMAN: OK. So it's a byproduct of their related business?</p><p>MOAZED: It gives them some defensibility that helps on the margin or, you know, that kind of aspect of it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: You mentioned that you were just in Vienna. What perspective did you hear there that viewers would be interested in hearing (ph) toward that?</p><p>MOAZED: I think in -- in Europe, lots of people are talking about Libra. I was also in Geneva right before Vienna and so there's a lot of chatter going on both here, obviously, and there about what's going to happen with this, would it be allowed, what could that mean for the EU, you know, and all of these kinds of repercussions for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Big tech facing a possible reckoning with executives like FaceBook CEO Mark Zuckerberg under scrutiny. What's your take in terms of where this is going in terms of, you've got testifying about election interferes -- interference, honest advertising, of course, breaches in privacy. What kind of regulation changes might you expect?</p><p>MOAZED: Net-net, I am very positive on Zuckerberg. And especially the stance that he's taking. I don't think Congress gives the American people enough respect or credit for their ability to think for themselves. I think, you know, on the Libra topic, it's going to be a positive things for America to innovate. You look at what Congress is beating Zuckerberg up on, it's actually kind of anti-American, right? It's saying, well, we don't want you to innovate particularly when your product will be used abroad, which will only have -- help America's influence abroad, a. B, oh, we want you to regulate more aggressively basically free speech on your platform called FaceBook. It -- it just doesn't really resonate with, I think, our value system and what we stand for.</p><p>FREEMAN: So Libra could be kind of a subversive force where overseas regimes are not free like ours?</p><p>MOAZED: China understands the power in their tech companies unlike anyone else, much better than the United States. Just look at what's happened with the NBA and Tencent. They are able to wheel their soft power through their tech companies abroad. Where is Libra really going to catch on? Maybe somewhat in the U.S., but really abroad where Zuckerberg is saying we can - - we can help the billion people unbanked. Where are a lot of these people? Not in the United States. So why wouldn't we want to do that?</p><p>MCDOWELL: And why we wouldn't, as a nation, want to promote that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alex, thank you. Great to see you.</p><p>MOAZED: Likewise.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alex Moazed joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, lights out in California again. Rolling blackouts affecting hundreds of thousands of customers. Utility PG&amp;E working to avoid wildfires. We'll tell you how.</p><p>And then, closer to a deal. Striking workers at General Motors and the plant in Michigan OK the tentative contract. We'll take a look, next.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, October 24th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season rolling on. American Airlines and Southwest Airlines among the big names reporting their third quarter this morning. Both have been affected by the 737 Max grounding.</p><p>Social media giant Twitter and Comcast also reporting before the opening bell this morning. We will have those numbers for you and get you full analysis and see if they're impacting markets.</p><p>Meanwhile, ahead of all of that markets are higher this morning, fractionally speaking. Dow futures up 19 points. S&amp;P futures up 3. And the Nasdaq futures up 35.</p><p>That's following a back and forth action yesterday. The major indices finished up slightly at 4:00 on Walls Street yesterday. it was all about mixed earnings reports. But when all was said and done, the DowIndustrials were up 45 points. The S&amp;P was up 8. And the Nasdaq was up 15.5.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 closing above 3000 -- about 22 points away from an all-time new record high.</p><p>European indices this morning look like this. We've got the European Central Bank decision due out later this morning, the last under the leadership of Mario Draghi. Then Christine Lagarde takes over as president of the ECB.</p><p>This morning the FT 100 is up 68. The CAC 40 in Paris is up 32. And the DAX index in Germany is up 73 points, two-thirds of 1 percent.</p><p>Southwest Airlines earnings coming out as we speak -- we're going to get you those numbers, imminently.</p><p>In Asia take a look at the markets there, mostly higher overnight as you can see. China was down fractionally but the best performer was in Hong Kong. Hang Seng index up almost 1 percent.</p><p>Lights out in California again -- rolling blackouts impacting nearly half a million people as PG&amp;E fights to avoid wild fires.</p><p>And General Motors seems to be driving toward a deal -- workers at one of the largest General Motors factories approving a new contract.</p><p>Burger King trying to scare up sales. Check this out, the ghost whopper has reappeared at select locations up against Halloween. Find out the unique taste tester the fast-food giant is using to get the word out.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour -- permanent cease fire. President Trump declaring victory announcing Turkey had agreed to make the five-day cease fire in Syria permanent. In return he's lifting U.S. sanctions against Turkey.</p><p>The President also announcing a handful of U.S. troops will remain in Syria but he made clear he will not waiver on his original commitment to leave the so-called endless war.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Early this morning the government of Turkey informed my administration that they would be stopping combat and their offensive in Syria and making the cease fire permanent and it will indeed be permanent.</p><p>I've therefore instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to lift all sanctions imposed on October 14th. We've secured the oil and therefore a small number of U.S. troops will remain in the area.</p><p>Let someone else fight over this long, bloodstained sand.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: He's going to leave some troops there to protect the oil fields in Syria. Turkey meanwhile has given the Kurdish fighters about a week to withdraw 20 miles from the border.</p><p>Joining us right now is the former ambassador to Cyprus and foreign and international economic policy analyst who served for six secretaries of state, Richard Boucher.</p><p>Sir -- it's good go have you on the program. Welcome back. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>RICHARD BOUCHER, FORMER AMBASSADOR TO CYPRUS: Thank you. Thank you. It's good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to the plan so far. The President saying, look, he doesn't want to be in any endless wars but he will leave some troops to protect those oil fields.</p><p>BOUCHER: Well, I mean first of all, it's good that there's a cease fire. It's good that we've sort of stabilized the parties vis-a-vis each other.</p><p>But on the other hand, it's another lesson. The fact that diplomacy has to go first. You have to get in there, negotiate the separation of the forces, negotiate a stable situation in order to remove U.S. troops. You don't remove U.S. troops and let, you know, let others come in and fill the vacuum.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think that's happening or are you against this plan to remove any troops right now?</p><p>BOUCHER: No, I think it's good idea that he removed the troops. But as I said you lead with the diplomacy. You work out a stable situation that will follow.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So U.S. envoy Jim Jeffrey told lawmakers during a House hearing, more than 100 ISIS prisoners are on the loose right now in Syria following the Turkey invasion. Ambassador -- one of the issues was when the U.S. troops leaving started spreading around the Kurdish fighters got rolled over and apparently left their positions and ISIS fighters were released. What's your take on that?</p><p>BOUCHER: Well, exactly, if you have a negotiated withdrawal, a negotiated stability, then the Kurds who can continue to hold the ISIS fighters. Right now we've got a situation with ISIS fighters on the lose, Kurds will never trust us again, Turks coming into areas and patrolling with the Russians. That's not a good situation but it's the best we can do since we acted the way we did.</p><p>MCDOWELL: it's Dagen McDowell. What should we watch in terms of flashpoints around the oil fields, for example, like you've got our troops with no allies virtually trying to guard the oil fields, the rise of ISIS, again that 100 ISIS prisoners was sort of contradicted by the President and his statement yesterday where he kind of dismissed the number although there's still about 10,000 under captivity. We have a thousand troops that are now in Iraq but they can only stay in that region for four weeks.</p><p>What should we be watching here because, again, \"The Journal\" editorial page calls this a win for Turkey and points out it's a safe zone for Bashar al-Assad, Russia, Turkey and Iran.</p><p>BOUCHER: Yes, exactly. I guess, you know, watched the number of ISIS people, 100 is bad but it's not awful compared to the total numbers. The - - issue of oil is not oil, we don't need the oil. We want to keep ISIS from using oils away as way of gaining money. You've got to watch that if they get their hands on the financial flows that come out of the oil fields.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Putting it back in business.</p><p>BOUCHER: And then third is -- yes, you don't want to put them back in business. And then third is to make sure that there aren't any holes in this arrangement, that there are that ISIS or others could move into.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Ambassador -- it's Emily Compagno. I have two questions for you. Number one -- do you foresee an appropriation issue with troops that are remaining there to protect the oil fields essentially, that there will be a question of protection for economic interest.</p><p>And secondly do you predict that we will hear an articulation of some type of foreign policy that really addresses the second and third and fourth degree layers that you mentioned here today?</p><p>BOUCHER: Well, I think, you know, the Congress, the appropriation's process will support American troops wherever they are. I don't see that as a big problem, I suppose they'll probably be a lot of noise.</p><p>The administration needs to say what is their vision. What is their plan? What are they trying to do here not only for the sake of the American people and the American Congress but for the sake of the parties themselves.</p><p>It's clear that the United States desire that the United States view of the situation has a certain amount of sway and if our goal is to create stable situation on the border to give Turkey a buffer to give the Kurds a space and not to have the Russians and the Syrian government come back in, then we have to articulate that in a way that makes sense for the people there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ambassador -- let me switch gears and ask you about China and specifically this NBA controversy. James Freeman, who's on our panel today, out with a new op-ed in the \"Wall Street Journal\" titled \"Xi Cannot Stop Shaq\". That Shaq O'Neill speaking out yesterday in support of freedom and in support of freedom of speech in America.</p><p>Your reaction to how some companies, even people in the league, the NBA, have been rolling over to appease China for, you know, who don't want anybody speaking out in support of the Hong Kongers?</p><p>BOUCHER: I don't think anybody in the United States is out to insult China or, you know, poke them with our fingers. On the other hand Americans have to be Americans. You've got the right to say what you want and we need to stand up for that and companies shouldn't say well, you know, we are going to put people around the Chinese. You know, let's be who we are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: James -- talk about your op-ed in a minute because, you know, there's also this issue of we know China's behavior, we know that they've rounded up one to two million Uyghurs, putting them in concentration camps. We know that they track their people.</p><p>I mean should we just turn a blind eye and do a deal because it puts money in the pockets of big business in America?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, there's a good essay at hotair.com about this basically saying look, we're overlooking a lot. You mentioned, in order to do business with China, we thought that maybe it would have long-term positive impact but we've overlooked a lot of human rights violations there and yet they cannot tolerate our free speech.</p><p>Ambassador -- I just wonder the precedent here. I mean if they are saying that you cannot say anything even in American media and still do business over there, that would seem to rule out a lot of U.S. companies. Or on the other hand change completely the dialogue we have within the United States to conform to their limits on speech?</p><p>BOUCHER: Well, that's what I say. We've got -- we've got to maintain our traditions, maintain our freedom of speech. Let people say what they want in -- wherever they are. If China doesn't want to deal with them, well, that's just, you know -- that's just going to happen.</p><p>You know, overall in Hong Kong, you know, it's a dangerous situation, it's a difficult situation. And I think Americans are going to have views about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So -- I mean if China is complaining about something that we value, free speech in America, should we complain about the way they treat people, the way they -- should that be part of the conversation around the trade deal? The one to two million Uyghurs in concentration camps, the tracking of citizens, the social score (ph) -- should we be focused on that and include that in the conversation about trade?</p><p>BOUCHER: Well, we should speak on it. We always do speak on it. We always have since the beginning. You know, when I was in Hong Kong during the handover 20 years ago I was accused of interference from China's internal affairs. I think all of my successors there have been accused of interference.</p><p>The United States speaks out about things that are of concern to us. I don't think that's necessarily the responsibility of companies as companies but American individuals should also be free to say what they want.</p><p>I don't think it enters into trade negotiations. I do think you have to be able to deal with countries in places particularly like China on a lot of different levels.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok.</p><p>BOUCHER: You to tell them what they're doing to the Uyghurs is wrong. But you have to be willing to cut a trade deal within U.S. interests.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, apparently if you got involved the way you did 20 years ago, you would have your bones crushed and your body smashed -- that's according to Xi Jinping.</p><p>BOUCHER: Well --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's what Xi Jinping said.</p><p>BOUCHER: -- if I was Chinese, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Ambassador -- it's good to see you, sir. Thank you so much.</p><p>BOUCHER: Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ambassador Richard Boucher joining us there.</p><p>More potential trouble for Boeing meanwhile. Cheryl Casone on headlines right now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. When it just can't get worse it does, Maria. A former Boeing pilot reportedly complained years ago that he was under pressure by management concerning the 737 Max jet. The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that Mark Forkner, who was the chief technical pilot for the Max was concerned about Boeing's push to make sure airlines wouldn't have to pay for additional pilot trainings.</p><p>Forkner told Colleagues he feared losing his job over the training issue. He's now at the center of a federal investigation to how that jet was built and certified.</p><p>Well, the 5-week strike against General Motors could be coming to an end. UAW workers at a plant in Clint, Michigan -- that's one of GM's largest have vote to ratify the new contract, workers across the nation have until tomorrow to vote on the new four-year deal.</p><p>And then take this one medium rare -- Burger King hasn't unveiled a ghost whopper. And their billing it today</p><p>It's a Halloween theme burger obviously. It's served on a white cheddar cheese flavored bun. The ghost whopper only available for a limited of time in ten restaurants in the United States. It's $4.60. Come on Burger King, where is the love?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ten restaurants -- that's a cool idea.</p><p>That sounds spooky -- Cheryl. Thank you Cheryl.</p><p>We'll take a break when we come back, light's out in California again control rolling backouts affecting hundreds of thousands of customers, utility PG&amp;E is working to avoid wild fires.</p><p>We're going to take a break. When we come back, light's out in California. Again rolling black out affecting hundreds of customers, Utility PG&amp;E is working to avoid wild fires. We're going to tell you how when we come back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Headlines across America this morning.</p><p>The South Florida \"Sun Sentinel\" reports Florida Senate permanently removes Scott Israel as Broward sheriff. Israel's leadership called into question, you remember as the massacre at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School unfolded.</p><p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said that he hopes this brings some relief to Parkland families. The trial of suspected shooter, Nicolas Cruz is set to begin in January.</p><p>The \"San Francisco Chronicle\" this morning writes PG&amp;E blacks out part of 15 counties. It's looking ahead to the next bigger outage that could start Saturday. A dangerous forecast forcing the utility to look ahead. Winds this weekend could be worse than the gusts that pushed the deadly wine country fires tow years. This would be the third forced black out this month -- all to help prevent fires sparked by damaged electrical equipment.</p><p>And the \"Chicago Sun Times\", this morning writes \"Lightfoot, we won't bailout CPS. Pay for everything teachers union wants. The mayor of Chicago showing no signs of backing down, saying that the district has to live within its means. The teachers strike has kept 300,000 students out of class for days now. Thousands rallied outside of city hall yesterday during Lightfoot's first budget address shutting down the famous loop.</p><p>We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back -- recession proof: how small business owners can prepare for the potential market moves of the economy.</p><p>Then overworked -- why many Americans are unhappy in the workplace.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Doing business amid economic uncertainty -- whether a recession hits hardships for individual businesses can happen at any time. You could lose your biggest customer. You could have your best employee jump ship.</p><p>My next guest is here to make sure your business thrives no matter what happens, what comes your way. Joining us right now is the founder and president of Autobahn Consultants. He is the governor of recession.com, he calls himself. And he is the author of the book \"Rock the Recession: how successful entrepreneurs prepare for, thrive during and create wealth after downturns. Jonathan Slain is here. Jonathan -- good to see you.</p><p>JONATHAN SLAIN, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, AUTOBAHN CONSULTANTS: Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great name of the book, \"Rock the Recession\", baby, tell us how to do it.</p><p>SLAIN: Really there's two kinds of recessions, Maria. Really the first are economic recessions, those are the ones that we all experience together like the great recession. And then there's the other kind of recessions, the noneconomic recessions, the ones that you mentioned where your biggest customer leaves or your five biggest -- best employees leave and they go to another company.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's like when it's not a recession for everybody else but a recession for you.</p><p>SLAIN: Exactly. And so the first thing that you want to do to prepare for a recession, my coauthor Paul Belair and I studied many companies. The first thing is to assess where you're at. And that's why we put upon recession.com, we have gotten assessment and companies go there, you benchmark where you're at versus the rest of companies, versus the industry, understanding where you are would be the first step.</p><p>From there, the second step would be to make sure that you're tuning up your business, tuning up your personal life so that you're prepared for a recession, you're going to get into racing.</p><p>And our last step is to pounce. That's where you're going to be able to purchase other companies, to purchase assets that are cheaper in the recession or to be able to get talent. I don't know if you've heard that since unemployment is so low right now, there's a war on talent out there, it's hard for small businesses, small business leaders to get talent, a recession is going to bring back a lot of those opportunities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. They have to pay up for talent, right. Is that what's going on?</p><p>SLAIN: Right now, Right now you have to pay up for talent and it's hard to get people even if you're willing to pay up. A recession means that people are going to be more malleable or willing to move around.</p><p>Maybe their company doesn't have a good plan, maybe their company hasn't rocked the recession, they haven't done what they need to do. So people jump ship and they're more willing to move to another company that is prepared.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's why during the good time James, right, you see a lot of movement. People don't mind quitting in another group, right.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. That's right. Yes, we're like -- economy-wise, a healthy quit rate.</p><p>I'm wondering whether it's personal or a larger recession. I assume part of tuning up is cutting cost. Is there advise you have on the first thing that ought to go. Whether it's business or personal expense.</p><p>SLAIN: So I'm recommending that all companies take a look. And try to cut percent of their expenses right now and start saving that money for a war chest. That way in the recession you can tout it --</p><p>FREEMAN: They all did that I didn't have a plan.</p><p>SLAIN: So my experience in the recession was really that I didn't' have a plan. I wasn't prepared and what happened there is that I ended up borrowing money from my mother in law. That's how I survived the great recession.</p><p>I had a small, fitness business. Personal training studio. It's probably the worst business to be in if you're looking at a recession because it's one of the first things to go. That discretionary type spending with fitness. But really --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Did you ever pay your mother-in-law back.</p><p>SLAIN: I did. I did.</p><p>So it was a quarter of a million that I borrowed from her and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Nice mother-in-law.</p><p>SLAIN: Nice mother in law.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>FREEMAN: You're going to hear about that forever.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You are. She's got that out --</p><p>SLAIN: You know, the good news is that I'm still married. So it did work out I think. And paying her back brought us closer together but the idea was that it wasn't even one lump sum, it was every other week I was calling her to say, hey, we've got to make payroll again, this is where we are at and so -- but it worked out ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We're happy to hear that. Jonathan -- good to have you. Thank you so much for the tip.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jonathan Slain -- we will be right back. Thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019102401cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBM-BFJ1-DXH2-63HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7596\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 24, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001TIV</classCode><className>AMERICAN AIRLINES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The care-free, Silicon Valley image has taken something of a beating this week after - suit and tie-clad - Mr Zuckerberg sat front of a Senate committee explaining how the personal information of 87m Facebook users ended up in the hands of political PR company Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>The UK company - which had a hand in Donald Trump's successful presidential campaign - is said to have taken the information via an app attached to the site's Connect service and used it to target voters in the run-up to the election. It isn't the first time Facebook has been accused of playing a role in political events. The group is also facing questions over whether it missed attempts by Russians to use the platform to interfere in the 2016 US election.</p><p>Chris Hughes - one of Facebook's first employees - thinks Mr Zuckerberg's grilling is long overdue. He claims that the recent scandal was not entirely unexpected because of the way in which Facebook allows users to access third-party websites through their accounts. Back in 2014 - when Cambridge Analytica mined the data - the third parties would have had access to users' data and that of their friends.</p><p>Facebook's shares have suffered as investors worry that the latest string of allegations may force lawmakers to impose profitcrippling regulation. Big tech peers, including Amazon (US:AMZN), Apple (US:AAPL) and Google's owner Alphabet ( US:GOOGL), have shared in the misery as concerns mount that any change in regulation may upset the way many of these companies make money.</p><p>The heavy weighting of the tech giants has dragged the wider US stock market down, too.</p><p>But Mr Zuckerberg used his time in Washington to allay some fears. He apologised for Facebook's handling of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and confirmed that the group is open to the \"right regulation\". He praised Europe's new data protection laws and agreed that the US would have to do more to ensure the personal information of individuals is protected. By refraining from any specifics, Mr Zuckerberg has left the door open for continued talks about the future of Facebook, including a paid-for version.</p><p>\u2022If regulation eases user and marketer concerns, it may not be the worst thing for Facebook. Investors are certainly seeming more confident and added $17bn (\u00a312bn) to the group's capitalisation on the first day of Mr Zuckerberg's testimony. But Facebook is certainly not out of the woods yet and we think investors should remain cautious as regulators circle the entire tech sector.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the US Congress</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-136499957</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3B-7B31-JBVM-Y03T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"463\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59206\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 13, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

In the audio, Zuckerberg talks to employees about issues ranging from the possibility of U.S. lawmakers attempting to break up the company to its plans to compete with video-sharing app TikTok. He also urged employees to tell friends who do not like the social media platform that Facebook cares about the problems and is working to solve them. Here are six things that Zuckerberg told employees, according to the transcript:Facebook can defeat a government break-up attemptThe Facebook CEO said he expected the company would face, and defeat, legal challenges if Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren were elected president. </p><p>Warren has vowed to break up giant tech companies like Facebook[2], Amazon and Alphabet Inc's Google. He also said breaking up big tech companies would make election interference 'more likely because now the companies can't coordinate and work together' and drew laughter by saying Facebook's investment on safety was bigger than Twitter's entire revenue.Without absolute control, 'I would have been fired'Asked how he balanced his financial responsibility to shareholders with his moral responsibility to society, Zuckerberg reminded employees of moments when he believes his concentrated control helped Facebook ride out difficulties such as Yahoo's 2006 bid for the company. 'One of the things that I've been lucky about in building this company is, you know, I kind of have voting control of the company, and that's something I focused on early on,' he said. 'And it was important because, without that, there were several points where I would've been fired. For sure, for sure'Facebook has a 'plan of attack' against TikTokZuckerberg was also questioned about Facebook's 'plan of attack' against TikTok, the rapidly growing video app owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, which has gained huge popularity among teenagers. He said that Facebook was focusing its new standalone video-sharing app Lasso, but would test it first in markets where TikTok is less prominent, such as Mexico. 'We're trying to first see if we can get it to work in countries where TikTok is not already big before we go and compete with TikTok in countries where they are big,' he said.Why Facebook announced digital currency plans earlyZuckerberg touched on the company's ambitious plans to establish a cryptocurrency called Libra[3]. Announced in June, the project quickly ran into trouble with skeptical regulators around the world. Zuckerberg said these responses had been part of Facebook trying 'a more consultative approach' on big projects. 'So not just show up and say, 'Alright, here we're launching this. Here's a product, your app got updated, now you can start buying Libras and sending them around,'' he said.Facebook does not want to get into brain surgeryFacebook announced last month that it had bought New York-based CTRL-labs[4], a start-up that is exploring ways for people to communicate with computers using brain signals. In the transcripts from the earlier July meetings, Zuckerberg said he thought that as part of Facebook's work on artificial reality and virtual reality, there would be a small amount of 'direct brain' interface and that progress in this area was exciting. But he stressed that Facebook was focused on non-invasive approaches that do not require surgery or implants. 'You think Libra is hard to launch,' Zuckerberg joked, imagining the headline ''Facebook wants to perform brain surgery.' I don't want to see the congressional hearings on that one.'Content moderator reports: 'A little ovedramatic'Outside contractors who monitor Facebook for objectionable content have complained that their work was underpaid, stressful and sometimes traumatic. An employee asked Zuckerberg about Facebook's plan to protect these types of contractors. Zuckerberg said it was an 'important issue that we're focused on' but he also said some of the reports were 'a little overdramatic.' 'Within a population of 30,000 people, there's going to be a distribution of experiences that people have,' he said. CTO Mike Schroepfer also stepped in to say that the company was working on technology to minimize harms for human moderators, for example, by automatically catching duplicate content.

Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, follows through on her vow to try to break up major technology firms, according to a leaked recording of his remarks published Tuesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah,\" Zuckerberg said in a July meeting with employees, a transcript of which was published by the technology news site the Verge.</p><p>He added: \"I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that's not the position that you want to be in when you're, you know, I mean ... it's like, we care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\"</p><p>Warren (D-Mass.) soon responded over Twitter, \"What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\"</p><p>The unusually direct exchange between a presidential candidate and a major corporate leader underscored the heightened political stakes for Silicon Valley ahead of the 2020 election. While many technology leaders have been visibly uneasy with President Trump - who routinely attacks the industry over its alleged bias against conservatives and other issues - there also is discomfort with the calls by Warren and other Democrats to regulate technology firms more aggressively than in the past.</p><p>The most alarming proposal to technology leaders is the call by Warren and some other liberals to dismantle major companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook for alleged antitrust violations. Chris Hughes, who co-founded Facebook with Zuckerberg, has been among those calling for a breakup of the company on the grounds that it has grown too powerful.</p><p>Facebook dominates much of social media worldwide through its namesake platform as well as Instagram and WhatsApp, both of which Facebook acquired when they were smaller but up-and-coming potential rivals.</p><p>Zuckerberg said in the same meeting with employees that Facebook is experimenting with a potential alternative to the Chinese-owned TikTok, which has grown popular among teens and young adults for its short videos. The Facebook alternative, called Lasso, is being tested in Mexico because, Zuckerberg said, TikTok is not yet popular there. He also said that Facebook was working with government regulators on the company's controversial plan to introduce a new online currency called Libra.</p><p>While other top Facebook executives have publicly argued against breaking up the company, Zuckerberg's remarks to employees were striking for their direct and often-unguarded tone - especially when compared with his occasional scripted speeches to users, typically through the Facebook Live portal, or in his nationally televised appearances on Capitol Hill last year. There, his opening comments and responses to questions were carefully constructed after days of preparation with lawyers.</p><p>After Zuckerberg's comments were published Tuesday, Warren took advantage of the news moment to tout her plan, \"How We Can Break Up Big Tech,\" linking to it in a tweet saying, \"I'm not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable. It's time to #BreakUpBigTech.\"</p><p>Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.</p><p>Facebook spokesman Andy Stone declined to elaborate on Zuckerberg's comments or respond to those from Warren. Hours after the Verge story was published, Zuckerberg linked to it on his Facebook page saying, \"even though it was meant to be internal rather than public, now that it's out there, you can check it out if you're interested in seeing an unfiltered version of what I'm thinking and telling employees on a bunch of topics like social responsibility, breaking up tech companies, Libra, neural computing interfaces, and doing the right thing over the long term.\"</p><p>The idea of enhanced antitrust enforcement of major technology companies has been gaining currency in recent years, at both the state and federal level. The Justice Department announced a major review of \"market-leading platforms\" in July that is ongoing.</p><p>As the Trump administration pursues possible antitrust claims, the issue is one of the few in the current political landscape that has significant support from both Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>The push by Warren and others for possible corporate breakups marks a departure from the Democratic Party's approach to such issues during the Obama administration, which was widely seen as sympathetic to Silicon Valley and had numerous former tech company officials in important administration jobs. A federal antitrust probe of Google, which ended in 2013, led to modest changes but no restructuring of that company.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-899795823b56485b80abd960e576a5fd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5R-1MM1-JB4M-V0RJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"855\"/><timeReceived>4:52 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 1, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) hauled the CEOs of America\u2019s richest and most powerful tech companies before the House as part of an investigation into whether the stunning growth of the technology industry leaders has strangled competition. The hearing\u2014nominally about their \u201cdominance\u201d in the marketplace for advertising, retail, and software\u2014quickly became a referendum for House Republicans on whether the companies\u2019 content moderation policies are biased against conservative viewpoints    James Sensenbrenner, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust regulation subcommittee, pressed Zuckerberg about Twitter\u2019s decision to remove a video \u2014 shared by the president\u2019s son among others\u2014touting the antimalarial drug as a \u201ccure\u201d for COVID-19.   Facebook, of course, didn\u2019t take any enforcement action against Donald Trump, Jr. because he\u2019d posted the video on Twitter, not Facebook. But Zuckerberg emphasized that while he doesn\u2019t want the responsibility of being an \u201carbiter of truth,\u201d sometimes Facebook feels compelled to act.    \u201cStating that there\u2019s a proven cure for COVID when there is in fact none\u201d could cause \u201cimminent risk of harm,\u201d Zuckerberg said, and so definitive claims about a \u201ccure\u201d for the disease will be taken down.   Cicilline, chairman of the subcommittee, tried to stick to the nominal purpose of the hearing\u2014\u201dExamining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google\u201d\u2014and claimed that the tech titans \u201chave too much power.\u201d     The hearing comes as many on the left are increasingly calling for anti-trust crackdowns on the tech behemoths and conservatives allege that social media companies\u2019 policies against extremist content and misinformation unfairly target right-wing users and messaging.     In a memo written by Republican committee staff and circulated before the hearing, Republicans tried to straddle a fine line between criticizing the tech titans for an alleged bias against conservatives while pushing back on what they said was an effort by Democrats that punishes \u201chard work and success, and condemns large companies out of a vague notion that \u2018big is bad.\u2019\u201d   For House Republicans, the tech industry\u2019s accumulation of power wasn\u2019t a problem per se so long as it doesn\u2019t conflict with conservative viewpoints and causes.   Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) blasted Google for \u201coffending half the people who use your product\u201d with an alleged anti-conservative bias and wondered why that hadn\u2019t resulted in a corresponding decrease in market share for the company.    Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) pressed Pichai not to give into \u201cbigoted anti-police policy\u201d after some employees wrote a letter asking that the company stop selling services to police and law enforcement in light of concerns about police violence and white supremacy. Google\u2019s decision to back out of a joint venture with the Defense Department, Project Maven, led Gaetz to \u201creally call into question their commitment to our country and our values.\u201d   In Google\u2019s case, Pichai punted on the questions by reiterating the company\u2019s commitment to working with law enforcement based on due process and the rule of law.   When pressed with similar questions, Zuckerberg said he \u201cbelieves companies shouldn\u2019t be making so many decisions by themselves\u201d about hot button social and political issues and highlighted his previous calls for regulation from the government to supplant</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42715339668</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-13W1-F07F-8039-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"635\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Daily Beast</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican from Missouri, in his Capitol Hill office. Zuckerberg left the hourlong meeting - one of several with lawmakers on Capitol Hill - without answering questions from a throng of reporters and photographers pursuing him down a hallway.</p><p>Hawley, though, had plenty to say. \"The company talks a lot. I'd like to see some action,\" he told reporters. \"I will believe Facebook when I see some real action out of Facebook.\"</p><p>Rather than moving users' personal data from properties such as WhatsApp and Instagram to the core Facebook platform, the company should put a wall around the services or, better yet, sell them off, Hawley said he told Zuckerberg.</p><p>Zuckerberg, who requested the meeting, \"did not think that was a great idea,\" he said.</p><p>Zuckerberg \"had a good, constructive meeting with President Trump at the White House today,\" a Facebook spokesman said. On Facebook and Twitter, Trump posted a photo with the caption, \"Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook in the Oval Office today.\"</p><p>No details were given on the meeting, first reported by the Axios website.</p><p>Trump has persistently criticized social media companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and his platform of choice, Twitter, embracing conservative critics' accusations that they censor religious, anti-abortion and politically conservative views. Trump has claimed, without evidence, that the companies are \"against me\" and even suggested U.S. regulators should sue them on grounds of anti-conservative bias.</p><p>A Facebook spokesman declined to comment on Hawley's remarks concerning his meeting with Zuckerberg.</p><p>The popular services WhatsApp and Instagram are among some 70 companies that Facebook has acquired over the past 15 years or so, giving it what critics say is massive market power that has allowed it to snuff out competition.</p><p>Zuckerberg's discussion with Hawley touched on industry competition, data privacy legislation, election security and accusations by conservatives that Facebook and other social media giants are biased against right-leaning content.</p><p>During his visit, Zuckerberg also met with other senators including Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mike Lee, R-Utah, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, and John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Tom Cotton, R-Ark. He also declined to answer reporters' questions when he left Lee's office earlier in the afternoon.</p><p>Lee's office said the two discussed bias against conservatives on Facebook's platform, regulation of online services, enforcement of antitrust laws in the tech industry and data privacy issues.</p><p>Congress has been debating a privacy law that could sharply rein in the ability of companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to collect and make money off users' personal data. A national law, which would be the first of its kind in the U.S., could allow people to see or prohibit use of their data.</p><p>Acting preemptively, Zuckerberg last spring called for tighter regulations to protect consumers' data, control harmful online content and ensure election integrity and data portability. The internet \"needs new rules,\" he said.</p><p>It was Zuckerberg's first public visit to Washington since he testified before Congress last spring about privacy, election interference and other issues.</p><p>Facebook, a social media giant based in Menlo Park, California, with nearly 2.5 billion users, is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators following a series of privacy scandals and amid accusations of abuse of its market power to squash competition.</p><p>The Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee are all conducting antitrust investigations of the big tech companies, and a bipartisan group of state attorneys general has opened a competition probe specifically of Facebook.</p><p>At Facebook's request, Warner helped organize a dinner meeting in Washington on Wednesday night for Zuckerberg and a group of senators.</p><p>Warner told The Associated Press he wanted Zuckerberg to hear his Senate colleagues' \"enormous concerns about privacy and about protecting the integrity of our political system.\"</p><p>Their message for the Facebook chief was \"self-regulation is not going to be the answer,\" Warner said. \"I think Zuckerberg understood that.\"</p><p>Warner and Hawley have proposed legislation that would force the tech giants to tell users what data they're collecting and how much it's worth. The proposal goes to the heart of Big Tech's hugely profitable business model of commerce in users' personal data. The companies gather vast data on what users read and like, and leverage it to help advertisers target their messages to individuals they want to reach.</p><p>The tech companies view with particular alarm a separate legislative proposal from Hawley that would require them to prove to regulators that they're not using political bias to filter content. Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean a social media platform loses its long-held immunity from legal action.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNTRCT-6473154</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNTRCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X38-85Y1-F0C5-X04B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313958</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"903\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The East Bay Times (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
