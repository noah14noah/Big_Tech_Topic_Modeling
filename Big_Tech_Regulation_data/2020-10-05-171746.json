down under if a proposed law is approved.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earlier this month, Facebook had warned local politicians it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-marketing/socialmedia/facebook-block-news-australia-347438\">would prevent Facebook users in Australia from sharing local and international news</url>, if Australia presses ahead with new legislation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Australia is proposing new laws that will require companies such as Facebook, to pay media outlets for the use of their news content.</p><h>Blunt warning</h><p>Facebook's warning to Australian users had been made by Will Easton, MD of Facebook Australia &amp; New Zealand in a hard hitting and blunt <url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2020/08/changes-to-facebooks-services-in-australia/\">blog post</url>.</p><p>Easton said that Australia was drafting a new regulation that \"misunderstands the dynamics of the internet and will do damage to the very news organisations the government is trying to protect.\"</p><p>Easton accused the commission overseeing the process of ignoring important facts, and the law \"defies logic and will hurt, not help, the long-term vibrancy of Australia's news and media sector.\"</p><p>Facebook's Easton also said the proposed law was effectively bad legislation.</p><p>Google has also expressed its opposition to this Australia legislation and used its search web page in Australia to warn local users that it would harm their ability to search.</p><h>Blunt response</h><p>But Australian officials had an equally blunt response to Facebook's managing director in Australia and New Zealand, telling Facebook \"'it's their call' to block

Australia's top antitrust regulator as saying on Thursday that Facebook will be \"weakened\" if it stops Australians from sharing news so the company can avoid paying for content.</p><p>\"It would be a shame for Australian democracy (and) it would be a shame for Facebook users if they took that course of action,\" ACCC Chair Rod Sims reportedly said in a speech delivered via Zoom.</p><p>\"It would also weaken Facebook, so it's their call,\" he added. \"If people can't get their news from Facebook then they'll go elsewhere to get their news.\"</p><p>Sims said no model to solve this problem had been effective so far.</p><p>Sims reportedly said Australia's plan was not a tax on Big Tech or a subsidy for other companies, saying it was \"a question of addressing a market power imbalance and one that matters to the future of our society\".</p><p>\"If you had a competitive market you wouldn't need this,\" he said.</p><p>If Facebook quit news sharing in Australia to avoid the law, the company \"may get something worse\" elsewhere, Sims reportedly added.</p><h>European battle</h><p>In April this year Google was instructed by the French competition authority to <url

But will Canada follow?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After an 18-month landmark study, the final report from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on regulating big platforms and encouraging media competition was released in July. It didn't get a lot of attention outside the country initially, but it is a watershed moment for consumers in the digital era as global regulators are examining whether it provides a blueprint for the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is one of the first instances where an independent regulator is looking at antitrust and competition law through the lens of consumer protection regarding digital platforms and the publishing industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google and Facebook are responsible for more than 70 per cent of all digital advertising, with traditional publishers and others struggling for the remaining piece of the market. That has left a hole in local news, not just in Australia, but in other countries including Canada.</p><p>\"This is the first time we've seen really a credible, independent, non-industry panel really examine the media implications and what it will cost the economy,\" says John Hinds, CEO of News Media Canada, which represents Canadian newspapers.</p><p>\"This isn't something that can be regarded as a partisan report by the industry or something that is politicized,\" Hinds said. \"It's looking at how the big platforms are affecting consumers and the economy through a very practical lens.\"</p><p>The sweeping 632-page report comes with 23 recommendations, including methods to ensure there is enough competition in the market, to determine if there is sufficient transparency in the prices charged for advertising and to require platforms to develop a code of conduct to make sure news businesses are treated fairly. News businesses would also be given notifications about any changes to algorithms that would affect news rankings on websites.</p><p>Other recommendations include taxpayer funding for local news and allowing donations for non-profit organizations engaging in public interest journalism to be tax deductible. The digital platforms have three months to respond to the report. The Australian government has said it will have a response to the report by the end of the year.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Canadian Competition Bureau said the bureau was aware of the Australian initiative to investigate digital platforms, but would not confirm whether it was considering a similar study.</p><p>\"As you know, the bureau closely follows the developments of investigations by our international counterparts while remaining mindful of the different legal regimes in each jurisdiction,\" said spokesperson Jayme Albert in a statement to the Star. \"The bureau continues to closely monitor firms in the digital economy to ensure they do not engage in anti-competitive conduct.\"</p><p>Local news has become an endangered species, with many smaller newspapers disappearing in the face of digital disruption. New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet said \"the greatest crisis in American journalism is the death of local news\" at an International News Media Association (INMA) conference. Baquet predicted that \"most local newspapers in America are going to die in the next five years, except for the ones that have been bought by a billionaire.\"</p><p>INMA, whose board of directors includes Torstar publisher John Boynton, considers and shares global strategies for media growth.</p><p>A study released in June by the organization found that Google alone made $4.7 billion (U.S.) in 2018 from publishers through advertising linked to its search engine.</p><p>Google has denied that figure, but there's no doubt that the search engine along with Facebook takes the lion's share of the digital advertising market.</p><p>Big tech has been under major regulatory scrutiny this year, not just for the impact on legacy media, but on privacy and antitrust issues.</p><p>Facebook was recently fined $5 billion by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over privacy breaches in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The U.S. Justice Department has also launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into the platforms, and the European Commission in July said it was launching an antitrust investigation into the activities of Amazon. Lawmakers in the U.S. have introduced bipartisan legislation (the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act) looking at how the newspaper industry can reach an agreement with the platforms for a share of the advertising revenue, giving them a four-year window to come up with a deal.</p><p>But while the European Union and the U.S. have launched aggressive investigations into the big digital platforms, other countries, including Canada, have taken more of a wait-and-see approach. Part of the reasoning may have been that the bigger jurisdictions have greater resources to deal with the world's biggest companies.</p><p>Not so for Australia. The country of 25 million, compared to Canada's 37 million, is not only less populated, but has a smaller economy (13th largest in the world by GDP, compared to Canada's, which is 10th). But it has decided to tackle the issue head on.</p><p>\"Australia, like Canada, are commodity-based economies with large land masses that are facing similar issues in regard to disruption,\" said Mihkel Tombak, Hatch professor of technology management and strategy at the University of Toronto and an antitrust expert.</p><p>\"Canada, though, has historically been more passive and sometimes waiting for other people to take the lead. This could either be a lack of self-confidence, or maybe it's the smart thing to do. Let them experiment first and see what works.\"</p><p>Albert said the Canadian Competition Bureau was \"unable to confirm\" whether it was investigating \"any specific matters with regard to the publishing industry, as the Bureau is required by law to conduct work confidentially.\"</p><p>News Media Canada's Hinds says he has been in touch with the bureau to try and arrange a meeting to determine next steps.</p><p>\"A lot of the discussion around media is about democracy and privacy. But the Competition Bureau can look at the issue through the lens of a tangible economic perspective and that's certainly what we want,\" Hinds said. \"What the Australian example is telling us is that while everyone is looking for a silver bullet, this is an incredibly complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach.\"</p><p>What the Australian Competition Bureau didn't do was recommend the breakup of the large platforms, although it did recommended changes that would force companies to inform regulators about the impact mergers would have on competition.</p><p>\"You don't necessarily want to discourage them from innovating or growing bigger, but what you want to do is to stop them from behaving badly so it stops other people from growing and innovating,\" U of T's Tombak said. \"But the important thing is that the Australians are taking this very seriously.\"</p><p>One way to regulate transnational companies with global reach might be the formation of an international competition authority, similar to the World Trade Organization, Tombak said.</p><p>\"It's been talked about before. But maybe now is the time, given the rise of these major digital platforms, that you need a competition regulator with more clout.\"</p><p>In July, competition authorities of the G7 countries and the European Commission released a common understanding agreement highlighting challenges faced by regulators in the digital economy. It's not quite the formation of a transnational competition bureau, but it's a recognition that more needs to be done.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019081955374062</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WVG-H4V1-JBTY-W00N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1258\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 19, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Morrison said the unit would get A$26.9m ($27m) in funding to undertake a series of inquiries, \"starting with the supply of online advertising and ad-tech services.\"</p><p>The ACCC\"s Digital Platforms report, focused primarily on Google and Facebook, whom it said accounted for 71c of every dollar spent on digital advertising in Australia. There was a risk that the pair\"s market dominance in digital advertising was undermining media\"s ability to deliver quality news, which it saw as critical to the effective functioning of democracy, the watchdog said.</p><p>It also raised concerns in a range of other areas including privacy, and Google and Facebook\"s closely held algorithms and what it saw as general lack of transparency that made it hard for advertisers to gauge if they were getting \"value for money.\"</p><p>If Facebook and Google can\"t reach a voluntary code agreement in negotiations led by ACCC chairman Rod Simms, they could have to spill their ad algorithm secrets, and be compelled to share revenue from ads around content uploaded by media to the likes of Google-owned YouTube - effectively compelling Google and Facebook to pay for news content.</p><p>A proposed tightening of privacy laws would mean people will have to receive notifications about what data is being collected about them and how it\"s being used, and would give them the right to erase it.</p><p>\"The companies are on \u00adnotice,\" said Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who announced the reforms along with Morrison and Communications Minister Paul Fletcher.</p><p>\"The government is not \u00admessing around, we will not hesitate to act.\"</p><p>However, some Big Tech critics were disappointed that the status quo would last for at least another year as the voluntary code negotiations dragged on.</p><p>And while most of the ACCC\"s reforms were adopted, Morrison\"s government did not take up a suggestion for tax-breaks to encourage philanthropic support for journalism, nor a recommendation for a mandatory code that would require digital platforms to detect and take down copyright-protected content.</p><p>Google and Facebook both said they support greater competition and will work closely with the ACCC.</p><p>\"We support a sustainable news ecosystem which is why we work with publishers to help them reach new audiences,\" Mia Garlick, director of policy, Australia and New Zealand at Facebook, said in an emailed statement.</p><p>Aussie govt on front-foot, NZ on back-foot</p><p>The Digital Platforms reforms come in parallel to other enforcement action, which in general has contrasted with a more back-foot stance on this side of the Tasman.</p><p>The ACCC recently filed a Federal Court case against Google, alleging it misled consumers into thinking they had disabled location-tracking - when, in fact, the search-ad giant was still able to track every move they made. Here, the ComCom is keeping a watching brief.</p><p>The Australian government passed a tough new law in the wake of the Christchurch mosque massacres, allowing social media platforms to be fined up to 10 per cent of their revenue or their executives jailed for up to three months if they fail to remove \"abhorrent violent material expeditiously.\"</p><p>And a \"Google tax\" crackdown on profit-shifting was implemented across the Tasman while our government is still weighing whether or not to introduce a similar measure.</p><p>Wait - a hint of front-foot</p><p>But our government did go on the front foot yesterday as NZ First leader and Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters cited the social media giants\" \"suffocating\" effect on New Zealand media companies as he throw his support behind NZME\"s renewed bid to buy Stuff.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-12293410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR7-PKM1-DYTJ-62HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 13, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\">Australia's competition watchdog is poised to call for far-reaching new regulations on Facebook, Google and other tech giants which could have global ramifications for how they make money and choose the content people consume.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's recommendations, if confirmed, would be among the strongest yet in a drive to rein in the power of digital behemoths amid a host of worldwide concerns ranging from anti-trust issues to privacy abuse, and their role in spreading disinformation and hateful content.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Following an 18-month inquiry into the power of digital platforms, the ACCC is due to issue its final report by June 30.</p><p>It is expected to include proposals for sweeping controls over tech companies' handling of personal data and their use of \"opaque\" algorithms to rank how they display advertisements, search results and content.</p><p>In a 328-page preliminary report issued in December, the ACCC had raised alarm over the \"substantial\" market power wielded by the likes of Google and Facebook, and notably the \"lack of transparency\" in their operations.</p><p>\"We are at a critical point in considering the impact of digital platforms on society,\" said the report, initiated by the conservative government at the behest of Australia's main media organisations.</p><p>The report focused particular attention on the huge impact Google and Facebook have had on Australia's news industry, with the number of newspaper and online journalists falling more than 20 percent since 2014 as digital advertising revenues were overwhelmingly captured by the two tech titans.</p><p>\"While the ACCC recognises their significant benefits to consumers and businesses, there are important questions to be asked about the role the global digital platforms play in the supply of news and journalism in Australia,\" it said.</p><p>A set of preliminary proposals set out in the report, many of which are expected to figure in the final conclusions, include greater regulation over the handling of personal data, similar to Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduced last year.</p><p>It also called for new penalties for invasion of privacy and greater controls on merger and acquisition activity by the biggest digital firms.</p><p>- Growing power of Big Tech -</p><p>One of its most radical suggestions is the creation of an Algorithm Review Board to monitor the complex formulae used to deliver advertisements, and rank news content and referral services to news media.</p><p>The ACCC said such a regulator was needed to ensure the big digital players do not \"favour their own business interests, through their market power and presence across multiple markets\".</p><p>\"There are also issues with the role of digital platforms in determining what news and information is accessed by Australians, how this information is provided, and its range and reliability.\"</p><p>ACCC chairman Rod Sims has said regulatory authorities in the United States, Britain, Europe and other areas are closely monitoring the outcome of the Australian inquiry as they all mull possible responses to the growing power of tech titans.</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government has already taken controversial steps targeting Big Tech, including introducing criminal penalties for executives of social media companies which permit the distribution of violent content on their platforms and an unprecedented law forcing tech firms to help security services break encrypted communications.</p><p>Tech companies have warned that enacting many of the ACCC's proposed recommendations would be impractical, or lead firms to simply avoid doing business in Australia.</p><p>\"We obviously need really clear rules for the internet that protect privacy, safety, the economic and social benefits of technology while also protecting competition and innovation,\" said Sunita Bose, head of the DIGI lobbying group formed by Google, Facebook, Twitter and other firms to deal with Australian regulators.</p><p>But, in an interview with Nine media newspapers ahead of the ACCC release, Bose cautioned that some of the watchdog's recommendations, on top of the government's earlier measures, could not only hurt the big players but have an even greater impact on start-ups and smaller firms with limited resources to meet new regulatory demands.</p><p>She warned in particular against attempts to monitor and regulate algorithms, which she said \"constitute highly sensitive commercial information\".</p><p>\"The prospect of having to disclose such sensitive information will serve as a deterrent to global digital companies and start-ups initiating or expanding their operations in Australia,\" she said.</p><p>Facebook</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It is expected to include proposals for sweeping controls over tech companies' handling of personal data and their use of \"opaque\" algorithms to rank how they display advertisements, search results and content.<br/> In a 328-page preliminary report issued in December, the ACCC had raised alarm over the \"substantial\" market power wielded by the likes of Google and Facebook, and notably the \"lack of transparency\" in their operations.<br/> \"We are at a critical point in considering the impact of digital platforms on society,\" said the report, initiated by the conservative government at the behest of Australia's main media organisations.<br/> The report focused particular attention on the huge impact Google and Facebook have had on Australia's news industry, with the number of newspaper and online journalists falling more than 20 per cent since 2014 as digital advertising revenues were overwhelmingly captured by the two tech titans.<br/> \"While the ACCC recognises their significant benefits to consumers and businesses, there are important questions to be asked about the role the global digital platforms play in the supply of news and journalism in Australia,\" it said.<br/> Possible proposals A set of preliminary proposals set out in the report, many of which are expected to figure in the final conclusions, include greater regulation over the handling of personal data, similar to Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduced last year. It also called for new penalties for invasion of privacy and greater controls on merger and acquisition activity by the biggest digital firms.<br/> One of its most radical suggestions is the creation of an Algorithm Review Board to monitor the complex formulae used to deliver advertisements, and rank news content and referral services to news media.<br/> The ACCC said such a regulator was needed to ensure the big digital players do not \"favour their own business interests, through their market power and presence across multiple markets. There are also issues with the role of digital platforms in determining what news and information is accessed by Australians, how this information is provided, and its range and reliability.\"<br/> ACCC chairman Rod Sims has said regulatory authorities in the United States, Britain, Europe and other areas are closely monitoring the outcome of the Australian inquiry as they all mull possible responses to the growing power of tech titans.<br/> Taking on Big Tech Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government has already taken controversial steps targeting Big Tech, including introducing criminal penalties for executives of social media companies which permit the distribution of violent content on their platforms and an unprecedented law forcing tech firms to help security services break encrypted communications.<br/> Tech companies have warned that enacting many of the ACCC's proposed recommendations would be impractical, or lead firms to simply avoid doing business in Australia.<br/> \"We obviously need really clear rules for the internet that protect privacy, safety, the economic and social benefits of technology while also protecting competition and innovation,\" said Sunita Bose, head of the DIGI lobbying group formed by Google, Facebook, Twitter and other firms to deal with Australian regulators.<br/> But, in an interview with Nine media newspapers ahead of the ACCC release, Bose cautioned that some of the watchdog's recommendations, on top of the government's earlier measures, could not only hurt the big players but have an even greater impact on start-ups and smaller firms with limited resources to meet new regulatory demands.<br/> She warned in particular against attempts to monitor and regulate algorithms, which she said \"constitute highly sensitive commercial information\". \"The prospect of having to disclose such sensitive information will serve as a deterrent to global digital companies and start-ups initiating or expanding their operations in Australia,\" she said.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSLIN-n11053700</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSLIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDS-0KS1-JBYT-H296-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Line</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 24, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

information is accessed by Australians, how this information is provided, and its range and reliability.\"</p><p>ACCC chairman Rod Sims has said regulatory authorities in the United States, Britain, Europe and other areas are closely monitoring the outcome of the Australian inquiry as they all mull possible responses to the growing power of tech titans.</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government has already taken controversial steps targeting Big Tech, including introducing criminal penalties for executives of social media companies which permit the distribution of violent content on their platforms and an unprecedented law forcing tech firms to help security services break encrypted communications.</p><p>Tech companies have warned that enacting many of the ACCC's proposed recommendations would be impractical, or lead firms to simply avoid doing business in Australia.</p><p>\"We obviously need really clear rules for the Internet that protect privacy, safety, the economic and social benefits of technology while also protecting competition and innovation,\" said Sunita Bose, head of the DIGI lobbying group formed by Google, Facebook, Twitter and other firms to deal with Australian regulators.</p><p>But, in an interview with Nine media newspapers ahead of the ACCC release, Bose cautioned that some of the watchdog's recommendations, on top of the government's earlier measures, could not only hurt the big players but have an even greater impact on start-ups and smaller firms with limited resources to meet new regulatory demands.</p><p>She warned in particular against attempts to monitor and regulate algorithms, which she said \"constitute highly sensitive commercial information\".</p><p>\"The prospect of having to disclose such sensitive information will serve as a deterrent to global digital companies and startups initiating or expanding their operations in Australia,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: -- they worked together from ATF, FBI and the local law enforcement. And they really -- I think in a nature tracked this down rather quickly because it was a difficult situation to deal with. I feel for all those in Austin, how scared they must have been in the process but I think they're taking a right approach, how they approached them but also from the standpoint of making sure they are correct, there's nothing else out there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCCARTHY: And learn more as it goes on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. I mean, at this point they're saying look, stay vigilant, we don't know the motive, we don't know if this individual did this alone or if there are others involved.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes. And you don't know -- I think when they get to their house, looking through it, I don't know if it's going to be booby trap but they'll have much more information. That's interesting if there's not somebody else involved in these type of situations. So, we'll have to look and see.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me move on and ask you about the spending bill, what you're working on this week. We'll we see a government shutdown? It appears you've agreed on a top line number but are going through details, where are we?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, you know, the last battle was really the big battle because the battle was always for about and what funding will we go the future with. Military needs the resource and this is going to be the greatest increase for the military in about the last decade because they needed the increase of where we're going. You get a pay raise for the troops but importantly, the investment that has been cut for so many years to keep us up especially when you looking at North Korea, Russia, and others, we have to be able to make that investment going forward. It's just finishing up the details. I believe we'll finish today, post something and then be able to vote in the next day or two.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about that because Reuters is reporting that it will include nearly $1.6 billion for border security. Is that true?</p><p>MCCARTHY: I believe at the end of the day no final details but that's a -- that's what we put in prior when we pass the appropriation bills and 1.6 is the number I would like to see. The President had made another offer. I mean, this is where the President is trying to solve this DACA situation. Think about how many times he has reached out to the Democrats and I think he found some common ground but then again they said no, he would extend out DACA for a number of years. If you finish the border security. The Democrats said they did not want to do that but I give the President great deal amount of credit to try and to solve this issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why don't they want to do it? I mean, the truth is is that he put a deal on the table that was even better than they were initially asking for.</p><p>MCCARTHY: It was. He is looking for border security and making sure that you don't come back to this two years from now but he extended it further for the number of individuals to be able to go there. If I were the Democrats knowing what they want, I would have taken that deal. Sometimes I wonder some of them want to just keep a problem out there. Almost make it political instead of solving a problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Going into the midterms they want something to attack the President on.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Let me ask you about the opioid spending because the last time we were talking about a spending bill there was a lot of complaints and criticism about too much spending. I recognize you need to give to get in terms of the military but is it including 2.8 billion in opioid spending and what are other spending that perhaps you're going to have to swallow as a result of getting what you need for the military?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Look, the main reason we are -- where we currently are because it takes 60 votes in the Senate. So, if we didn't have to have that, we would be in a different situation. But if you wanted to be able about to plus up the military, actually bring the military back, think about how many planes are not able about to fly, think about the number of military men and women who have actually died in accidents just in the last year. So we all knew we had to have that investment, but to get the investment in the military, the Democrats held us to appoint that we had to invest domestically. But think about where we put that domestic money. We're putting almost three billion into opioids, we're putting a number of billion into infrastructure and that's the part that we've been working out directing with. In the last Congress we had the CARA bill dealing with the opioid but you're having almost 175 people a year die, brother and sisters from the standpoint of -- for this opioid epidemic and it's got to stop.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. Let me -- let me switch gears and ask you about the trade restraints that we're expecting to come out of this White House tomorrow. What can you tell us about these measures? There's been a lot of criticism and upset over the aluminum and steel tariffs. Now we understand that the White House will come up with tariffs on imports of at least $30 billion and also restrictions in terms of Chinese investments in the United States.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, I actually think this is where the President is correct looking at China, looking at the intellectual property. The -- what they have been one stealing from America, what they've been going in in buying and taking back to China dealing with military, dealing with technology and others. I think it's an area that you're going to get a get a lot of agreement on. And when you look at the steel and aluminum, remember, the President gave flexibility on that. So, what was first brought out and what ended up at the end of the day when we get the majority of our steel from Canada, that had an exemption in it as well. So, I think what you'll find coming out, there will be an opportunity but I think he is correct about looking at what China has been doing and what China has been stealing from America. I think you're going to find other countries join in with us as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The President said that he wants to open this up to industry. He wants to hear from companies in terms of what products should be really targeted most. How will that process take place?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, he will lay out the framework coming forward but I think this is a positive aspect. He's not just going in and saying one-size- fits-all. He wants to listen to individuals and then go out and lead and make sure it's right. It's correct to have this challenge with China. We don't want to get into a trade war but what we have watched China do over a number of years, they use from state control going in and buying companies bringing the technology back to China, they stole a number of different intellectual properties from numerous companies and it's not just in one field, it will go down to agriculture, it will go into all different aspects. So I think standing up and putting a different perspective on this will turn out to be a very positive aspect.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because people get this particularly industry because when you want to have business in China sell to the 1.3 billion people. China forces you to give up the technology to a do so, right? And then you can't even have an ownership of anything, full ownership, it's a joint venture and you only own 49 percent.</p><p>MCCARTHY: They have you come in 49 percent, they learn what you're doing and a few short years they kick you away and they have it all. And they come in numerous times what we've watched and be able to leapfrog of taking the technology and not paying for it. I think it has to stop. People have to respect intellectual property that people invest in and I think that's one of the greatest strengths of America but you're not going to out innovating if they keep stealing the property.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So do you want to see a reciprocal situation there whereas China can't out-and-out acquire companies here that it's 49 percent joint venture. I mean, is that the kind of a reciprocal situation that may come out of this?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, I don't want to see just one size fits all.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>MCCARTHY: But I want something to be fair in the process. And the other aspect you look at there's other things that happen with this. As the President stands up to China, China realizes they've done something wrong and now they're finding standing up to North Korea. It's changing the outcome of other aspects. The reason North Korea is coming to the stable, wanted a sanction but I think a part of what -- how the President led not only here but standing up tough to China at the same time and realize there is a new sheriff in town and the world is going to be a little different in this administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. It's true. Let me ask you about the number here because The Washington Post is saying, look, this is $60 billion in imports. The Wall Street Journal is saying $30 billion in imports. Do you have any sense? What is the real number?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, I think if the President is going to sit and listen to the industry, I don't think anybody has the number I get. So people will throw numbers out there but if he's going to sit and listen to the industry which I think he should do, takes their input and let's put the very best plan forward, that's a good way going about handling it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know for a long time, China has certain industries that are off limits, it doesn't matter who it is. If a foreigner comes in, wants to acquire defense company in China, it's not going to happen. Same with financial services, should we have industries that are off limits?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, I think there are certain areas we should look about off limits and that is stealing the technology especially if it's going into military and others. And when you look at these mergers and acquisitions that China has been doing, state run, going in and stealing these different things, to me, that is an aspect that we really have to look seriously (INAUDIBLE) be able to do it but I think we have to take a new approach.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The President has also talked about a phase two of the tax plan, he referred to that, that with Kevin Brady recently. Will Democrats really get onboard with the phase two of cutting taxes?</p><p>MCCARTHY: They didn't get onboard with phase one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Remember, they said this will be armageddon that the bonuses were crumbs but think about how much this tax plan has done. 1.2 million Americans got a longer maternity leave in one company. Millions of Americans got bonuses, there are electrical bill, here we are going to have snow coming, it's actually lower because they passed on the tax cuts in the utility companies. But Democrats still said no, they came out with their own plan. They want to raise taxes if they were able to take the majority. So, I think it's smart. All the benefit that we had where you have unemployment at a new low, I think it's smart that we look at another tax plan going forward to be -- have more tax cuts be able to move this economy and growth. If you really want to get out of this debt, yes, you have to curve the spending in government but you have to grow the economy. You will not get out of this problem without growth. And look at all conversations that you had, we're finally getting back to three percent growth. Something we didn't see in the last eight years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY: It's a new administration, it's a new opportunity for America and I think it's the beginning of America's comeback.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you want to see in phase two? Would that be making the individual cuts permanent? Would that be another cut on small businesses. What specifically would you like to see in phase two?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, of course I want to see the individuals made permanent. But like any big bill when you go through it, there are going to be other aspects that you didn't think about. Let's see where we need to go there. Let's see how this bill has transferred and changed the economy because there are places we missed. Let's listen to the economy and let's go back and analyze that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'll tell you, now we're talking about four percent growth, potentially in this year or perhaps in '19. Do you worry that any of this growth story which obviously is a big reason coming from the tax plan is going to get impacted by these tariffs. I mean, that's the worry that in fact if you were to pull these aluminum and steel tariffs in place which are supposed to get implement beginning this week, Friday that maybe takes away from some of this growth.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, I'm worried about doing anything that's harming this growth going forward and that's why I was happy that the President had some exemptions in there especially when it comes to our allies and others.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a big part of the story.</p><p>MCCARTHY: I mean, China makes the most aluminum and the most steel but that's not where we buy it from. And they're subsidizing it. So is there another way of going about doing it, not harming our allies? And I think that's the way the exemptions should be moved through but I'm nervous about what happens to this economy. Yes, we are growing, we don't want to harm or slow it down but I also think we have to stand up to China in what they've been doing, that's why I don't think one across the board position works, that's why listening to the industry is probably a very smart way to handle it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You say China makes the most terms of aluminum and steel. That's the overcapacity issue, right? So they produce it and then they just put it into the global marketplace, maybe we get the most from Canada but that doesn't mean ultimately it came from China.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Because they'll do the raw material, they'll supply it. Government subsidizes it and able to send it out. And what we've watched but you also see a number of jobs lower down manufacturing have a great deal amount of jobs that utilize that steel to make a product. And you want to make sure those o jobs continue growing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, I got to ask about Facebook, let's talk about that, the mining controversy. The stock is down again this morning, Facebook officials could meet with aides from the House Judiciary Committee as early as today. We're told CEO Mark Zuckerberg expected to address his staff on Friday. Company coming under fire after Cambridge Analytica allegedly misused private information for more than 50 million Facebook users during the 2016 elections. We spoke with Chris Collins earlier, your colleague from New York and he was pretty adamant in terms of what he is expecting. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. CHRIS COLLINS (R), NEW YORK: I'm confident you will see new legislation coming out and/or the enforcement where it belongs, the FTC will be coming down on them, so that it's more evident for someone that you're checking a box it's OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What should be done here? What can Congress do at this point?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Well, Congress can do a lot of things but I don't want to Congress to overreact without having all the information. First thing I want Congress to do is learn everything that happened. But this is a technology that's continued to grow. This is where a lot of people get their information even though it may not be true information. So what roles do we see that should change in there? The first thing that has to happen is Facebook needs to come and talk to Congress, they need to answer the questions. And after we get all the information, we should see what's appropriate and what's appropriate for the future for the individual going forward. But people you sponsoring ads. Do people know who is paying for these ads? People are putting misinformation out there and utilizing Facebook to disrupt the election process. People have to understand that and there may be safeguards that we have to deal with but I don't want to prejudge without having all the information.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm not -- I'm not surprised that the political part of this story uses and mines all of this data. Isn't that what happened during the election of Barack Obama when he was masterful in terms of mining data and figuring out where potential voters were.</p><p>MCCARTHY: You know what? They were so good, they put it out there for people to see and they sold it around the world for other campaigns to use. The U.K. used it in the process. They were the ones that pretty much started this. And the difference was, the valley was very excited to help Barack Obama. It's a different aspect now but we want to make sure that your privacy is protected but every action you take on Facebook, if you like something, somebody can mine that, right? If you put up from some emotion or some campaign you want to support, people mine that and know which direction you're going. I don't know that that's wrong but we want to make sure people understand that and know that going in that your privacy is protected but also your actions are known.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I would imagine today given the powerful position and influence that these companies have, you have to look at this.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Oh, by far. We have to seriously look at this because Facebook is more than a place that somebody goes to post their pictures of their family vacation, right? Now people are getting their news from it, they're posting content on it. And they can't sit there and live in today's world with the laws that they had in the past. I think you have to modernize and you have to apply the traditions to a changing future at the same time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congressman, great information from this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And it's great that you're working through this snowstorm.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes. Government may be shut down but Congress is not, we will still vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We like it. Thank you. Kevin McCarthy joining us. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Let's get right to the breaking news out of Texas this morning where the suspect in a series of Austin area bombings is now dead after killing himself with an explosive device as police closed in on him. Todd Piro is live on the ground in Round Rock this morning with the very latest. Todd, good morning to you. What can you tell us?</p><p>TODD PIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you. The sun is coming up now, but this really is a continuation of a really long night and even longer month for the individuals behind me here at the scene. ATF, fire department, ambulances, police officers from Austin P.D. and of course the FBI, the scene right behind me is where the 24-year-old suspect blew himself up earlier this morning following what were some amazing events last night. Police had been following a number of leads but in the last 24 to 36 hours, their main person of interest turned into a suspect.</p><p>A lot of that was due to those FedEx packages which had a lot of information in them and on them that cops were able to piece together. They're able to figured out that he was driving a particular car which led them to a hotel where he was staying. Police then surrounded that hotel overnight and were waiting for tactical teams to arrive in order to make the make scene as safe as possible. Car started to drive away, police started follow, the car then stopped as SWAT approached, the suspect blew up the car and died in the blast. That's how we got there but when I spoke with the mayor of Austin earlier, he said it really could not have been done without the help of his community. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE ADLER, MAYOR OF AUSTIN, TEXAS: Our community has rallied, you know, the only job we have was to be a little bit more vigilant, to notice things that were suspicious or out of place. And we were all doing that as a community and I think as the facts coming out the community is going to see that that actually helped resolve this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PIRO: But Maria, while a new day is done and there is a sense of relief here throughout Texas. Two things to keep in mind, one, we do not yet know if the individual, the suspect who died had any accomplices and two, we also don't know if there are any packages out there in the community. So please remain, vigilant if you see something doesn't seem right call the authorities, there are so many of them working on scene right now trying to make sure that we can put this situation behind us. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Todd. Thank you very much. Todd Piro in Texas. Coming up. Former Major League Baseball all-star pitcher Mariano Rivera joins us. He will explain his new role in combating the opioid crisis in America, he is next. Then General Mills beats third-quarter earnings in revenue expectations, due in part the strong demand for snacks in North American. We break down the numbers coming up. And check futures as well. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We just heard from Kevin McCarthy that the Congressional spending bill will include $2.8 billion to battle opioid addiction. Now there's a new tool in the fight against growing crises. For many people opioids are the only thing that can help their physical pain but what if a nondrug would be able to combat that pain? One company has developed a wearable ultrasound that treats chronic and acute pain.</p><p>One of the greatest pitchers in baseball history is a supporter, joining us right now is Brian Murphy, NanoVibronix CEO and Mariano Rivera, former Major League all-star pitcher. Good to see you, gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>BRIAN MURPHY, CEO, NANOVIBRONIX: Thank you.</p><p>MARIANO RIVERA, FORMER MAJOR LEAGUE ALL-STAR PITCHER: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So Brian, kick us off here, you brought one of the wearables. Can you show us how it works, tell us about it, NanoVibronix.</p><p>MURPHY: It's actually NanoVibronix. We're a medical device company. Recently up listed to NASDAQ. And we employ a technology and all of our products called surface acoustic wave, the technology is basically wearable ultrasound or low-level, low-frequency ultrasound. And we employ at -- into a product called PainShield which provides resolution to pain, the cause of the pain rather than just masking the pain.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see. Mariano, tell us your history with pain, how you got introduced to NanoVibronix.</p><p>RIVERA: Maria, first of all, I mean, I got into this with my friend Paul (Bucker) and I tell you what, I got into this because my wife was have a little back problem and I asked my friend to provide me one of those devices and I was able to use it on her and she got better. But I tell you one thing though, Maria, I wouldn't have this when I was playing baseball. I might would have played another three, four years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. So you -- so you've seen it and used, it works, that's why you're supporting it. I understand you spoken about this with President Trump?</p><p>RIVERA: Definitely I have to (INAUDIBLE) it's -- I mean, the President fighting opioids and this is one of the alternatives. You know, we fight on opioids but we don't have what we're going to do after that, so I mean, the best thing is using a product that is safe and it's handy. So, we have to move towards alternative.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Mariano, you say you would have played another three, four years. That's a lot more stage than you already had. What kind of pain were you experiencing late in your career and what is this product -- what did this product do to help you?</p><p>RIVERA: Well, more so than pain, it's soreness basically, I mean, after your -- in your career and activities, kind of like minimize but once you're more active, you got back pain, knee pain, all kind of pains. And this device is amazing. So I mean, I truly believe that it's something that we can take a look, and start using it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Dagen, jump in here because the truth is is when you're talking about opioids, there is such an addiction that people -- that they get worse -- they get into a worse situation because you take the opioid, you want more and then people have gone on to heroin.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. Because it -- opioids quite frankly are expensive so they turn to other similar drugs. Brian, I want to know though that with this device, what type of pain does it treat that opioids would also be used to treat because there -- when you say pain that is a catchall, a never pain is very different from bone pain, very different from muscle pain. So what kind of pain does this device specifically treat?</p><p>MURPHY: We actually just completed a study, something called trigeminal neuralgia, it's a facial nerve pain that's also called the suicide pain. There is only really two interventions for it. One is opioids and the other is severing the nerve in the face, not good alternatives. The earlier studies showed that it was very effective on treatment, long-term resolution of trigeminal neuralgia. So we figured if we could solve that problem which is the most horrendous type of pain that only opioids can cover up. Everything else is pretty much a walk in the park. Many sports injuries, tennis elbow, should injury, neck injury.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Tendinitis-related pain.</p><p>MURPHY: Exactly. Any soft tissue type of injury.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's incredible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It really is. It's terrific to see the support. Mariano, did you mention this specific product to the President?</p><p>RIVERA: For how (INAUDIBLE) this is a conversation that we need to have, you know, because I mean, that's what we need to move towards. There's equipment that can be helpful and not hurting the people. And that's exactly what we need.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will leave it there. Mariano Rivera, great to have you on the show. Brian Murphy, you as well. Thanks very much for joining us, gentlemen.</p><p>MURPHY: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>RIVERA: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon. Thank you. Coming up. President Trump response to the series of bombings in Austin. His response next. And then Teamsters President, James Hoffa will join me in an exclusive Fox Business interview. He weighs in on the President's trade restraints on China and a lot more. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news this morning, the Austin bombing suspect is dead after a confrontation with police overnight. Authorities say that the 24-year-old male suspect killed himself after detonating an explosive device inside of his car as the police approached the car. Police have not yet uncovered a motive. Adam Shapiro was live at the White House this morning with the latest on how the administration is reacting to this investigation. Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: And a good morning to you, Maria. The President actually tweeted this morning about what's happened in Austin. Let me give you the actual tweet that the President put out, he said, \"AUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD,\" in all capital letters. \"Great job by law enforcement and all concerned.\" Now, remember just yesterday on camera, the President had been talking about what was going on in Austin and the investigation. There were some 500 federal law enforcement personnel working with local law enforcement to try and find the suspect who they believed may be the man they're now identifying. But the President yesterday said, this is obviously a very, very sick individual or maybe individuals. These are sick people and we will get to the bottom of it. We will be very strong.</p><p>So, as you have said, they are trying to make sure there's no one else involved in this. There is a man who is the suspect who is believed to have committed suicide by blowing himself up. And the President has tweeted this morning, \"Great job by law enforcement and all concerned.\" Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Adam, thank you so much, Adam Shapiro. Now, we want to go to the latest in China and the tariff turmoil. President Trump is set to unveil tariffs on Chinese imports by the end of the week as you heard here first, have been reporting that something is coming against China, whether restrictions on trade or tariffs. Reports say now that the price range is between $30 billion and $60 billion of imports. The tariffs are expected to target technology, telecommunications, and intellectual property. This comes just a few days before the controversial steel and aluminum tariffs are set to go into effect. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that China is ready to square off and deliver counter tariffs of its own. Joining me right now in a Fox Business exclusive is International Brotherhood of Teamsters President, James P. Hoffa. James, it's good to have you.</p><p>JAMES P. HOFFA, PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. You're happy with tariffs?</p><p>HOFFA: We are. You know, this is -- we've had tremendous dumping here. We've had 30 steel companies go out of business. We need steel, we need aluminum to have our national security, and this is a deliberate dumping by China, Vietnam, whoever can do it, and they keep sending it here. We've got to stop it, and this is the way to basically level the playing field.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why do you say the dumping is an issue for the unions, for workers, why, explain, connect the dots for us?</p><p>HOFFA: It's very simple. Your 30 companies are out of business. These people have lost their jobs, because of a plan by China to keep dumping their -- they're creating an excess of supply out there, and dumping it here, we've got to stop that. It's protect American jobs, that's what this is about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and the issue though is that we're going to receive retaliation. I mean, there was a speculation earlier that Europe is going to institute a 25 percent tariff. Do you want to get into a trade war?</p><p>HOFFA: Well, you know, the answer is it's going to level out. I think we've got to negotiate with people to say, hey, let's find a way to get this done, whether it's China or whether it's that. This is basically a shot across their bow to say we've got a problem here, you've got to stop. If you stop, we can start working it out, especially with our allies with Germany, France with regard to the U.K. If there is a problem, we're going to put these on you. Let's work backyards and find out how do we solve these problems, but we have to start somewhere. This is a shot across the bow, I think it's a good idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's interesting that you say it's a good idea. Typically, the unions have gone with the Democrats but you like what this President is doing economically.</p><p>HOFFA: He's doing the right thing with regard to the trade. We're also working on NAFTA, we're working on basically the tariffs. These are things that have to be done that no one had the guts to do it. But you go back a little bit, don't forget, I think Reagan did something like that with Harley-Davidson. This has been done before and we need more of this right now. There's a national emergency right now to protect American jobs, right now. We need steel for national security, we need aluminum, we have to have strong, strong companies here, and the way that it's going, we're not going to have any steel companies left. So, this is a beginning of something to save American jobs and to protect national security.</p><p>BARTIROMO: James, let's talk about NAFTA for a moment, you mentioned NAFTA. It's still up in the air, negotiating between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada, what do you want to see? What's most important in terms of a change in the NAFTA legislation?</p><p>HOFFA: Well, the big thing with NAFTA -- you know, Canada, really, is not that much of a problem, because their lifestyle and their standards are basically the same as ours. But when you get to Mexico, you have such a disparity with regard to the standard of living and the wages. It's become a dumping ground and corporations are moving there, building factories, shipping back over here, taking advantage of cheap labor. We've got to stop that, we got to have a strong labor chapter, you have to have stronger unions down there. We've got to change the way it's going down there. It's not happening, we're not seeing -- this is 25 years of NAFTA and we haven't seen their standard of living go up like it has everywhere else. That's what got to be addressed. So, we have to have a strong labor chapter, we've got to do, you know, different things have already been done, we're protecting the border from unsafe Mexican trucks. We're on the right path, and we're working very closely with Ambassador Lighthizer who is doing a great job, and we're going to have a NAFTA we can all be proud of.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you want to see border protection?</p><p>HOFFA: Absolutely. Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, the President is trying to get the money for the border wall but he is facing pushback from the Dems.</p><p>HOFFA: Well, the border wall is something different than basically have unsafe Mexican trucks. But you know, some type of protection, we have to have a border -- I do believe --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- he wants to protect the southern border.</p><p>HOFFA: I do believe we have to have borders. And I think that, you know, I'm not -- I'm not a legal immigration back-and-forth is fine. I don't have any problem with that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And you're not afraid to say it.</p><p>HOFFA: No.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HOFFA: Right. Let's do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about this pension push, school teachers and union members pushing to preserve their pensions after the fate remains unclear and the $1.3-trillion spending bill on Capitol Hill last week, bipartisan committee met for the first time in Washington to address this pension crisis. We know where the money is being spent and where the growth is, and it is in those entitlements.</p><p>HOFFA: Well, that's not really true. We just gave $1.3-trillion gift to big business. I mean, there's a lot of money they just gave away, so they can't say, oh, we don't have any money now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you talking about the tax plan?</p><p>HOFFA: Yes, you shouldn't have given it away. Now, that it's gone, you're saying, oh, my gosh, $1.3 trillion gone.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, they were lowering --</p><p>HOFFA: And so, (INAUDIBLE) there's no money for anybody else. But (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: They lowered corporate taxes to enable corporations to feel there was an environment out there that they could hire more workers. Are you saying you wanted to see the corporate tax rate of 35 percent stay in place? Is that what you're saying, James?</p><p>HOFFA: I would say we should, yes, because these corporations are making - -</p><p>BARTIROMO: You wanted a corporate tax rate of 35 percent?</p><p>HOFFA: These corporations are making billions of dollars. And now, we're going to say we've got to cut the safety net, we got to get rid of Social Security? Do you -- food stamps? Are you kidding me? Are we really that bad we're going to do that to this country? No, let's get back to the pension. The pension issue which you mentioned, that's an important issue. For the first time, Congress is focused on the issue of pension, the pension crisis, we have joint committees set up right now to start working on this problem. Orrin Hatch has made the right comments about what we have to do to address the pension crisis in America, and we're going to have a solution by November, and I'm very proud of what they've done. We've had input into it. We're working with Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, to address this problem. It's a major problem, we need money to fix the problem, the answer is, people can't work 40 years, promised a pension and then pull the rug on them, that's wrong, people deserve pensions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the truth is that these programs are going out of -- I mean, they are -- they are going bankrupt, right? You see Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. Those programs are going bankrupt in the next 15 to 20 years, even less than that.</p><p>HOFFA: Well, if you -- if you give $1.5 trillion away, they'll go bankrupt because there's no money. The answer is you have to fund everything. American is getting grayer, we're going to have more people on Social Security. What are you going to say, we're not going to have Social Security? You'll have a revolution in this country. People have been promised this. I know thousands of people that depend on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. That is what this country is about. They deserve it, it's working, it's one plan that really does work, the check comes every month, it's just right. Let's not disturb that right now, and these (INAUDIBLE) people now that these -- you know, these people are starting to say, oh, we got to get rid of the so-called \"entitlements.\" When they say entitlements, they're talking about Social Security. You want to get rid of Social Security, you have a revolution in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. No, I understand once you give somebody something, it's hard to take it back. But on the corporate tax rate, when you look at a corporate tax rate of 35 percent in America, versus, 13 percent in Ireland, how is that competitive? I mean, how could the U.S. stay at 35 percent corporate rate when all of so many other countries are at such a lower level, that's why you're losing jobs. As a guy who's protecting so many thousands of people's jobs and fighting for the rights of workers, you have to believe that that wasn't competitive.</p><p>HOFFA: I don't believe it. These companies here are making so much money right now. And what did we have, trillions of dollars are offshore. You know, Pfizer has all this money overseas, and all of a sudden, they start bringing it back. They're making money, they know how to get around that. The General Electric with all the billions of dollars they make, they didn't file -- they didn't pay taxes at all. Give me a break.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, I know that. And that's because they had all those loopholes. But this tax plans took all the loopholes out.</p><p>HOFFA: Well, I don't know about that, but they'll find a way. I'm telling you, it was better the other way because we had money in the government. When you take that amount of money out of this system right now, it's basically destroying it, and what does Republicans -- the first thing they say is cut Social Security, that's their answer to everything, get rid of the entitlements.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. So, what do you have to say -- what do you have to say about now three percent economic growth. We were talking about 1-1/2 percent economic growth in the last 10 years. Now, you're talking about three percent partly due to the tax cut plan.</p><p>HOFFA: I hope we have three percent -- I hope we have three percent, four percent, five percent. That's good for America.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It doesn't just come out of a hat, James, it's happening --</p><p>HOFFA: I'm not so sure about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's happening because you're seeing a tax cut plan and anticipation of lower taxes.</p><p>HOFFA: Well, this is awful robust economy right now. It's going very, very strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It sure is partly because of the tax cuts.</p><p>HOFFA: Well, we'll see. We'll see what happens. I can't predict what it's going to be, but I got news for you, three percent, four percent, it's good for America, it's good for everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It sure is. So, do you think that that kind of growth can sustain, if we go on this path and we continue to see job creation, are you expecting that kind of a growth number?</p><p>HOFFA: I don't know. If they put the money back in where there -- what I'm disappointed in, is that all this money is coming back to these corporations and not sharing it with the workers. Right now --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, what about all these thousand-dollar bonuses, James, are you going to call them crumbs?</p><p>HOFFA: Let me tell you a story -- now, let me -- it is crumbs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, come on, give me a break.</p><p>HOFFA: Let me tell you a story. They said Wal-Mart people are going to give $1,000. You got to work there 20 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HOFFA: 20 years. They're not many people who work 20 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not everybody -- not every company who gave out a thousand dollars has any restrictions like that.</p><p>HOFFA: Why didn't they give it to everybody? And now, we're seeing these other things, United Airlines, you have to have perfect attendance. Well, lots of luck. I mean, that's not fair. Give the money back. Share the money. This was supposed to be what they were telling everybody, they're telling the media, oh, we're going to share this money, and now they're putting all these things in, you have to have a raffle, you have to have this, you have to have perfect attendance.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's the average salary of union person today? I know it depends on seniority and all that. Will you come up with a number?</p><p>HOFFA: It depends. We have people making $100,000 --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: $100,000.</p><p>HOFFA: No, it's not average. 75,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. 75,000. So, you're telling me that $75,000 job, they don't want a thousand dollars?</p><p>HOFFA: I'm saying I --</p><p>BARTIROMO: They look at a thousand dollars as crumbs?</p><p>HOFFA: But if they gave it them -- but now they're not. For Disney was supposed to give a thousand dollars, now they put a loophole on, only if you approve the contract. Can you believe they did that? Come on, give the money away. You got it, give it back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Look, you have me at trade, I'm not so sure about the tax plan. I like this conversation, James. It's good to see you.</p><p>HOFFA: Always good to see. Bye-bye.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much, James P. Hoffa joining us there. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Music mogul Jimmy Iovine is stepping back from daily involvement in Apple streaming music business. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with details there, watching this market. Nic, good morning.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. So, it's interesting story because when Apple took over and bought these from $3 billion back in 2014, they accrued all of these great media and music moguls. And now, Jimmy Iovine is the last of the bunch. You know, they already lost Dr. Dre and some of the other executives, Rogers, the Nine Inch Nails frontman, all gone. But here is something about Jimmy Iovine. The thing is that he says now, he wants to spend more time with his family. Well, his shares are fully vested in August, so that's an interesting transition. So, he's moving from his lead role here to a consulting role. He's also brought in things like car-pool karaoke and tried to really make Apple more competitive with Spotify where it's likely to take over Spotify with its U.S.-paid subscribers. You could see Apple is down slightly.</p><p>Then we're taking a look at General Mills. This is under pressure today. There's (INAUDIBLE) full-year forecast. They said that the earnings per share are going to growing up to one percent rather than the prior forecast of three to four percent. This is the parent of Yoplait and Cheerios. They are unveiling cost cuts. The CEO says he's disappointed but the truth of the matter is that they've actually faced rising costs and also seen a sharp increase in freight and transportation and commodity costs. In fact, trucking and railroads have hiked their prices. And for one reason is they just don't have enough drivers, and it's hurting U.S. companies like General Mills. So, General Mills under pressure today, down 8.6 percent. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Nic, thank you so much. Facebook is facing the music right here in Washington as the fallout over Cambridge Analytica grows. Joining us now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney. And Stu, I don't know if you heard my interview with Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, but we talked about when all of this mining of user data started and it was when we were in the beginning of the election of Barack Obama.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, way back, way back when, that's true. Look, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that Facebook is in crisis. Now, that's a very big statement because I think that Facebook is the most important communications company in the world. Facebook and other digital companies are money machines, precisely because they sell personal information about us. Our information is sold by these digital companies, if there are restrictions on digital companies, Facebook in particular, restrictions on how they can sell, what they can sell, if there's any restriction like that, then Facebook ceases to be the juggernaut that it is now. I think they're facing a leadership crisis, where is Zuckerberg? Zuckerberg is the company, it's set up to be basically his company. He runs it any which way he likes, and so far, he said nothing. Now, Axios is reporting that he's going to say something in the next 24 hours. I think that's eagerly awaited. I have no idea what he's going to say, but that's a company in crisis, and that's a very big thing to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we'll say this, Congress wants him here in Washington, and they want to ask him about this, and they want answers before they decide on legislation. But it looks like you know, the bite of the regulation is coming for these companies, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes. And they're facing what may become a class action lawsuit. After all, if they played not fast and loose but if they didn't have full control of the information on these 50 million people which was used by a political dirty tricks company, that's a breaking in their agreement with the FTC, I believe, or the -- whatever it is, some regulatory authority.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The FTC, Stu, you're absolutely right.</p><p>VARNEY: FTC. And that is grounds for a lawsuit. And it could be huge. That's a big deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I know you'll have a lot more on this in 10 minutes. We'll see you at the top of the hour, Stu, thanks. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins every day at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. We've got our panel back, Jon Hilsenrath, Heather is here. We've got additional coverage of the breaking news out of Austin, Texas when we come right back. More details emerging on the bombing suspect. Then, the east coast bracing for another snowstorm, hundreds of flights pre-emptively canceled. The weather forecast on the other side of this break.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The bombing suspect in Austin, Texas is now dead. Lauren Simonetti with all the details in New York. Lauren?</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Maria, police say the suspect was a 24-year-old white male found in the parking lot of a hotel in Round Rock, Texas, just north of Austin. He died after he detonated an explosive device inside his car.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN MANLEY, CHIEF, AUSTIN POLICE DEPARTMENT: As members of the Austin Police Department SWAT team approached the vehicle, the suspect detonated a bomb inside the vehicle, knocking one of our SWAT officers back, and one of our SWAT officers fired at the suspect as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: Police warned people to remain vigilant as they learn more about the suspect's whereabouts over the last 24 hours. Investigators also trying to see if the suspect was working with anybody else. All this comes after a package bomb exploded at a FedEx shipping center near San Antonio yesterday, and another bomb was found inside a package at an Austin FedEx. That device was fortunately intercepted. The four earlier explosions killed two people.</p><p>While severe weather for the east coast today, the region getting pounded with winds, snow, coastal flooding. It's the fourth nor'easter in less than three weeks. The storm, as you can see, already dumping wet snow in Maryland. This bus lost control, slid down an embankment into a creek. Fortunately no students were onboard and the driver is not hurt. Air travel is also crippled, thousands and thousands of flights canceled for today, as well as tomorrow. So, check with the airline if you're headed out somewhere.</p><p>And there's a storm brewing across the Atlantic as well. The European Union is proposing new taxes on big U.S. tech companies that do business in Europe, including Facebook, Alphabet, and Amazon. Under the proposed rules, these companies would pay an additional three percent of revenue from some of their online services there. The upshot is the digital companies could wind up forking over hundreds of millions of euros more in taxes. Now, in order for the proposals to pass, all 28 E.U. countries as well as European Parliament have to agree. The U.S. has already warned against taxes that are aimed at big tech companies.</p><p>Facebook shares in the premarket are now down for the third day in a row, losing over 10 percent of their value in that time. Well, the Federal Reserve widely expected to raise interest rates today. First policy meeting under Fed Chair Jerome Powell. This would also be the first rate hike of the year. Investors looking at if the Fed will raise rates more than the predicted three times this year, of course, Fox Business will have a special coverage of the Fed decision at 2:00 Eastern Time, followed by the first news conference by Jay Powell half an hour after that. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Big news day, Lauren, thank you so much. We've got Jon and Heather with me. We're going to take a quick break and get their thoughts on all of the above. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Final thoughts, Jon Hilsenrath.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Two things: the Fed, Jay Powell is on the stage today. And the other thing is watch trade. There's a lot happening on the trade front, including tariffs on China. I think that could be the market mover today, more than the Fed.</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, VICE PRESIDENT, VISION 4 FUND DISTRIBUTORS: Markets love transparency. Powell is going to give it to him. If he doesn't raise rates, then the markets will sell off.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, good point. Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mark Zuckerberg's New Year's resolution was to fix Facebook. Walk the talk.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good point. Walk the talk. Dagen, thank you. We'll see you again tomorrow, everybody. Here's \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" and Stuart, take it away.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It's not just up to the universities and the startups,\" she said. \"We have to decrease those barriers and increase access.\"</p><p>Entrepreneur William Hurley, the co-founder and CEO of Strangeworks who is also known as Whurley, said new technologies such as 5G need to be more equitably distributed across Austin to avoid a future of \"the technology-haves and the technology-have-nots.\"</p><p>\"It can't be, 'we put it in the rich community because we need it more than the poor community,'\" he said. \"We discriminate greatly in the distribution of access, and we now live in a world where that is the equalizer.\"</p><p>Miss the event? You can watch a video of the entire program <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2020/02/07/austin-in-2040-experts-predict-whats-in-store.html\">here</url>.</p><p>The implications of 5G are broad, and almost every industry will be affected in some way. Telemedicine, for example, may benefit from enhanced imaging and better results from the use of clinical wearables. It's possible doctors will be able to perform remote surgery using wirelessly controlled robots. Autonomous cars will have the system they need to truly be driverless, virtual and augmented reality might flourish and the internet of things will have the backbone it requires.</p><p>Hurley added that more robust capacity for high-speed internet will make telecommuting more common, which could ease the region's traffic woes.</p><p>\"We have a very big tech community here,\" he said. \"There are thousands and thousands and tens of thousands of cars that can be taken off the road, potentially, in Austin if we had that infrastructure.\"</p><p>A more diverse economy - but one that still revolves around tech</p><p>Charisse Bodisch, senior vice president of economic development at the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, said cybersecurity will be one of the most important industries to diversifying the local economy in the coming decades.</p><p>Ideally, a more diverse economy can make Austin the \"last in, first out\" of a future recession.</p><p>\"There's going to be a downturn somewhere,\" she said. \"It doesn't just go into infinity.\"</p><p>Austin has never been a city focused on oil and gas like Houston has been. But Hurley warned that local firms could be hurt by the knockoff effects of oil's decline, citing <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/oil-stocks-are-the-new-tobacco-in-death-knell-phase-says-jim-cramer-2020-01-31\">an argument by CNBC's Jim Cramer last week</url> that oil stocks are beginning to wither as consumer pressures mount - as tobacco stocks once did.</p><p>\"A huge part of our economy is tied to that ... sinking ship,\" Hurley said. \"That doesn't mean we're not going to use any gas for our cars in the next five years. But, as an effect on the economy, it is going to be dramatic and that will hit Austin.\"</p><p>Central Texas' biggest bankruptcy last year happened to come from the energy sector when Austin-based Jones Energy filed for Chapter 11 protection in April. The exploration and production company that owns land in Texas and Oklahoma emerged from the Chapter 11 process a month later after it wiped away $1.09 billion in debt, and in December was lined up to be purchased by an Oklahoma City company for $201.5 million.</p><p>The ordeal underscored that Austin can not only be indirectly impacted by woes in the energy sector, it can take direct hits.</p><p>\"That part of the economy needs to be addressed, and I think Austin should be in the leadership of that,\" Hurley said.</p><p>In true tech fashion, Austin startups are eager to advance the energy industry. Software companies such as Enverus and RigUp are adding 21st century processes to oil and gas businesses, and ventures such as Freedom Solar are growing fast and reducing reliance on natural resources that yield fickle business markets.</p><p>Bodisch said the chamber is eager to diversify Austin's economy by continuing to court tech providers focused on innovating in a variety of industries, not just security. Fintech, biotech, real estate-tech, energy-tech and even food-tech are sectors that excite chamber officials.</p><p>And military-tech is a big one, too, since the Army settled its Army Futures Command here more than a year ago. With a goal of developing smarter soldiers, weapons and defense systems, the Futures Command is <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2020/01/28/6-startups-cozy-up-with-austins-army-futures.html\">already striking partnerships</url> with artificial intelligence startups, local robotics engineers and Austin businesses focused on unmanned vehicles.</p><p>Dan Graham, founder of Notley and former CEO of BuildASign.com, said he expects corporate responsibility to become an increasingly \"existential\" consideration instead of a \"nice to have\"- especially in the consumer packaged goods space - as younger generations grow older and wealthier.</p><p>\"They're beginning to demand those kind of things, those kind of positive impact products and services across the board,\" said Graham, who spends much of his time investing in startups. \"Big companies are making massive changes to how to accommodate that shift in consumer mindset.\"</p><p>Giordano said Austinites need to talk more about equitable access to education, housing, transportation and work.</p><p>\"We'll think about environmental and ecological sustainability - from how we use plastics to what we do about energy,\" she said. \"And we'll have a really significant conversation about how we balance safety and privacy with this increasing need for on-demand delivery that will require sensors, facial recognition and AI tracking us everywhere.</p><p>\"I hope that we attract and grow businesses that are audacious and have a real sense of having a social license to operate,\" she added. \"We're not just going to be good entrepreneurs. We're going to be extraordinary innovators who can show the rest of the world how to solve some of these problems we're going to deal with.\"</p><p>But will there be flying cars?</p><p>Many of the speakers at the 2040 event said they expect drone delivery to proliferate in the next 20 years - something that may have as much of an impact on traffic as telecommuting. As Amazon.com Inc. plots to build <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2020/01/29/pflugerville-paves-way-for-massive-amazon.html\">its biggest distribution facility in the area</url>, one that will be filled with robots and automation, Giordano predicts that the delivery-on-demand trend will remain popular.</p><p>What's less clear is how Central Texans themselves will get around. A growing collection of tech startups, aircraft manufacturers, automakers and investors are betting that fleets of flying taxis will become commonplace - though the timeframe for that is hotly debated.</p><p>Uber is one of the companies at the forefront, going so far as tasking architects in recent years to mock up mini airports that could support such a system. Locally, innovators such as Matt Chasen are rushing to the game with their own version of flying cars. Chasen, who parlayed his success and fortune from the shipping company uShip to start Lift Aircraft, is already test-flying a vehicle that's a mix of a personal helicopter and a drone.</p><p>The more-grounded - literally and figuratively - options for transportation lay in things such as commuter trains, subways and more highway lanes. Later this year, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2020/01/14/multibillion-dollar-transit-plans-unveiled-for.html\">Austinites may be asked</url> to approve billions of dollars for such additions to the transportation network.</p><p>But, as panelists pointed out, the possibility of even traditional transportation improvements boils down to what society is willing to stomach.</p><p>\"The thing that we often overlook is that it's often not a technological problem,\" Hurley said. \"It's regulatory environments, people willing to accept change and things like that.\"</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Now led by a veteran policymaker, it       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.austintech.org/\">launched a new website and membership drive</url> this week to boost its coffers and strengthen the still-young 501(c)6 organization.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The group will be helmed by its first full-time executive director, David Edmonson. He comes to the job with more than a decade of experience working in Texas politics. He previously worked in various roles for Texas state Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston - eventually rising to his deputy chief of staff - and Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso, for whom he worked as general counsel. Edmonson's salary is being paid for by a single seed donation designed to allow the group to hire someone to get it up and running.</p><p>\"This is my day job,\" said Edmonson. \"I am trying to build this organization from the ground up.\"</p><p>Since May, the group's interests have broadened from a focus on ridesharing to other aspects of city policy. In late 2016, the group <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2016/10/26/mikes-take-austin-tech-alliances-new-app-pushes.html\">launched an app focused on local city elections</url> that included brief biographies and position statements for each City Council candidate as well as an overview of the November transportation bond.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://austinstartups.com/austins-codenext-and-why-it-matters-to-tech-729c909312e2#.g260riecv\">In a recent blog post</url>, it began to tackle       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2017/01/30/codenext-first-draft-arrives-amid-critical.html\">the CodeNEXT rewrite of Austin's land use code</url>. \"This is a very dense topic, to put it lightly,\" said Edmonson of CodeNEXT. \"But this is going to be one of the most-significant business issues facing Austin over the next 12 months and it will shape Austin for decades. It is important to talk about what the results could be, especially in terms of the impact it could have on where Austin's tech sector lives, works and plays.\"</p><p>One \"impact\" the group will focus on is affordability. Currently, Austin's tech industry maintains a recruiting edge when it comes to cost of living compared with other tech hubs such as San Jose, Calif., or New York City. Those big tech salaries can go a lot farther in Central Texas. But <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2017/02/03/cost-of-living-index-austin-is-getting-more.html\">rising housing costs in the region have eroded - but not yet eliminated - that advantage</url>, according to Edmonson.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2017/02/02/viewpoint-codenext-impact-austin-affordability.html\">CodeNEXT, Austin's overhaul of the building permit process, could be a vehicle to preserve that advantage.</url></p><p>\"When Austin is competing with other tech hubs, one of the great advantages it has is the relative affordability and lower cost of living,\" said Edmonson. \"CodeNEXT is the biggest and best public-policy opportunity to ensure that Austin can create enough housing units to meet rising housing demand.\"</p><p>Edmonson's first job will be to get members. They will be recruited into one of three membership tiers. There will be a free \"community\" membership that gives access to group newsletters and other information. There's also an individual \"professional\" membership, priced at $25. Members of this tier will be allowed to vote on the policy positions the group takes and help drive its overall direction. There is also a corporate membership tier that lets businesses buy memberships for their workers at various price points.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

But the setting \"Web &amp; App Activity\" needed to also be switched off if users did not want their location data collected, which most people did not know because Google did not properly disclose the information to the consumers.</p><p>\"Google's conduct caused users to understand that personal data about their location was not being obtained... by Google when in fact personal data was being obtained,\" ACCC wrote in a court filing on Tuesday, which it published on its website.</p><p>\"We allege that Google misled consumers by staying silent about the fact that another setting also had to be switched off,\" ACCC head Rod Sims told reporters in Sydney.</p><p>Crackdown against big tech</p><p>A Google spokeswoman said the company was currently reviewing the details of the allegations and will fight the claims.</p><p>The lawsuit is the first of several that the consumer watchdog has said it would pursue against the Australian arms of global tech giants like Google and Facebook when it called for tougher laws concerning privacy and content-sharing.</p><p>The Australian lawsuit against Google is seeking unspecified penalties, and orders requiring the publication of corrective notices by Google, the ACCC said. \"We want declarations that the current behavior should not continue,\" Sims said.</p><p>The matter is expected to come up for a case management hearing in Sydney's federal court on November 14.</p><p>The lawsuit also comes amid an intensifying global crackdown on the world's biggest tech firms.

Google mixed up user-data and sent many Take-out users' personal videos to random people.</p><p>While the issue lasted several days, Google says it only affected 0.01% of users - but with the number of users in excess of 1 billion, the number is believed to run into the thousands.</p><p>The way big tech companies like Google and Facebook collect, store and share user-data has  come under scrutiny in recent years.</p><p>The ACCC has taken legal action against Google</p><p>Last year, the Australian consumer watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) filed legal proceedings against Google, accusing it of misleading smartphone users about how it collects and uses personal location data.</p><p>It's the ACCC's first lawsuit against a global tech giant, but one which the Commission hopes will send a clear message that tech companies are legally required to inform users of how their data is collected, and how users can stop it from being collected.</p><p>Other countries are said to be watching the proceedings closely, as they too consider how to keep tech companies accountable.</p><p>In a nutshell,  the ACCC alleges that Google breached the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) by misleading its users during the years 2017 and 2018 by:</p><p> not properly disclosing that two different settings need to be switched off if consumers do not want Google to collect, keep and use their location data, andnot disclosing to consumers on which pages personal location data can be used for a purposes unrelated to the consumer's use of Google services.</p><p>Some of the alleged breaches carry penalties of up to A$10 million or 10% of annual turnover.</p><p>According to the ACCC, Google's account settings on Android phones and tablets have led consumers to believe that changing a setting on the \"Location History\" page stops the company from collecting, storing and using their location data. It alleges that Google failed to make clear to consumers that they would actually need to change their choices on a separate setting titled \"Web &amp; App Activity\" to prevent this from occurring.</p><p>It is well known that Google collects and uses consumers' personal location data for purposes other than providing Google services to consumers, although users are often surprised to realise just how much information these tech giants have and profit from.</p><p>For example, Google uses location data for its navigation platforms, using the data to work out demographic information for the sole purposes of selling targeted advertising. And, as it has become increasingly clear, digital platforms have the ability to track consumers when they are  both online and offline to create highly detailed personal profiles.</p><p>These profiles are then used to sell products and services, but companies like the ACCC believe the way the information is gathered is misleading or deceptive, and could also breach  privacy laws.</p><p>No 'blanket' protection for users globally</p><p>The closest thing to a cross-jurisdiction set of rules regarding privacy rights is the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), which were introduced in 2018 and govern data protection and privacy in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA).</p><p>The regulation also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The instrument aims to give individuals control over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the rules within the EU.</p><p>Not all companies and organisations have adopted the GDPR. Rather, only those with offices in an EU country or that collect, process or store the personal data of anyone located within an EU country are required to comply with the rules.</p><p>But because many businesses have an international focus and reach,  many Australian businesses have adopted the regulations and given consumers some assurances regarding privacy.</p><p>And the GDPR laws do have teeth. In January, a French regulator fined Google 50 million euros (about AUD$82 million) for breaches of privacy laws.

There have been many high profile examples of overseas entities where the cost of failing to meet compliance obligations has been high, see for example the Equifax data breach in 2017. However, closer to home there have been a number of high profile cases which provide illustrative issues for businesses in privacy risk. At the business breakfast on Monday 13 May 2019, the OAIC launched the  Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme 12 month Insights Report. This report confirms the continuing role of human error and the need for more operational safeguards around privacy.</p><p>Insights from the Global Privacy summit</p><p>As Privacy Awareness Week continues it is instructive to reflect on what is happening around the world in privacy. In the first week of May, the international association of privacy professionals held the Global Privacy Summit in Washington DC where over 4,300 privacy professionals from all over the world converged to learn and share ideas. The conference opened with a keynote address from Danah Boyd, who is an author that has provided significant research and publications on social media and children and whose message contained an important distinction between the simple act of free speech and the technique of amplification in social media.</p><p>The opening session was followed by a panel discussion with the three leading data protection commissioners. That is, the UK's Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon and the chairwoman of the European Data Protection Board, Andrea Jelinek.</p><p>This was again a fascinating discussion where the focus was on trends and how long it would take before the introduction of the GDPR results in concrete sanctions, especially among the big tech companies. The Irish Commissioner indicated that there are cases before them that are likely to be finalised over the upcoming northern hemisphere summer. The UK Commissioner spoke to the focus on fairness and transparency and the risks to consumers of invisible processing.</p><p>There was a discussion amongst the panel as to what was needed to provide appropriate data protection and it was agreed that well-resourced and funded enforcement bodies are a fundamental requirement.</p><p>Various sessions held over the conference focused on different areas including AI and algorithmic transparency and accountability - a topic that is increasingly intersecting with privacy issues.</p><p>There was also a very interesting address provided by the chairman of the US Federal Trade Commission Joseph Simons.</p><p>In this interview, the chairman spoke to some of the structural responses which may be made to privacy concerns which include governance responses and orders which impose governance obligations. There was a discussion about the increasing overlap between privacy and competition law.</p><p>The discussion also considered what the FTC has learnt from their past experiences - including that a number of orders that were made in the past were perhaps not sufficiently detailed, and it was indicated that future orders requiring independent assessments would be more robust.</p><p>There was also discussion around where technology fits in the regulatory landscape, and in fact, the FTC has recently restructured its operations to include a technology task force within its consumer protection bureau. This is a lesson that may well be relevant to us in Australia.</p><p>Another session on data ethics, digital risk and predicting the future canvassed some of the upcoming issues and noted the simultaneous stratification and convergence in the privacy function as it diverges between the operational function and the strategy issue.<br/>  In the context of audits, including regulator audits, customer audits and third party audits, a general presentation from some European based practitioners provided some detail as to the experiences they have had to date with regulator reviews and the issues that have arisen.<br/>  Lyn Nicholson, who attended the summit, will share more of these insights at our next Privacy roundtable series in June 2019.

More...</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Repeal of Competition and Consumer Act section may stymie small business<br/> The IPA has expressed concerns about the upcoming repeal of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (CCA) Section 51(3) and its potential impact on small business. This repeal may have a direct impact on Section 45 of the CCA and as a result could stifle competition rather than encourage it (02 August 2019).  More...</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">K-Line convicted of criminal cartel conduct and fined $34.5 million<br/> The Federal Court found K-Line engaged in a cartel with other shipping companies in order to fix prices on the transportation of cars, trucks, and buses to Australia between 2009 and 2012. K-Line's fine of $34.5 million is the largest ever criminal fine imposed under the Competition and Consumer Act (02 August 2019).  More...</p><p>Big Warehouse pays penalty and compensates customers<br/> Online spare parts retailer Big Warehouse has paid a $12,600 penalty after the ACCC issued an infringement notice against the company for allegedly breaching the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) by misleading a consumer about their consumer guarantee rights in relation to spare parts they had ordered (01 August 2019)  More...</p><p>Josh Frydenberg and Gladys Liu hit with High Court challenge over election results<br/> Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Liberal MP Gladys Liu are facing a High Court challenge to their victories at this year's federal election. Documents filed to the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, claimed the posters imitated official Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) material and were therefore in breach of electoral laws that make misleading and deceptive conduct illegal (31 July 2019).

It is now considering major changes including forcing Google to provide its users alternatives to its Chrome internet browser and develop new codes of conduct to police fake news and make sure they negotiate fairly with traditional media companies (26 July 2019).  More...</p><p>ACCC appeals 'flushable' wipes decision<br/> The ACCC has appealed the Federal Court's decision to dismiss part of the ACCC's case against Kimberly-Clark. The ACCC will argue on appeal that Kimberly-Clark's flushable claims should have been found to be misleading because there was evidence of the risk of harm these wipes posed to the sewerage system, and that the trial judge was wrong to require evidence that these particular wipes had caused actual harm (26 July 2019).  More...</p><p>Horse sales giant Inglis, ATC in $20 million legal feud over tip<br/> A secret dumping ground in the corner of Warwick Farm racetrack, is central to a $20 million legal feud between horse sales giant Inglis and the Australian Turf Club. The sales firm believed it was being handed a site free of contamination after diesel spills were identified and cleaned up, but says it has had to resort to the courts in order to pursue damages for what it believes was deceptive and misleading conduct (26 July 2019).  More...</p><p>Concerns about ANZ Terminals, GrainCorp deal<br/> The ACCC has released a statement of issues raising preliminary concerns about ANZ Terminals' proposed acquisition of GrainCorp Liquid Terminals Australia Pty Ltd. \"In some locations, the acquisition will lead to ANZ Terminals becoming the only storage provider for some liquid products. This loss of competition could result in higher prices for customers, or lower levels of service (24 July 2019).  More...</p><p>Market imbalance threatens future wine industry growth<br/> ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said the imbalance in bargaining power results in growers accepting contracts with sub-optimal terms, with limited ability to resolve disputes, and a lack of pricing transparency is also hindering the effective operation of the market. The ACCC is currently seeking feedback from the industry on its interim report (22 July 2019).

Defanging Big Tech is an ongoing series examining the challenge for governments, and how they should respond.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">OTTAWA-It's language typically reserved for armed conflicts or natural disasters. This week, Canada's heritage minister used it for a regulatory spat in Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Canadian government stands with our Australian partners and denounces any form of threats,\" Steven Guilbeault said in an emailed statement to the Star's Susan Delacourt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The \"threats\" Guilbeault referred to involved some of the world's richest and most influential corporations, Facebook and Google, which have separately warned Canada's friends down under that they will suspend services in Australia or block media organizations from using their platforms if Canberra follows through with a law they don't like.</p><p>That law would force these giants of the digital age - companies that rake in tens of billions of dollars each year and control the infrastructure of the internet's most-trafficked venues - to negotiate payments to the journalism organizations that create the news content hosted on their platforms.</p><p>Canada is working on its schemes to regulate these platforms, though the government is cagey about providing particulars. Guilbeault would not agree to speak with the Star on the record this week, offering instead to speak \"on background\" without being quoted or named. The Star declined, and Guilbeault's office provided a written statement in response to questions.</p><p>There may be good reason why a politician would tread carefully on this terrain. It's proven to be tricky.</p><p>Critics charge big multinational tech companies don't pay enough taxes and that this is unfair to domestic competitors. But when several countries, including Canada, floated proposals to create special taxes on revenue that these U.S.-based digital giants reap in their jurisdictions, the Americans threatened to impose tariffs - a threat Canada knows too well to be credible with Donald Trump in the White House.</p><p>Others want to see modernized rules in Canada to force companies like Netflix to showcase a minimum amount of Canadian content, just like radio and television stations. But when then-heritage minister M&amp;#233;lanie Joly unveiled Canada's new cultural policy in 2017, she was roundly criticized because it did not create requirements for foreign players to support domestic productions.</p><p>She was later shuffled to the tourism portfolio.</p><p>Meanwhile, many news organizations are bleeding dollars as Facebook and Google gobble up the vast majority of all digital ad revenue in Canada, according to one dire report on the financial state of this country's news media.</p><p>Clearly there's a lot for the government to grapple with.</p><p>The way University of Ottawa professor and Canada Research Chair in internet and E-Commerce Law Michael Geist sees it, Guilbeault could make decisions in several areas. The first involves taxation.</p><p>Geist noted how the political will to go down this route has changed since 2015, when Stephen Harper, then prime minister, warned Canadians Justin Trudeau would impose a \"Netflix tax\" on their streaming subscriptions. What he was really talking about was the application of sales tax to these subscriptions, which wasn't collected because the service was provided to Canadians by a company not based in this country.</p><p>Similarly, sales tax doesn't apply to ads purchased from foreign websites like Facebook and Google - a key point of contention for groups like the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, which argue this unfairly disadvantages Canadian media.</p><p>But while Trudeau steadfastly denied Harper's charge about the Netflix tax five years ago, things have changed. Quebec and Saskatchewan applied their provincial sales taxes to off-jurisdiction digital services in 2019. British Columbia plans to follow suit. And so does the Liberal government in Ottawa, which Guilbeault has said intends to collect federal sales tax so that \"foreign platforms will pay the same taxes as Canadian digital companies.\"</p><p>However, as Geist explains, the Liberals also promised something else during the 2019 federal election. Their policy platform called for a special, three-per-cent tax on revenues that large foreign digital companies raise in Canada. The New Democrats, Conservatives and Bloc Qu&amp;#233;b&amp;#233;cois promised similar taxes.</p><p>But after taking power, the Liberals have suggested they won't act on this pledge without other countries doing the same. Guilbeault's office, for instance, pointed this week to a statement the minister posted on Twitter last December, in which he called the current tax situation \"unfair\" and said the government would address it \"in a fair, responsible manner\" as it works to \"build an international consensus\" on the issue.</p><p>\"They actually flip-flopped, in terms of which tax they seemed to be willing to move forward on,\" said Geist, pointing to the willingness to move first with the sales tax.</p><p>\"With sales taxes, it's consumers paying the sales taxes, and it's just the companies collecting and remitting,\" he said.</p><p>Opposition parties also remain supportive of additional taxes for foreign digital services. NDP MP Charlie Angus told the Star this week that the government should make sure these companies pay their share.</p><p>\"We see Facebook threatening Australia. They are not good corporate citizens,\" Angus said. \"They need to be paying tax. It's about fairness, because so much of the revenue comes from ads but they're not paying tax back in. So it's a simple, straightforward thing.\"</p><p>Conservative MP Michelle Rempel also pointed to commitments from her party's new leader Erin O'Toole, who called for tax changes to ensure there are taxes on digital ads bought from foreign websites like Facebook and Google. \"We're probably overdue as a country at looking at ways to ensure that companies are paying their fair share... We're open to looking at that,\" she said.</p><p>Google did not respond to a request for comment from the Star this week. Facebook, however, signalled in a background conversation with the Star that it is willing to pay more taxes in Canada.</p><p>The second area where Geist sees potential for federal action is in response to calls for foreign digital players to pay for Canadian content. Here, Geist said \"it's pretty clear (the government is) going to do something,\" given how Trudeau assigned Guilbeault to bring in legislation to modernize Canada's laws on broadcasting and telecommunications before the end of the year.</p><p>In his office's statement to the Star, Guilbeault said the government is committed to a \"more equitable digital regulatory framework\" in Canada. \"It is about levelling the playing field,\" he said. \"Those who benefit from the Canadian ecosystem must also contribute to it, through the Canadian broadcasting sector or the fair remuneration for the use of news content.\"</p><p>The Australian situation shows there are \"big risks\" for the Canadian government if it takes a similar path, Geist said. He said the removal of quality journalism from major digital platforms would leave users with potentially less credible sources of information, and questioned the assumption that news content - which, on platforms like Facebook, is shared voluntarily by news organizations and social media users - is worth significant amounts of money to digital giants.</p><p>\"The idea that we'd have Canadian news organizations shut out of large social media platforms sure isn't helping those Canadian media organizations,\" Geist said.</p><p>In a written statement to the Star, Kevin Chan, global director and head of public policy at Facebook Canada said removing news in Australia is the company's \"last choice\" and that it wants to \"work with news organizations and governments to support the development of sustainable business models.\" In Canada, that has included putting almost $9 million toward initiatives such as a program to fund jobs with The Canadian Press, he said, adding that \"we'll continue to do more.\"</p><p>Finally, Geist outlined how there are calls for Ottawa to do something around the proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms. Last year, the government earmarked $9 million for projects designed to educate people about online misinformation, and rolled out another $3.5 million to \"amplify the current efforts\" of organizations to help people assess health information online during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>For Rempel, it's better to emphasize educational initiatives than to create a system where tech companies like Facebook have to police misinformation and decide what should be removed from their websites. It would also be problematic for governments to set parameters for those decisions, she said.</p><p>She recognized the overall complexity of the issues facing Guilbeault and the government as they try to adapt to the realities of the 21st century digital economy and said she hopes the question of how to tax and regulate web giants figures prominently in the next federal election.</p><p>\"I hope to see, and I think that some of these policies should be part of any sort of an election campaign or platform, because they're really material to competitiveness and content-creation and tech innovation in our country, and we have to get it right,\" she said.</p><p>Of course, this wouldn't be the first time these issues have figured in an election campaign. All parties agree that something should be done. Promises have been made. Yet the challenge remains.</p><p>Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics for the Star.

Defanging Big Tech is an ongoing series examining the challenge for governments, and how they should respond.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">OTTAWA-It's language typically reserved for armed conflicts or natural disasters. This week, Canada's heritage minister used it for a regulatory spat in Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Canadian government stands with our Australian partners and denounces any form of threats,\" Steven Guilbeault said in an emailed statement to the Star's Susan Delacourt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The \"threats\" Guilbeault referred to involved some of the world's richest and most influential corporations, Facebook and Google, which have separately warned Canada's friends down under that they will suspend services in Australia or block media organizations from using their platforms if Canberra follows through with a law they don't like.</p><p>That law would force these giants of the digital age - companies that rake in tens of billions of dollars each year and control the infrastructure of the internet's most-trafficked venues - to negotiate payments to the journalism organizations that create the news content hosted on their platforms.</p><p>Canada is working on its schemes to regulate these platforms, though the government is cagey about providing particulars. Guilbeault would not agree to speak with the Star on the record this week, offering instead to speak \"on background\" without being quoted or named. The Star declined, and Guilbeault's office provided a written statement in response to questions.</p><p>There may be good reason why a politician would tread carefully on this terrain. It's proven to be tricky.</p><p>Critics charge big multinational tech companies don't pay enough taxes and that this is unfair to domestic competitors. But when several countries, including Canada, floated proposals to create special taxes on revenue that these U.S.-based digital giants reap in their jurisdictions, the Americans threatened to impose tariffs - a threat Canada knows too well to be credible with Donald Trump in the White House.</p><p>Others want to see modernized rules in Canada to force companies like Netflix to showcase a minimum amount of Canadian content, just like radio and television stations. But when then-heritage minister M&amp;#233;lanie Joly unveiled Canada's new cultural policy in 2017, she was roundly criticized because it did not create requirements for foreign players to support domestic productions.</p><p>She was later shuffled to the tourism portfolio.</p><p>Meanwhile, many news organizations are bleeding dollars as Facebook and Google gobble up the vast majority of all digital ad revenue in Canada, according to one dire report on the financial state of this country's news media.</p><p>Clearly there's a lot for the government to grapple with.</p><p>The way University of Ottawa professor and Canada Research Chair in internet and E-Commerce Law Michael Geist sees it, Guilbeault could make decisions in several areas. The first involves taxation.</p><p>Geist noted how the political will to go down this route has changed since 2015, when Stephen Harper, then prime minister, warned Canadians Justin Trudeau would impose a \"Netflix tax\" on their streaming subscriptions. What he was really talking about was the application of sales tax to these subscriptions, which wasn't collected because the service was provided to Canadians by a company not based in this country.</p><p>Similarly, sales tax doesn't apply to ads purchased from foreign websites like Facebook and Google - a key point of contention for groups like the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, which argue this unfairly disadvantages Canadian media.</p><p>But while Trudeau steadfastly denied Harper's charge about the Netflix tax five years ago, things have changed. Quebec and Saskatchewan applied their provincial sales taxes to off-jurisdiction digital services in 2019. British Columbia plans to follow suit. And so does the Liberal government in Ottawa, which Guilbeault has said intends to collect federal sales tax so that \"foreign platforms will pay the same taxes as Canadian digital companies.\"</p><p>However, as Geist explains, the Liberals also promised something else during the 2019 federal election. Their policy platform called for a special, three-per-cent tax on revenues that large foreign digital companies raise in Canada. The New Democrats, Conservatives and Bloc Qu&amp;#233;b&amp;#233;cois promised similar taxes.</p><p>But after taking power, the Liberals have suggested they won't act on this pledge without other countries doing the same. Guilbeault's office, for instance, pointed this week to a statement the minister posted on Twitter last December, in which he called the current tax situation \"unfair\" and said the government would address it \"in a fair, responsible manner\" as it works to \"build an international consensus\" on the issue.</p><p>\"They actually flip-flopped, in terms of which tax they seemed to be willing to move forward on,\" said Geist, pointing to the willingness to move first with the sales tax.</p><p>\"With sales taxes, it's consumers paying the sales taxes, and it's just the companies collecting and remitting,\" he said.</p><p>Opposition parties also remain supportive of additional taxes for foreign digital services. NDP MP Charlie Angus told the Star this week that the government should make sure these companies pay their share.</p><p>\"We see Facebook threatening Australia. They are not good corporate citizens,\" Angus said. \"They need to be paying tax. It's about fairness, because so much of the revenue comes from ads but they're not paying tax back in. So it's a simple, straightforward thing.\"</p><p>Conservative MP Michelle Rempel also pointed to commitments from her party's new leader Erin O'Toole, who called for tax changes to ensure there are taxes on digital ads bought from foreign websites like Facebook and Google. \"We're probably overdue as a country at looking at ways to ensure that companies are paying their fair share... We're open to looking at that,\" she said.</p><p>Google did not respond to a request for comment from the Star this week. Facebook, however, signalled in a background conversation with the Star that it is willing to pay more taxes in Canada.</p><p>The second area where Geist sees potential for federal action is in response to calls for foreign digital players to pay for Canadian content. Here, Geist said \"it's pretty clear (the government is) going to do something,\" given how Trudeau assigned Guilbeault to bring in legislation to modernize Canada's laws on broadcasting and telecommunications before the end of the year.</p><p>In his office's statement to the Star, Guilbeault said the government is committed to a \"more equitable digital regulatory framework\" in Canada. \"It is about levelling the playing field,\" he said. \"Those who benefit from the Canadian ecosystem must also contribute to it, through the Canadian broadcasting sector or the fair remuneration for the use of news content.\"</p><p>The Australian situation shows there are \"big risks\" for the Canadian government if it takes a similar path, Geist said. He said the removal of quality journalism from major digital platforms would leave users with potentially less credible sources of information, and questioned the assumption that news content - which, on platforms like Facebook, is shared voluntarily by news organizations and social media users - is worth significant amounts of money to digital giants.</p><p>\"The idea that we'd have Canadian news organizations shut out of large social media platforms sure isn't helping those Canadian media organizations,\" Geist said.</p><p>In a written statement to the Star, Kevin Chan, global director and head of public policy at Facebook Canada said removing news in Australia is the company's \"last choice\" and that it wants to \"work with news organizations and governments to support the development of sustainable business models.\" In Canada, that has included putting almost $9 million toward initiatives such as a program to fund jobs with The Canadian Press, he said, adding that \"we'll continue to do more.\"</p><p>Finally, Geist outlined how there are calls for Ottawa to do something around the proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms. Last year, the government earmarked $9 million for projects designed to educate people about online misinformation, and rolled out another $3.5 million to \"amplify the current efforts\" of organizations to help people assess health information online during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>For Rempel, it's better to emphasize educational initiatives than to create a system where tech companies like Facebook have to police misinformation and decide what should be removed from their websites. It would also be problematic for governments to set parameters for those decisions, she said.</p><p>She recognized the overall complexity of the issues facing Guilbeault and the government as they try to adapt to the realities of the 21st century digital economy and said she hopes the question of how to tax and regulate web giants figures prominently in the next federal election.</p><p>\"I hope to see, and I think that some of these policies should be part of any sort of an election campaign or platform, because they're really material to competitiveness and content-creation and tech innovation in our country, and we have to get it right,\" she said.</p><p>Of course, this wouldn't be the first time these issues have figured in an election campaign. All parties agree that something should be done. Promises have been made. Yet the challenge remains.</p><p>Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics for the Star.

Defanging Big Tech is an ongoing series examining the challenge for governments, and how they should respond.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">OTTAWA-It's language typically reserved for armed conflicts or natural disasters. This week, Canada's heritage minister used it for a regulatory spat in Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Canadian government stands with our Australian partners and denounces any form of threats,\" Steven Guilbeault said in an emailed statement to the Star's Susan Delacourt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The \"threats\" Guilbeault referred to involved some of the world's richest and most influential corporations, Facebook and Google, which have separately warned Canada's friends down under that they will suspend services in Australia or block media organizations from using their platforms if Canberra follows through with a law they don't like.</p><p>That law would force these giants of the digital age - companies that rake in tens of billions of dollars each year and control the infrastructure of the internet's most-trafficked venues - to negotiate payments to the journalism organizations that create the news content hosted on their platforms.</p><p>Canada is working on its schemes to regulate these platforms, though the government is cagey about providing particulars. Guilbeault would not agree to speak with the Star on the record this week, offering instead to speak \"on background\" without being quoted or named. The Star declined, and Guilbeault's office provided a written statement in response to questions.</p><p>There may be good reason why a politician would tread carefully on this terrain. It's proven to be tricky.</p><p>Critics charge big multinational tech companies don't pay enough taxes and that this is unfair to domestic competitors. But when several countries, including Canada, floated proposals to create special taxes on revenue that these U.S.-based digital giants reap in their jurisdictions, the Americans threatened to impose tariffs - a threat Canada knows too well to be credible with Donald Trump in the White House.</p><p>Others want to see modernized rules in Canada to force companies like Netflix to showcase a minimum amount of Canadian content, just like radio and television stations. But when then-heritage minister M&amp;#233;lanie Joly unveiled Canada's new cultural policy in 2017, she was roundly criticized because it did not create requirements for foreign players to support domestic productions.</p><p>She was later shuffled to the tourism portfolio.</p><p>Meanwhile, many news organizations are bleeding dollars as Facebook and Google gobble up the vast majority of all digital ad revenue in Canada, according to one dire report on the financial state of this country's news media.</p><p>Clearly there's a lot for the government to grapple with.</p><p>The way University of Ottawa professor and Canada Research Chair in internet and E-Commerce Law Michael Geist sees it, Guilbeault could make decisions in several areas. The first involves taxation.</p><p>Geist noted how the political will to go down this route has changed since 2015, when Stephen Harper, then prime minister, warned Canadians Justin Trudeau would impose a \"Netflix tax\" on their streaming subscriptions. What he was really talking about was the application of sales tax to these subscriptions, which wasn't collected because the service was provided to Canadians by a company not based in this country.</p><p>Similarly, sales tax doesn't apply to ads purchased from foreign websites like Facebook and Google - a key point of contention for groups like the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, which argue this unfairly disadvantages Canadian media.</p><p>But while Trudeau steadfastly denied Harper's charge about the Netflix tax five years ago, things have changed. Quebec and Saskatchewan applied their provincial sales taxes to off-jurisdiction digital services in 2019. British Columbia plans to follow suit. And so does the Liberal government in Ottawa, which Guilbeault has said intends to collect federal sales tax so that \"foreign platforms will pay the same taxes as Canadian digital companies.\"</p><p>However, as Geist explains, the Liberals also promised something else during the 2019 federal election. Their policy platform called for a special, three-per-cent tax on revenues that large foreign digital companies raise in Canada. The New Democrats, Conservatives and Bloc Qu&amp;#233;b&amp;#233;cois promised similar taxes.</p><p>But after taking power, the Liberals have suggested they won't act on this pledge without other countries doing the same. Guilbeault's office, for instance, pointed this week to a statement the minister posted on Twitter last December, in which he called the current tax situation \"unfair\" and said the government would address it \"in a fair, responsible manner\" as it works to \"build an international consensus\" on the issue.</p><p>\"They actually flip-flopped, in terms of which tax they seemed to be willing to move forward on,\" said Geist, pointing to the willingness to move first with the sales tax.</p><p>\"With sales taxes, it's consumers paying the sales taxes, and it's just the companies collecting and remitting,\" he said.</p><p>Opposition parties also remain supportive of additional taxes for foreign digital services. NDP MP Charlie Angus told the Star this week that the government should make sure these companies pay their share.</p><p>\"We see Facebook threatening Australia. They are not good corporate citizens,\" Angus said. \"They need to be paying tax. It's about fairness, because so much of the revenue comes from ads but they're not paying tax back in. So it's a simple, straightforward thing.\"</p><p>Conservative MP Michelle Rempel also pointed to commitments from her party's new leader Erin O'Toole, who called for tax changes to ensure there are taxes on digital ads bought from foreign websites like Facebook and Google. \"We're probably overdue as a country at looking at ways to ensure that companies are paying their fair share... We're open to looking at that,\" she said.</p><p>Google did not respond to a request for comment from the Star this week. Facebook, however, signalled in a background conversation with the Star that it is willing to pay more taxes in Canada.</p><p>The second area where Geist sees potential for federal action is in response to calls for foreign digital players to pay for Canadian content. Here, Geist said \"it's pretty clear (the government is) going to do something,\" given how Trudeau assigned Guilbeault to bring in legislation to modernize Canada's laws on broadcasting and telecommunications before the end of the year.</p><p>In his office's statement to the Star, Guilbeault said the government is committed to a \"more equitable digital regulatory framework\" in Canada. \"It is about levelling the playing field,\" he said. \"Those who benefit from the Canadian ecosystem must also contribute to it, through the Canadian broadcasting sector or the fair remuneration for the use of news content.\"</p><p>The Australian situation shows there are \"big risks\" for the Canadian government if it takes a similar path, Geist said. He said the removal of quality journalism from major digital platforms would leave users with potentially less credible sources of information, and questioned the assumption that news content - which, on platforms like Facebook, is shared voluntarily by news organizations and social media users - is worth significant amounts of money to digital giants.</p><p>\"The idea that we'd have Canadian news organizations shut out of large social media platforms sure isn't helping those Canadian media organizations,\" Geist said.</p><p>In a written statement to the Star, Kevin Chan, global director and head of public policy at Facebook Canada said removing news in Australia is the company's \"last choice\" and that it wants to \"work with news organizations and governments to support the development of sustainable business models.\" In Canada, that has included putting almost $9 million toward initiatives such as a program to fund jobs with The Canadian Press, he said, adding that \"we'll continue to do more.\"</p><p>Finally, Geist outlined how there are calls for Ottawa to do something around the proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms. Last year, the government earmarked $9 million for projects designed to educate people about online misinformation, and rolled out another $3.5 million to \"amplify the current efforts\" of organizations to help people assess health information online during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>For Rempel, it's better to emphasize educational initiatives than to create a system where tech companies like Facebook have to police misinformation and decide what should be removed from their websites. It would also be problematic for governments to set parameters for those decisions, she said.</p><p>She recognized the overall complexity of the issues facing Guilbeault and the government as they try to adapt to the realities of the 21st century digital economy and said she hopes the question of how to tax and regulate web giants figures prominently in the next federal election.</p><p>\"I hope to see, and I think that some of these policies should be part of any sort of an election campaign or platform, because they're really material to competitiveness and content-creation and tech innovation in our country, and we have to get it right,\" she said.</p><p>Of course, this wouldn't be the first time these issues have figured in an election campaign. All parties agree that something should be done. Promises have been made. Yet the challenge remains.</p><p>Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics for the Star.

Defanging Big Tech is an ongoing series examining the challenge for governments, and how they should respond.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">OTTAWA-It's language typically reserved for armed conflicts or natural disasters. This week, Canada's heritage minister used it for a regulatory spat in Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Canadian government stands with our Australian partners and denounces any form of threats,\" Steven Guilbeault said in an emailed statement to the Star's Susan Delacourt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The \"threats\" Guilbeault referred to involved some of the world's richest and most influential corporations, Facebook and Google, which have separately warned Canada's friends down under that they will suspend services in Australia or block media organizations from using their platforms if Canberra follows through with a law they don't like.</p><p>That law would force these giants of the digital age - companies that rake in tens of billions of dollars each year and control the infrastructure of the internet's most-trafficked venues - to negotiate payments to the journalism organizations that create the news content hosted on their platforms.</p><p>Canada is working on its schemes to regulate these platforms, though the government is cagey about providing particulars. Guilbeault would not agree to speak with the Star on the record this week, offering instead to speak \"on background\" without being quoted or named. The Star declined, and Guilbeault's office provided a written statement in response to questions.</p><p>There may be good reason why a politician would tread carefully on this terrain. It's proven to be tricky.</p><p>Critics charge big multinational tech companies don't pay enough taxes and that this is unfair to domestic competitors. But when several countries, including Canada, floated proposals to create special taxes on revenue that these U.S.-based digital giants reap in their jurisdictions, the Americans threatened to impose tariffs - a threat Canada knows too well to be credible with Donald Trump in the White House.</p><p>Others want to see modernized rules in Canada to force companies like Netflix to showcase a minimum amount of Canadian content, just like radio and television stations. But when then-heritage minister M&amp;#233;lanie Joly unveiled Canada's new cultural policy in 2017, she was roundly criticized because it did not create requirements for foreign players to support domestic productions.</p><p>She was later shuffled to the tourism portfolio.</p><p>Meanwhile, many news organizations are bleeding dollars as Facebook and Google gobble up the vast majority of all digital ad revenue in Canada, according to one dire report on the financial state of this country's news media.</p><p>Clearly there's a lot for the government to grapple with.</p><p>The way University of Ottawa professor and Canada Research Chair in internet and E-Commerce Law Michael Geist sees it, Guilbeault could make decisions in several areas. The first involves taxation.</p><p>Geist noted how the political will to go down this route has changed since 2015, when Stephen Harper, then prime minister, warned Canadians Justin Trudeau would impose a \"Netflix tax\" on their streaming subscriptions. What he was really talking about was the application of sales tax to these subscriptions, which wasn't collected because the service was provided to Canadians by a company not based in this country.</p><p>Similarly, sales tax doesn't apply to ads purchased from foreign websites like Facebook and Google - a key point of contention for groups like the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, which argue this unfairly disadvantages Canadian media.</p><p>But while Trudeau steadfastly denied Harper's charge about the Netflix tax five years ago, things have changed. Quebec and Saskatchewan applied their provincial sales taxes to off-jurisdiction digital services in 2019. British Columbia plans to follow suit. And so does the Liberal government in Ottawa, which Guilbeault has said intends to collect federal sales tax so that \"foreign platforms will pay the same taxes as Canadian digital companies.\"</p><p>However, as Geist explains, the Liberals also promised something else during the 2019 federal election. Their policy platform called for a special, three-per-cent tax on revenues that large foreign digital companies raise in Canada. The New Democrats, Conservatives and Bloc Qu&amp;#233;b&amp;#233;cois promised similar taxes.</p><p>But after taking power, the Liberals have suggested they won't act on this pledge without other countries doing the same. Guilbeault's office, for instance, pointed this week to a statement the minister posted on Twitter last December, in which he called the current tax situation \"unfair\" and said the government would address it \"in a fair, responsible manner\" as it works to \"build an international consensus\" on the issue.</p><p>\"They actually flip-flopped, in terms of which tax they seemed to be willing to move forward on,\" said Geist, pointing to the willingness to move first with the sales tax.</p><p>\"With sales taxes, it's consumers paying the sales taxes, and it's just the companies collecting and remitting,\" he said.</p><p>Opposition parties also remain supportive of additional taxes for foreign digital services. NDP MP Charlie Angus told the Star this week that the government should make sure these companies pay their share.</p><p>\"We see Facebook threatening Australia. They are not good corporate citizens,\" Angus said. \"They need to be paying tax. It's about fairness, because so much of the revenue comes from ads but they're not paying tax back in. So it's a simple, straightforward thing.\"</p><p>Conservative MP Michelle Rempel also pointed to commitments from her party's new leader Erin O'Toole, who called for tax changes to ensure there are taxes on digital ads bought from foreign websites like Facebook and Google. \"We're probably overdue as a country at looking at ways to ensure that companies are paying their fair share... We're open to looking at that,\" she said.</p><p>Google did not respond to a request for comment from the Star this week. Facebook, however, signalled in a background conversation with the Star that it is willing to pay more taxes in Canada.</p><p>The second area where Geist sees potential for federal action is in response to calls for foreign digital players to pay for Canadian content. Here, Geist said \"it's pretty clear (the government is) going to do something,\" given how Trudeau assigned Guilbeault to bring in legislation to modernize Canada's laws on broadcasting and telecommunications before the end of the year.</p><p>In his office's statement to the Star, Guilbeault said the government is committed to a \"more equitable digital regulatory framework\" in Canada. \"It is about levelling the playing field,\" he said. \"Those who benefit from the Canadian ecosystem must also contribute to it, through the Canadian broadcasting sector or the fair remuneration for the use of news content.\"</p><p>The Australian situation shows there are \"big risks\" for the Canadian government if it takes a similar path, Geist said. He said the removal of quality journalism from major digital platforms would leave users with potentially less credible sources of information, and questioned the assumption that news content - which, on platforms like Facebook, is shared voluntarily by news organizations and social media users - is worth significant amounts of money to digital giants.</p><p>\"The idea that we'd have Canadian news organizations shut out of large social media platforms sure isn't helping those Canadian media organizations,\" Geist said.</p><p>In a written statement to the Star, Kevin Chan, global director and head of public policy at Facebook Canada said removing news in Australia is the company's \"last choice\" and that it wants to \"work with news organizations and governments to support the development of sustainable business models.\" In Canada, that has included putting almost $9 million toward initiatives such as a program to fund jobs with The Canadian Press, he said, adding that \"we'll continue to do more.\"</p><p>Finally, Geist outlined how there are calls for Ottawa to do something around the proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms. Last year, the government earmarked $9 million for projects designed to educate people about online misinformation, and rolled out another $3.5 million to \"amplify the current efforts\" of organizations to help people assess health information online during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>For Rempel, it's better to emphasize educational initiatives than to create a system where tech companies like Facebook have to police misinformation and decide what should be removed from their websites. It would also be problematic for governments to set parameters for those decisions, she said.</p><p>She recognized the overall complexity of the issues facing Guilbeault and the government as they try to adapt to the realities of the 21st century digital economy and said she hopes the question of how to tax and regulate web giants figures prominently in the next federal election.</p><p>\"I hope to see, and I think that some of these policies should be part of any sort of an election campaign or platform, because they're really material to competitiveness and content-creation and tech innovation in our country, and we have to get it right,\" she said.</p><p>Of course, this wouldn't be the first time these issues have figured in an election campaign. All parties agree that something should be done. Promises have been made. Yet the challenge remains.</p><p>Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics for the Star.

Defanging Big Tech is an ongoing series examining the challenge for governments, and how they should respond.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">OTTAWA-It's language typically reserved for armed conflicts or natural disasters. This week, Canada's heritage minister used it for a regulatory spat in Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Canadian government stands with our Australian partners and denounces any form of threats,\" Steven Guilbeault said in an emailed statement to the Star's Susan Delacourt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The \"threats\" Guilbeault referred to involved some of the world's richest and most influential corporations, Facebook and Google, which have separately warned Canada's friends down under that they will suspend services in Australia or block media organizations from using their platforms if Canberra follows through with a law they don't like.</p><p>That law would force these giants of the digital age - companies that rake in tens of billions of dollars each year and control the infrastructure of the internet's most-trafficked venues - to negotiate payments to the journalism organizations that create the news content hosted on their platforms.</p><p>Canada is working on its schemes to regulate these platforms, though the government is cagey about providing particulars. Guilbeault would not agree to speak with the Star on the record this week, offering instead to speak \"on background\" without being quoted or named. The Star declined, and Guilbeault's office provided a written statement in response to questions.</p><p>There may be good reason why a politician would tread carefully on this terrain. It's proven to be tricky.</p><p>Critics charge big multinational tech companies don't pay enough taxes and that this is unfair to domestic competitors. But when several countries, including Canada, floated proposals to create special taxes on revenue that these U.S.-based digital giants reap in their jurisdictions, the Americans threatened to impose tariffs - a threat Canada knows too well to be credible with Donald Trump in the White House.</p><p>Others want to see modernized rules in Canada to force companies like Netflix to showcase a minimum amount of Canadian content, just like radio and television stations. But when then-heritage minister M&amp;#233;lanie Joly unveiled Canada's new cultural policy in 2017, she was roundly criticized because it did not create requirements for foreign players to support domestic productions.</p><p>She was later shuffled to the tourism portfolio.</p><p>Meanwhile, many news organizations are bleeding dollars as Facebook and Google gobble up the vast majority of all digital ad revenue in Canada, according to one dire report on the financial state of this country's news media.</p><p>Clearly there's a lot for the government to grapple with.</p><p>The way University of Ottawa professor and Canada Research Chair in internet and E-Commerce Law Michael Geist sees it, Guilbeault could make decisions in several areas. The first involves taxation.</p><p>Geist noted how the political will to go down this route has changed since 2015, when Stephen Harper, then prime minister, warned Canadians Justin Trudeau would impose a \"Netflix tax\" on their streaming subscriptions. What he was really talking about was the application of sales tax to these subscriptions, which wasn't collected because the service was provided to Canadians by a company not based in this country.</p><p>Similarly, sales tax doesn't apply to ads purchased from foreign websites like Facebook and Google - a key point of contention for groups like the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, which argue this unfairly disadvantages Canadian media.</p><p>But while Trudeau steadfastly denied Harper's charge about the Netflix tax five years ago, things have changed. Quebec and Saskatchewan applied their provincial sales taxes to off-jurisdiction digital services in 2019. British Columbia plans to follow suit. And so does the Liberal government in Ottawa, which Guilbeault has said intends to collect federal sales tax so that \"foreign platforms will pay the same taxes as Canadian digital companies.\"</p><p>However, as Geist explains, the Liberals also promised something else during the 2019 federal election. Their policy platform called for a special, three-per-cent tax on revenues that large foreign digital companies raise in Canada. The New Democrats, Conservatives and Bloc Qu&amp;#233;b&amp;#233;cois promised similar taxes.</p><p>But after taking power, the Liberals have suggested they won't act on this pledge without other countries doing the same. Guilbeault's office, for instance, pointed this week to a statement the minister posted on Twitter last December, in which he called the current tax situation \"unfair\" and said the government would address it \"in a fair, responsible manner\" as it works to \"build an international consensus\" on the issue.</p><p>\"They actually flip-flopped, in terms of which tax they seemed to be willing to move forward on,\" said Geist, pointing to the willingness to move first with the sales tax.</p><p>\"With sales taxes, it's consumers paying the sales taxes, and it's just the companies collecting and remitting,\" he said.</p><p>Opposition parties also remain supportive of additional taxes for foreign digital services. NDP MP Charlie Angus told the Star this week that the government should make sure these companies pay their share.</p><p>\"We see Facebook threatening Australia. They are not good corporate citizens,\" Angus said. \"They need to be paying tax. It's about fairness, because so much of the revenue comes from ads but they're not paying tax back in. So it's a simple, straightforward thing.\"</p><p>Conservative MP Michelle Rempel also pointed to commitments from her party's new leader Erin O'Toole, who called for tax changes to ensure there are taxes on digital ads bought from foreign websites like Facebook and Google. \"We're probably overdue as a country at looking at ways to ensure that companies are paying their fair share... We're open to looking at that,\" she said.</p><p>Google did not respond to a request for comment from the Star this week. Facebook, however, signalled in a background conversation with the Star that it is willing to pay more taxes in Canada.</p><p>The second area where Geist sees potential for federal action is in response to calls for foreign digital players to pay for Canadian content. Here, Geist said \"it's pretty clear (the government is) going to do something,\" given how Trudeau assigned Guilbeault to bring in legislation to modernize Canada's laws on broadcasting and telecommunications before the end of the year.</p><p>In his office's statement to the Star, Guilbeault said the government is committed to a \"more equitable digital regulatory framework\" in Canada. \"It is about levelling the playing field,\" he said. \"Those who benefit from the Canadian ecosystem must also contribute to it, through the Canadian broadcasting sector or the fair remuneration for the use of news content.\"</p><p>The Australian situation shows there are \"big risks\" for the Canadian government if it takes a similar path, Geist said. He said the removal of quality journalism from major digital platforms would leave users with potentially less credible sources of information, and questioned the assumption that news content - which, on platforms like Facebook, is shared voluntarily by news organizations and social media users - is worth significant amounts of money to digital giants.</p><p>\"The idea that we'd have Canadian news organizations shut out of large social media platforms sure isn't helping those Canadian media organizations,\" Geist said.</p><p>In a written statement to the Star, Kevin Chan, global director and head of public policy at Facebook Canada said removing news in Australia is the company's \"last choice\" and that it wants to \"work with news organizations and governments to support the development of sustainable business models.\" In Canada, that has included putting almost $9 million toward initiatives such as a program to fund jobs with The Canadian Press, he said, adding that \"we'll continue to do more.\"</p><p>Finally, Geist outlined how there are calls for Ottawa to do something around the proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms. Last year, the government earmarked $9 million for projects designed to educate people about online misinformation, and rolled out another $3.5 million to \"amplify the current efforts\" of organizations to help people assess health information online during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>For Rempel, it's better to emphasize educational initiatives than to create a system where tech companies like Facebook have to police misinformation and decide what should be removed from their websites. It would also be problematic for governments to set parameters for those decisions, she said.</p><p>She recognized the overall complexity of the issues facing Guilbeault and the government as they try to adapt to the realities of the 21st century digital economy and said she hopes the question of how to tax and regulate web giants figures prominently in the next federal election.</p><p>\"I hope to see, and I think that some of these policies should be part of any sort of an election campaign or platform, because they're really material to competitiveness and content-creation and tech innovation in our country, and we have to get it right,\" she said.</p><p>Of course, this wouldn't be the first time these issues have figured in an election campaign. All parties agree that something should be done. Promises have been made. Yet the challenge remains.</p><p>Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics for the Star.

Defanging Big Tech is an ongoing series examining the challenge for governments, and how they should respond.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">OTTAWA-It's language typically reserved for armed conflicts or natural disasters. This week, Canada's heritage minister used it for a regulatory spat in Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Canadian government stands with our Australian partners and denounces any form of threats,\" Steven Guilbeault said in an emailed statement to the Star's Susan Delacourt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The \"threats\" Guilbeault referred to involved some of the world's richest and most influential corporations, Facebook and Google, which have separately warned Canada's friends down under that they will suspend services in Australia or block media organizations from using their platforms if Canberra follows through with a law they don't like.</p><p>That law would force these giants of the digital age - companies that rake in tens of billions of dollars each year and control the infrastructure of the internet's most-trafficked venues - to negotiate payments to the journalism organizations that create the news content hosted on their platforms.</p><p>Canada is working on its schemes to regulate these platforms, though the government is cagey about providing particulars. Guilbeault would not agree to speak with the Star on the record this week, offering instead to speak \"on background\" without being quoted or named. The Star declined, and Guilbeault's office provided a written statement in response to questions.</p><p>There may be good reason why a politician would tread carefully on this terrain. It's proven to be tricky.</p><p>Critics charge big multinational tech companies don't pay enough taxes and that this is unfair to domestic competitors. But when several countries, including Canada, floated proposals to create special taxes on revenue that these U.S.-based digital giants reap in their jurisdictions, the Americans threatened to impose tariffs - a threat Canada knows too well to be credible with Donald Trump in the White House.</p><p>Others want to see modernized rules in Canada to force companies like Netflix to showcase a minimum amount of Canadian content, just like radio and television stations. But when then-heritage minister M&amp;#233;lanie Joly unveiled Canada's new cultural policy in 2017, she was roundly criticized because it did not create requirements for foreign players to support domestic productions.</p><p>She was later shuffled to the tourism portfolio.</p><p>Meanwhile, many news organizations are bleeding dollars as Facebook and Google gobble up the vast majority of all digital ad revenue in Canada, according to one dire report on the financial state of this country's news media.</p><p>Clearly there's a lot for the government to grapple with.</p><p>The way University of Ottawa professor and Canada Research Chair in internet and E-Commerce Law Michael Geist sees it, Guilbeault could make decisions in several areas. The first involves taxation.</p><p>Geist noted how the political will to go down this route has changed since 2015, when Stephen Harper, then prime minister, warned Canadians Justin Trudeau would impose a \"Netflix tax\" on their streaming subscriptions. What he was really talking about was the application of sales tax to these subscriptions, which wasn't collected because the service was provided to Canadians by a company not based in this country.</p><p>Similarly, sales tax doesn't apply to ads purchased from foreign websites like Facebook and Google - a key point of contention for groups like the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, which argue this unfairly disadvantages Canadian media.</p><p>But while Trudeau steadfastly denied Harper's charge about the Netflix tax five years ago, things have changed. Quebec and Saskatchewan applied their provincial sales taxes to off-jurisdiction digital services in 2019. British Columbia plans to follow suit. And so does the Liberal government in Ottawa, which Guilbeault has said intends to collect federal sales tax so that \"foreign platforms will pay the same taxes as Canadian digital companies.\"</p><p>However, as Geist explains, the Liberals also promised something else during the 2019 federal election. Their policy platform called for a special, three-per-cent tax on revenues that large foreign digital companies raise in Canada. The New Democrats, Conservatives and Bloc Qu&amp;#233;b&amp;#233;cois promised similar taxes.</p><p>But after taking power, the Liberals have suggested they won't act on this pledge without other countries doing the same. Guilbeault's office, for instance, pointed this week to a statement the minister posted on Twitter last December, in which he called the current tax situation \"unfair\" and said the government would address it \"in a fair, responsible manner\" as it works to \"build an international consensus\" on the issue.</p><p>\"They actually flip-flopped, in terms of which tax they seemed to be willing to move forward on,\" said Geist, pointing to the willingness to move first with the sales tax.</p><p>\"With sales taxes, it's consumers paying the sales taxes, and it's just the companies collecting and remitting,\" he said.</p><p>Opposition parties also remain supportive of additional taxes for foreign digital services. NDP MP Charlie Angus told the Star this week that the government should make sure these companies pay their share.</p><p>\"We see Facebook threatening Australia. They are not good corporate citizens,\" Angus said. \"They need to be paying tax. It's about fairness, because so much of the revenue comes from ads but they're not paying tax back in. So it's a simple, straightforward thing.\"</p><p>Conservative MP Michelle Rempel also pointed to commitments from her party's new leader Erin O'Toole, who called for tax changes to ensure there are taxes on digital ads bought from foreign websites like Facebook and Google. \"We're probably overdue as a country at looking at ways to ensure that companies are paying their fair share... We're open to looking at that,\" she said.</p><p>Google did not respond to a request for comment from the Star this week. Facebook, however, signalled in a background conversation with the Star that it is willing to pay more taxes in Canada.</p><p>The second area where Geist sees potential for federal action is in response to calls for foreign digital players to pay for Canadian content. Here, Geist said \"it's pretty clear (the government is) going to do something,\" given how Trudeau assigned Guilbeault to bring in legislation to modernize Canada's laws on broadcasting and telecommunications before the end of the year.</p><p>In his office's statement to the Star, Guilbeault said the government is committed to a \"more equitable digital regulatory framework\" in Canada. \"It is about levelling the playing field,\" he said. \"Those who benefit from the Canadian ecosystem must also contribute to it, through the Canadian broadcasting sector or the fair remuneration for the use of news content.\"</p><p>The Australian situation shows there are \"big risks\" for the Canadian government if it takes a similar path, Geist said. He said the removal of quality journalism from major digital platforms would leave users with potentially less credible sources of information, and questioned the assumption that news content - which, on platforms like Facebook, is shared voluntarily by news organizations and social media users - is worth significant amounts of money to digital giants.</p><p>\"The idea that we'd have Canadian news organizations shut out of large social media platforms sure isn't helping those Canadian media organizations,\" Geist said.</p><p>In a written statement to the Star, Kevin Chan, global director and head of public policy at Facebook Canada said removing news in Australia is the company's \"last choice\" and that it wants to \"work with news organizations and governments to support the development of sustainable business models.\" In Canada, that has included putting almost $9 million toward initiatives such as a program to fund jobs with The Canadian Press, he said, adding that \"we'll continue to do more.\"</p><p>Finally, Geist outlined how there are calls for Ottawa to do something around the proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms. Last year, the government earmarked $9 million for projects designed to educate people about online misinformation, and rolled out another $3.5 million to \"amplify the current efforts\" of organizations to help people assess health information online during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>For Rempel, it's better to emphasize educational initiatives than to create a system where tech companies like Facebook have to police misinformation and decide what should be removed from their websites. It would also be problematic for governments to set parameters for those decisions, she said.</p><p>She recognized the overall complexity of the issues facing Guilbeault and the government as they try to adapt to the realities of the 21st century digital economy and said she hopes the question of how to tax and regulate web giants figures prominently in the next federal election.</p><p>\"I hope to see, and I think that some of these policies should be part of any sort of an election campaign or platform, because they're really material to competitiveness and content-creation and tech innovation in our country, and we have to get it right,\" she said.</p><p>Of course, this wouldn't be the first time these issues have figured in an election campaign. All parties agree that something should be done. Promises have been made. Yet the challenge remains.</p><p>Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics for the Star.

This week, Canada's heritage minister used it for a regulatory spat in Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The Canadian government stands with our Australian partners and denounces any form of threats,\" Steven Guilbeault said in an emailed statement to the Star's Susan Delacourt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The \"threats\" Guilbeault referred to involved some of the world's richest and most influential corporations, Facebook and Google, which have separately warned Canada's friends down under that they will suspend services in Australia or block media organizations from using their platforms if Canberra follows through with a law they don't like.</p><p>That law would force these giants of the digital age - companies that rake in tens of billions of dollars each year and control the infrastructure of the internet's most-trafficked venues - to negotiate payments to the journalism organizations that create the news content hosted on their platforms.</p><p>Canada is working on its schemes to regulate these platforms, though the government is cagey about providing particulars. Guilbeault would not agree to speak with the Star on the record this week, offering instead to speak \"on background\" without being quoted or named. The Star declined, and Guilbeault's office provided a written statement in response to questions.</p><p>There may be good reason why a politician would tread carefully on this terrain. It's proven to be tricky.</p><p>Critics charge big multinational tech companies don't pay enough taxes and that this is unfair to domestic competitors. But when several countries, including Canada, floated proposals to create special taxes on revenue that these U.S.-based digital giants reap in their jurisdictions, the Americans threatened to impose tariffs - a threat Canada knows too well to be credible with Donald Trump in the White House.</p><p>Others want to see modernized rules in Canada to force companies like Netflix to showcase a minimum amount of Canadian content, just like radio and television stations. But when then-heritage minister M&amp;#233;lanie Joly unveiled Canada's new cultural policy in 2017, she was roundly criticized because it did not create requirements for foreign players to support domestic productions.</p><p>She was later shuffled to the tourism portfolio.</p><p>Meanwhile, many news organizations are bleeding dollars as Facebook and Google gobble up the vast majority of all digital ad revenue in Canada, according to one dire report on the financial state of this country's news media.</p><p>Clearly there's a lot for the government to grapple with.</p><p>The way University of Ottawa professor and Canada Research Chair in internet and E-Commerce Law Michael Geist sees it, Guilbeault could make decisions in several areas. The first involves taxation.</p><p>Geist noted how the political will to go down this route has changed since 2015, when Stephen Harper, then prime minister, warned Canadians Justin Trudeau would impose a \"Netflix tax\" on their streaming subscriptions. What he was really talking about was the application of sales tax to these subscriptions, which wasn't collected because the service was provided to Canadians by a company not based in this country.</p><p>Similarly, sales tax doesn't apply to ads purchased from foreign websites like Facebook and Google - a key point of contention for groups like the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, which argue this unfairly disadvantages Canadian media.</p><p>But while Trudeau steadfastly denied Harper's charge about the Netflix tax five years ago, things have changed. Quebec and Saskatchewan applied their provincial sales taxes to off-jurisdiction digital services in 2019. British Columbia plans to follow suit. And so does the Liberal government in Ottawa, which Guilbeault has said intends to collect federal sales tax so that \"foreign platforms will pay the same taxes as Canadian digital companies.\"</p><p>However, as Geist explains, the Liberals also promised something else during the 2019 federal election. Their policy platform called for a special, three-per-cent tax on revenues that large foreign digital companies raise in Canada. The New Democrats, Conservatives and Bloc Qu&amp;#233;b&amp;#233;cois promised similar taxes.</p><p>But after taking power, the Liberals have suggested they won't act on this pledge without other countries doing the same. Guilbeault's office, for instance, pointed this week to a statement the minister posted on Twitter last December, in which he called the current tax situation \"unfair\" and said the government would address it \"in a fair, responsible manner\" as it works to \"build an international consensus\" on the issue.</p><p>\"They actually flip-flopped, in terms of which tax they seemed to be willing to move forward on,\" said Geist, pointing to the willingness to move first with the sales tax.</p><p>\"With sales taxes, it's consumers paying the sales taxes, and it's just the companies collecting and remitting,\" he said.</p><p>Opposition parties also remain supportive of additional taxes for foreign digital services. NDP MP Charlie Angus told the Star this week that the government should make sure these companies pay their share.</p><p>\"We see Facebook threatening Australia. They are not good corporate citizens,\" Angus said. \"They need to be paying tax. It's about fairness, because so much of the revenue comes from ads but they're not paying tax back in. So it's a simple, straightforward thing.\"</p><p>Conservative MP Michelle Rempel also pointed to commitments from her party's new leader Erin O'Toole, who called for tax changes to ensure there are taxes on digital ads bought from foreign websites like Facebook and Google. \"We're probably overdue as a country at looking at ways to ensure that companies are paying their fair share... We're open to looking at that,\" she said.</p><p>Google did not respond to a request for comment from the Star this week. Facebook, however, signalled in a background conversation with the Star that it is willing to pay more taxes in Canada.</p><p>The second area where Geist sees potential for federal action is in response to calls for foreign digital players to pay for Canadian content. Here, Geist said \"it's pretty clear (the government is) going to do something,\" given how Trudeau assigned Guilbeault to bring in legislation to modernize Canada's laws on broadcasting and telecommunications before the end of the year.</p><p>In his office's statement to the Star, Guilbeault said the government is committed to a \"more equitable digital regulatory framework\" in Canada. \"It is about levelling the playing field,\" he said. \"Those who benefit from the Canadian ecosystem must also contribute to it, through the Canadian broadcasting sector or the fair remuneration for the use of news content.\"</p><p>The Australian situation shows there are \"big risks\" for the Canadian government if it takes a similar path, Geist said. He said the removal of quality journalism from major digital platforms would leave users with potentially less credible sources of information, and questioned the assumption that news content - which, on platforms like Facebook, is shared voluntarily by news organizations and social media users - is worth significant amounts of money to digital giants.</p><p>\"The idea that we'd have Canadian news organizations shut out of large social media platforms sure isn't helping those Canadian media organizations,\" Geist said.</p><p>In a written statement to the Star, Kevin Chan, global director and head of public policy at Facebook Canada said removing news in Australia is the company's \"last choice\" and that it wants to \"work with news organizations and governments to support the development of sustainable business models.\" In Canada, that has included putting almost $9 million toward initiatives such as a program to fund jobs with The Canadian Press, he said, adding that \"we'll continue to do more.\"</p><p>Finally, Geist outlined how there are calls for Ottawa to do something around the proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms. Last year, the government earmarked $9 million for projects designed to educate people about online misinformation, and rolled out another $3.5 million to \"amplify the current efforts\" of organizations to help people assess health information online during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>For Rempel, it's better to emphasize educational initiatives than to create a system where tech companies like Facebook have to police misinformation and decide what should be removed from their websites. It would also be problematic for governments to set parameters for those decisions, she said.</p><p>She recognized the overall complexity of the issues facing Guilbeault and the government as they try to adapt to the realities of the 21st century digital economy and said she hopes the question of how to tax and regulate web giants figures prominently in the next federal election.</p><p>\"I hope to see, and I think that some of these policies should be part of any sort of an election campaign or platform, because they're really material to competitiveness and content-creation and tech innovation in our country, and we have to get it right,\" she said.</p><p>Of course, this wouldn't be the first time these issues have figured in an election campaign. All parties agree that something should be done. Promises have been made. Yet the challenge remains.</p><p>Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics for the Star.

What he was really talking about was the application of sales tax to these subscriptions, which wasn't collected because the service was provided to Canadians by a company not based in this country.</p><p>Similarly, sales tax doesn't apply to ads purchased from foreign websites like Facebook and Google - a key point of contention for groups like the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, which argue this unfairly disadvantages Canadian media.</p><p>But while Trudeau steadfastly denied Harper's charge about the Netflix tax five years ago, things have changed. Quebec and Saskatchewan applied their provincial sales taxes to off-jurisdiction digital services in 2019. British Columbia plans to follow suit. And so does the Liberal government in Ottawa, which Guilbeault has said intends to collect federal sales tax so that \"foreign platforms will pay the same taxes as Canadian digital companies.\"</p><p>However, as Geist explains, the Liberals also promised something else during the 2019 federal election. Their policy platform called for a special, three-per-cent tax on revenues that large foreign digital companies raise in Canada. The New Democrats, Conservatives and Bloc Qu&amp;#233;b&amp;#233;cois promised similar taxes.</p><p>But after taking power, the Liberals have suggested they won't act on this pledge without other countries doing the same. Guilbeault's office, for instance, pointed this week to a statement the minister posted on Twitter last December, in which he called the current tax situation \"unfair\" and said the government would address it \"in a fair, responsible manner\" as it works to \"build an international consensus\" on the issue.</p><p>\"They actually flip-flopped, in terms of which tax they seemed to be willing to move forward on,\" said Geist, pointing to the willingness to move first with the sales tax.</p><p>\"With sales taxes, it's consumers paying the sales taxes, and it's just the companies collecting and remitting,\" he said.</p><p>Opposition parties also remain supportive of additional taxes for foreign digital services. NDP MP Charlie Angus told the Star this week that the government should make sure these companies pay their share.</p><p>\"We see Facebook threatening Australia. They are not good corporate citizens,\" Angus said. \"They need to be paying tax. It's about fairness, because so much of the revenue comes from ads but they're not paying tax back in. So it's a simple, straightforward thing.\"</p><p>Conservative MP Michelle Rempel also pointed to commitments from her party's new leader Erin O'Toole, who called for tax changes to ensure there are taxes on digital ads bought from foreign websites like Facebook and Google. \"We're probably overdue as a country at looking at ways to ensure that companies are paying their fair share... We're open to looking at that,\" she said.</p><p>Google did not respond to a request for comment from the Star this week. Facebook, however, signalled in a background conversation with the Star that it is willing to pay more taxes in Canada.</p><p>The second area where Geist sees potential for federal action is in response to calls for foreign digital players to pay for Canadian content. Here, Geist said \"it's pretty clear (the government is) going to do something,\" given how Trudeau assigned Guilbeault to bring in legislation to modernize Canada's laws on broadcasting and telecommunications before the end of the year.</p><p>In his office's statement to the Star, Guilbeault said the government is committed to a \"more equitable digital regulatory framework\" in Canada. \"It is about levelling the playing field,\" he said. \"Those who benefit from the Canadian ecosystem must also contribute to it, through the Canadian broadcasting sector or the fair remuneration for the use of news content.\"</p><p>The Australian situation shows there are \"big risks\" for the Canadian government if it takes a similar path, Geist said. He said the removal of quality journalism from major digital platforms would leave users with potentially less credible sources of information, and questioned the assumption that news content - which, on platforms like Facebook, is shared voluntarily by news organizations and social media users - is worth significant amounts of money to digital giants.</p><p>\"The idea that we'd have Canadian news organizations shut out of large social media platforms sure isn't helping those Canadian media organizations,\" Geist said.</p><p>In a written statement to the Star, Kevin Chan, global director and head of public policy at Facebook Canada said removing news in Australia is the company's \"last choice\" and that it wants to \"work with news organizations and governments to support the development of sustainable business models.\" In Canada, that has included putting almost $9 million toward initiatives such as a program to fund jobs with The Canadian Press, he said, adding that \"we'll continue to do more.\"</p><p>Finally, Geist outlined how there are calls for Ottawa to do something around the proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms. Last year, the government earmarked $9 million for projects designed to educate people about online misinformation, and rolled out another $3.5 million to \"amplify the current efforts\" of organizations to help people assess health information online during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>For Rempel, it's better to emphasize educational initiatives than to create a system where tech companies like Facebook have to police misinformation and decide what should be removed from their websites. It would also be problematic for governments to set parameters for those decisions, she said.</p><p>She recognized the overall complexity of the issues facing Guilbeault and the government as they try to adapt to the realities of the 21st century digital economy and said she hopes the question of how to tax and regulate web giants figures prominently in the next federal election.</p><p>\"I hope to see, and I think that some of these policies should be part of any sort of an election campaign or platform, because they're really material to competitiveness and content-creation and tech innovation in our country, and we have to get it right,\" she said.</p><p>Of course, this wouldn't be the first time these issues have figured in an election campaign. All parties agree that something should be done. Promises have been made. Yet the challenge remains.</p><p>Alex Ballingall is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics for the Star.

But will Canada follow?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After an 18-month landmark study, the final report from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on regulating big platforms and to encourage media competition was released in July. It didn't get a lot of attention outside the country initially, but it is a watershed moment for consumers in the digital era as global regulators are examining whether it provides a blueprint for the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is one of the first instances where an independent regulator is looking at antitrust and competition law through the lens of consumer protection regarding digital platforms and the publishing industry. Google and Facebook are responsible for more than 70 per cent of all digital advertising, with traditional publishers and others struggling for the remaining piece of the market. That has left a hole in local news, not just in Australia, but in other countries including Canada.</p><p>\"This is the first time we've seen really a credible, independent, nonindustry panel really examine the media implications and what it will cost the economy,\" says John Hinds, CEO of News Media Canada, which represents Canadian newspapers. \"This isn't something that can be regarded as a partisan report by the industry or something that is politicized. It's looking at how the big platforms are affecting consumers and the economy through a very practical lens.\"</p><p>The sweeping 632-page report comes with 23 recommendations, including methods to ensure there is enough competition in the market, to determine if there is sufficient transparency in the prices charged for advertising, and to require platforms to develop a code of conduct to make sure news businesses are treated fairly. News businesses would also be given notifications about any changes to algorithms that would affect news rankings on websites.</p><p>Other recommendations include taxpayer funding for local news, and allowing donations for non-profit organizations engaging in public interest journalism to be tax deductible. The digital platforms have three months to respond to the report. The Australian government has said it will have a response to the report by the end of the year.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Canadian Competition Bureau said the bureau was aware of the Australian initiative to investigate digital platforms, but would not confirm whether they were considering a similar study.</p><p>\"As you know, the Bureau closely follows the developments of investigations by our international counterparts while remaining mindful of the different legal regimes in each jurisdiction,\" said spokesperson Jayme Albert in a statement to the Star. \"The Bureau continues to closely monitor firms in the digital economy to ensure they do not engage in anti-competitive conduct.\"</p><p>Local news has become an endangered species, with many smaller newspapers disappearing in the face of digital disruption. The New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet said \"the greatest crisis in American journalism is the death of local news\" at an International News Media Association (INMA) conference. Baquet predicted that \"most local newspapers in America are going to die in the next five years, except for the ones that have been bought by a billionaire.\"</p><p>INMA, whose board of directors includes Torstar publisher John Boynton, considers and shares global strategies for media growth.</p><p>A study released in June by the organization finds that Google alone made $4.7 billion US in 2018 from publishers through advertising linked to its search engine.</p><p>Google has denied that figure, but there's no doubt that the search engine along with Facebook takes the lion's share of the digital advertising market.</p><p>Big tech has been under major regulatory scrutiny this year, not just for the impact on legacy media, but on privacy and antitrust issues.</p><p>Facebook was recently fined $5 billion US by the Federal Trade Commission over privacy breaches in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The U.S. Justice Department has also launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into the platforms, and the European Commission in July said they were launching an antitrust investigation into the activities of Amazon. And lawmakers in the U.S. have introduced bipartisan legislation (the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act) looking at how the newspaper industry can reach an agreement with the platforms for a share of the advertising revenue, giving them a four-year window to come up with a deal.</p><p>But while the European Union and the U.S. have launched aggressive investigations into the big digital platforms, other countries, including Canada, have taken more of a wait-and-see approach. Part of the reasoning may have been that the bigger jurisdictions have greater resources to deal with the world's biggest companies.</p><p>Not so for Australia. The country of 25 million, compared to Canada's 37 million, is not only less populated, but has a smaller economy (13th largest in the world by GDP, compared to Canada's 10th position). But they have decided to tackle the issue head on.</p><p>\"Australia, like Canada, are commodity-based economies with large land masses that are facing similar issues in regard to disruption,\" says Mihkel Tombak, Hatch Professor of Technology Management and Strategy at the University of Toronto and an antitrust expert. \"Canada though has historically been more passive and sometimes waiting for other people to take the lead.

But will Canada follow?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After an 18-month landmark study, the final report from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on regulating big platforms and to encourage media competition was released in July. It didn't get a lot of attention outside the country initially, but it is a watershed moment for consumers in the digital era as global regulators are examining whether it provides a blueprint for the future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is one of the first instances where an independent regulator is looking at antitrust and competition law through the lens of consumer protection regarding digital platforms and the publishing industry. Google and Facebook are responsible for more than 70 per cent of all digital advertising, with traditional publishers and others struggling for the remaining piece of the market. That has left a hole in local news, not just in Australia, but in other countries including Canada.</p><p>\"This is the first time we've seen really a credible, independent, nonindustry panel really examine the media implications and what it will cost the economy,\" says John Hinds, CEO of News Media Canada, which represents Canadian newspapers. \"This isn't something that can be regarded as a partisan report by the industry or something that is politicized. It's looking at how the big platforms are affecting consumers and the economy through a very practical lens.\"</p><p>The sweeping 632-page report comes with 23 recommendations, including methods to ensure there is enough competition in the market, to determine if there is sufficient transparency in the prices charged for advertising, and to require platforms to develop a code of conduct to make sure news businesses are treated fairly. News businesses would also be given notifications about any changes to algorithms that would affect news rankings on websites.</p><p>Other recommendations include taxpayer funding for local news, and allowing donations for non-profit organizations engaging in public interest journalism to be tax deductible. The digital platforms have three months to respond to the report. The Australian government has said it will have a response to the report by the end of the year.</p><p>A spokesperson for the Canadian Competition Bureau said the bureau was aware of the Australian initiative to investigate digital platforms, but would not confirm whether they were considering a similar study.</p><p>\"As you know, the Bureau closely follows the developments of investigations by our international counterparts while remaining mindful of the different legal regimes in each jurisdiction,\" said spokesperson Jayme Albert in a statement to the Star. \"The Bureau continues to closely monitor firms in the digital economy to ensure they do not engage in anti-competitive conduct.\"</p><p>Local news has become an endangered species, with many smaller newspapers disappearing in the face of digital disruption. The New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet said \"the greatest crisis in American journalism is the death of local news\" at an International News Media Association (INMA) conference. Baquet predicted that \"most local newspapers in America are going to die in the next five years, except for the ones that have been bought by a billionaire.\"</p><p>INMA, whose board of directors includes Torstar publisher John Boynton, considers and shares global strategies for media growth.</p><p>A study released in June by the organization finds that Google alone made $4.7 billion US in 2018 from publishers through advertising linked to its search engine.</p><p>Google has denied that figure, but there's no doubt that the search engine along with Facebook takes the lion's share of the digital advertising market.</p><p>Big tech has been under major regulatory scrutiny this year, not just for the impact on legacy media, but on privacy and antitrust issues.</p><p>Facebook was recently fined $5 billion US by the Federal Trade Commission over privacy breaches in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The U.S. Justice Department has also launched a sweeping antitrust investigation into the platforms, and the European Commission in July said they were launching an antitrust investigation into the activities of Amazon. And lawmakers in the U.S. have introduced bipartisan legislation (the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act) looking at how the newspaper industry can reach an agreement with the platforms for a share of the advertising revenue, giving them a four-year window to come up with a deal.</p><p>But while the European Union and the U.S. have launched aggressive investigations into the big digital platforms, other countries, including Canada, have taken more of a wait-and-see approach. Part of the reasoning may have been that the bigger jurisdictions have greater resources to deal with the world's biggest companies.</p><p>Not so for Australia. The country of 25 million, compared to Canada's 37 million, is not only less populated, but has a smaller economy (13th largest in the world by GDP, compared to Canada's 10th position). But they have decided to tackle the issue head on.</p><p>\"Australia, like Canada, are commodity-based economies with large land masses that are facing similar issues in regard to disruption,\" says Mihkel Tombak, Hatch Professor of Technology Management and Strategy at the University of Toronto and an antitrust expert. \"Canada though has historically been more passive and sometimes waiting for other people to take the lead. This could either be a lack of self confidence, or maybe it's the smart thing to do. Let them experiment first and see what works.\"</p><p>Albert said the Canadian Competition Bureau was \"unable to confirm\" whether it was investigating \"any specific matters with regard to the publishing industry, as the Bureau is required by law to conduct work confidentially.\"</p><p>News Media Canada's Hinds says he has been in touch with the bureau to try and arrange a meeting to determine next steps.</p><p>\"A lot of the discussion around media is about democracy and privacy. But the competition bureau can look at the issue through the lens of a tangible economic perspective and that's certainly what we want,\" Hinds says. \"What the Australian example is telling us is that while everyone is looking for a silver bullet, this is an incredibly complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach.\"</p><p>What the Australian Competition Bureau didn't do, however, was recommend the breakup of the large platforms, although it did recommended changes that would force companies to inform regulators about the impact mergers would have on competition.</p><p>\"You don't necessarily want to discourage them from innovating or growing bigger, but what you want to do is to stop them from behaving badly so it stops other people from growing and innovating,\" U of T's Tombak says. \"But the important thing is that the Australians are taking this very seriously.\"</p><p>One way to regulate transnational companies with global reach might be the formation of an international competition authority, similar to the World Trade Organization, Tombak says.</p><p>\"It's been talked about before.

This week\u2019s issue is written by <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/nyt-australia-newsletter?module=inline\">Isabella Kwai</url>, a reporter with the Australia bureau.</p><p>Recently, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/nyt-australia-newsletter?module=inline\">coronavirus</url> restrictions began lifting, I met up with my good friend Sofia for a long walk along Sydney\u2019s coastline. The weather had turned, finally, from a perennial summer to something chillier, but the ocean was full of the usual smattering of surfers and brave swimmers.</p><p>Except for guards warning people against loitering, it felt almost like we had traveled back to a pre-pandemic past \u2014 except that version is a fantasy that no longer exists.</p><p>With <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/nyt-australia-newsletter?module=inline\">Australia</url> having controlled the pandemic\u2019s spread, for now, much of the country is putting in place a three-step plan to restore normalcy \u2014 allowing restaurants and cafes to reopen for small groups and school to resume at least a few days a week. We are better off than many, escaping much of the devastation that is still ravaging much of the world.</p><p>But it means we are confronting the beginning of a new reality: What does normal look like when the virus is still a threat, and when life has already unquestionably changed?</p><p>New figures reveal that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/nyt-australia-newsletter?module=inline\">600,000 people in Australia lost their jobs in April</url>, with the unemployment rate now above 6 percent. And with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/nyt-australia-newsletter?module=inline\">friction increasing with China over a call for an inquiry</url> in to the pandemic\u2019s origins, the country is facing a geopolitical shift in which it may suddenly play more leader than follower on the world stage, with all the risks that come with that.</p><p>Then there are things that have been knocked off course and are difficult to quantify: friends and family <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/nyt-australia-newsletter?module=inline\">indefinitely separated</url>, rising incidents of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/nyt-australia-newsletter?module=inline\">anti-Chinese racism</url>, and the emotional impact on all of us, particularly health care workers on the front lines.</p><p>While many people are welcoming the revival of our economy, the life we return to now will still be full of uncertainty. Will a resurgence of the virus happen, as it has in other countries that<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/nyt-australia-newsletter?module=inline\">initially had a handle on the outbreak</url>? Is it even possible to plan for the future? Will we ever be able to cross borders so easily again?</p><p>But as I\u2019ve spoken to doctors, cafe owners and friends who have lost their jobs, one thing has struck me deeply: the enduring ingenuity of the human spirit everywhere.</p><p>In New York, the 7 p.m. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/nyt-australia-newsletter?module=inline\">daily tribute to health workers</url> is still going on. In New Zealand, restaurants have banded together to pool staff for delivery services. In Taiwan, baseball games are going forward <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/nyt-australia-newsletter?module=inline\">with cardboard cutout spectators</url>, and one band of Australian soccer fans, dying for entertainment, helped create a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/nyt-australia-newsletter?module=inline\">surprising following for the Belarusian soccer team</url>.</p><p>That walk with my friend Sofia may be one of our last. After weeks of agonizing back and forth, immigration pressures are forcing her to leave Australia, her home of six years, to return to Sweden \u2014 and to a different future than the one she had envisioned.</p><p>Still, I keep coming back to the moments I\u2019ve been fortunate to share with her and everyone else as we fumbled our way through the lockdown \u2014 two friends saying their vows over Zoom as the Internet froze, the taste of the air after a day inside, how green the trees looked the first time we emerged from our homes.</p><p>I wonder what we\u2019ll hold onto, and what will fade.</p><p>Has your life changed during the pandemic?

Thanks to those of you who wrote in with your own recommendations.</p><p>I had traveled to Canada to visit my grandparents in the 1980s as a teen and learned the value of a good martini. This was my introduction to cocktails and I was excited to share my newfound knowledge on graduation night. I was dressed to impress, and thought I would even more so impress my date by ordering a martini at the bar. After a blank stare from the bartender, he returned soon after with a tall glass of Martini Cinzano on ice with no gin, no olives. I proceeded to describe how to make a martini like my grandfather made. The glaring response I got was a tall glass of ice filled with gin.</p><p>I am so excited to hear Australia is growing out of its hardened fist of just getting pissed and is appreciating what the cocktail can bring to life. </p><p>\u2014 Kevin Cushing</p><p>Enjoying the Australia Letter? <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/nyt-australia-newsletter?module=inline\">Sign up here</url> or forward to a friend.</p><p>For more Australia coverage and discussion, start your day with your local <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/nyt-australia-newsletter?module=inline\">Morning Briefing</url> and join us in our <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/series/nyt-australia-newsletter?module=inline\">Facebook group</url>.</p><p>PHOTO: Manly Beach in Sydney remains open to people exercising and surfing, although with some restrictions.

Australia is leading the charge, with its competitions authority demanding that Google and Facebook pay $600m (\u00a3331m) a year to Australian media for using its content.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has been relentless in its pursuit of Google, suing it for misuse of personal data and this month challenging the search engine's acquisition of Fitbit. Google and Facebook are contesting the proposed charges for news but the ACCC's treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, says \"we're prepared for this fight\".</p><p>In the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will this week complete its study of the digital advertising market. Its interim report, published in December, found that Google had a 90 per cent share of the UK's \u00a36bn search advertising market and that Facebook had a majority of the \u00a35bn online display advertising market. This profitability was \"well beyond what we would expect in a competitive market\", the CMA said.</p><p>Last week, at the House of Lords, senior figures from the UK's biggest news companies expressed hope that the dominance of Google and Facebook (which together take \u00a310bn a year in UK digital advertising, 70 per cent of the market) was finally about to be curbed. David Dinsmore, chief operating officer of News UK, publishers of The Times and The Sun, described the Australian developments as \"really exciting\" and said they could lead to Rupert Murdoch's company getting \"market value\" for its content.</p><p>Peter Wright, editor emeritus of DMG Media, publisher of the Daily Mail, Metro and i, told peers that payments from the tech giants would be \"transformational\" for news websites, particularly those in local media. He expressed the belief that the ACCC had the backing of the Australian government and \"this will be made to work\". French competition authorities ordered Google to make payments to French publishers in April. The House of Lords' Communications and Digital Committee is examining the future of journalism and will report in the autumn, which could add to pressure for regulation. \"We can't really afford for the UK to be left behind,\" Dinsmore told peers.</p><p>Facebook and Google see themselves as drivers of traffic to news sites. Last Thursday, Google announced a \"new news\" project which pays select publishers in Germany, Australia and Brazil for \"high-quality\" journalism. Facebook began payments to some US publishers, including the Wall Street Journal, in October.</p><p>Even in America, the platforms are being investigated by the Department of Justice and state attorneys general for possible antitrust violations. A coalition of 2,000 US news groups is demanding to collectively negotiate with Google.</p><p>Whether there is political will to punish companies that generate so much American soft power is doubtful. Donald Trump has a complicated relationship with big tech but celebrates it as a symbol of American success, likening the initials of Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Apple to his \"Make America Great Again\" slogan.</p><p>The platforms, despite their unfathomable riches, are struggling to grow in the current advertising slump. Both Google and Facebook missed analysts' expectations for share earnings in the first quarter.</p><p>Mark Thompson, the Britishborn president and CEO of the New York Times Company, thinks the digital platforms are finally prepared to change. \"They are beginning to realise that there's a lot of regulatory and political pressure on them,\" he told the Freudcast podcast last week. \"I talk to the leaders of these companies and maybe I'm na\u00efve but I genuinely believe that they want to do a better job themselves.\"</p><p>But then Thompson reckons that advertising-funded news is a \"really unreliable\" business model and a road to oblivion. He sent a chilling warning to media outlets that are neglecting their digital products. \"For some of them, I think they will run out of time soon.\" The New York Times is focused on a subscription model and has six million signed up but I wrote here last week that UK consumers are showing marked reluctance to pay for digital news.</p><p>The former head of the BBC and Channel 4 also warned that advertiser-funded television, which has been ravaged by the economic paralysis caused by coronavirus, \"looks very vulnerable to me\". He said that broadcasters who expect a \"cyclical\" recovery of TV advertising are mistaken. \"I don't think it's going to come back.\"</p><p>Digital advertising is worth $330bn (\u00a3268bn) globally but it won't sustain quality media - unless the platforms can be persuaded to hand over some of the pie.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IINDUK-DMGTCHPDSTRY000041523813ARTICLETEXT1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IINDUK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607M-DKR1-F072-44G5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">379735</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"808\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Print Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>i-Independent Print Ltd</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"17013\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 29, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

If implemented, these steps will set a global precedent for checking Big Tech's global oligopoly over advertising and online news.</p><p><br/><br/>The Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said that the government intended to \"lift the veil\" on the closely guarded algorithms the firms use to collect and monetise users' data, and accepted the ACCC's \"overrising conclusion that there is a need for reform\", Reuters reported. Drawing attention to Facebook and Google's market dominance, he said that the two companies accounted for 61 per cent of online advertising revenue between them, despite sourcing their content from media organisations, ABC reported.<br/><br/>To no one's surprise, Google and Facebook have opposed tighter regulation and said that ACCC had underestimated the level of competition for online advertising. Traditional media owners have backed the reform, as per Reuters.<br/><br/>This inquiry was directed by the then Treasurer Scott Morrison on December 4, 2017. It looked into the effect of search engines, social media platforms and digital content aggregation platforms on competition in media and advertising. The preliminary report was released on December 10, 2018. ACCC is the Australian anti-trust watchdog. The proposals will be subjected to a 12-week public consultation before the government acts on the report at the end of the year, ABC reported.<br/><br/>Australia is investigating Google and Facebook<br/><br/>According to Reuters, ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said that five different investigations of Google and Facebook were under way, and more could follow. ACCC's report said that it expects to conclude these investigations later in the year.<br/><br/>Adverse effects of digital platforms<br/><br/>Most adverse effects stem from dominance of Google and Facebook in the market, according to the report:<br/><br/>* Google and Facebook's market power distorted businesses' ability to compete in advertising, media, and other markets<br/><br/>* Digital advertising markets are opaque with highly uncertain money flows<br/><br/>* Consumers not adequately informed about how their data is collected and used; have little control over the data collected<br/><br/>* News content creators reliant on dominant digital platforms, but unable to monetise their content<br/><br/>* Australian society, like others in the world, affected by disinformation and increasing mistrust of news<br/><br/>Recommendations<br/><br/>23 recommendations were made:<br/><br/>1. Changes to Australia's merger laws to require consideration of the effect of potential competition and to recognise the importance of data</p><p>2. Advance notice of acquisitions that would alert the ACCC to proposed acquisitions by large digital platforms that may impact competition in Australia</p><p>3. Google should allow Australian Android users to choose their search engine and internet browser, as in Europe, instead of providing them with defaults</p><p>4. Government establish a specialist digital platforms branch within the ACCC, with standing information-gathering powers, to proactively monitor and investigate potentially anti-competitive conduct by digital platforms and conduct that may breach Australian consumer laws, and to undertake rolling market studies</p><p>5. Inquiry into ad tech services and advertising agencies by the specialist digital platform branch recommended earlier</p><p>6.

It is part of an innovative, cross-government technology service deal, inked by the Turnbull government with the US business tech giant, that gives all federal agencies access to IBM's cloud infrastructure, cyber-security practice, applications and system software. </p><p><br/><br/>The highly strategic whole-of-government service agreement will enable the $450 billion big Australian public sector access to IBM's technology platform. IBM is a heavyweight in the enterprise space, in particular in financial services, and already has major agreements with Canberra's digital giants, Human Services, the ATO, Home Affairs and Defence. <br/><br/>This agreement enables the 900-plus long tail of medium to small government agencies to also tap IBM's deep capability in data system design and application deployment, while giving the government's big four tech shops more flexibility to explore innovative technologies and applications and cost benefits on existing contracts. <br/><br/>The deal, led by the Digital Transformation Agency, is the highest-value tech contract negotiated by the Australian government, and reflects the long-term anticipated value of the agreement. <br/><br/>\"The agreement, led by the Digital Transformation Agency, is the highest value tech contract negotiated by the Australian government, and reflects the long-term anticipated value of the agreement.\" <br/><br/>The agreement represents a much more assertive approach to the big tech vendors, using the federal government's $6-10 billion annual tech spend to leverage with IBM an ambitious embrace of three emerging foundational technologies, which many digital leaders expect will be deeply transformative for government. <br/><br/>Under the deal, IBM's AI and cloud technology can be used by Australian agencies to quickly bring more self-service, automation and digitisation to government services. IBM and the Digital Transformation Agency will convene government and industry leaders to prioritise the introduction of new technologies to citizen services. <br/><br/>Announcing the pathbreaking agreement, Minister for Digital Transformation Michael Keenan said the all-of-government service agreement would save money and would help drive the deployment of simpler and easier services. He said it is a major step towards the government's aggressive goal to be one of the top three digital governments by 2025. <br/><br/>\"The deal has also been structured to enable small and medium-sized firms to engage with IBM through 'channel partner' arrangements to ensure they also benefit,\" Keenan said. <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rapid access to emerging technologies</emphasis><br/>Keenan is also minister for human services and earlier this week made an impassioned plea to take a positive view of data sharing and integration within government. Keenan declared data is not \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://ministers.pmc.gov.au/keenan/2018/committee-economic-development-australia-speech\">a four letter word</url>\", citing early examples where integration of data sets was supporting predictive applications in drug and weather data. <br/><br/>New DTA chief executive, Randall Brugeaud, said the five-year deal would save about $100 million over that period. <br/><br/>IBM's Australian Managing Director David La Rose said this will give Australians rapid access to emerging technologies as they are developed, while helping the government re-engineer its platforms to protect and encrypt citizen data against modern-day cyber-security threats.  <br/><br/>\"This agreement is a testament to our 40-year partnership with the Australian Government. It shows trust and belief in our ability to transform and provide world-leading capabilities, leveraging our investments locally in AI, blockchain, quantum and cloud. We look forward to helping the Australian Government to redefine the digital experience for the benefit of all Australians.\" <br/><br/>The government's R&amp;D accelerator programs are to be driven through three hubs in Melbourne, Canberra and the Gold Coast.  <br/><br/>IBM has major research infrastructure and capability embedded in the Melbourne University health ad bio tech precinct, leading the world in the real-world application of AI to melanoma. This is expected to be the foundation of a research team to accelerate the application of blockchain, AI and quantum computing across the emerging public sector platforms.  <br/><br/>Separate units of expert computer engineers and developers will also be based on the Gold Coast and Canberra to work on leading cyber-security solutions for data protection and the application of super-computing for government services. <br/><br/>Blockchain enables transactional data to be trusted, without the need for complex centralised control systems. Public sector pilot projects around Australia are expected to begin mature-to-early operational applications in the coming year, but technologists believes blockchain could underpin the virtualisation of major government controlled or funded systems in the health, finance, transport, safety, energy, education, regulatory and communications sectors. <br/><br/><br/><br/></p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">READ MORE: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.themandarin.com.au/94825-blockchain-the-honest-bureaucrat/\">Blockchain\u00a0 \u2012 the honest bureaucrat</url></emphasis></emphasis><br/></p></bodyText></listItem></list><p><br/><br/><br/><br/>AI offers the government the opportunity to deeply learn from its huge data pools sitting in its major revenue, payments, service, and safety systems and automate many of the manual systems still deeply embedded in state and federal tech platforms. AI applications are rapidly being deployed to enable computers to learn from case files what are the most effective solutions and offer a major opportunity to empower human service frontline workers by enabling them to learn from the vast amount of knowledge sitting in case management files. <br/>'As\u00a0profound as the rollout of electricity'<br/>Quantum is an uber powerful computing technology that promises to power up many of the heavy data processes that will come as federal, stare and local governments seek to integrate major life services, like an easy solution to wind up the affairs of a deceased family.  <br/><br/>Quantum computing evangelists believe it will be as profound as the rollout of electricity. The Australian government has already made a $25 million investment in the UNSW Quantum lab in Sydney. The same lab also has multi-million dollar investments from the NSW government, Telstra and the Commonwealth Bank. \u00a0 <br/><br/>IBM has once of the world's leading quantum computing labs, located outside of New York City. <br/><br/>The government is also negotiating with other major tech vendors to drive a better all-of-government result. Outside of the big defence primes, IBM and Telstra dominate the tech vendor space in Canberra, but with major relationships with Fujitsu, SAP and Oracle. <br/><br/>Keenan said the coordinated procurement process allows for better oversight of contract delivery and greater\u00a0accountability of how public funds are being spent. Since 2008, whole-of-government agreements have saved the government about $1.2 billion. <br/><br/>The DTA agreement with IBM comes as the government's fifth chief digital officer in just over three and half years, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.themandarin.com.au/94730-slater-out-brugeaud-in-another-new-ceo-for-the-digital-transformation-agency/\">Randall Brugeaud, takes over as CEO of the DTA</url> from former NAB executive Gavin Slater, who is going back to the private sector after 12 months in the job. <br/><br/>The deal represents a major recovery for the US tech giant. IBM\u00a0 had to negotiate a major compensation deal with Treasury, after the first all-digital census was forced to be shut down for two days in 2016, when ABS chief David Kalisch took the call not to risk the suspected infiltration of census data. IBM provided the census solution. <br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IBM is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.themandarin.com.au/partner-pages/\">a partner</url> of The Mandarin</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MANDRN-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MANDRN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SR1-KJG1-JD6R-T29F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">435685</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1296\"/><timeReceived>7:05 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mandarin</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 5, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The R&amp;D program will be driven through three hubs in Melbourne, Canberra and the Gold Coast. It is part of an innovative, cross-government technology service deal, inked by the Turnbull government with the US business tech giant, that gives all federal agencies access to IBM's cloud infrastructure, cyber-security practice, applications and system software.  The highly strategic whole-of-government service agreement will enable the $450 billion big Australian public sector access to IBM's technology platform. IBM is a heavyweight in the enterprise space, in particular in financial services, and already has major agreements with Canberra's digital giants, Human Services, the Australian Taxation Office, Home Affairs and Defence.  This agreement enables the 900-plus long tail of medium to small government agencies to also tap IBM's deep capability in data system design and application deployment, while giving the government's big four tech shops more flexibility to explore innovative technologies and applications and cost benefits on existing contracts.  The deal, led by the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA), is the highest-value tech contract negotiated by the Australian government, and reflects the long-term anticipated value of the agreement.  The agreement represents a much more assertive approach to the big tech vendors, using the federal government's $6-10 billion annual tech spend to leverage with IBM an ambitious embrace of three emerging foundational technologies, which many digital leaders expect will be deeply transformative for government.  Under the deal, IBM's AI and cloud technology can be used by Australian agencies to quickly bring more self-service, automation and digitisation to government services. IBM and the Digital Transformation Agency will convene government and industry leaders to prioritise the introduction of new technologies to citizen services.  Announcing the pathbreaking agreement, Minister for Digital Transformation Michael Keenan said the all-of-government service agreement would save money and would help drive the deployment of simpler and easier services. He said it is a major step towards the government's aggressive goal to be one of the top three digital governments by 2025.  \"The deal has also been structured to enable small and medium-sized firms to engage with IBM through 'channel partner' arrangements to ensure they also benefit,\" Keenan said. Rapid access to emerging technologies Keenan is also Minister for Human Services and earlier this week made an impassioned plea to take a positive view of data sharing and integration within government. Keenan declared data is not \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://ministers.pmc.gov.au/keenan/2018/committee-economic-development-australia-speech\">a four letter word</url>\", citing early examples where integration of data sets was supporting predictive applications in drug and weather data.  New DTA chief executive, Randall Brugeaud, said the five-year deal would save about $100 million over that period.  IBM's Australian managing sirector David La Rose said this will give Australians rapid access to emerging technologies as they are developed, while helping the government re-engineer its platforms to protect and encrypt citizen data against modern-day cyber-security threats.  \"This agreement is a testament to our 40-year partnership with the Australian Government. It shows trust and belief in our ability to transform and provide world-leading capabilities, leveraging our investments locally in AI, blockchain, quantum and cloud. We look forward to helping the Australian Government to redefine the digital experience for the benefit of all Australians.\"  The government's R&amp;D accelerator programs are to be driven through three hubs in Melbourne, Canberra and the Gold Coast.  IBM has major research infrastructure and capability embedded in the Melbourne University health ad bio tech precinct, leading the world in the real-world application of AI to melanoma. This is expected to be the foundation of a research team to accelerate the application of blockchain, AI and quantum computing across the emerging public sector platforms.  Separate units of expert computer engineers and developers will also be based on the Gold Coast and Canberra to work on leading cyber-security solutions for data protection and the application of super-computing for government services.  Blockchain enables transactional data to be trusted, without the need for complex centralised control systems. Public sector pilot projects around Australia are expected to begin mature-to-early operational applications in the coming year, but technologists believes blockchain could underpin the virtualisation of major government controlled or funded systems in the health, finance, transport, safety, energy, education, regulatory and communications sectors.  AI offers the government the opportunity to deeply learn from its huge data pools sitting in its major revenue, payments, service, and safety systems and automate many of the manual systems still deeply embedded in state and federal tech platforms. AI applications are rapidly being deployed to enable computers to learn from case files what are the most effective solutions and offer a major opportunity to empower human service frontline workers by enabling them to learn from the vast amount of knowledge sitting in case management files. 'As\u00a0profound as the rollout of electricity' Quantum is an uber powerful computing technology that promises to power up many of the heavy data processes that will come as federal, stare and local governments seek to integrate major life services, like an easy solution to wind up the affairs of a deceased family.  Quantum computing evangelists believe it will be as profound as the rollout of electricity. The Australian government has already made a $25 million investment in the UNSW Quantum lab in Sydney. The same lab also has multi-million dollar investments from the NSW government, Telstra and the Commonwealth Bank.  IBM has once of the world's leading quantum computing labs, located outside of New York City.  The government is also negotiating with other major tech vendors to drive a better all-of-government result. Outside of the big defence primes, IBM and Telstra dominate the tech vendor space in Canberra, but with major relationships with Fujitsu, SAP and Oracle.  Keenan said the coordinated procurement process allows for better oversight of contract delivery and greater\u00a0accountability of how public funds are being spent. Since 2008, whole-of-government agreements have saved the government about $1.2 billion.  The DTA agreement with IBM comes as the government's fifth chief digital officer in just over three and half years,\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.themandarin.com.au/94730-slater-out-brugeaud-in-another-new-ceo-for-the-digital-transformation-agency/\">Randall Brugeaud, takes over as chief executive of the DTA</url>\u00a0from former NAB executive Gavin Slater, who is going back to the private sector after 12 months in the job.  The deal represents a major recovery for the US tech giant. IBM\u00a0 had to negotiate a major compensation deal with Treasury, after the first all-digital census was forced to be shut down for two days in 2016, when ABS chief David Kalisch took the call not to risk the suspected infiltration of census data. IBM provided the census solution.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This article was originally published on </emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.themandarin.com.au/95308-australian-government-and-big-blue-mint-1-billion-advanced-technologies-deal/\">The Mandarin</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">.\u00a0IBM is\u00a0a partner\u00a0of The Mandarin.</emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/startupsmart/advice/four-predictions-from-tech-giant-ibm-on-the-future-of-the-internet-of-things-in-2018/\">NOW READ: Four predictions from tech giant IBM on the future of the Internet of Things in 2018</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SS0-HCG1-F0NT-H20B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1287\"/><timeReceived>11:54 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 9, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

More than 40 submissions were received, it said.<br/>Under the proposed code the ACCC is suggesting a binding \"final offer\" arbitration process as a way to avoid platforms seeking to drag payment negotiations. Under the proposal they'd get three months' \"negotiation and mediation\", after which an independent arbitrator would choose which of the two parties' final offer is \"the most reasonable\", doing so within 45 business days.<br/>\"This would ensure disagreements about payment for content are resolved quickly. Deals on payment could be reached within six months of the code coming into effect if arbitration is required,\" the ACCC writes.<br/>The code also aims to enable groups of media businesses (such as local and regional publications) to collectively negotiate to get a better deal out of platforms use of their content.<br/>On the enforcement front, the draft proposes that non-compliance - such as not bargaining in good faith or breaching minimum commitments - can lead to infringement penalties, with the maximum set at $10M or 3x the benefit obtained or 10% of a platform's turnover in the market in the last 12 months (whichever is greater). So Facebook and Google could potentially be on the hook for fines running to many millions of dollars if they are found to have breached such a code.<br/>The scope of the code's application looks broadly enough drawn that it seems intended to try to prevent platforms from dodging payment by simply switching off a single news-focused products (such as Google News). Google did just that in Spain instead of paying for reuse of news snippets there (and it remains switched off in the market). But the ACCC's proposal also applies to Google search and Discover so Google would have to forgo showing any Australian news content to avoid the revenue share - which is a far bigger switch to flip.<br/>Another interesting aspect of the proposal would require the platforms to give news media businesses around a month (28 days') notice of algorithm changes that are \"likely to materially affect\" referral traffic to news and/or the ranking of news behind paywalls; and also for \"substantial\" changes to the display and presentation of news, and advertising directly associated with news.<br/>Another notable requirement is for platforms to give news media businesses \"clear information\" about the data they collect via users' interactions with news content on their platforms - such as how long people spend on an article; how many articles they consume in a certain time period; and other data about user engagement with news across platform services.<br/>This aspect of the proposal looks intended to tackle the problem of dominant platforms using their market power to maintain their grip on the attention economy by being able to monopolize access to data by blocking content producers from being able to access information about how Internet users are engaging with their work.<br/>Platforms like Facebook have sought to centralize others' content to their advantage - applying market power to encourage content to be posted in a place where only they have full access to interaction data. This breaks the link between news producers and their own audience, making it harder for them to perform analytics around articles or respond to changes and trends in consumption behavior.<br/>Being cut off from so much user data also makes it harder for media outlets to cultivate closer relations with consumers of their product - something that looks increasingly vital for developing successful additional revenue streams, such as subscription offers, for example.<br/>\"There is a fundamental bargaining power imbalance between news media businesses and the major digital platforms, partly because news businesses have no option but to deal with the platforms, and have had little ability to negotiate over payment for their content or other issues,\" said ACCC chair, Rod Sims, commenting on the proposal in a statement.<br/>\"In developing our draft code, we observed and learned from the approaches of regulators and policymakers internationally that have sought to secure payment for news. We wanted a model that would address this bargaining power imbalance and result in fair payment for content, which avoided unproductive and drawn-out negotiations, and wouldn't reduce the availability of Australian news on Google and Facebook.\"<br/>\"We believe our proposed draft code achieves these purposes,\" he added.<br/>The proposal contains more suggestions aimed at breaking down the power imbalance between the two adtech giants and news producers. One element would require them to publish proposals for recognizing original news content on their services - which sounds like an 'exclusive' label (to go alongside 'fact-checked' labels platforms can sometimes choose to apply).<br/>The pair would also need to provide news media businesses with what the ACCC dubs \"flexible user comment moderation tools\" - such as the ability to turn off comments on individual stories posted to a platform.<br/>The theme here is increased agency for news businesses vs Facebook and Google so they have a better chance to shape public debate happening around their own content - platforms having also gobbled up the sorts of conversations which used to happen via a newspaper's letters' page.<br/>In terms of eligibility, the ACCC says media businesses would be eligible for payment for platforms' content reuse if the online news content they produce \"investigates and explains issues of public significance for Australians\" or \"issues that engage Australians in public debate and inform democratic decision-making; or issues relating to community and local events\".<br/>Other criteria include adhering to minimum levels of professional editorial standards; maintaining a \"suitable degree\" of editorial independence; operating in Australia for the main purpose of serving Australian audiences; and generating revenue of more than $150,000 per year.<br/>The code, which would initially only apply to Facebook and Google (though the ACCC notes that other platforms could be added if they gain similar market power), is not intended to capture any non-news content producers, such as drama, entertainment or sports broadcasting.<br/>In a statement responding to the proposal Google expressed deep disappointment.\u00a0Mel Silva, MD of Google Australia, said:<br/>Our hope was that the Code would be forward thinking and the process would create incentives for both publishers and digital platforms to negotiate and innovate for a better future - so we are deeply disappointed and concerned the draft Code does not achieve this. Instead, the government's heavy handed intervention threatens to impede Australia's digital economy and impacts the services we can deliver to Australians.<br/>The Code discounts the already significant value Google provides to news publishers across the board - including sending billions of clicks to Australian news publishers for free every year worth $218 million. It sends a concerning message to businesses and investors that the Australian Government will intervene instead of letting the market work, and undermines Australia's ambition to become a leading digital economy by 2030. It sets up a perverse disincentive to innovate in the media sector and does nothing to solve the fundamental challenges of creating a business model fit for the digital age.<br/>We urge policymakers to ensure that the final Code is grounded in commercial reality so that it operates in the interests of Australian consumers, preserves the shared benefits created by the web, and does not favour the interests of large publishers at the expense of small publishers.<br/>Facebook had far less to say - sending a line attributed to William Easton, its MD for Australia &amp; New Zealand - which says it's reviewing the proposal \"to understand the impact it will have on the industry, our services and our investment in the news ecosystem in Australia\".<br/>In terms of Australia's next steps, further consultation will take place on the draft mandatory code during August, with the ACCC saying it will be finalised \"shortly after\".<br/>More details about the draft code can be found here.<br/>While regulation being applied to big tech now looks like a given in multiple jurisdictions around the world - with US lawmakers alive to the damage flowing from a handful of hyper-powerful homegrown tech giants- the question of how fair and effective it will be is very much up in the air.<br/>One potentially problematic element of Australia's approach with this news ad revenue share is that it does not appear to tackle Facebook's and Google's abusive model of surveillance capitalism - which remains under regulatory scrutiny in Europe - but seems set to further embed the media with data-mining business models that work by stripping consumers of their privacy to target them with behavioral ads.<br/>Critics contend that a myriad of harms flow from behavioral advertising - from time-wasting clickbait at the low end to democracy-denting disinformation and hate speech at the other.

Continue reading Australia now has a template for forcing Facebook and Google to pay for news</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Australia is closing in on a legally binding framework to force adtech giants Facebook and Google pay media companies for monetizing their news content when it s posted to their social media      platforms or otherwise aggregated and monetized.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Back in April the country s government announced it would adopt a mandatory code requiring the tech giants to share ad revenue with media business after an attempt to negotiate a voluntary      arrangement with the companies failed to make progress.</p><p>Today Australia s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has published details of a first pass at that mandatory code   which it says is intended to address  acute bargaining power      imbalances  between local news businesses vs the adtech duopoly, Google and Facebook.</p><p>The draft follows a consultation process before and after the release of a concepts paper in May, in which the ACCC sought feedback on a range of options. More than 40 submissions were      received, it said.</p><p>Under the proposed code the ACCC is suggesting a binding  final offer  arbitration process as a way to avoid platforms seeking to drag payment negotiations. Under the proposal they d get three      months   negotiation and mediation , after which an independent arbitrator would choose which of the two parties  final offer is  the most reasonable , doing so within 45 business days.</p><p> This would ensure disagreements about payment for content are resolved quickly. Deals on payment could be reached within six months of the code coming into effect if arbitration is required,       the ACCC writes.</p><p>The code also aims to enable groups of media businesses (such as local and regional publications) to collectively negotiate to get a better deal out of platforms use of their content.</p><p>On the enforcement front, the draft proposes that non-compliance   such as not bargaining in good faith or breaching minimum commitments   can lead to infringement penalties, with the maximum      set at $10M or 3x the benefit obtained or 10% of a platform s turnover in the market in the last 12 months (whichever is greater). So Facebook and Google could potentially be on the hook for      fines running to many millions of dollars if they are found to have breached such a code.</p><p>The scope of the code s application looks broadly enough drawn that it seems intended to try to prevent platforms from dodging payment by simply switching off a single news-focused products      (such as Google News). Google did just that in Spain instead of paying for reuse of news snippets there (and it remains switched off in the market). But the ACCC s proposal also applies to      Google search and Discover so Google would have to forgo showing any Australian news content to avoid the revenue share   which is a far bigger switch to flip.</p><p>Another interesting aspect of the proposal would require the platforms to give news media businesses around a month (28 days ) notice of algorithm changes that are  likely to materially affect       referral traffic to news and/or the ranking of news behind paywalls; and also for  substantial  changes to the display and presentation of news, and advertising directly associated with news.</p><p>Another notable requirement is for platforms to give news media businesses  clear information  about the data they collect via users  interactions with news content on their platforms   such as      how long people spend on an article; how many articles they consume in a certain time period; and other data about user engagement with news across platform services.</p><p>This aspect of the proposal looks intended to tackle the problem of dominant platforms using their market power to maintain their grip on the attention economy by being able to monopolize      access to data by blocking content producers from being able to access information about how Internet users are engaging with their work.</p><p>Platforms like Facebook have sought to centralize others  content to their advantage   applying market power to encourage content to be posted in a place where only they have full access to      interaction data. This breaks the link between news producers and their own audience, making it harder for them to perform analytics around articles or respond to changes and trends in      consumption behavior.</p><p>Being cut off from so much user data also makes it harder for media outlets to cultivate closer relations with consumers of their product   something that looks increasingly vital for      developing successful additional revenue streams, such as subscription offers, for example.</p><p> There is a fundamental bargaining power imbalance between news media businesses and the major digital platforms, partly because news businesses have no option but to deal with the platforms,      and have had little ability to negotiate over payment for their content or other issues,  said ACCC chair, Rod Sims, commenting on the proposal in a statement.</p><p> In developing our draft code, we observed and learned from the approaches of regulators and policymakers internationally that have sought to secure payment for news. We wanted a model that      would address this bargaining power imbalance and result in fair payment for content, which avoided unproductive and drawn-out negotiations, and wouldn t reduce the availability of Australian      news on Google and Facebook. </p><p> We believe our proposed draft code achieves these purposes,  he added.</p><p>The proposal contains more suggestions aimed at breaking down the power imbalance between the two adtech giants and news producers. One element would require them to publish proposals for      recognizing original news content on their services   which sounds like an  exclusive  label (to go alongside  fact-checked  labels platforms can sometimes choose to apply).</p><p>The pair would also need to provide news media businesses with what the ACCC dubs  flexible user comment moderation tools    such as the ability to turn off comments on individual stories      posted to a platform.</p><p>The theme here is increased agency for news businesses vs Facebook and Google so they have a better chance to shape public debate happening around their own content   platforms having also      gobbled up the sorts of conversations which used to happen via a newspaper s letters  page.</p><p>In terms of eligibility, the ACCC says media businesses would be eligible for payment for platforms  content reuse if the online news content they produce  investigates and explains issues of      public significance for Australians  or  issues that engage Australians in public debate and inform democratic decision-making; or issues relating to community and local events .</p><p>Other criteria include adhering to minimum levels of professional editorial standards; maintaining a  suitable degree  of editorial independence; operating in Australia for the main purpose of      serving Australian audiences; and generating revenue of more than $150,000 per year.</p><p>The code, which would initially only apply to Facebook and Google (though the ACCC notes that other platforms could be added if they gain similar market power), is not intended to capture any      non-news content producers, such as drama, entertainment or sports broadcasting.</p><p>In a statement responding to the proposal Google expressed deep disappointment. Mel Silva, MD of Google Australia, said:</p><p>Our hope was that the Code would be forward thinking and the process would create incentives for both publishers and digital platforms to negotiate and innovate for a better future   so we are      deeply disappointed and concerned the draft Code does not achieve this. Instead, the government s heavy handed intervention threatens to impede Australia s digital economy and impacts the      services we can deliver to Australians.</p><p>The Code discounts the already significant value Google provides to news publishers across the board   including sending billions of clicks to Australian news publishers for free every year      worth $218 million. It sends a concerning message to businesses and investors that the Australian Government will intervene instead of letting the market work, and undermines Australia s      ambition to become a leading digital economy by 2030. It sets up a perverse disincentive to innovate in the media sector and does nothing to solve the fundamental challenges of creating a      business model fit for the digital age.</p><p>We urge policymakers to ensure that the final Code is grounded in commercial reality so that it operates in the interests of Australian consumers, preserves the shared benefits created by the      web, and does not favour the interests of large publishers at the expense of small publishers.</p><p>Facebook had far less to say   sending a line attributed to William Easton, its MD for Australia &amp; New Zealand   which says it s reviewing the proposal  to understand the impact it will      have on the industry, our services and our investment in the news ecosystem in Australia .</p><p>In terms of Australia s next steps, further consultation will take place on the draft mandatory code during August, with the ACCC saying it will be finalised  shortly after .</p><p>More details about the draft code can be found here.</p><p>While regulation being applied to big tech now looks like a given in multiple jurisdictions around the world   with US lawmakers alive to the damage flowing from a handful of hyper-powerful      homegrown tech giants  the question of how fair and effective it will be is very much up in the air.</p><p>One potentially problematic element of Australia s approach with this news ad revenue share is that it does not appear to tackle Facebook s and Google s abusive model of surveillance capitalism        which remains under regulatory scrutiny in Europe   but seems set to further embed the media with data-mining business models that work by stripping consumers of their privacy to target them      with behavioral ads.</p><p>Critics contend that a myriad of harms flow from behavioral advertising   from time-wasting clickbait at the low end to democracy-denting disinformation and hate speech at the other. Meanwhile      other less intrusive types of ad-targeting are available.</p><p>A section of the proposed code that touches on  the privacy of platform users  notes only that:  The draft code s minimum standards require digital platforms to provide clear information about      the data they currently collect through news content. However, the code does not include any requirements for digital platforms to increase sharing of user data with news media businesses.      Accordingly, the code does not have an impact on the privacy protections currently applicable to digital platform users. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook\">https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>Natasha Lomas<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>, Wire, United States, English<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2684626</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GR-T6R1-JCTB-F4YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1874\"/><timeReceived>1:05 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The Chinese-owned social media platform says it is working to remove videos of a man apparently taking his own life with a gun and banning users who keep trying to spread the clips through the app.    It\u2019s the latest example of the ongoing struggle by big tech companies to police their platforms for harmful content amid increasing pressure from regulators.    Prime Minister Scott Morrison said eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, Australia\u2019s online watchdog, is taking \u201cstrong action\u201d against what he described as a \u201cdisgraceful video\u201d.    \u201cThose who run these organizations have a responsibility to those who are watching and particularly when it comes to children,\u201d Morrison said in a video released by his office.    \u201cMy message to those social media companies is, yes, your products are changing the world, but with that comes a great responsibility and you need to be accountable and you need to be responsible for making sure that your product does not harm Australians, and my government will be making sure that we do everything to hold you to account for that,\u201d he said.    Australia last year took extraordinary legislative steps to remove violent content from internet platforms.    Social media executives can be imprisoned if their platforms stream real violence under the new laws. The legislation was a response to an Australian gunman who used a helmet-mounted camera to broadcast live on Facebook as he murdered 51 worshippers in two mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch.    But the eSafety Commissioner\u2019s office said TikTok could not be prosecuted under the laws.    \u201cThe video is not considered abhorrent violent material \u2013 because it is not violent terrorism, murder or attempted murder, rape, torture or kidnapping,\u201d the office said in an email.    The office is working with social media companies to \u201cto remove content and monitor the situation\u201d, Inman Grant said in a statement.    \u201cSocial media companies need to use the tools at their disposal to detect and remove this content much more quickly,\u201d she said.    Morrison\u2019s criticism of TikTok comes after he distanced Australia from the US stance on the company behind it, ByteDance.    President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has threatened to ban TikTok by mid-September and ordered ByteDance to sell its US business, claiming national security risks due to the Chinese ownership.    Morrison told the Aspen Security Forum in the United States last month that TikTok did not compromise Australia\u2019s security interests, a move that pleased China .    He took the extraordinary step of attacking TikTok in a video a day after the last two Australian journalists working for Australian media left China for fear of detention and the Chinese foreign ministry announced Australian citizen Cheng Lei, a Chinese state media journalist, had been detained because she was \u201csuspected of carrying out criminal activities endangering China\u2019s national security\u201d.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43034814389</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T2-8PY1-F07F-81TN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"579\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Indian Express</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 9, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp;

The legislation was a response to an Australian gunman who used a helmet-mounted camera to broadcast live on Facebook as he murdered 51 worshippers in two mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch.</p><p>But the eSafety Commissioner\u2019s office said TikTok could not be prosecuted under the laws.</p><p>\u201cThe video is not considered abhorrent violent material -\u2013 because it is not violent terrorism, murder or attempted murder, rape, torture or kidnapping,\u201d the office said in an email.</p><p>The office is working with social media companies to \u201cto remove content and monitor the situation,\u201d Inman Grant said in a statement.</p><p>\u201cSocial media companies need to use the tools at their disposal to detect and remove this content much more quickly,\u201d she said.</p><p>Morrison\u2019s criticism of TikTok comes after he distanced Australia from the U.S. stance on the company behind it, ByteDance.</p><p>President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has threatened to ban TikTok by mid-September and ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. business, claiming national security risks due to the Chinese ownership.</p><p>Morrison told the Aspen Security Forum in the United States last month that TikTok did not compromise Australia\u2019s security interests, a move that pleased China.</p><p>He took the extraordinary step of attacking TikTok in a video a day after the last two Australian journalists working for Australian media left China for fear of detention and the Chinese foreign ministry announced Australian citizen Cheng Lei, a Chinese state media journalist, had been detained because she was \u201csuspected of carrying out criminal activities endangering China\u2019s national security.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-3ee350b5e1d4949c400ff9576c1491be20200909</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T1-C6K1-DYMD-60RX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"531\"/><timeReceived>10:36 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 9, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

TikTok says it's working to remove videos of a man apparently taking his own life and banning users that keep trying to spread the clips on the wildly popular social media platform, it was reported on Tuesday, Sept. </p><p>8, 2020. (AP Photo/File)CANBERRA, Australia (AP) \u2014 Australian regulators have ruled out prosecuting TikTok over an apparent suicide video under tough new laws prohibiting some forms of violent online images, but the prime minister urged social media companies on Wednesday to take more responsibility for offensive content. The Chinese-owned social media platform says it is working to remove videos of a man apparently taking his own life with a gun and banning users who keep trying to spread the clips through the app. It's the latest example of the ongoing struggle by big tech companies to police their platforms for harmful content amid increasing pressure from regulators. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, Australia's online watchdog, is taking 'strong action' against what he described as a 'disgraceful video.' 'Those who run these organizations have a responsibility to those who are watching and particularly when it comes to children,' Morrison said in a video released by his office. 'My message to those social media companies is, yes, your products are changing the world, but with that comes a great responsibility and you need to be accountable and you need to be responsible for making sure that your product does not harm Australians, and my government will be making sure that we do everything to hold you to account for that,' he said. Australia last year took extraordinary legislative steps to remove violent content from internet platforms. Social media executives can be imprisoned if their platforms stream real violence under the new laws. The legislation was a response to an Australian gunman who used a helmet-mounted camera to broadcast live on Facebook as he murdered 51 worshippers in two mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch. But the eSafety Commissioner's office said TikTok could not be prosecuted under the laws. (Ad) The coronavirus knocked the wind out of stocks.

(Tickers Included) 'The video is not considered abhorrent violent material -- because it is not violent terrorism, murder or attempted murder, rape, torture or kidnapping,' the office said in an email. The office is working with social media companies to 'to remove content and monitor the situation,' Inman Grant said in a statement. 'Social media companies need to use the tools at their disposal to detect and remove this content much more quickly,' she said. Morrison's criticism of TikTok comes after he distanced Australia from the U.S. stance on the company behind it, ByteDance. President Donald Trump's administration has threatened to ban TikTok by mid-September and ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. business, claiming national security risks due to the Chinese ownership. Morrison told the Aspen Security Forum in the United States last month that TikTok did not compromise Australia's security interests, a move that pleased China. He took the extraordinary step of attacking TikTok in a video a day after the last two Australian journalists working for Australian media left China for fear of detention and the Chinese foreign ministry announced Australian citizen Cheng Lei, a Chinese state media journalist, had been detained because she was 'suspected of carrying out criminal activities endangering China's national security.'8 Consumer Staples Stocks That Offer Good Value[1]Chances are you've been spending more time at home than usual. You may also be spending more of your budget on some creature comforts that might normally make it on your shopping list. These are the consumer staples that you rely on every day. And that's what makes the consumer staples one of the most interesting sectors for investors. For starters, consumer staples are defensive stocks. They are stocks that tend to perform well when the economy is doing well or when it is performing poorly. That's because they are essentials like toilet paper, packaged foods and beverages, even alcohol and tobacco. Now the opposite side of this coin is that the price you pay for these items is somewhat fixed. And that means these stocks don't fit the definition of growth stocks. But the Covid-19 pandemic has changed that equation a little bit. It's not that people are necessarily paying more for these items. But they are buying more of these items. And this means that consumer staples are having their moment in the sun. However, it also means that right now there are several consumer staples that are looking a little pricey.

The Chinese-owned social media platform says it is working to remove videos of a man apparently taking his own life with a gun and banning users who keep trying to spread the clips through the app.   It\u2019s the latest example of the ongoing struggle by big tech companies to police their platforms for harmful content amid increasing pressure from regulators.   Prime Minister Scott Morrison said eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, Australia\u2019s online watchdog, is taking \u201cstrong action\u201d against what he described as a \u201cdisgraceful video.\u201d   \u201cThose who run these organizations have a responsibility to those who are watching and particularly when it comes to children,\u201d Morrison said in a video released by his office.   \u201cMy message to those social media companies is, yes, your products are changing the world, but with that comes a great responsibility and you need to be accountable and you need to be responsible for making sure that your product does not harm Australians, and my government will be making sure that we do everything to hold you to account for that,\u201d he said.   Australia last year took extraordinary legislative steps to remove violent content from internet platforms.   Social media executives can be imprisoned if their platforms stream real violence under the new laws. The legislation was a response to an Australian gunman who used a helmet-mounted camera to broadcast live on Facebook as he murdered 51 worshippers in two mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch.   But the eSafety Commissioner\u2019s office said TikTok could not be prosecuted under the laws.   \u201cThe video is not considered abhorrent violent material -\u2013 because it is not violent terrorism, murder or attempted murder, rape, torture or kidnapping,\u201d the office said in an email.   The office is working with social media companies to \u201cto remove content and monitor the situation,\u201d Inman Grant said in a statement.   \u201cSocial media companies need to use the tools at their disposal to detect and remove this content much more quickly,\u201d she said.   Morrison\u2019s criticism of TikTok comes after he distanced Australia from the U.S. stance on the company behind it, ByteDance.   President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has threatened to ban TikTok by mid-September and ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. business, claiming national security risks due to the Chinese ownership.   Morrison told the Aspen Security Forum in the United States last month that TikTok did not compromise Australia\u2019s security interests, a move that pleased China.   He took the extraordinary step of attacking TikTok in a video a day after the last two Australian journalists working for Australian media left China for fear of detention and the Chinese foreign ministry announced Australian citizen Cheng Lei, a Chinese state media journalist, had been detained because she was \u201csuspected of carrying out criminal activities endangering China\u2019s national security.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43034085868</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T2-8RV1-JCSC-J1MC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"579\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Click2Houston.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 9, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Chinese-owned social media platform says it is working to remove videos of a man apparently taking his own life with a gun and banning users who keep trying to spread the clips through the app.   It\u2019s the latest example of the ongoing struggle by big tech companies to police their platforms for harmful content amid increasing pressure from regulators.   Prime Minister Scott Morrison said eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, Australia\u2019s online watchdog, is taking \u201cstrong action\u201d against what he described as a \u201cdisgraceful video.\u201d   \u201cThose who run these organizations have a responsibility to those who are watching and particularly when it comes to children,\u201d Morrison said in a video released by his office.   \u201cMy message to those social media companies is, yes, your products are changing the world, but with that comes a great responsibility and you need to be accountable and you need to be responsible for making sure that your product does not harm Australians, and my government will be making sure that we do everything to hold you to account for that,\u201d he said.   Australia last year took extraordinary legislative steps to remove violent content from internet platforms.   Social media executives can be imprisoned if their platforms stream real violence under the new laws. The legislation was a response to an Australian gunman who used a helmet-mounted camera to broadcast live on Facebook as he murdered 51 worshippers in two mosques in the New Zealand city of Christchurch.   But the eSafety Commissioner\u2019s office said TikTok could not be prosecuted under the laws.   \u201cThe video is not considered abhorrent violent material -\u2013 because it is not violent terrorism, murder or attempted murder, rape, torture or kidnapping,\u201d the office said in an email.   The office is working with social media companies to \u201cto remove content and monitor the situation,\u201d Inman Grant said in a statement.   \u201cSocial media companies need to use the tools at their disposal to detect and remove this content much more quickly,\u201d she said.   Morrison\u2019s criticism of TikTok comes after he distanced Australia from the U.S. stance on the company behind it, ByteDance.   President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has threatened to ban TikTok by mid-September and ordered ByteDance to sell its U.S. business, claiming national security risks due to the Chinese ownership.   Morrison told the Aspen Security Forum in the United States last month that TikTok did not compromise Australia\u2019s security interests, a move that pleased China.   He took the extraordinary step of attacking TikTok in a video a day after the last two Australian journalists working for Australian media left China for fear of detention and the Chinese foreign ministry announced Australian citizen Cheng Lei, a Chinese state media journalist, had been detained because she was \u201csuspected of carrying out criminal activities endangering China\u2019s national security.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43034048327</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T2-8RV1-JCSC-J1HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"581\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 9, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The regulator said that Google misled users about how it collected and used their location data. The matter is scheduled for a case hearing on November 14, per Reuters report. MediaNama has reached out to Google for comment and will update this when they reply.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google kept users' in the dark about what it was doing with their personal data: ACCC's accusations<br/><br/>ACCC said that Google \"collected, kept and used highly sensitive and valuable personal information about consumers' location without them making an informed choice\".</p><p>Turning off \"Location History\" did not actually turn it off: The ACCC said when people set up their Google accounts on phones and tablets, they would have incorrectly believed that \"Location History\" was the only setting that affected whether the company was collecting a user's location data. Whereas, the setting \"Web and App Activity\" also had to be switched off if users did not want their location data to be collected.<br/><br/>The Australian regulator said, \"Google has failed to make clear to the consumers that they would need to change their choices on a separate setting titled \"Web and App Activity\" to prevent this location tracking.\"<br/><br/>By default, the new Google accounts have location history turned off, while web and app activity turned on. However, if the later remained switched on, the company continued to collect personal information including the user's location through the app, ACCC said.<br/><br/>Google didn't inform users what it was actually doing with their personal data: ACCC further said that Google misled users by not informing them that their personal data could be used for purposes unrelated to the consumer's use of its services, such as:<br/><br/>* to personalise advertisements for other users;<br/><br/>* to infer demographic information;<br/><br/>* to measure the performance of advertisements;<br/><br/>* to promote, offer to supply or supply advertising services to third parties; and/or<br/><br/>* to produce anonymised, aggregated statistics (such as store visit conversions statistics) and share those statistics with advertisers.<br/><br/>The anti-trust regulator accused Google of breaching the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) since January 2017, on account of the above accusations.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that this case is ACCC's first move against a major digital platform following the publication of the Digital Platforms Inquiry Final Report in July. Interestingly, ACCC had recommended limiting the market dominance of Facebook and Google to promote competition, strengthening the Australian Privacy Act, and giving Australians greater power over how their information is collected and used.<br/><br/>Big Tech's repeated run-ins with regulators<br/><br/>* In January, a French regulator fined Google $55.5 million for breach of privacy laws under the GDPR rules. The regulator alleged that Google did not get valid user consent to gather data for targeted advertising.<br/><br/>* Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner is investigating Google over a complaint alleging breach of privacy laws.<br/><br/>* The Norwegian Consumer Council had published a report which analysed a sample of Google, Facebook and Microsoft Windows privacy settings. The report concluded that these tech firms employ numerous tactics to persuade consumers towards sharing as much data as possible. It also said some aspects of privacy policies can be seen as \"dark patterns\".<br/><br/>* In Canada, an investigation into how Facebook gets consent for certain data practices by the office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada was highly criticised. It concluded that Facebook users \"had no way of truly knowing what personal information would be disclosed to which app and for what purposes\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0050231486</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDY-97C1-DXMP-K2PB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"641\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 4, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The move comes as scrutiny grows worldwide over data privacy, with U.S. and European lawmakers recently focusing on how tech companies treat user data. In court documents, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) accused Google of not explicitly getting consent or properly informing consumers of a 2016 move to combine personal information in Google accounts with browsing activities on non-Google websites. \u201cThis change ... was worth a lot of money to Google,\u201d said commission chairman Rod Sims. \u201cWe allege they\u2019ve achieved it through misleading behaviour.\u201d  SEE ALSO: Big Tech CEOs ready defenses for US Congress hearing into their growing power  The change allowed Google to link the browsing behaviour of millions of consumers with their names and identities, providing it with extreme market power, the regulator added. \u201cWe consider Google misled Australian consumers about what it planned to do with large amounts of their personal information, including internet activity on websites not connected to Google,\u201d Sims said. However, Google said the change was optional and consumer consent was sought through prominent and easy-to-understand notifications.  \u201cIf a user did not consent, their experience of our products and services remained unchanged,\u201d a Google spokesman said in an email, adding that the company intends to defend its position. In June 2016, Google had changed the wording of its privacy policy, dropping a statement that it would not combine data known as \u201ccookies\u201d from its advertisement display business, DoubleClick, with users\u2019 personal information.  SEE ALSO: Internet balloons represent much more than just internet  Instead, the new policy read, \u201cDepending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google services.\u201d The Australian regulator alleges that Google used the combined data to boost targeted advertising - a key income source - and that it did not make clear to consumers the changes in its privacy policy. \u201cThis is an action we are taking that others have not,\u201d said Sims. The regulator, through its action in Australia\u2019s Federal Court, wanted to establish the common law on what providers in various jurisdictions could do, and was potentially seeking \u201cmillions\u201d in damages, he added, without specifying a figure. \u201cWe will keep taking action, as will agencies overseas, and it will shape how these platforms behave, to make sure that the internet is a benefit to users, not a detriment.\u201d  SEE ALSO: How startups can benefit from Influencer marketing    Covid 19 Time Series</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42692417064</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FM-6XS1-F07F-8521-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"522\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>East African Standard</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The poll, undertaken by research company Essential Vision, asked 1,076 Australians in an online survey their thoughts on a range of topics dominating September\u2019s news cycle.   Key among them were their thoughts on Facebook and Google\u2019s strong resistance to the Australian government\u2019s proposed new laws to balance the playing field for news media outlets.       The laws, if passed, would see Google and Facebook required to work more closely with news media organisations and be forced to come to the table to agree on payments made to media for the sharing of their content.   Google lashed out against the proposals, filling its various services with warnings to users about the bill\u2019s implications. While Facebook remained mostly silent on the issue, it indicated last week it would potentially implement a news ban on the platform if the laws pushed ahead.   Australians said if this did happen, however, they\u2019d most likely go straight to the source, according to Essential\u2019s report.   Thirty-seven per cent of the respondents said it was very likely they\u2019d simply visit the news sites while a further 38 per cent said it was quite likely.   A quarter of the respondents said it was either not that likely or not likely at all that they\u2019d visit the news site if a ban was to occur.       It\u2019s important to note that the research also showed just how reliant on Facebook Australians were for their news consumption.   A little more than half of the respondents admitted to using the platform daily for news \u2014 the biggest age group being between 35 and 54 at 64 per cent. Following behind were the 18 to 34 and 55-plus age groups, both at 46 per cent.   The data suggests Australians, if true to their word, would not let a social media news ban get in the way of their news reading. Whether that actually happens remains to be seen.  Young people aren\u2019t united against big tech\u2019s response      But it wasn\u2019t all great news for news media outlets and the government.   While 54 per cent agreed that big tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, should support local media, it was the younger demographic that was less convinced.   Of the 17 per cent that disagreed that big tech had a part to play in propping up local media, a quarter of those were between 18 and 34 with a further 16 per cent aged between 35 and 54.   The 18-to-34-year-old demographic were also less likely to stop using Facebook in response to its tough stance against the proposed laws.   Out of the 35 per cent who disagreed they\u2019d use the platform less if it were to ban news, 20 per cent of them, the majority, were in that younger age bracket.   While Facebook is seen as the boomer\u2019s preferred choice of social media, the response tells a slightly different story \u2014 young people are less willing to take the government\u2019s side in this debate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43023513718</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SS-Y4G1-F07F-84BD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"544\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Gizmodo Australia</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 8, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001347</classCode><className>POLLS &amp; SURVEYS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001872</classCode><className>YOUTH MARKET</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N510000CC</classCode><className>MEDIA &amp; TELECOMMUNICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001872</classCode><className>YOUTH MARKET</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GT116</classCode><className>OCEANIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GR156</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA &amp; NEW ZEALAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

It will introduce an arbitration system that will make binding decisions on fees that social media groups must pay to media companies.</p><p>Breaches of a new mandatory code of conduct could result in fines worth hundreds of millions of dollars and are aimed at changing the behaviour of companies including Facebook and Google, said Rod Sims, chairman of Australia\u2019s competition regulator.</p><p>\u201cHopefully\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the digital platforms will realise they have to mature as businesses,\u201d said Mr Sims. \u201cThey can\u2019t keep taking advantage of free content and have a sustainable business model. They have to actually embrace this and open up to this development, which I think they should realise is inevitable.\u201d</p><p>He added that international regulators had been in contact with his office and were considering introducing similar laws.</p><p>Apple and other tech groups apart from Facebook and Google will not initially be covered by the law, because the competition regulator does not deem them to be sufficiently influential in distributing news content.</p><p>In Australia, where the Conservative government has close ties to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp empire, regulators have targeted digital platforms\u2019 impact on traditional news media, which has suffered extensive job losses and closures in the past decade.</p><p>An Australian inquiry into digital media platforms last year found that the vast majority of online advertising spend goes to Google and Facebook.</p><p>Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment while Google said it was deeply disappointed with the legislation. In submissions to the Australian inquiry, Google claimed the economic value it gets from news content was small. \u00a0</p><p>Other jurisdictions have attempted to force Google and Facebook to pay for news content before with mixed results. In 2014, Google closed its Google News service in Spain following the introduction of laws that forced it to pay for some content.</p><p>However, Terry Flew, professor of communications at Queensland University of Technology, said the huge public pressure on Big Tech suggested it would be difficult for Google or Facebook to completely exit certain news markets over the matter.</p><p>In April, French authorities <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b16a018c-4f34-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5\"> ordered Google</url> to negotiate \u201cin good faith\u201d with news providers on paying for their content. The move prompted the US group to show only headlines to news stories to avoid payment.</p><p>Mr Sims said Australia\u2019s new law would avoid the pitfalls of the French and Spanish rules. The code covers Google\u2019s entire search function rather than just its Google News service, he said. </p><p>Google has begun agreeing partnerships with media organisations in Germany, Australia and Brazil for a news service due to be launched this year that includes licensing payments, suggesting a gradual shift in tactics. Facebook is also paying some US publishers for content on its news page platform.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-4c3cc2ffc93e4c6f85aeb796aafbf2d7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GP-TNF1-JB77-K09W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"632\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Australia has proposed forcing Facebook and internet search giant Google to pay local media outlets for content, drawing strong opposition from the U.S. companies in a dispute that is being watched by regulators and news organizations around the world, according to Reuters.    Facebook said this month it would stop Australians from sharing local and international news on its website if the proposal becomes law. The company and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) are still negotiating before the regulator makes a formal recommendation to the government.    \u201cIt would be a shame for Australian democracy (and) it would be a shame for Facebook users if they took that course of action,\u201d ACCC Chair Rod Sims said in a speech delivered via Zoom.    \u201cIt would also weaken Facebook, so it\u2019s their call,\u201d he added. \u201cIf people can\u2019t get their news from Facebook then they\u2019ll go elsewhere to get their news.\u201d    As traditional media outlets lose advertising revenue to internet giants, some countries have tried to find ways to make such companies pay for the traffic sent to their websites. But Sims said no model had been effective.    The proposal in Australia involves an arbitrator setting the payment terms if an internet company can\u2019t strike a deal with a local media outlet, a provision Facebook has said could force it to pay unlimited royalties.    A Facebook representative was not immediately available to comment on Thursday. Google has said that it has struck content deals with some Australian publishers, but has issued public warnings that the law may hurt its search service.    Sims said Australia\u2019s plan was not a tax on Big Tech or a subsidy for other companies, saying it was \u201ca question of addressing a market power imbalance and one that matters to the future of our society\u201d.    \u201cIf you had a competitive market you wouldn\u2019t need this,\u201d he said.    If Facebook quit news sharing in Australia to avoid the law, the company \u201cmay get something worse\u201d elsewhere, Sims added.

Australia has proposed forcing Facebook and internet search giant Google to pay local media outlets for content, drawing strong opposition from the U.S. companies in a dispute that is being watched by regulators and news organisations around the world.  Facebook said this month it would stop Australians from sharing local and international news on its website if the proposal becomes law. The company and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) are still negotiating before the regulator makes a formal recommendation to the government.  \u201cIt would be a shame for Australian democracy (and) it would be a shame for Facebook users if they took that course of action,\u201d ACCC Chair Rod Sims said in a speech delivered via Zoom.  \u201cIt would also weaken Facebook, so it's their call,\u201d he added. \u201cIf people can't get their news from Facebook then they'll go elsewhere to get their news.\u201d  As traditional media outlets lose advertising revenue to internet giants, some countries have tried to find ways to make such companies pay for the traffic sent to their websites. But Sims said no model had been effective.  The proposal in Australia involves an arbitrator setting the payment terms if an internet company can't strike a deal with a local media outlet, a provision Facebook has said could force it to pay unlimited royalties.  A Facebook representative was not immediately available to comment on Thursday. Google has said that it has struck content deals with some Australian publishers, but has issued public warnings that the law may hurt its search service.  Sims said Australia's plan was not a tax on Big Tech or a subsidy for other companies, saying it was \u201ca question of addressing a market power imbalance and one that matters to the future of our society\u201d.  \u201cIf you had a competitive market you wouldn't need this,\u201d he said.  If Facebook quit news sharing in Australia to avoid the law, the company \u201cmay get something worse\u201d elsewhere, Mr. Sims added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The bad news for news media is that there's no way of mending them in a way that benefits journalism.  The challenges the ACCC identifies -- excessive market power of Facebook and Google, an unequal regulatory mishmash and the mass aggregation of private data -- all flow from this broken advertising model.  There are no magic answers in the ACCC report. </p><p>The real solution is to break the platforms' power by breaking them up. However, Australia can't do it. US regulators can and that's an emerging issue in the forthcoming presidential election.  [related-story id=\"674124\"]  The most important recommendations for Australia are to conduct a further inquiry into advertising and its technology and for the ACCC to take on an ongoing role in supervising the platforms through a special unit.  Fixing the digital advertising model won't help journalism. The heart of that challenge for media comes from what an academic paper cited in the report calls \"attention allocation in [an] information-rich environment\". What does the report say about internet audiences? The report shows that consumers are allocating their attention to the platforms, with Australians spending about 40% of their time online on one or another of the products of Facebook and Google. By comparison, Australians spend only 2.3% of their time on the traditional news sites of News Corp, Nine, the ABC, Seven West Media and Ten.  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bondcap.com/report/itr19/\">Mary Meeker's influential internet trends</url> report demonstrates the intuitive point that there is a direct correlation between the proportion of time spent on a medium and the proportion of advertising dollars that medium attracts. So it's no surprise that the ACCC report crunches the data to show that 61% of online advertising ends up with Google and Facebook.  Worse, as the ACCC report makes clear, much of the advertising expenditure intended for websites (including news media) gets clipped by the platforms' ad tech on the way through. Various studies estimate the loss between advertiser and web publisher at between one and two-thirds of online advertising spend.  Rather than simplifying advertising, the big tech platforms have made it more complex, and are benefiting from the complexity they've created. They control the platform for supply (where ad buyers place their ads), for demand (where publishers list their available space) and the exchange that pairs them in between. Google is the largest provider of each step of this ad tech.  [related-story id=\"656521\"]  This suggests that rather than supporting something useful (say, journalism), much of the advertising dollars -- perhaps half of them -- are now supporting the advertising industry itself from creative agencies through buyers and on through the various stages of ad tech, with each stage taking a cut. How does the inquiry suggest a re-balancing of the scales? The inquiry doesn't see any way of redirecting these dollars to news media. It rejects the idea of copyright-style licensing fees to be paid to news publishers and doesn't address an industry favourite of a levy on digital ads to support journalism.  It addresses, instead, the barriers to publishers promoting their news media (through shares, links and likes) imposed by the market power of the platforms who, after all, benefit from keeping the consumer on their own site. It examines seemingly obscure questions. How much text can be included in a Google link before a reader decides they don't need to link to the publisher's site for more detail? Not much it turns out. What's the impact of Google-supported Accelerated Mobile Pages on news-related advertising (some, but a trade-off for speed).  It identifies the catastrophic effect on referrals resulting from Facebook's 2017 algorithmic shift to downplay news in their \"news feed\" -- a drop of 40% says Seven West Media.  Its solution is for the platforms to have an ACMA regulated code governing relations with the publishers, although that seems like a bit of bolting horses and locked stable doors.  Instead, it recognises the need for government intervention through grants (particularly to support local media), tax concessions to promote philanthropy and not-for-profit journalism, and regulations (on, say, local content) for streaming services like Netflix and Google-owned YouTube .  And stable funding for the ABC and SBS -- wonder how the government will answer that in its response to the report promised by the end of the year.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Did the ACCC inquiry come to the right conclusions on Big Internet and its role in advertising and journalism?

Policy makers are usually demure enough to hide this. It is rare that rent-seeking is as explicit and open as the Australian government's current attempt to expropriate money from Facebook and Google\u2014money that will be directly paid to the traditional news outlets that these tech companies have disrupted.   This is much more than just a regional policy fight; what is happening in Australia tells us a lot about how the changing economics of media are feeding the bipartisan war on the tech industry in the United States and globally. Much of what is dressed up as populist anti-tech policy is in fact an attempt by legacy media companies to weaponize confused regulators against their competitors.   The Australian government wants Facebook and Google to sign onto what they call a \" News Media Bargaining Code ,\" which will require tech companies to pay news organizations when news content is \"included\" on the digital platforms. The exact price to be paid is meant to be negotiated by media companies and digital platforms. The rationale offered by Australian antitrust regulators is that there is a \"bargaining power imbalance\" between tech and media companies, hence the need for government action to get negotiations started.    You may be tempted to read that paragraph again. Don't bother. The government's argument is euphemistic and its reasoning is obscure. The most obvious problem is that neither Facebook nor Google \"include\" news content on their platform. The dispute is not about intellectual property theft; all tech companies are doing is linking to news sites. Facebook allows users to share links. Google offers links through its general search function as well as its Google News search service. The upshot is that the Australian government wants Facebook and Google to pay news organizations for the privilege of linking to their content.    Unsurprisingly, Facebook has said if it is forced to pay it will simply block Australians from sharin g news links. Google might also shut down its Google News service\u2014that's what happened when a similar policy was introduced in Spain in 2014.   Much like the U.S., the Australian media sector is in economic freefall. And like the U.S., both Australian progressives and conservatives have been regarding tech companies with increasing skepticism. We usually think of anti-tech skepticism as ideological\u2014conservatives are at odds with socially liberal Silicon Valley types while progressives look at Silicon Valley as the new robber barons. But in Australia, it is strikingly obvious how the economic collapse of traditional media causes anti-tech sentiment.   Throughout the 20th century, the newspaper business model was simple: Newspapers sought to match readers with advertisers. Advertising paid for journalism, which attracted readers, which then attracted more advertising, and so on. The more readers the better. So newspapers tried to appeal to the median reader.    The history of the media in the last two decades is the slowly unfolding consequences of advertising migrating from the print media to the internet. This creative destruction not only undermined business models that paid for mass-market journalism, but reshaped how public debate is conducted. The growth in media partisanship in recent years could be because media outlets no longer try to appeal to the median reader\u2014 they try to engage a passionate few who will stump up a subscription fee . That is, media partisanship has economic causes.   The other consequence is political backlash against the big tech companies.    For generations, the art of politics involved serenading the local press, getting an audience with the regional media mogul, or building a relationship with a sympathetic journalist who could be relied on to get a political message out.    Now those friendly moguls and journalists are on the backfoot, shocked by the extraordinary growth of the digital platforms that seem to have ripped both the economic high ground from under them. And the political class is starting to respond to the new media normal the best way they know how: with threats of regulation.   It is easy to laugh at the odd populist attempts to tame digital platforms, such as Sen. Josh Hawley's (R\u2013Mo.) 2019 proposal to ban autoplay videos and infinite scrolling. But the Australian experience shows that the greater threat to digital platforms comes from antitrust regulators, dressed up in bizarre claims about \"bargaining power imbalances.\"   Antitrust policy in the 21st century is particularly vulnerable to this sort of strange thinking. Antitrust was conceived in a world of monolithic corporate hierarchies\u2014factories that built physical things and distributed those things using physical infrastructure like rails and ports. Digital platforms are hard to understand through the traditional antitrust lens.    The more users a digital platform has\u2014the more it dominates a market segment\u2014the more valuable that platform is to those users. We want to use the social media network that everyone else is using. And to get more users, platforms often provide access to one side of the market for free. For regulators used to hunting for predatory pricing, this just looks weird. At the same time these digital markets are highly dynamic; firms tend to dominate them, but not for long. This too leaves regulators in a bind. They've spent more than a century warning of the dangers of monopolies, but now they're struggling to identify the actual harm these digital platform \"monopolies\" are causing.   Australian regulators are confused as to what to do and have proposed everything from regulating Facebook and Google's algorithms, to enacting new privacy laws, to giving more money to public broadcasters.   It's clear that U.S. regulators are confused too. In early September, The New York Times reported that while the Department of Justice plans to imminently bring an antitrust case against Google's parent company, Alphabet, there is much internal disagreement about what the grounds of the government complaint should be.    As the Australian experience shows, this combination of confused regulators and aggrieved, politically connected industries is a dangerous thing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Ahead this hour, diplomatic efforts ramp up to help those trapped in Eastern Ghouta in Syria.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The U.S. president suggests more guns at school.  That's the way to avoid the next mass shooting, which will be targeting students.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Australia's deputy prime minister giving up.  The scandal and the headlines wouldn't go away so Barnaby Joyce calls it quits.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello and thank you for joining us.  I'm John Vause and this is now the third hour of NEWSROOM L.A.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>VAUSE:  We start with what could be a breakthrough at the U.N. Security Council.  It is expected to meet in about nine hours to vote on a proposed 30-day cease fire to Syria.  The move comes after days of debate. Russia opposes the truce but on Thursday appeared ready maybe to make a deal.  </p><p>But that same day the U.S. accused the Kremlin of blocking efforts to end the bloodshed.  And we should stress, as a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia has the power to veto any draft solution. Here is what diplomats from those countries said on Thursday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  Russia will continue to do everything possible to achieve piece in Syria and to restore stability in the Middle Eastern region.  </p><p>We call upon our partners to engage in the same, in the spirit of constructive cooperation in engagement with the U.N.  rather than continuing to create smoke screens and scaling up support for jihadists and severing the region into many parts.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The Russian permanent representative also asked we, quote \"come up with ways of getting out of this situation.\"  Yet it appears to be intent on blocking any meaningful effort to do so.  </p><p>The United States is ready to vote on this resolution right here and right now.  All of us should be ready.  There is no reason to delay. Literally, the minute this meeting ends, this council can take the clearest possible step to help vote for a ceasefire and vote for humanitarian access.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE:  Well, with all that talk there has been intense bombardment in Eastern Ghouta.  The rebel held enclave has been hammered by Syrian and Russian warplanes.  On Wednesday the Syrian military dropped leaflets on the area, warning residents to leave and blaming the deaths of thousands of women and children on insurgents.  </p><p>But activists say warplanes have killed scores of innocent people. Human Rights Watch says more than 400 civilians have  been killed in just the past few days.</p><p>The Russia and Syrian government say they are targeting terrorists in Eastern Ghouta but there are reports (INAUDIBLE) targets like hospitals.  In this video from the Syrian activists you can hear the warplanes on their bombing runs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOUR ADAM, SYRIAN ACTIVIST:  Since 24 hours until this bombing they are more than 100 people killed by the Assad government and the Russia warplanes.  But they hit every building and every town and every village in Eastern Ghouta.  </p><p>Right now with the warplanes in the sky in Ghouta, you can hear the sound of those warplanes hit the building and the village in Eastern Ghouta.  </p><p>Today like -- they are like more than 24 people killed.  More than more than 20 people killed by the Russian warplanes in Duma City (ph). And worst of that, the warplanes target the hospital and make many hospital out of service, completely out of service.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE:  Welcome to our Jomana Karadsheh joins us now live from Amman in Jordan.</p><p>So Jomana, what's the latest on the humanitarian crisis inside Ghouta in terms of medical supplies and food and how much longer can they last?</p><p>JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, not very long, according to what we hear from the various aid agencies that are really urging the international community to do what it can to reach some sort of agreement, whether in the Security Council or on the sidelines for a cease fire, a truce, at least so they can try and get that much needed humanitarian aid into this area that has been besieged for about five years and to try and evacuate about 700 cases of people who need urgent medical support.  As you mentioned it's such a catastrophic --</p><p>[02:05:00]</p><p>KARADSHEH:  -- humanitarian situation in there, John, as described by the U.N.  chief.  It is hell on Earth for those civilians.  About 400,000 people estimated to be trapped inside Eastern Ghouta in the past few days.  </p><p>There has been this relentless bombing campaign, where they have no safe place to turn to, not even their basements are safe anymore and hospitals, as we've heard from the various medical groups, saying they claim the hospitals are being targeted.  </p><p>So and they're running out of almost everything.  We have heard this from the activists that we have been speaking to -- food, fuel, everything is really scarce in there.  And the situation in the hospitals where they have been running out of medical supplies, they've been using expired medications.  They've been reusing syringes.  It's a really dire situation.  </p><p>And unfortunately, people see no way out of this, as they are waiting for the international community yet again to act.</p><p>VAUSE:  Yes.  We have been down this road sadly before, Jomana.  Thank you for the live report.  </p><p>There are disturbing new details about the police response to the massacre at a Florida high school last week.  The Broward County sheriff says an armed deputy never went into the building during the rampage but waited outside.</p><p>The deputy has since resigned.  Sheriff Scott Israel described his reaction to seeing this incident on security video.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERIFF SCOTT ISRAEL, BROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA:  Devastated, sick to my stomach.  There are no words.  I mean, these families lost their children.  We lost coaches.  I've been to the funerals, I've been to the homes where they sit and shiver.  I've been to the vigils.  It's just -- there are no words.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE:  The news comes as President Trump doubles down on arming teachers to prevent school shootings.  He also supports tougher background checks and raising the legal age for buying a semiautomatic rifle from 18 to 21.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:   I think a concealed permit for having teachers, and letting people know that there are people in the building with a gun. </p><p>You won't have, in my opinion you won't have these shootings because these people are cowards.  They're not going to walk into a school if 20 percent of the teachers have guns.  It may be 10 percent or maybe 40 percent.</p><p>And what I'd recommend doing is the people that do carry, we give them a bonus.  We give them a little bit of a bonus.  So practically for free you have now made the school into a hardened target. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE:  Joining me here now in Los Angeles, CNN political commentator Joe Trippi and KABC talk radio host John Phillips.  </p><p>Good to have you both.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE:  So reading, writing and rifles is where it's going.  </p><p>John, seriously, in a public school system, where teachers don't have enough textbooks they don't have enough pens or pencils or basic supplies, the federal government will suddenly find close to a billion dollars to arm a million or so teachers and they don't even want it for the most part.</p><p>JOHN PHILLIPS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  The fact of the matter is it's unfortunate.  But the reality of the situation is that a lot of soft targets in today's day and age are going to have to become hard targets.  </p><p>We saw it at airports where you had pilots who had to go through very extensive training and carry guns on planes.  They can also carry it with them through the airplane terminal.  I think that's something that we certainly should look at for schools and other soft targets.  </p><p>We had a situation here yesterday or two days ago, at a high school in Whittier, where there was a threat made against a school.  And you had the guard there, who was unarmed, who leapt into duty and did everything that he was supposed to do.  And fortunately that was thwarted.</p><p>As we saw in Florida, sometimes things don't work like a Swiss clock. You had FBI missing obvious signs, you had the local police missing obviously signs, you had the school security guard who was there, who didn't do what he was supposed to do.  Sometimes it can be the last line of defense in an unfortunate situation.</p><p>VAUSE:  Joe, before you respond, I just want to -- the president obviously likes the idea, the NRA really loves  this idea.  But that seems that's it.  Listen to this. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  To arm, like to arm any teacher?</p><p>They're there to teach.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We don't need guns in the hands of teachers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't believe teachers should be armed.  I believe teachers should teach.</p><p>SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R), FLORIDA:  The notion that my kids are going to school with teachers that are armed with a weapon is not something that, quite frankly, I'm comfortable with.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE:  And Joe, there could be a lot of evidence that some teachers want them for the most part.</p><p>JOE TRIPPI, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  No, teachers don't want it. Senator Rubio, senator from Florida, you know, Little Rubio, I guess, the way the president --</p><p>VAUSE:  Little Marco.</p><p>TRIPPI:  -- Little Marco doesn't want them.  It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  The billion dollars that it would take.  And again, the teachers don't want them.  And they are there to teach.  </p><p>[02:10:00]</p><p>TRIPPI:  So I think this is just a nonstarter.  I don't think this is going to  go anywhere.</p><p>VAUSE:  And, John, at the same time, the president wants to arm the teachers or some of the teachers.  And he is opposed to active shooter drills because he doesn't want to give, you know, the children the negative news that there could be shooters one day will be in the school.</p><p>PHILLIPS:  We're going to have to rethink the way we handle security not just at schools but at shopping malls, at -- we certainly have at baseball stadiums, sporting stadiums.  You can't go to a baseball game now and Major League Baseball without going through a metal detector. It's a sad reality.  </p><p>But in a free society where you have people who are able to do these things, you have to take every precaution you can to make sure that the tragedy that we saw doesn't happen again.</p><p>VAUSE:  Drills are part of that.</p><p>TRIPPI:  I actually think the most significant thing was the president's willingness to move the age to 21.  That is some movement, at least in the right direction, I think, from him.</p><p>VAUSE:  And with that, that move is not supported by the NRA.</p><p>TRIPPI:  Right.</p><p>VAUSE:  But you know, as you said, this is progress.  And Donald Trump believes that he could probably win over the NRA on this measure. This is what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I don't think I'll be going up against them.  I really think the NRA wants to do what's right.  They're very close to me.  I'm very close to them.  They're very, very great people.  They love this country.  They're patriots.  The NRA wants to do the right thing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE:  Joe, in recent memory can you recall the NRA ever supporting a measure which would restrict the access to guns in this country as opposed to making it easier?</p><p>TRIPPI:  No.  They never have.  But I do think this is something the president -- I agree with him.  I think he can do this.  He has a real ability now to lead.  I mean to actually take some of the people that will support him, that will do, you know, follow him, even sort of against ideas that they didn't like before.  </p><p>He can move.  He's moved the parties, moved them in the --</p><p>VAUSE:  -- Nixon to China moment.  </p><p>TRIPPI:  Yes, and I think this is when he could actually make significant progress on just moving that age would be you know, look, I don't think it's enough.  But for the president to move that way is something --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE:  It would break the deadlock we've seen for the last 20  years essentially.</p><p>OK.  The NRA came out all guns blazing -- forgive me for saying that. This was on Thursday, the first public response to the school shooting in Florida.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WAYNE LAPIERRE, PRESIDENT, NRA:  As we've learned in recent months, even the FBI is not free of its own corruption and its own unethical agents.  Look and I know you probably all share this sentiment.  And I get people telling me from coast to coast.  </p><p>And they shake their heads when he they say it process.  I can understand a few bad apples in an organization as large as the FBI. But what's hard to understand  is why no one at the FBI stood up and called B.S. on its rogue leadership.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE:  John, this is an organization which the FBI is reportedly investigating for receiving millions of dollars of money from Russia, which was then funneled to the Trump campaign.  You know -- and what Wayne LaPierre is saying there, it sounded like it was out of the first chapter of Donald Trump's playbook.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:  In this particular case, the case of the Florida shooting, the FBI  certainly dropped the ball.  We've heard this so much as admitted by the FBI itself, by a lot of people who used to work in the organization, who consider themselves to be big supporters of them.  </p><p>But to go back to what the president suggested in terms of gun control, I think  that the NRA is going to have to get on board with that.  Because the president will be able to cobble together the votes.  </p><p>Not only is that good for a lot of Republicans who are running in purple states or blue states, it's good for a lot of Democrats who are representing red states, who are up for election this time, including 10 of them in states that Trump won.  </p><p>If the Democrats take a strident position on gun control and force people like Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Manchin to sign onto that, it's political suicide for them.  What the president could do is extend an olive branch to them and get some sort of consensus to put a majority together.</p><p>VAUSE:  Joe, I just want to get to what Wayne LaPierre was saying. This attack on the FBI, I mean, it sounded dangerous in a way.</p><p>TRIPPI:  No, this is something I think is dangerous.  It's again it's out of the Trump playbook, it's trying to distract from other things, sort of push off the FBI and destroy the credibility of the FBI and of the Mueller investigation.  </p><p>And this is a group that may very well be under investigation like many of the people around Trump.  Again, it's out of that play book. It's not a big surprise that he would say this.  But in the end, I think it's very, very dangerous to where the country's headed right now.</p><p>VAUSE:  I was surprised that he actually took it that far.  But OK, we're almost out of time.  </p><p>So do you remember when Paul Manafort actually proudly told everyone that he wasn't getting paid to be Donald Trump's campaign manager -- or chairman, rather?  </p><p>Not so because there is this --</p><p>[02:15:00]</p><p>VAUSE:  -- new indictment from Robert Mueller, the special counsel, in the Russia investigation and it shows that, along with his business partner, Rick Gates, Manafort was being paid before, during and after the election.  But here is the real substance of the new indictment.  </p><p>Prosecutors described a scheme in which the two long-time business partners allegedly laundered $30 million, failed to pay taxes for almost 10 years and used real estate they owned to fraudulently secure more than $20 million in loans.   John, Paul Manafort's lawyer says he is innocent.  But this is now all being seen as Mueller upping the pressure on Gates, upping it to then turn on Manafort and then alternately Manafort to turn on Trump.  </p><p>PHILLIPS:   Yes.  Still nothing to with Russian collusion.  More of the same.  Similar charges to what they charged Manafort with the first time.  I don't think a lot of people are surprised that Manafort didn't fill out the right forms or pay his taxes and has vulnerabilities there.  </p><p>But it doesn't go to the heart of what he is supposed to be investigating.</p><p>VAUSE:  But, Joe, if you look at the charges here, Manafort is, what, 70 years old.</p><p>TRIPPI:  Yes, he is spending the rest of his life in prison.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VAUSE:  If there is a guilty verdict.</p><p>TRIPPI:  -- if there is a guilty verdict there.  I think this is -- it is a bunch of stuff about Russia right now.  And Manafort and Gates may have deep insights into that, that may implicate the president or people around him, certainly his relatives.  And so I don't think -- I think to, again, I think this sort of repetition, that there is no collusion, there's no evidence of collusion, you know, I'm prepared to sit back with what's coming out.</p><p>VAUSE:  See what happens.</p><p>TRIPPI:  And to wait and see what happens there before I proclaim that.</p><p>VAUSE:  And obviously if nothing else, Mueller is playing hardball.  </p><p>Joe and John, good to see you both.</p><p>TRIPPI:  Good to be with you.</p><p>VAUSE:  Well, still to come here, the Australian government reeling from a sex scandal and now the deputy prime minister is giving up his post.  We'll have the details in a moment.  </p><p>And two of President Trump's children are on very two different high- profile international trips right now.  We'll tell you where they are and why a lot of people are paying attention.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>VAUSE:  Australia's deputy prime minister is giving up that role after admitting to an affair with a former staffer.  Barnaby Joyce will resign as the leader of the national party.  Earlier this month he confessed he was living with his former media adviser and they are also expecting a child.  </p><p>Joyce says he hopes the resignation will end the media coverage of the scandal.  </p><p>Not a chance.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNABY JOYCE, AUSTRALIAN DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER:  It's absolutely important.  It's incredibly important that this be a circuit breaker not just for the parliament but more importantly that it be a circuit broker for Vicki, it be a circuit broker for my unborn child, it be a circuit breaker for my daughters and it be a circuit breaker for Nat.  </p><p>It's got to stop.  This has got to stop.  And  it's not fair on them. It's just completely and utterly unwarranted, the sort of --</p><p>[02:20:00]</p><p>JOYCE:  -- observation that's happened.  On a humorous side, I think it's got to stop for the poor buggers who are parked outside my house every day.  I think it's got to stop for them as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE:  Caroline Marcus joins us now.  She is with Sky News Australia. And we find her in the great city of Armidale in Northern New South Wales.  </p><p>Caroline, OK, Joyce thinks that by resigning it will put all of this to one side.  That may be true but if nothing else, this will be a break for the government, which has been hammered by this scandal for weeks.</p><p>CAROLINE MARCUS, SKY NEWS AUSTRALIA:  Hi, John, yes, it will be a little bit of a break.  But parliament is sitting here in Australia next week.  And we have what is called senate estimate hearings, which are going through a lot of the questions that have been hounding deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce over the last few weeks since the scandal broke.  </p><p>It's been just over two weeks since it was revealed that the second most powerful man in Australia, Barnaby Joyce, is having a child with his former media adviser and that baby is due in April.  That staffer had been with him for some time in his offices in Canberra, in our capital.  </p><p>And that affair had been conducted when she was working for him.  It began then.  It was after this was revealed, John, that other stories came out about this affair, including that this staffer question had been moved from one office to another to another within the same party, raising questions about how the taxpayer money was being used to find jobs for her within government, to avoid her having to work directly with her lover.  </p><p>Now what's also brought Barnaby Joyce into disrepute is he is a famous conservative politician in this country.  He has campaigned on family values.  He quite famously stood in opposition to same-sex marriage when that was being debated and voted on last year here in Australia.  </p><p>So he has been portrayed as something of a hypocrite for having betrayed his own wife and four daughters by conducting this affair. But now the scrutiny really is on him and how he has used that taxpayer funding.  </p><p>It's also been revealed he has been living rent free here in Armidale, thanks to the generosity of a friend of his, who is a local businessman and donor to the party.  It will be interesting to see how things go forward from here.  </p><p>The national party which he has led and resigned from today are in a coalition government with the prime minister's party, the Liberal Party of Australia.  They need to work together in order to make the government wheels turn.  </p><p>So we'll find out Monday who gets elected as the new leader of the Nationals Party and we'll go forward, lead Australia with our prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull.</p><p>VAUSE:  Yes, not to forget that he also threatened to euthanize Pistol and Boo, Johnny Depp's dogs, which I think is probably his greatest international claim to fame.  </p><p>Caroline, thank you.  Be careful of whoever is shouting off to the side there in Armidale.  You never know.</p><p>OK.  Now to a segment called where in the world are President Trump's children?</p><p>The answers:  Ivanka just landed in South Korea.  She's representing the United States at the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games. She'll also meet with President Moon Jae-in and she will keep us guessing if she could in fact give a cold shoulder to the North Korean delegation, just like the vice president.  </p><p>Donald Trump Jr. continues his business trip in India.  The company line is it's all for the Trump Organization.  But the Trump is being touted as all business.  So even though some critics say he is there profiting from his father's presidency.  </p><p>Paula Hancocks is following Ivanka's trip in PyeongChang.  And CNN's Nikhil Kumar has more details on Donald Trump Jr.'s business trip in India.  </p><p>But, Paula, first to you.  Ivanka Trump, she will be meeting with the South Korean president.  They are expected to hold these talks or at least meet.  </p><p>Will they be substantive talks?</p><p>And if the opportunity comes up, is she in a position to hold negotiations with the North Koreans?</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, John, what we hear officially is that the Blue House, the presidential office here, is not going to try and facilitate talks between North Korea and the United States.  </p><p>As you say, though, Ivanka Trump will be having a banquet dinner with President Moon Jae-in  of South Korea this Friday night.  And so certainly you would expect that North Korea is going to come up.  Of course, they don't give an agenda for these kind of banquets.  </p><p>But it would be interesting to be a fly on the wall, just as with the U.S. vice president Mike Pence.  Clearly they would have been talking about the same issue as well.  Although with the U.S. vice president there was no overlap between the North Koreans and the United States.  </p><p>There was no acknowledgement from either side.  In fact, Mr. Pence --</p><p>[02:25:00]</p><p>HANCOCKS:  -- felt the need to try and defend the reason he didn't stand when the joint Korean team walked into the stadium during the opening ceremony.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  For all those in the media who think I should have stood and cheered with the North Koreans, I say the United States of America doesn't stand with murderous dictatorships.  </p><p>We stand up to murderous dictatorships.  And we will keep standing strong until North Korea stops threatening our country, our allies or until they abandon their nuclear and ballistic missiles once and for all.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HANCOCKS:  It will be interesting to see what happens at the closing ceremony, having spoken to some of the South Korean athletes.  We know they will be coming in, in the unified Korea outfit, marching alongside the South Korean athletes.  Very interesting to see whether or not Ivanka Trump stands for them although, given what Mr. Pence said there, you would imagine probably not -- John.</p><p>VAUSE:  There is always the intrigue, especially at this year's Winter Games.  Paula, thank you.  </p><p>Nikhil, to you, this speech which Donald Trump Jr. is set to deliver in a couple of hours was originally called \"Reshaping indo-Pacific Ties.\"  It sounded like some kind of foreign policy address, which was one of the big criticisms of this trip.  </p><p>Apparently it's now called a fireside chat.  So that would be an indication that maybe some of the criticism has had an impact. NIKHIL KUMAR, CNN NEW DELHI BUREAU CHIEF:  That's right, John.  The title has changed.  Until yesterday, the official agenda put out by the conference organizers said, as you said, you know, it talked about a talk about Indo-Pacific ties, which, as you say, sounded like foreign policy.  </p><p>Now in a few hours we are told that he is instead going to be having a fireside chat at the fireside chat with Donald Trump Jr.  And it's going to take place at the hotel you can see right behind me.  That's the venue.  </p><p>So that was one of the criticisms and the other criticism the trip has generated and concern that it has generated is that even here, Donald Trump Jr. has been here pretty much all week.  He arrived on Tuesday, he came to Delhi.  </p><p>Since then he has been all over the place.  He was in the eastern city of Calcutta.  He as we say in Pune near Mumbai, nearest the national capital.  Then he was in Mumbai itself; he is back in Delhi today and he has been promoting the Trump business.  This is the largest international market for the Trump Organization.  </p><p>They have licensed their name to five projects.  And tonight after the summit, after he speaks at the summit, he is going to a dinner which was advertised before he arrived with these massive four-page ads in India, which said, book your property in the Trump project over here and get invited to this dinner with Trump Jr., which  has generated a lot of criticism and concern about whether the people who are, in fact, booking these apartments, these condos, are doing it because they want to meet Donald Trump and Trump Jr., I should say, and through that get access to the Trump White House -- John.</p><p>VAUSE:  Yes, this has been the criticism for quite some time, the closeness between the family and the business.  And there is no firewall between it.  And I guess at the moment it's like water off a duck's back for the Trump family.  Nikhil, thank you for being with us.  Appreciate it.</p><p>Next here on NEWSROOM L.A.,  he is a survivor of the Florida high school shooting.  He is not he is not a paid actor.  How that conspiracy theory became a viral video and how it slipped through all the safety protocols on YouTube.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[02:30:50] VAUSE: Welcome back.  You're watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles.  I'm John Vause with the headlines this hour.  The U.N. Security Council will meets in the coming oust of both on a cease fire resolution for Syria.  The deals would allow for a 30-day truce, to allow both the military aide and medical evacuations.  News of the vote comes amid an intense bombing campaign in the rebel-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta.</p><p>A sex scandal has led to the resignation of Australia's deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce recently admitted to an affair with a former staffer who is now pregnant.  Joyce says he will step down as well as leader of the national party.  But he will remains a member of Parliament.</p><p>The Broward County Sheriff says an armed deputy waited outside during last week's school shooting in Florida.  The guard has resigned. Police also say officers who responded to the shooting were watching security footage on a 20-minute delay because someone had actually rewound the video.</p><p>YouTube has apologized after it was used as a platform to spread conspiracy theories about the Florida school shooting.  But there's one video in particular which seems to have taken the tech giant by surprise.  It claims David Hogg, an outspoken student leader of the Never Again Movement was in fact a paid actor.  This is just simply no true.  </p><p>Even so it quickly rose to the top trending spot before being removed before violating YouTube's policy on harassment and bullying.  This effort to smear the students and survivors of the Stoneman Douglas School shooting began on Monday with far right Web sites posting a vial mix of rumor innuendo and outright lies.  But YouTube video about Hogg raises news concerns about the social networks and our ability to stop the spread of fake news.  For more, CNN's Hadas Gold is with us from Washington.  Hadas, good to see you.  </p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN REPORTER:  Hi, John. Great to be with you.</p><p>VAUSE:  OK. Let's start with the statement to CNN from YouTube.  This video shouldn't never have appeared in trending because the video contained footage from authoritative news source, our system misclassified it.  That news source (INAUDIBLE) it came from the CBS station here in Los Angeles.  It was an older interview with David. And in some ways, this seems to highlights to need to humanize for human judgment as supposed to, you know, our computer's algorithms to sort out what is fake and what is not.  </p><p>GOLD:  That is the exact issue that we have here and that they are using computerized algorithms to do the work that maybe human should be doing.  YouTube doesn't have a group of people who are sitting around and checking the trending bars and checking the search results for any sort of possible conspiracy theories that are arising.  They are more reactive if things get flagged to them, if it starts becoming part of the news, then they take it down.  </p><p>But this incident is raising a lot of questions now for how they should react to this in the future and maybe there should be a sort of SWAT team of humans who when there's a big news event such as this horrific shooting they're just keeping an eye on it because for a whiles and I was testing this out.  </p><p>If you typed in David Hogg's name to YouTube's search bar, let's say you were looking for an interview he did, the first few results were these conspiracy videos.  And that's something that this social media and internet platforms are coming ahead to right now because they're starting to also get the eyes of government regulators looking at them and saying maybe we should start getting more involved in this process.   VAUSE:  Yes.  That's sort of been the constant sort of threat I guess hanging over all of the big tech companies.  The New York Times actually looked closely on how all of this happened.  Here is part of their reporting.  Unlike the other unhinged clips that have garnered significant attention on YouTube in the recent past, the video of the Parkland survivor originated with neither a conspiracy orientated media organization like Infowars, nor one of the popular YouTubers who created or catered rather, to far right subcultures and fringe political factions.  Instead it was posted to the infrequently updated account run by Mike M.  I guess which meant it did not raise any red flags and was -- I guess almost like a back door into the YouTube system.  </p><p>GOLD:  Exactly.  I mean, what -- people are so used to hearing that the sites like an Infowars or Gateway Pundit are the source of some of these videos, these conspiracy theories.</p><p>[02:35:06] But as we've known now for years, anybody's video, anybody can sort of become famous or trending on any of these platforms.  And that's clearly what happened here.  And so it might have raised some red flags in the traditional sense.  </p><p>But, you know, if one person makes a video after a big news event and kind of captures really quickly what's going on as this person clearly did with the student who became very well-known, then you reach this sort of interesting balance that these platforms need to strike between people who are expressing themselves on these platforms, which is obviously a big part of these platform success, it's how it's open to everybody but then also making sure that the truth is still goes out there.  </p><p>And maybe as people are discussing this, people who are discussing this should be this human teams that maybe don't have to delete the entire video but just make sure that it's not the top of tending, that it's not the top result in the search results that people when they're searching just for a legitimate information, they're actually finding it.  </p><p>VAUSE:  We saw this back in Sandy Hook, there was this great conspiracy theory put out that, you know, it was a basically all staged so the government could crackdown on, you know, people who are owning guns and that kind of stuff.  And the big social networks, they have promised to try and stop, you know, this part of this conspiracy theories.  But at the end of day, there remains a tension between cracking down on fake news content and there's also a business at the same time which has a business model of making money from getting people to watch.  And people watch this kind of stuff.  </p><p>GOLD:  And that's exactly right.  I mean, if you look at the viewership numbers on some of these videos, there are hundreds of thousands of viewers.  And if you put an ad on to that, that's how these platforms make their money.  But this is something that people are clearly asking for.  And at some point, as these tech platforms has said themselves that their whole business model is really based off of the trust of the users, that users trust them to get them good information.  And if they start losing that trust and they start losing their business.  </p><p>VAUSE:  Yes.  Yes, exactly, because this has been -- this has been going on not just this we saw, you know, in the 2016 election and continues to go on.  And, you know, some would say really need to get a handle on relatively soon because the clock is ticking all over this.  But Hadas, good to see you.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>GOLD:  Thanks for having me. </p><p>VAUSE:  Well, a quick break here.  And then part of the appeal of Cuba, the street filled with colorful classic cars from the 50s.  But many Cubans, they prefer something a little less cool.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUSE:  CNN is partnering with young people all around the world for a student-led day of action against modern day slavery.

And just truly be yourself.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUSE:  We want to hear what freedom means to you.  Post a photo or video to social media using the #MyFreedomDay.</p><p>OK.  It may be a Cold War relic back in Cuba.  A lot of car is king of the road.  CNN's Patrick Oppmamm discovers the lasting legacy of soviet engineering.  </p><p>PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Cuba is famous for its vintage American cars.  Classic Chevys and Chryslers that tourists love to pose in front of.  But this island is also home to one of the world's largest collections of old Russian cars.  Ladas, Volgas and Maskoviches, aging soviet arrow work horse that drive like tractors and have all the style of a tin can but are still kept running in a country in short supply of transportation.  And there are Cubans who said they actually prefer the Russian cars and meet up for friendly races to show off the superiority of soviet engineering.  </p><p>These are the cars that the current generation were born with.  Says the head of a local club for Russian car aficionados.  These are the cars they learned to repair and how to drive.  Many of the Russian cars are decades older than their drivers.  These cars are a reminder of when Cuba was aligned with the Soviet Union and socialism was supposed to be the bright future for this island.  Many of the cars were given as rewards for the most faithful supporters of the revolution who have since passed them on to their children and grandchildren.  For as long as they can keep them running.  It's like they're part of the family Ernesto says.  Like your grandfather, still there alive but you're not sure how much longer.</p><p>After the you fall of the Soviet Union, Cubans assumed no more Russian cars were coming their way.  But in January, the Cuban government imported 320 new Ladas to serve as taxis.  The first Russian cars brought the island in 12 years and a flashy version of the Lada, the Cubans weren't familiar with.  Not everyone is impressed.</p><p>They look like cars with technology that are light and fast he says, but they won't last as long as these cars do.  And if nothing else, Cuba's original Russian cars have shown they can withstand the test of time.  Patrick Oppmann, CNN Havana.</p><p>VAUSE:  OK.  And amazing end and a heartwarming end with terrifying ordeal in Egypt.  Police noticed a little boy was dangling from the third floor of building.  The boy was at a party accidentally fell through a window.  So officers scrambled to get some fabric try and catch him but instead the five-year-old fell into one of the policeman's arms, amazingly the child wasn't hurt.  The policeman was OK as well, and the little boy back with his mom.  Thank you for watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles.  I'm John Vause.  Stay with us.  \"WORLD SPORT\" is next live from Pyeongchang.  You're watching CNN.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[02:45:10] AMANDA DAVIES, CNN INTERNATIONAL SPORTS ANCHOR:  Hi, thanks for joining us.  Welcome along to WORLD SPORT, and day 14 of the Winter Olympics with me, Amanda Davies.  So, where we have just two days to go until the closing ceremony here in Pyeongchang.  Today was always going to have to go something to beat yesterday.  But, for the much-anticipated battle for figure skating gold has more than lived up to the hype.</p><p>Two young Russians who share the same coach going head to head for one Olympic gold.  No one else had been given a chance in the build-up. Alina Zagitova, a 15 year old who set a new world record in her free skate, up against her 18 year old compatriot, Evgenia Medvedeva, a two-time world and European champion.</p><p>As a long wait, while the rest of the player perform, it was Zagitova who went first.  Dressed in red as predicted, she performed her jumps and moves with technical difficulty in the second half of the program, hoping to get more points.  Say it wasn't perfect though, but it did produce a score just shy of her personal best.  And it was enough to lift her into the gold medal position.  Interestingly, she looked a little bit disappoint at her score.  But maybe that was because she knew what was to come.</p><p>Medvedeva, then, took to the ice and put in a near perfect performance.  In some people's eyes better than what had come before, but the scores came in and amid what sounded like shock and something of a stunned silence really in the arena.  Medvedeva was given exactly the same score in her free skate as her rival but missed on gold because of the short programs scores.</p><p>So, it is 15 year old, Alina Zagitova, with gold at her first Winter Olympics.  18 year old Medvedeva with silver and Canada's Kaetlyn Osmond, taking Bronze.  And a little bit earlier on, I asked our CNN Contributor Christine Brennan, who was watching if the right woman won?</p><p>CHRISTINE BRENNAN, CNN SPORTS ANALYST (via telephone):  Obviously, both Alina Zagitova and Evgenia Medvedeva had a tremendous performances today.  As did Kaetlyn Osmond, and from Canada, 22 years old.  Great jump, great speed on the ice, is deserving bronze medalist.</p><p>But I would have had it the other way.  I would have had Medvedeva, two-time world champ, 18 years old.  I think she -- I would be at her first, and I went up at head, Zagitova, second.  I believe that Medvedeva had the more complete program.  It is not just about jumps, it's also about the artistry and it's about the placements of the jumps.</p><p>And as you know, we have talked about this.  Zagitova was backloading that program, all the jumps in the final two minutes.  She got a lot of points for it, but I don't think that was a complete program.  I don't think it was the beautiful well-balanced program that you would expect frankly, of an Olympic gold medalist.</p><p>And so, I said, Medvedeva would have been in number one in my book. Obviously, it was so close.  1.31 points between the two training partners.  And once again, figure skating chooses the jumper over the artist.  We saw it 20 years ago in Nagano, Michelle Kwan being upset by Tara Lipinski.  It happened again here today.  I guess we shouldn't be surprised by that, but it was a bit of an upset.  I think, again, the skating community thought Medvedeva might have it with her beautiful performance today.  But her 15 year old counterpart, compatriot, and countrywoman, Zagitova did win the gold and obviously, it's a message for the sport, keep jumping.</p><p>DAVIES:  Now, that was Christine Brennan, a little bit earlier on Zagitova, with the gold medal, the first gold of these games for the Olympic athletes from Russia.  The team's 14th medal overall.  And there may will be another opportunity for another this weekend.</p><p>The OAR have just begun their men's ice hockey semifinal against the Czech Republic.  There many people's favorites for the gold with Canada see it as the greatest rivals.  It is still scoreless so far, very early on in that game.  Canada taking on Germany in the other semifinal later this evening.</p><p>Well, the International Olympic Committee is set to decide this weekend whether or not they lift the ban on the Russian team for the closing ceremony and allow them to march under their own flag with their own uniforms.  But two Russians who won't be there, the mixed doubles curling pair of Alexander Krushelnitzky and his wife, Anastasia.  They have here returned home to Saint Petersburg in Russia.  Having been stripped to their bronze medal, following Alexander's failed drug test from meldonium.  The World Curling Federation continue to investigate the case.</p><p>Canada's dominance in the women ski cross continues, they won gold their third straight games, thanks to Kelsey Serwa.  (INAUDIBLE) may Brittany Phelan took silver.  They've been high hopes for reigning champion Marielle Thompson on her come back from injury, but when the race started, her dreams for the medal defense were over in about 10 seconds.  It was a credential packed final field, but so produced the comfortable win in the end.  Pulling away from Phelan to go one better on her silver medal in Sochi, four years ago.</p><p>That Canada's 10th gold of the games putting them just one behind Norway and Germany.  Or just one place I should say, behind Norway and Germany who have 13.  As for totals medals, Norway still ahead with 35 in total for these games.  That actually only predicted a total of 30. So, great going for them.  Stay with us and WORLD SPORT will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[02:52:43] DAVIES:  Welcome back to WORLD SPORT, and Pyeongchang, we're just two days away from the closing ceremony where once again there'll be a lot of focus on the (INAUDIBLE) delegations from North and South Korea, who marched at the opening ceremony under the unified flag.</p><p>The women's hockey team created history here as the first ever unified Korean team to take part at the Olympics.  But they build-up with less than ideal with 12 North Korean players joining forces with the existing score of 23 from South Korea, causing language issues and very late team strategy changes.  They failed to win the game, conceded 28 goals and scored just two.  So, what did the players make of it?  I spoke to two of the original South Korean team a little bit earlier on.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RANDI GRIFFIN, UNIFIED KOREAN HOCKEY PLAYER:  When we first found out there was just a lot of uncertainty, and we've been preparing for so long that it's very easy to let that uncertainty kind of spiral into like worst-case scenarios.  And so, we were worried about it, but then, I think once the North Korean players arrived and we saw that -- you know, they're just people, they're hockey players and they're girls like us.  And we started getting to know them and we just became a hockey team again.</p><p>DAVIES:  What has been the biggest challenge?  A lot has been made of the language barriers.  But is that -- has that been the biggest challenge for you guys?  Do you want to answer that one as the translator?</p><p>JO SU-SIE, UNIFIED KOREAN HOCKEY PLAYER:  OK, with Sara, our coach was speaking in English.  And I had to translate in Korean for like Korean players.  And I have to -- I had to translate from Korean to North Korean, because like they are not used to any English.</p><p>DAVIES:  And what is the view of your family of the unified team? Have they agreed with it as an idea?</p><p>JO SU-SIE, UNIFIED KOREAN HOCKEY PLAYER:  Yes, first -- at first, it was very difficult for us, me, and our team to accept that, like suggestion, having two countries come together is really like good for politics and relationship.</p><p>GRIFFIN:  I know that my grandfather was not happy about it and didn't really like the idea of what he saw as North Koreans high jacking the spotlight of our team in the Olympics.  And didn't have great feelings towards the cheerleaders, and that sort of thing.  But, I think, once the game started and he was just watching hockey, he was proud of me and proud of our team.  And maybe just thought that was a little bit weird.</p><p>[02:55:18] DAVIES:  What did you think of the cheerleaders?</p><p>GRIFFIN:  I've never seen anything like the cheerleaders at a sporting event.</p><p>DAVIES:  Neither have we.</p><p>GRIFFIN:  You know, they were very interesting.  Sometimes it was hard, you know, when you're on the ice are trying to just focus on the game, and just you with on the ice.  But sometimes I'm kind of like, you know, like what's going on up there?</p><p>It was interesting, and I think, probably the weirdest thing about it was that they try of had their own routine that seem like they had nothing to do with what was really happening on the ice.  And usually, at a hockey game, the fans are kind of responding to what's happening -- you know, and we could be losing 8-0 to Swiss and they're so like, \"we are winning like we are great.\"  And so, like, OK.  So, yes, it was just a little bit of a strange different experience, but, yes, I guess it was interesting.</p><p>DAVIES:  So, would you like to see the unified team continue moving forward?</p><p>GRIFFIN:  For this Olympics, I think, we were able to make the best of it and get through it because we knew this is just two weeks.  And that's a very different thing than talking about like a three or four- year plan.  And certainly, it wouldn't make a lot of sense I don't think for our team to continue training at a South Korean team for four years, and then, have them show up two weeks before again like that's not really unified at all.  That's just adding a few North Korean players at the last minute to the roster.  So, I think, there's just a lot of details that would have to be worked out, and I haven't heard any kind of details.  So, it's hard to say.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DAVIES:  Very interesting, the girls afterwards saying they quite like the idea of staying in touch with some of the North Korean players but they're not sure how they would be able to do that.  According to the South Korean news agency, Yonhap, the North and South Korea are going to hold talks next Tuesday about the possible participation of North Korea at next month's Paralympics.  We will, of course, get you any more details on that as -- and when we get them both for now.</p><p>That's it, from me and the team for this edition of WORLD SPORT live from Pyeongchang.
