(AMZN) and Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Google, and for scrutiny of <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20003168/index.dl|minority\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20003168/index.dl|minority</url> stakes that rarely raise Washington alarms. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agency also garners attention for the risk arbitrage-enlightening tea leaves it reveals on live transactions through candid public disclosures that contrast sharply with the secrecy that shrouds U.S. federal reviews.</p><p>Now, as the U.K. prepares to withdraw from the European Union, London is poised to rival Washington and Brussels as an antitrust superpower.</p><p> It s now reached the consciousness of a U.S. audience that the CMA is picking up international deals with a U.S.-centric presence with little or no meaningful U.K. nexus,  said Bill Batchelor, partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP and affiliates in London.</p><p>The agency is particularly keen on U.S. tech mergers with broad policy implications.</p><p>Recent examples include the since-abandoned $1.2 billion combination of <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20002299/index.dl|gene\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20002299/index.dl|gene</url> sequencing companies Pacific Biosciences of California Inc. (PACB) and Illumina Inc. (ILMN) and Google s $2.6 billion purchase of cloud startup Looker Data Sciences Inc., cleared without remedies. </p><p>All four are headquartered in California.</p><p> I think the CMA believes, along with a number of other authorities, that merger policy was not as tough as it should have been over the past decade,  said Bill Kovacic, former Federal Trade Commission chairman.</p><p>Its  intensification of scrutiny  is a response to those criticisms, said Kovacic, appointed to the CMA s board of directors in 2013 to help establish its framework and priorities and monitor its performance.</p><p>While the CMA doesn t require merger parties to submit paperwork, stakeholders know it can investigate anyway, so they routinely file, resulting in a notification process that resembles a de facto mandatory requirement, he said.</p><p>Created in 2014 to consolidate the Competition Commission and the Office of Fair Trading, or OFT, the CMA aims to be more rigorous than its predecessors.</p><p>Kovacic noted that it tasked a Rome-based consultancy last year with examining four digital transactions the OFT cleared.</p><p>They include two that Big Tech s fiercest critics want unwound: Google s 2013 purchase of navigation app Waze Inc. and Facebook Inc. s (FB) 2012 acquisition of Instagram Inc.</p><p>True to form, the consultant's\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.learlab.com/news/the-report-on-evaluation-of-past-merger-decisions-in-the-uk-digital-sector-is-online/|report\">https://www.learlab.com/news/the-report-on-evaluation-of-past-merger-decisions-in-the-uk-digital-sector-is-online/|report</url> is online. Among the conclusions:  The set of decisions analyzed has revealed gaps in the authorities  understanding of digital markets. </p><p>The authors urge enforcers to push  the boundaries of the legal tests and constraints  they face to improve effectiveness. For digital markets that have redefined competition,  a more risk-taking approach  may be justified.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Post-Brexit CMA</emphasis></p><p>While the CMA traditionally cedes large, marquee mergers to the European Commission, the CMA has left its imprimatur analyzing smaller combinations Brussels ignores.</p><p> With Brexit, the CMA now stands on the same footing as the Department of Justice, the European Commission,  Kovacic said.  It s in a position to play a more significant role on the global stage as a separate independent voice. </p><p>The agency wouldn t have to step aside when the EU tackles high-profile cases after the end of the Brexit transition, scheduled for Dec. 31, Batchelor emphasized.  They will review in parallel with the EU. </p><p>That means lawyers representing merger parties must factor in CMA timelines.  They re going to be on your list of crucial regulators to take into account,  the Skadden attorney said.</p><p>The European Commission has levied hefty fines against U.S. tech giants Google, Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Facebook. Washington is investigating the market power of leading digital platforms and exploring whether to unwind consummated mergers. </p><p>Not to be outdone, the CMA has flexed its regulatory muscle on Big Tech. In March, it published  Unlocking Digital Competition,  a groundbreaking <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/785547/unlocking_digital_competition_furman_review_web.pdf|report\">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/785547/unlocking_digital_competition_furman_review_web.pdf|report</url> authored by a panel chaired by Jason Furman, chief economic adviser to former U.S. President Barack Obama.</p><p>It recommends a digital markets unit that would develop a code of competitive conduct and investigate companies, impose solutions and assess penalties. The agency followed with a July report that outlined its <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/814709/cma_digital_strategy_2019.pdf|digital\">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/814709/cma_digital_strategy_2019.pdf|digital</url> markets strategy.</p><p>A more prominent international role could make the CMA s chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, as recognizable someday as Margrethe Vestager, Europe s longtime antitrust czar whose title now encompasses EU digital policy. </p><p>Even if no longer a member of the European Competition Network, the CMA could maintain critical links to Brussels. This could be accomplished by forging strong relations with European competition authorities through new bilateral or multilateral arrangements with the European Commission and EU Member States, The Deal has learned. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Washington Lessons</emphasis></p><p>The CMA s most defining trait is its gushing transparency. It regularly updates the public on the status, duration and scope of reviews. The openness enhances the agency s visibility and guarantees its analysis reverberates well beyond its borders.</p><p>Such disclosure is unthinkable stateside, where officials deliberate in private and mergers often clear with no explanation. </p><p>The CMA is even lifting the lid on Washington s secrets. </p><p>A quick check of the CMA s navigable website can reveal details about confidential documents and preliminary enforcement decisions on transactions U.S. enforcers have been silent on.</p><p>Recently, the CMA <url normalizedValue=\"https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20004017/index.dl|divulged\">https://pipeline.thedeal.com/article/20004017/index.dl|divulged</url> that the DOJ cleared Google-Looker, something the department never confirmed. </p><p>Since U.S. and U.K. officials trade information and coordinate efforts, any insights gleaned from the CMA likely reflect topics under discussion in Washington. Nevertheless, there s no guarantee the Brits and their Yankee counterparts always would agree.</p><p>The CMA can afford such openness because it s not a prosecutor. It can block a transaction by fiat with a prohibition order without going to court to prove the merits of its case. </p><p>While parties can appeal, they must satisfy the  highly demanding standard  of proving the CMA erred in interpreting the law or made an irrational or procedurally tainted decision, Batchelor explained. </p><p>U.S. enforcers are more cautious in case they litigate.

We then pick a threat from leftfield that banks, start-ups, and big tech companies are ignoring - perhaps at their peril.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech giants</p><p>As the WEF report notes, banks are becoming increasingly reliant on tech giants for services such as building customer interfaces, cloud storage, or even marketing. Amazon's cloud computing platform, for example, is being used by firms such as Carlyle, and its voice-activated system, 'Alexa', has been picked up by Capital One. Banks are using social media and Google as ad platforms to acquire new customers, but in other, product-driven ways too, with Brazil's Banco Bradesco letting its customers conduct their daily banking through social media apps.</p><p>At the same time, many of these tech giants have begun to show an increasing interest in providing elements of financial services to their own retail customers. Could this be a Trojan horse situation?</p><p>Such change is being played out with particular intensity in China where WeChat, the dominant social media app with multiple utilities, is giving prominence to its own WePay payments product over incumbent financial services companies.</p><p>Unlike a fintech firm, these technology companies wouldn't have to build a brand from scratch; they could hand-pick their points of entry into financial services and capitalise on financial institutions' dependence on them. With cyber security likely to become an increasing determinant of customer trust in financial services brands, the tech-driven reputation of companies like Google and Amazon could be a major advantage.</p><p>For now, the relatively low return on equity offered by banks differs significantly from the highly scalable, operationally streamlined models of most tech companies. However the introduction of  open banking regulations could make it possible for tech companies to finally bring their high return on equity business models to bear on the financial services industry. Return on equity may also not be the primary objective for tech companies entering the financial services arena. Owning the end-to-end customer relationship provides unprecedented understanding of customer behaviour, wants and needs and would allow the tech giants to expand the range of services they provide in a very targeted and efficient fashion.</p><p>There is another side of the coin however.</p><p>Banking and financial services are not easy sectors to enter. They carry complex regulatory procedures that need to be managed nationally as well as internationally. They can be capital intensive, susceptible to large-scale frauds, and ultimately pose a major risk to the broader reputation of a multi-sector business. Cool, respected, tech execs might not be keen on their reputations being dragged through the mud should customers feel mistreated. These businesses might decide that the regulatory burden of entering the market is just too heavy to bear.</p><p>Whilst new open data initiatives should lower some of these barriers to entry, it is not a certainty that tech giants will shift their gaze toward financial services.</p><p>Start-ups</p><p>Start-ups have gained huge amounts of consumer trust and loyalty within early-adopter networks by providing more transparent and user-friendly services than those of many of the banks. If these trusted start-ups broaden their offerings to mimic the holistic nature of banks, they could leverage their hard-won reputations and entice customers away from their banks. TransferWise, for example, might be an app for transferring money abroad, but you only have to read their job descriptions to see that they have their eye on a bigger prize. They claim their goal is to be the UK's most popular, most loved and most trusted financial brand.</p><p>But it's a tough slog scaling to be a major, mass-market business. The report from WEF and Deloitte points out that start-ups did not grab as much market share this year as expected. Acquiring customers for traditional financial services products is hard, and convincing them to switch is even harder. Historically, persuading customers to switch over has been a sticking point, even within the industry, with banks often resorting to buying their customers with expensive inducements. Whilst the early-adopter audience might love a better price and user experience, the general public aren't sure if they can trust unknown brands, and are maybe happy to pay a little more to stick with what they know.</p><p>The old adage is that companies need to create a 10x improvement in services for people to switch. Early adopters might move for less, but the bar is pretty high when it comes to convincing mass-market consumers to change their deep-rooted behaviours. Creating a 10x better experience in banking will not be as easy as some start-up founders like to claim.</p><p>A leftfield threat</p><p>Despite all the buzz around tech giants and start-ups, there is another threat to banks that has been conspicuously absent from this debate.</p><p>Price comparison sites.</p><p>These companies have done a lot of the hard work already. Brands like Compare The Market and Moneysupermarket have invested heavily in building a reputation amongst the general public. They've gathered the regulatory expertise to navigate the complex financial services landscape. And they've developed partnerships with a huge range of product providers.</p><p>Price is only one reason why customers might choose a financial services product however, and price comparison websites would have to learn how to create the right products, brand and user experience to win the day. Price alone might not be enough.</p><p>German company Raisin's recent acquisition of Manchester-based PBF solutions suggests they might be preparing to make the move from intelligent price comparison website to something closer to a banking service in the UK.</p><p>In the open banking universe, price comparison sites could be uniquely positioned to take advantage of increased competition as they gain further access to valuable customer data. In the future, the Moneysupermarkets of the world could own the customer relationship and sit in front of the banks, with the bank relegated to something akin to a financial services utility.</p><p>Watch this space for meerkats.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

This follows the UK Finance announcement on 12 June 2019 which outlined proposed activity in support of the Access to Cash Review, and aligning with the existing activity undertaken by LINK.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Over the summer, UK Finance has been engaging with consumer representatives, local authority representatives and market participants, including LINK and its members, on the cash needs of local communities. Through this work it has become apparent that (outside of LINK's welcome commitment on ATM provision) the sustainability of the wider system to meet customer cash needs relies on strengthening complementary non-ATM solutions for cash and payment access. UK Finance's forward focus will include the 'recycling' of cash in local communities, improving access to digital alternatives and the engagement of key technology and infrastructure partners. Complementary to LINK's commitments, UK Finance will be focusing on solutions in the following five key areas:</p><p>1. Commitment to LINK and the Post Office: UK Finance welcomes LINK's recent announcement on securing free cash access in key retail centres, supported by a strengthening of the Financial Inclusion programme for key communities. UK Finance members support and fund LINK and contracts with the Post Office (through the Banking Framework) to use 11,500 branches nationwide and will continue to monitor the effectiveness of cash provision through these channels closely and take action to improve delivery where necessary.</p><p>2. The Community Access to Cash Initiative: UK Finance is today launching this initiative to facilitate cross-industry work with local communities, through their elected officials (including MPs, members of devolved parliaments and assemblies, mayors and councillors), to help identify, report and address gaps and barriers to cash and payment provision. The initiative will provide grant support and industry guidance to local communities to improve access to cash and the adoption of alternative solutions where an ATM is not appropriate or required. Applications for grant support will be community-led and should be focused on building towards long-term solutions, for example:</p><p>* Digital education awareness programmes</p><p>* Driving community cashback</p><p>* Helping local communities to connect with partners who can increase awareness of, and access to, available and secure cash provision</p><p>Applications can be submitted via LINK's website from 31 October 2019 through to 31 January 2020, with awards to be made by 31 March 2020. The assessment and award of grants will be considered by a UK Finance Award Committee made up of a cross-section of member representatives. Natalie Ceeney CBE has kindly agreed to Chair the inaugural meeting of the Award Committee in an independent capacity.</p><p>3. Local community cash recycling: UK Finance believes that retailer cashback has a more significant role to play and can support the efficient recycling of cash in local communities, as well as providing much needed support for High Streets generally. Cashback can drive a healthy and efficient local cash ecosystem, whereby cash spend in shops is re-drawn and spent again locally, rather than directed back to central hubs for redistribution. UK Finance will monitor and support various retailer cashback pilots and initiatives that have the ability to drive efficient recycling of cash in local communities. UK Finance is encouraged by the positive dialogue it has held with regulators on supporting cashback initiatives which are in train.</p><p>4. Access to digital innovation: UK Finance will work with key stakeholders, including Natalie Ceeney CBE, the UK and devolved governments, regulators and consumer representatives to encourage delivery of innovative digital solutions and help enable everyone to use digital payments through improving access to digital infrastructure and capabilities.</p><p>5. Awareness and mapping: UK Finance will develop awareness campaigns and a comprehensive map of the available channels through which consumers can access cash (e.g. bank and building society networks, post office, ATMs, merchant cashback, etc). UK Finance continues to believe that in a world of data, providing customers with information about where they can access cash is fundamental, particularly as more channels come online. The banking and finance industry is now seeking partners to build a mapping capability which would provide consumers with information on their nearest free-to-use cash outlet.</p><p>Next Steps and Call for Partners</p><p>UK Finance will continue to work closely with HM Treasury, Bank of England, regulators, Natalie Ceeney CBE, consumer groups and the UK Finance Consumer Advisory Group as work is progressed on access to cash.</p><p>It has become increasingly clear that solutions to the access to cash challenge will be found through collaboration beyond the banking and finance industry.</p><p>The challenges and opportunities faced in securing appropriate access to cash and payment services for consumers are shared by the whole of society. UK Finance is therefore calling for partners across industries, including telecommunications and 'Big-Tech' companies, retailers and payment innovators, to engage on the solutions in the above areas.</p><p>Stephen Jones, Chief Executive of UK Finance, said:</p><p>\"The banking and finance industry is committed to ensuring access to cash remains free and widely accessible for those that continue to need it. Yet there is no 'one size fits all' approach and only via collaboration across government, regulators, industry, customer groups and communities can this be achieved. Understanding the needs of local communities is critical and the new Community Access to Cash Initiative will help identify the most appropriate access to cash and payment service solutions. Local cash recycling will play a pivotal role in the sustainability of the system, although we can't achieve a resilient and sustainable cash landscape on our own. It is vital we are supported by other sectors such as telecoms, retailers and infrastructure providers to assure widespread provision.\"</p><p>City minister, John Glen, said:</p><p>\"Technology is transforming how we manage our money, but with 11 billion payments made in cash last year we know that access remains a critical issue for many. Today's announcement shows the industry stepping up to the plate to ensure access to cash for people who need it, while also helping them to take advantage of the digital innovations that are giving so many of us greater control over our finances.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6876148 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6876148</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5N-WSH1-DYG2-R204-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1126\"/><timeReceived>8:22 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 30, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000813</classCode><className>GRANTS &amp; GIFTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N921100GG</classCode><className>DEVOLVED GOVERNMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>ST000DN6R</classCode><className>PUBLIC OFFICIALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001912</classCode><className>RETAIL &amp; WHOLESALE TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008XSL</classCode><className>RETAILERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000DKQY</classCode><className>SHOPPING CENTERS &amp; MALLS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GX106</classCode><className>LONDON, ENGLAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The conclusive outcome of the December 2019 general election implies a more-certain political backdrop for the UK banking industry than has been in the case in every year since the 2014 Scottish referendum. Moreover, the results of the recent Bank of England stress test reaffirmed our view that UK banks are well-positioned to manage a global economic slowdown.\"</p><p>The negative pressures on net interest margins and other sources of operating income have become \"well-established\" themes in UK banking in recent years.</p><p>\"It is hard to imagine this changing materially in 2020, particularly if the Bank of England cuts interest rates again,\" said S&amp;P. \"Moreover, although all banks have been working hard to reduce their operating expense base, further rounds of cost control are likely if low rates persist.\"</p><p>With personal lending only expected to rise about 3% in 2020, while business lending is forecast to see lower credit growth, UK lenders may be forced to relax their cautious risk management, S&amp;P said.</p><p>\"If the cautious risk management functions relax their risk appetite by a modest amount, it could support the supply of credit. Stronger credit growth would help lenders to partly offset weak net interest margins,\" the ratings agency said.</p><p>A major non-financial risk, S&amp;P noted, is the \"significant technological diffusion\" facing the banking industry.</p><p>\"The UK is a global hub in the fintech space. We see a limited, but sufficient, window of opportunity for incumbents to react before the potential mass adoption of 'Open Banking', a set of regulatory reforms that will make it easier for customers to consolidate their financial data and shop around. Moreover, the large and innovative nature of the UK banking sector may yet prove sufficiently attractive to the Big Tech corporates, which could enter into similar partnership structures to those seen recently in the US online retail banking market,\" S&amp;P said.</p><p>The ratings agency commented, however, that recent earnings from smaller fintech firms in the UK have shown they have struggled to break into the market share of the largest UK banks, which could result in some consolidation in the sector.</p><p>S&amp;P noted its UK banking outlook is consistent with its global banking industry outlook.</p><p>\"Although our ratings on most UK banks have stable outlooks, those banks that can meet the long-term industry challenges, while maintaining their credit fundamentals, could see ratings upside,\" added S&amp;P. </p><p>S&amp;P continued: \"The low-rate policy carries a silver lining: it has helped to keep loan losses exceptionally low. Nevertheless, over our two-year outlook horizon, the threat of a UK recession could yet become reality. Idiosyncratic events from non-financial risks may also weaken ratings. We therefore caution that any apparent ratings upside from the recently altered UK political backdrop may prove to be transitory.\"</p><p>S&amp;P currently holds an A+ credit rating for HSBC; A- for Lloyds, Nationwide and Standard Chartered; BBB+ for Barclays, RBS and Santander UK; and BBB for Virgin Money.</p><p>By Paul McGowan; <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:paulmcgowan@alliancenews.com\">paulmcgowan@alliancenews.com</email></p><p>Copyright 2020 Alliance News Limited.

At a recent seminar on 'Big Tech', social media and privacy, organised by Professor Robin Barnes of the Global Institute of Freedom and Awareness and Peter Coe of Aston University, social media was compared to the sea, unleashing unpredictable forces and incalculable hazards in a boundless world. It was suggested that, in lieu of a defined system of regulation, we should address these hazards as, when, and where they arise.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The suggestion is born of the view that social media platforms were founded on principles of libertarianism, akin to those that underpin the free market: the aim was an unregulated platform of free speech and the unimpeded sharing of ideas, on the basis that regulating or restricting free speech would cause more harm than any caused by the speech itself. It has become clear though that the notion of a 'truest' platform for speech is both idealistic and unrealistic, where damaging statements online regularly prompt us (and the courts) to weigh up people's competing rights to freedom of expression and privacy.</p><p>Libertarianism relies on the assumption that people read news objectively, and that reporting is considered rationally. Unfortunately, history tells us otherwise. The success of propaganda paved the way for its modern counterpart: fake news. It is often impossible to interpret fake news rationally, or even to discern the fake from the real, as those responsible for disseminating false information have an uncanny ability to weave truth and lies into a persuasive narrative.</p><p>Citizen journalism presents similar problems. Encouraged by slogans such as CNN's \"You see it, you report it\", the public is now primed to capture the news as it happens, often at the expense of context. This exacerbates the move towards instantaneous, picture- and video-based reporting, and away from traditional, investigative journalism, which requires both time and resources to unpick the truth.</p><p>It is also worth bearing in mind, in the context of a legal action for the potential misuse of private information, that pictures and video can result in more poignant invasions of privacy. As Lord Phillips M.R. explained in a case involving secret photographs of a high-profile wedding: a photograph can certainly capture every detail of a momentary event in a way which words cannot. He added that \"special considerations attach to photographs in the field of privacy. They are not merely a method of conveying information that is an alternative to verbal description. They enable the person viewing the photograph to act as a spectator, in some circumstances voyeur would be the more appropriate noun, of whatever it is that the photograph depicts.\" A later judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Recklos v Greece found that a personal image constitutes a chief attribute of personality. The law therefore acknowledges that visual details have the power to be especially intrusive.</p><p>All of this points to a different approach, that what we need is not less but more regulation, specifically that all publishers should be subject to regulation, including social media platforms. Currently, platforms tend to escape primary liability for problematic content, on the grounds that they are mere hosts as opposed to true publishers.</p><p>But, as will no doubt continue to fuel passionate debate, regulation poses problems too, not just the question of how to rein in 'Big Tech', with its considerable lobbying strength, but how tightly.  Arguably, social media news streams now transcend politics, providing an influential space for voices that would otherwise remain unheard. In curbing the power of social media platforms, we risk muffling an important mouthpiece.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.</p><p><br/> Ms Alexandra Agnew<br/> Mishcon de Reya<br/> Africa House<br/> 70 Kingsway<br/> London<br/> WC2B 6AH<br/> UK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONDAQ-10709146</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MONDAQ2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJ0-XVY1-DYX7-J53N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">149522</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"665\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Mondaq Ltd.

It follows a months-long inquiry into tech companies and issues of privacy, misinformation and the power of their platforms in the wake of the scandal involving the data-analytics firm Cambridge Analytica's -access to Facebook users' data.</p><p>The committee also published another set of Facebook emails following an earlier trove released by parliament in December that revealed the company's tactics in dealing with competitors and monetising its user data.</p><p>Facebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29, losing its voice in a more influential market covering 500 million people.</p><p>\"The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data-privacy rights,\" said committee chairman Damian Collins.</p><p>\"Companies like Facebook exercise massive market power which enables them to make money by bullying the smaller technology companies and developers who rely on this platform to reach their customers.\" The report expressed concern at the \"porous nature of Facebook data security protocols\" and accused the company of continuing to choose profit over data privacy. It said the company took \"highly aggressive action\" against certain apps that were competitors.</p><p>The committee on Monday released more documents provided to UK politicians as part of a lawsuit against Facebook filed by Six4Three, the developer of a now-defunct app. Six4Three sued Facebook in 2015, alleging the social network's data policies were anticompetitive and favoured certain companies over others.</p><p>Emails show Facebook as far back as 2011 wrestling with where to draw the line on protecting users. In an internal email that year, a Facebook executive told colleagues he feared the company was routinely erring too far on the side of outside developers who used Facebook, rather than users.</p><p>Another executive's response: \"One week everyone is yelling that we're not protecting users enough. The next week everyone is swooping in and saying we're being too aggressive.\" In other newly released emails, Facebook employees discussed how to decide whether to bar outside parties from building apps on Facebook's platform. They created a list of risks to weigh each partner against; one was whether the outside party was a competitor.</p><p>Facebook addressed the release of its internal emails in Dec-ember. CEO Mark Zuckerberg at the time said: \"Like any -organ-isation, we had a lot of internal discussion and people raised different ideas. Ultimately, we decided on a model where we continued to provide the developer platform for free and developers could choose to buy ads if they wanted. This model has worked well.\" The British report in one section focused on \"inferred data\" - characteristics based not on information shared by users but on an analysis of users' data profiles. It noted that under EU rules now law in the UK, such inferred data was not protected like personal data, suggesting this was a loophole regulators should address.It said Mr Zuckerberg had shown \"contempt for the UK parliament\" for refusing to appear before the committee.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-cfbc710a332a11e995ec5da9431b0b2faec7c5bcf3f923bfaf66ea07eb476efc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFR-5F41-F0JP-W3VY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It further increases its value by entering into comprehensive reciprocal data-sharing arrangements with major app developers who run their businesses through the Facebook platform, the report says. <br/>Meanwhile, it adds, among the countless innocuous postings of celebrations and holiday snaps, some malicious forces use Facebook to threaten and harass others, publish revenge porn, disseminate hate speech and propaganda of all kinds, and influence elections and democratic processes; much of which Facebook, and other social media companies, are either unable or unwilling to prevent. <br/>The lawmakers say the big tech companies must therefore not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight. <br/>\"The legislative tools already exist. They must now be applied to digital activity, using tools such as privacy laws, data protection legislation, anti-trust and competition law. <br/>\"If companies become monopolies, they can be broken up, in whatever sector.

UK lawmakers have come down hard on Facebook, calling for tighter regulation and scrutiny of the world's biggest social networking platform. Yesterday, the lawmakers issued a damning report, dubbed the \"Disinformation and 'fake news': Final Report\", alleging Facebook \"intentionally and knowingly\" violated UK's privacy and competition laws. This as Facebook faces more scrutiny from many jurisdictions over scandals relating to data privacy issues, election interference and spreading fake news. </p><p>One of the biggest scandals to hit the social networking site last year was when a whistle-blower revealed Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested the personal Facebook data of up to 87 million people in order to profile and target users for political advertisements. In their report, UK parliamentarians say Facebook operates by monitoring both users and non-users, tracking their activity and retaining personal data. They note Facebook makes its money by selling access to users' data through its advertising tools. It further increases its value by entering into comprehensive reciprocal data-sharing arrangements with major app developers who run their businesses through the Facebook platform, the report says. Meanwhile, it adds, among the countless innocuous postings of celebrations and holiday snaps, some malicious forces use Facebook to threaten and harass others, publish revenge porn, disseminate hate speech and propaganda of all kinds, and influence elections and democratic processes; much of which Facebook, and other social media companies, are either unable or unwilling to prevent. The lawmakers say the big tech companies must therefore not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight. \"The legislative tools already exist. They must now be applied to digital activity, using tools such as privacy laws, data protection legislation, anti-trust and competition law. \"If companies become monopolies, they can be broken up, in whatever sector. Facebook's handling of personal data, and its use for political campaigns, are prime and legitimate areas for inspection by regulators, and it should not be able to evade all editorial responsibility for the content shared by its users across its platforms,\" the report says. It points out that in a democracy, there is a need to experience a plurality of voices and, critically, to have the skills, experience and knowledge to gauge the veracity of those voices. \"While the Internet has brought many freedoms across the world and an unprecedented ability to communicate, it also carries the insidious ability to distort, mislead, and produce hatred and instability. \"We invited Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook - the social media company that has over 2.25 billion users and made $40 billion in revenue in 2017 - to give evidence to us and to this committee; he chose to refuse, three times. \"Social media companies cannot hide behind the claim of being merely a 'platform' and maintain they have no responsibility themselves in regulating the content of their sites. Despite all the apologies for past mistakes that Facebook has made, it still seems unwilling to be properly scrutinised.\" The UK lawmakers believe that by choosing not to appear before the committee and not to respond personally to any of their invitations, Zuckerberg has shown contempt towards both the UK Parliament and the 'International Grand Committee', involving members from nine legislatures from around the world. They add Facebook's management structure is opaque to those outside the business and this seemed to be designed to conceal knowledge of and responsibility for specific decisions. \"Our interim report recommended that clear legal liabilities should be established for tech companies to act against harmful or illegal content on their sites. There is now an urgent need to establish independent regulation. \"We believe a compulsory code of ethics should be established, overseen by an independent regulator, setting out what constitutes harmful content.

In Depth In September 2018, the UK government published an initialcode of conduct for data-driven health and care technology[6].Advancements in health technology, especially in artificial intelligence (AI), have been widely heralded as presenting the opportunity to change health care as we know it.In the real world, however, building, testing and implementing data tools and data driven solutions can prove harder than developers and technology companies expect.Complex approvals, overlapping regulatory frameworks and pricing inconsistencies can make it difficult to sell solutions to the National Health Service (NHS). This is coupled with real anxieties about whether big tech can be trusted with patient data, and these concerns are only exacerbated by loss of confidence in data-sharing sites over the last year and new caution about the risks of non-compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation.If the code is widely adopted and achieves the status of other industry codes, especially those applicable to devices and pharma, this may bring clarity and consistency to those working in this field. </p><p>It is worth noting that the success of other codes arguably stems from the strength and the requirements of relevant national industry bodies\u2014something that may be necessary for digital health developers too.The code is currently voluntary, but technology providers have been encouraged to sign up and use the code. The aim is for technology providers to demonstrate their commitment to the NHS and technology within the NHS by signing up to the principles.You can give feedback on the code byresponding to this questionnaire[7].A final version of the code is expected in December 2018.The code sets out 10 key principles for technology providers. Some of these principles replicate and are consistent with data protection principles in law and existing NHS codes (for example, the need for fairness, transparency and accountability).Digital health providers and investors may wish to focus on some of the following areas when providing feedback: Principle 1 - Define the User. Providers may want to consider whether they are able to identify the precise beneficiary of the data analysis at the outset. Principle 3: Be fair, transparent and accountable. This principle also covers compliance with GDPR and providers may want to consider how the principles will apply to pseudonymous data or the research exemptions, which are common components of GDPR compliance for global data driven healthcare solutions. Principle 8 - evidence of effectiveness for use Principle 9 - the commercial strategy and how benefits will be shared with the NHS Principle 10 - the evidence, performance and validation of the algorithm. Providers may want to consider how the principles will apply to the different datasets used in AI and machine learning (including training, validation or test datasets). At the same time, the government has committed to simplifying the regulatory and funding landscape, creating an environment that enables experimentation and encourages the system to adopt innovation.

Advancements in health technology, especially in artificial intelligence (AI), have been widely heralded as presenting the opportunity to change health care as we know it. In the real world, however, building, testing and implementing data tools and data driven solutions can prove harder than developers and technology companies expect. Complex approvals, overlapping regulatory frameworks and pricing inconsistencies can make it difficult to sell solutions to the National Health Service (NHS). This is coupled with real anxieties about whether big tech can be trusted with patient data, and these concerns are only exacerbated by loss of confidence in data-sharing sites over the last year and new caution about the risks of non-compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation. </p><p>If the code is widely adopted and achieves the status of other industry codes, especially those applicable to devices and pharma, this may bring clarity and consistency to those working in this field. It is worth noting that the success of other codes arguably stems from the strength and the requirements of relevant national industry bodies\u2014something that may be necessary for digital health developers too. The code is currently voluntary, but technology providers have been encouraged to sign up and use the code. The aim is for technology providers to demonstrate their commitment to the NHS and technology within the NHS by signing up to the principles. You can give feedback on the code by responding to this questionnaire[2]. A final version of the code is expected in December 2018. The code sets out 10 key principles for technology providers. Some of these principles replicate and are consistent with data protection principles in law and existing NHS codes (for example, the need for fairness, transparency and accountability). Digital health providers and investors may wish to focus on some of the following areas when providing feedback:Principle 1 - Define the User. Providers may want to consider whether they are able to identify the precise beneficiary of the data analysis at the outset. Principle 3: Be fair, transparent and accountable. This principle also covers compliance with GDPR and providers may want to consider how the principles will apply to pseudonymous data or the research exemptions, which are common components of GDPR compliance for global data driven healthcare solutions. Principle 8 - evidence of effectiveness for use Principle 9 - the commercial strategy and how benefits will be shared with the NHS Principle 10 - the evidence, performance and validation of the algorithm. Providers may want to consider how the principles will apply to the different datasets used in AI and machine learning (including training, validation or test datasets).At the same time, the government has committed to simplifying the regulatory and funding landscape, creating an environment that enables experimentation and encourages the system to adopt innovation.McDermott PerspectivesMcDermott's digital health team works extensively with digital health providers, investors and health organisations around the world on the issues related to the adoption of new technologies.

It also called for the creation of an independent regulator that has the power to launch legal action against companies in breach of the code that could result in hefty fines.</p><p>Large sections of the report were devoted to criticism of Facebook, which it said had intentionally and knowingly violated both privacy and anti-competition laws in how it handled user data and tried to stifle competitors.</p><p>The report expands on earlier recommendations from the committee published in July. It follows a months-long inquiry into tech companies and issues of privacy, misinformation and the power of their platforms in the wake of the scandal involving the data-analytics firm Cambridge Analytica's access to Facebook users' information.</p><p>The committee also published another set of Facebook emails following an earlier trove released by Parliament in December that revealed the company's tactics in dealing with competitors and monetizing its user data.</p><p>Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment, added the Dow Jones report.</p><p>The committee recommended laws governing privacy, data protection, antitrust and competition should be used to rein in companies. \"The big tech companies must not be allowed to expand exponentially, without constraint or proper regulatory oversight,\" it said.</p><p>\"If companies become monopolies they can be broken up, in whatever sector,\" the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee said in its final report on disinformation and \"fake news.\"</p><p>It is not clear how many of the panel's recommendations will be taken up by the British government, but some are likely to be incorporated in UK government policy proposals to be put forward in coming months. The UK is scheduled to leave the European Union on Mar. 29, losing its voice in a more influential market covering 500 million people.</p><p>\"The big tech companies are failing in the duty of care they owe to their users to act against harmful content, and to respect their data-privacy rights,\" said Damian Collins, the committee's chairman.</p><p>\"Companies like Facebook exercise massive market power which enables them to make money by bullying the smaller technology companies and developers who rely on this platform to reach their customers,\" he said.</p><p>The report expressed concern at the \"porous nature of Facebook data security protocols\" and accused the company of continuing to choose profit over data privacy. It also said the company took \"highly aggressive action\" against certain apps that were competitors.</p><p>The committee Monday released more documents provided to UK lawmakers as part of a lawsuit against Facebook filed by Six4Three LLC, the developer of a now-defunct app. Six4Three sued Facebook in 2015, alleging the social network's data policies were anticompetitive and favored certain companies over others.</p><p>Emails show Facebook as far back as 2011 wrestling with where to draw the line on protecting users. In an internal email that year, a Facebook executive told colleagues he feared the company was routinely erring too far on the side of outside developers who use Facebook, rather than users.</p><p>Another executive's response: \"One week everyone is yelling that we're not protecting users enough. The next week everyone is swooping in and saying we're being too aggressive.\"</p><p>In other newly released emails, Facebook employees discussed how to decide whether to bar outside parties from building apps on Facebook's platform. They created a list of risks to weigh each partner against; one was whether the outside party was a competitor.</p><p>Facebook previously addressed the release of its internal emails in December. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg at the time said: \"Like any organization, we had a lot of internal discussion and people raised different ideas. Ultimately, we decided on a model where we continued to provide the developer platform for free and developers could choose to buy ads if they wanted. This model has worked well.\"</p><p>The British report in one section focused on \"inferred data,\" characteristics based not on information shared by users but on an analysis of users' data profiles.</p><p>It noted that under EU rules now law in the UK, such inferred data was not protected like personal data, suggesting this was a loophole regulators should address, added the Dow Jones report.</p><p>It said Zuckerberg had shown \"contempt for the UK Parliament\" for refusing to appear before the committee. \"The management structure of Facebook is opaque to those outside the business and this seemed to be designed to conceal knowledge of and responsibility for specific decisions,\" it said.</p><p>By Stephen Fidler and Georgia Wells</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EFEAIF-_25514895</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EFEAIF2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFP-3MF1-F0B9-C2KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318730</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"833\"/><timeReceived>9:12 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Agencia EFE S.A.

They work quite significantly in parallel with the US agencies and the European Commission and others,\u201d he said.</p><p>The CMA\u2019s tougher stance \u2014 particularly against digital platforms \u2014 comes in spite of criticism that too much regulation could stifle innovation and policymakers\u2019 hopes of attracting more tech investment in the wake of Brexit.\u00a0</p><p>Last week a group of investors backing Deliveroo said the regulator\u2019s probe of the food-delivery app\u2019s deal with Amazon risked undermining the incentives to invest in British start-ups. But Mr Coscelli insisted the regulator had a solid understanding of business and it would have a \u201creasonably pro-business approach\u201d.</p><p>The CMA is spending more time and resources looking at deals where a dominant online player buys a smaller rival, Mr Coscelli said.\u00a0</p><p>In recent years, deals led by US tech giants have raised\u00a0 competition concerns among regulators. Facebook was allowed to buy messaging app WhatsApp for $19bn in 2014 and photo-sharing app Instagram for $1bn in 2012, while Google bought online advertising agency DoubleClick in 2007.\u00a0</p><p>The CMA recently launched\u00a0 a probe of Google\u2019s proposed $2.6bn acquisition of data analytics company Looker. It also launched a probe into Amazon\u2019s\u00a0 investment in Deliveroo on fears that it might harm competition in the online food delivery and grocery markets.</p><p>\u201cThe argument that companies were making seven or eight years ago was that it was very difficult to predict how it was going to play out,\u201d said Mr Coscelli. \u201cWe now realise that there are strong barriers to entry and expansion. </p><p>\u201cWhen we look at the current deals we have a higher degree of scepticism.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>The regulator is also pushing ahead with a new digital markets strategy to help it address the competition issues thrown up by big tech. In December the CMA found Google accounted for more than 90 per cent of all revenues earned from search advertising in the UK in 2018, while Facebook accounted for almost half of all UK display advertising revenues.</p><p>The government is making plans for a\u00a0 regulator to police the technology sector. The idea of a \u201cdigital markets unit\u201d, advanced by a panel headed by Jason Furman, chief economic adviser to former US president Barack Obama, is expected to be embraced by the UK government this year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-6345e9b0459a11eaaeb3955839e06441</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4B-0G01-DXP9-901Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

Facebook accounted for almost half of all display advertising revenue in the U.K., reaching more than \u00a32 billion.</p><p>Both companies have used their data and search dominance to train their algorithms to provide better services than their rivals, the CMA said. Their approach to data privacy and partnerships with hardware companies are also having a direct impact on consumer choice and competition, the watchdog added.</p><p>For instance, the CMA found that Google paid around \u00a31 billion   16% of its total 2018 search revenues   to be the default search engine on mobile devices such as Apple Inc.'s iPhones. For its part, Facebook does not allow users to opt out of targeted advertising on its main social network, forcing them to share considerable personal data in return for using its free service, the CMA said.</p><p>Following consultations with industry stakeholders, the watchdog is considering regulatory proposals aimed at increasing data privacy, and transparency in digital advertising.</p><p>Potential measures include opening up access to click and query search data and limiting Google's ability to be the default search engine on devices and browsers; forcing Facebook to connect more seamlessly with rival social networks; addressing the conflicts of interests in digital advertising and requiring platforms to allow people to turn off ad targeting.</p><p>The CMA will begin further consultations on the findings ahead of publishing its final report next year. It will then present its recommendations to the government to help shape its approach to regulation.</p><p>Both Google and Facebook said that they will continue to work with the government and CMA as part of the consultations process.</p><p>According to the Financial Times, the government is to create a technology regulator next year that will impose a code of conduct on companies including Facebook and Google.</p><p>The U.K. in April recommended establishing a separate regulator that will police online services for extremist content, with punishments including fines for sites that do not swiftly remove offending material.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-56231964</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XTJ-P4H1-JDVW-N07B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"439\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

The preliminary investigation is ongoing,' the European Competition Commission told Reuters[2] in an email Saturday. </p><p>EU Commissioner for CompetitionMargrethe Vestager has previously forced [3]Google to pay billions in fines for antitrust violations. Google and other big tech companies have also been targeted by the U.S. government due to competition concerns.Google, along with Facebook, Amazon and Apple are currently under investigation[4] by the Justice Department to see whether these companies have too much power in the market. TheJudiciary Committee in the House of Representatives is also undertaking a big tech investigation.Politicians have also heavily scrutinized these big tech companies, with Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., calling for the firms to be broken up. President Trump has claimed [5]that Google has an anti-conservative bias that interfered in the 2016 presidential election.

The move would build on the decision to establish a data unit in 2018 to help it flush out issues thrown up by big tech companies such as fake online reviews and algorithms affecting online shopping. </p><p>Mr Coscelli said the CMA would also be sending its staff to Citizens Advice call centres to \u201chear directly from consumers with specific problems\u201d later in the year.</p><p>The CMA has recently moved to stamp out bad behaviour in the online gambling industry as well as clamp down on some hotel booking, car hire and ticketing sites.</p><p>Mr Coscelli said stronger enforcement powers would mean the CMA could take on more consumer-protection work. \u201cWe are saying if you allowed us to provide a more efficient administrative system and have fining powers, with the same amount of funding we have today, we could materially increase the number of cases,\u201d he told the FT. </p><p>\u201cWe are not very well known as a competition authority, which is a weakness,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t really a sense that we are fighting for the consumer and working for them.\u201d</p><p>The CMA\u2019s plans come as the agency prepares to take on a beefed-up role after the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, including covering more complex merger, cartel and competition cases and potentially having a role in state aid.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-c7b355c2571011eaa528dd0f971febbc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y90-P6C1-JB77-K0MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><timeReceived>4:09 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 25, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

Grading for the vocational qualifications was delayed to give the board more time to recalculate the grades after A-level and GCSE results were based on teacher estimates. Last week, Pearson said the regrading was needed to \"address concerns about unfairness in relation to A-levels and GCSEs and ensure no BTec student is disadvantaged.\" Cindy Rampersaud, senior vice-president for BTec and apprenticeships at the company, said all eligible results would be available by Friday. Around 200,000 level one and two entries were due to receive grades last Thursday, while 250,000 level three grades have already been awarded but were part of the reassessment.

How it responds now is pivotal for the country's future, but also the current administration's.As soon as the decision was taken to close schools in mid-March, it was clear that there needed to be a plan in place for reopening them and helping young people catch up on the education they lost out on during lockdown.It was also clear that children who were already less privileged were most affected by the shutdown. It was clear when life-defining exams were cancelled that there would also need to be a way to ensure university places, apprenticeships and wider employment opportunities wouldn't become even further out of reach.Related: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/aug/25/covid-19-boris-johnson-school-face-mask-advice-change\">This exams fiasco gives the lie to Boris Johnson's 'levelling up' agenda | Justine Greening</url>Updated at 9.08am BST7.39am BSTThousands of headteachers have written to the education secretary, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/aug/25/covid-19-boris-johnson-school-face-mask-advice-change\">Gavin Williamson</url>, accusing the government of repeatedly failing to listen or collaborate as schools prepare to reopen to millions of children across England.In what appears to be a damaging breakdown in relations, headteachers say they are facing some of the most significant challenges of their professional lives but feel they are \"working in isolation\", unsupported by the government.School leaders, who are still picking up the pieces after the recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/aug/25/covid-19-boris-johnson-school-face-mask-advice-change\">exams fiasco</url>, say their confidence in government has been \"significantly knocked\".

The change is down to Covid-19 restrictions, the corporation said, after reports the anthems could be axed for political reasons. Fabricant told BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"I think it is all very sad, Rule Britannia has some lovely words.\" He argued that while the BBC said the changes were due to coronavirus restrictions that other tunes will be sung, such as the national anthem. He said that a solo singer version would not be \"thin\".\"When you hear opera singers belting it out, I would not say that is a thin voice, I'd be happy with that compromise: a single voice singing it [Rule, Britannia!] loudly.\" Updated at 9.06am BST7.33am BSTPupils wearing face coverings should be kept under review, union saysPupils wearing masks is an option that should be kept under review, a union has said, despite the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/aug/25/covid-19-boris-johnson-school-face-mask-advice-change\">education secretary insisting the measure is not needed</url> as schools in England prepare to reopen. It comes as the Scottish government is expected to state its decision on face coverings in schools in light of the latest guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/aug/25/covid-19-boris-johnson-school-face-mask-advice-change\">children aged 12 and over should wear a mask</url>. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said as evidence continues to emerge, Westminster should review its guidance. The ASCL general secretary, Geoff Barton, told the Daily Telegraph: \"We would expect the government in Westminster to review its guidance on the use of face coverings in schools - which currently says they are not required - in light of the WHO guidance and the consultation taking place in Scotland. \"The evidence is clearly evolving on this issue and it is important that it is kept under review and that clear direction is provided to schools.\" But Prof Russell Viner, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said there was concern about younger children wearing face coverings. The WHO and UN children's agency Unicef suggested that face shields may be an alternative in situations such as speech classes where the teacher and pupils need to see each other's mouths. The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, has already said the issue should be kept under review. Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said her education secretary John Swinney is in the final stages of consulting with teachers and councils on whether to recommend the use of masks when moving around schools.

The head of England's exam regulator, Sally Collier, has resigned over the exams fiasco that has engulfed schools and universities. News of her departure came hours after the education select committee announced she had been called to give evidence to MPs on the exams debacle at a hearing next Wednesday. An education source said: \"She knew she'd reached the end of the line.\" Collier, the chief regulator and Ofqual chief executive, oversaw the development of the flawed exams algorithm that was scrapped after it downgraded nearly 40% of A-level results. The algorithm was created after ministers insisted on avoiding grade inflation.  Trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine may have gathered enough data to show whether it works and is safe by the end of the year - but it will then need to go through the regulatory process, scientists say. Prof Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said it was \"just possible\" there may be enough clinical trial data on the vaccine to put before the regulators this year. Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, has said a vaccine may not be ready until next winter. Pollard suggested they were hoping to go faster. We're wrapping up the UK liveblog now but you can continue to follow our coverage of UK and global developments here. Thanks for reading. The EU's trade commissioner has said he broke no public health regulations governing the pandemic while in Ireland. Phil Hogan, whose role makes him of key interest to British government officials pursuing post-Brexit trade talks, provided 20 pages of documents to the head of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, after she requested further details of his trip home earlier this month. The former Irish government official said he believed he complied with rules designed to limit the spread of coronavirus in the country. Hogan was among 81 guests who attended a controversial golf dinner in the west of Ireland. He returned to the Republic on 31 July and was required to restrict his movements for 14 days. In a document published on the European commission website, Hogan said he tested negative for Covid-19 while in hospital for treatment on 5 August and claimed that \"ended the self-restriction period\". He told the Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9: I am satisfied, arising from the test that I did that proved it was negative, that I was no risk to anybody. Because of the fact that I had a negative test. Because my medical people said I was no risk to anybody. I checked with the Citizens Information website which is funded by the HSE and I felt that I was no risk to anybody by going to Adare. I understand the perception. I was covered by the regulations that my work-related activities and under the regulation there is a reasonable excuse mechanism that allowed me the exemption to do that. The \"eat out to help out\" scheme encouraged more people into UK restaurants last week, taking the total number of meals claimed since the beginning of August to more than 64m - the equivalent of one for nearly every person in the country. The figures released by HM Revenue &amp; Customs suggest the scheme - where diners can claim a half-price discount up to a maximum of \u00a310 per head on food and non-alcoholic drink on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August - has provided a much-needed boost for the embattled hospitality sector. Ahead of the end of the scheme next week, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the figures demonstrated how popular it had been so far, with 10.5m meals claimed in the first week, rising to 35m in the second and 64m by the third. Autistic children need time to prepare for changes on wearing face coverings within schools, a charity has said, after Boris Johnson hinted at a U-turn on the policy. Tim Nicholls, the head of policy and public affairs at the National Autistic Society, said face coverings in schools would be another \"unexpected change\" for autistic children. Secondary school pupils in Scotland will be required to wear face coverings in between lessons from Monday, while the prime minister suggested there could be a change to the current advice for schools in England. The current guidance says face coverings are not recommended, but Boris Johnson told reporters: \"If we need to change the advice then of course we will.\" Nicholls said wearing a mask could feel suffocating and overwhelming for some pupils with autism, while others may have difficulty understanding why it was required. \"They are going back to schools that look and feel incredibly different from when they were last there,\" he told the PA Media news agency. Parliamentary authorities have been accused of censorship after refusing to accept a charity's petition highlighting non-Covid patients not receiving NHS care during the pandemic. Action against Medical Accidents (AvMA) submitted the petition in June. It said that NHS England's decision in March to restrict most normal care, so that hospitals could focus on the influx of Covid patients, \"has meant access even to urgent diagnostic procedures and treatment for non-covid conditions has been severely restricted, putting lives at risk\". But parliament's petition team, which decides which proposals are hosted online, rejected AvMA's petition, saying that reopening NHS services now that the pandemic has subsided is not a matter for ministers. It said: \"We can't accept your petition because the UK government aren't responsible for the issue you raise. This is an operational matter for the NHS.\" Government ministers have been told they still have questions to answer over this summer's grading chaos, following the resignation of the Ofqual chief regulator in the wake of the A-level and GCSE results U-turn in England. Sally Collier will be replaced by her predecessor Dame Glenys Stacey, the exams regulator said. In a statement on Tuesday, Ofqual said Collier had decided \"that the next stage of the awarding process would be better overseen by new leadership\". However, the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said questions still remained for ministers over what went wrong, and the National Education Union (NEU) said issues \"run far deeper than the actions of one chief executive\". The Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, accused the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, of letting someone else \"take the blame\" for what had happened, and reiterated a call for him to resign. The education select committee has said Ofqual representatives will appear in front of MPs on 2 September, while Williamson is due before the committee on 16 September. The committee chairman, Robert Halfon, said Collier had agreed to appear in front of MPs before her resignation and he hoped she still would. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the ASCL said Collier's resignation \"follows the failure of the statistical model that led to this year's grading fiasco, but the fault is not hers alone\". He added: Ministers have questions to answer over the extent to which they scrutinised and challenged the methodology and reliability of the statistical model, particularly given the enormity of the task and the importance of getting it right. The ASCL has written to Williamson to request an \"immediate independent review to rapidly establish what happened and what went wrong\". Barton added: \"We believe that public confidence has been so badly damaged that full transparency is essential.\" The NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said: Sally Collier had no option but to follow through Michael Gove's reforms of GCSEs and A-levels, which set up many of the problems of 2020. We have no sure way of knowing where the balance of fault lies, but we can be quite certain that Gavin Williamson gave direction to Ofqual that there should not be grade inflation and all candidates should get a fair grade. He must have known that both those directions are incompatible. There have been a further 1,184 Covid-19 cases recorded in the UK, and 16 more deaths, Public Health England has confirmed after technical problems with the online Covid-19 dashboard, which is failing to load data. This takes the total number of recorded cases to 327,798 and the total number of fatalities to 41,449. The coronavirus pandemic has led to a dip in the number of cancer patients in England being treated with radiotherapy, a charity has said. New analysis by Macmillan Cancer Support found that the number of people in England receiving radiotherapy for one of five common types of cancer dropped 24% in April. There were around 3,500 records of people with breast, prostate, lung, bladder or oesophageal cancer having radiotherapy in April this year, compared with around 4,600 in April 2019. Radiotherapy data from Public Health England's national cancer registration and analysis service showed the figures increased in May when there were 4,800 records of people with these types of cancer having radiotherapy. But the figure was still 14% down on last year, according to the Macmillan analysis. Sara Bainbridge, the head of policy and influence at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: For many people living with cancer there has never been a scarier time to face a diagnosis and any disruption to treatment like this only adds to the worry that so many patients and their loved ones are already experiencing. We urgently need to see the recovery plan promised by the government to make sure cancer services can deliver care as quickly and safely as possible. There is a lot of work to be done and the scale of the challenge must also be addressed by securing more staffing and resources. We cannot let cancer become the \"forgotten C\" during this pandemic. In further research, Jo's Cervical Cancer found that minority ethnic women are less likely than white women to attend cervical cancer screenings during the pandemic. Figures from the charity, published by the Guardian, show that black, Asian and minority ethnic women (BAME) are twice as likely (20%) to be strongly worried about contracting the virus at a cervical cancer screening than white women (9.4%). Two in five BAME women (39.6%) said they would feel unsafe visiting a doctor's surgery at the moment compared with 27.2% of white women, according to a poll of 2,000 women. And 17.3% of women with BAME heritage said they believe that delaying cervical cancer screening is the safest thing to do at the moment, compared with 8.1% of white women. Coronavirus restrictions in parts of northern England are expected to continue when the government reviews existing measures later this week, but will be more tightly targeted and focus on smaller areas. People in Oldham in Greater Manchester, and in specific wards in Pendle and Blackburn in Lancashire were told not to socialise with anyone outside their household from midnight on Saturday. They were also advised to only use public transport if essential and numbers attending weddings, civil partnerships and funerals were restricted to up to 20. Council chiefs in Blackburn welcomed the announcement after they campaigned for a targeted approach at a \"really local level\" and said resources and efforts could be concentrated on the places that needed it most. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) also lifted restrictions in Wigan, Rossendale and Darwen, bringing them in line with the rest of England. The next announcement by the DHSC on restrictions in the \"northern area of intervention\" is due to take place after a meeting on Thursday of the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) chaired by the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, and England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. Local councils and MPs are expected to make their recommendations to the JBC by Wednesday over where, if any, restrictions should be imposed in their local areas. The Tory leader of Bolton council has called on the government to lift restrictions in the borough. Councillor David Greenhalgh said: According to recently produced data, we have seen this week's data for Bolton now at 12.9 per 100,000 new confirmed cases, showing Bolton over the past three weeks with a downward trajectory and way outside those authorities that are areas of concern on government lists. We have seen our neighbours in Wigan taken out of GM (Greater Manchester) restrictions and it is now time for Bolton to follow suit, and the figures and data support this. Mohammed Iqbal, the leader of Pendle council, criticised the extra restrictions imposed in the borough as the number of Covid-19 cases continued to fall. He said: We are not signed up to extra government restrictions. This is not what Pendle needs right now. What we do need is extra support from the government, including financial support to ensure the safety messages and rules for Pendle reach everyone. Last week Hancock said: \"Our approach is to make the action we take as targeted as possible, with the maximum possible local consensus. \"To do that we are introducing a new process to increase engagement between local leaders, both councils and MPs, with the aim of taking as targeted action as possible. \"This will allow local councils to focus resources on to the wards which need more targeted intervention in order to drive infection rates down, and gives local people a stronger voice at the table.\" The Guardian's deputy political editor is reporting that a number of Tory MPs are concerned about a possible government U-turn on masks in schools as Boris Johnson comes under growing pressure to review Public Health England advice which \"does not recommend them\". \"Several are strongly opposed and want concerns conveyed to Number 10,\" Jessica Elgot has tweeted. Scientists believe a 75-year-old woman from Nottinghamshire was the first known person to catch coronavirus in the UK and the earliest to die from it, as research shows the disease was circulating widely in communities in early February. Samples analysed by the University of Nottingham show the unnamed woman, who had an underlying health condition, tested positive for the virus on 21 February. She was admitted to Queen's medical centre (QMC), in Nottingham, and died on 3 March, two days earlier than the first recorded Covid-19 death in the UK. Her positive coronavirus test results were not returned until 16 March, almost two weeks after her death. Previously, the first case caught in the UK was believed to be a man in Surrey who was reported to have tested positive on 28 February. Scientists retrospectively analysed samples from the QMC hospital dating back to January, and discovered the virus had been circulating in the area between early February and March. Their study said this was undetected at the time because the government was restrictive both in its definition of coronavirus symptoms, and over who could be tested. Read the full story here: The National Deaf Children's Society said that schools and colleges must be ready to meet the needs of deaf pupils by doing things such as investing in clear masks. As speculation builds that the government may be about to make a policy U-turn, paving the way for near-mandatory use of face coverings in English schools, the organisation said the use of face masks in education would have serious consequences for the UK's 50,000 deaf children. Ian Noon, the chief policy adviser of the National Deaf Children's Society, said: For many, there may be little benefit in even attending school or college because they won't understand their teachers and classmates, with loneliness and isolation a tragic result. Public health must always be the priority, so if face masks are introduced, schools and colleges must be ready to meet deaf pupils' needs by investing in clear face masks, making every reasonable adjustment possible and urgently discussing the best way forward with specialist teachers, parents and deaf pupils themselves. Education is a right, not a privilege, and this does not change because you're deaf. A mother has said she will not send her son to school if rules in England are not changed, and he is not allowed to wear a mask. Amid increasing pressure, Boris Johnson has hinted that guidance which says face coverings are not required for schoolchildren in England could be changed, with some reports saying a U-turn has already been agreed by the government. Debra Kidd, 52, is from Saddleworth, near Oldham, Greater Manchester, where additional lockdown measures are currently in place amid a rise in coronavirus cases. She told the PA Media news agency her son Sam, 13, had been told by Saddleworth school that children would not be required to wear masks and would be expected to remove them at the front gates. \"We've complained about this and the school says it is following government guidance,\" she said. \"Our position is that if he can't wear a mask, he's not going back.\" Virgin Atlantic says it has reached \"a significant milestone in safeguarding its future\" after creditors voted to approve a \u00a31.2bn bailout. The vote was a key part of a court-sanctioned process being used by the airline to implement the deal. It warned earlier this month it could run out of money by the end of September if the rescue package was rejected. The company said in a statement: Today, Virgin Atlantic has reached a significant milestone in safeguarding its future, securing the overwhelming support of all four creditor classes, including 99% support from trade creditors who voted in favour of the plan. The next step is an English high court hearing on September 2 to sanction the restructuring plan. Phil Hogan, the European trade commissioner who is battling to save his job, has sent the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, a 20-page summary of his movements during the period he breached lockdown rules in Ireland. Hogan, a former Irish minister whose role at the commission makes him a key figure in post-Brexit trade deal talks between the EU and the UK, has apologised for attending an event in his home country that may have breached Covid-19 regulations but he remains under pressure. Von der Leyen requested detailed of his movements. The commission has published details of a memo from Hogan here, but holes are already being picked in the details provided. Five patients on a cancer ward in Northern Ireland have tested positive for Covid-19. It is the second cluster of infections at Craigavon Area hospital in Co Armagh. A member of staff has tested positive and three close staff contacts are self-isolating as a precaution, the Southern health and social care trust said. It added: \"Covid-19 is rising again in our community. We urgently appeal to everyone to wash their hands, cover their face and maintain social distancing. The ward is closed to admissions. Trust staff are working closely with the Public Health Agency to manage the situation. Trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine may have gathered enough data to show whether it works and is safe by the end of the year - but it will then need to go through the regulatory process, scientists say. Prof Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said it is \"just possible\" that there may be enough clinical trial data on Oxford University's Covid-19 vaccine to put before the regulators this year. Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, has said a vaccine may not be ready until next winter. Pollard suggested they were hoping to go faster. \"I think that Chris Whitty is quite rightly being cautious, that it could take as long as that to first of all demonstrate a vaccine works and is safe and then to go through the processes of regulators looking at that very carefully to make sure everything's been done correctly,\" Pollard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Students have begun receiving their BTec grades, a week after exam board Pearson withdrew some and delayed the publication of others to give itself time to recalculate scores in the week of the A-level exam results fiasco. About 200,000 people who had taken the level one and two vocational qualifications were told last week, just hours before results day, that they would not be receiving them on time. A further 250,000 level-three grades, which had already been awarded, were also reassessed. It came after an outcry over A-level and GCSE results led to the scrapping of an algorithm that had calculated pupils' grades in lieu of exams. After the algorithm downgraded the results of many pupils from the estimates given by their teachers, while apparently favouring pupils from private schools, pupils held multiple protests with many calling for the resignation of the education secretary, Gavin Williamson. Boris Johnson is facing fresh calls to meet bereaved families who lost their loved ones during the coronavirus pandemic. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said they have asked for meetings with the prime minister on four occasions. Earlier this month, the all-party parliamentary group on Coronavirus heard from bereaved families who said they felt they are being \"swept under the carpet\" by the government. The APPG chairwoman, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, wrote to the prime minister and said she was shocked to learn that he had \"refused\" to meet the group - which represents 1,450 families. Commenting on the letter, Jo Goodman, who lost her father, Stuart, after he was diagnosed with Covid-19 aged 72, said: The prime minister has refused to meet bereaved families four times now. This isn't about pointing fingers or laying blame, so we don't know why Boris Johnson won't meet with us. We can only hope that the prime minister listens to the APPG and finally does the right thing by meeting with bereaved families. We just don't want others to go through the same pain we have. The Co-operative Bank became the latest major British employer to announce redundancies on Tuesday as it said it would part ways with around 350 members of staff. Last week, more than 7,700 major job losses were announced at big British employers. It comes as the Office for National Statistics said 730,000 people have been taken off payrolls since the beginning of the crisis in March. You can read back over full coverage of today's latest grim economic and business news on our business live blog here on a day when hopes of a swift recovery suffered some serious blows. A piece of news now that - for a significant section of the population - might be as important as anything else today. The Great British Bake Off will look as it always does when it returns to screens due to the cast and crew living and filming \"in a bubble\", a Channel 4 executive has said. Production of the 11th series was initially delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic, but filming on the popular show finished last week. Kelly Webb-Lamb, deputy director of programmes and head of popular factual for Channel 4, explained during a controller session at Edinburgh's Television Festival that the \"enormous\" feat of getting the show back on air was due to stringent health and safety measures. She said: \"The feat of getting Bake Off back was enormous and enormously important. The head of England's exam regulator, Sally Collier, has resigned over the exams fiasco that has engulfed schools and universities. Collier, the chief regulator and Ofqual chief executive, oversaw the development of the flawed exams algorithm that was scrapped after it downgraded nearly 40% of A-level results. It came after ministers insisted on avoiding grade inflation. She had been conspicuous by her absence since the U-turn on results last week, with Ofqual's chair, Roger Taylor, issuing a public apology instead. Collier's resignation comes days after the publication of millions of GCSE results and a day after Gavin Williamson insisted Ofqual had his \"full confidence\". He had previously refused to back Collier. Amid speculation that the government has already signed off on a U-turn on its masks policy in English schools, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has added his voice to calls for the government to to take World Health Organization (WHO) advice on board. \"The World Health Organization has advised children over 12 to wear a face covering where they can't socially distance, and as more countries are introducing them in school corridors and communal areas, it's important that lessons are learned,\" said Khan. \"I have continually called on government to respond to the latest health advice and my team are speaking with officials in Scotland to ensure we have the most up-to-date advice ahead of our schools returning.\" Public Health England and the Department for Education have both signed off on a new policy that will make the wearing of face masks near-mandatory in communal areas of secondary schools in England, the TES reports, citing sources. An announcement could come as early as today, the same sources say. Downing Street probably hoped Dominic Cummings' family would not provide any more headaches after the furore prompted by Boris Johnson's adviser's lockdown dash to his parents' Durham farm this year. But, in a fresh blow to No 10, the top aide's father-in-law has reportedly said Johnson will stand down as prime minister in six months. The claim - strenuously denied by Downing Street - was apparently delivered by Sir Humphry Wakefield to a visitor to the family's 13th-century Grade I-listed Chillingham Castle, in Northumberland, last week. The 84-year-old baronet, father of Cummings' wife, Mary, told visitor Anna Silverman the PM was still struggling badly after having coronavirus and would step down in six months, according to a report in the Times. Wakefield, a lifelong horse rider, is said to have likened the virus to being \"gone in the fetlock\", a horse's joint. \"If you put a horse back to work when it's injured it will never recover,\" he reportedly said. No 10 dismissed the claim as \"utter nonsense\". Wakefield could not be reached for comment. Labour is calling for the use of face masks in secondary schools, citing a \"growing body of evidence that the use of face masks in communal areas in secondary schools helps protect students and staff and drive down transmission\". The shadow education secretary, Kate Green said a change in advice was needed quickly. \"The prime minister must listen to this evidence and act quickly to give certainty to parents and teachers who are just days away from schools reopening,\" she said. \"The last thing concerned parents and pupils need is another last minute U-turn from this government that throws school plans into chaos.\" More from the official stats authority, while we await more updates on the possibility that schoolchildren will be asked to wear face coverings when they return next month. The proportion of people who believe Britain will be united after the coronavirus pandemic has halved in three months, figures suggest. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) surveyed 12,630 adults between 24 April and 28 June about their perceptions of unity and division in Britain. Over the period as a whole, 46% of adults on average thought that Britain will be united after society has recovered from Covid-19. At the start of the period, a higher proportion of people felt Britain would be \"very or somewhat\" united after the pandemic than felt this way at the end of the period. In the first week of the survey period more than half (57%) felt the UK would be more united, falling to 28% in the final week. Exactly half of female respondents believed this compared with 41% of men. Deaths in the UK have risen above average levels for the first time since mid-June, official statistics show, but coronavirus is not thought to be behind the rise. The high temperatures of the heatwave earlier this month are most likely behind the recent increase, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. In the week ending 14 August, there were 9,392 deaths from all causes in England and Wales - 447 more than the previous week. This took the number of deaths that week to 3.4% above the average for this time of year over the past five years - the first time the average has been exceeded since June. Meanwhile, deaths involving coronavirus have been steadily falling. There were 139 deaths registered in the week ending 14 August that mentioned \"novel coronavirus\", an 8.6% fall from the 152 deaths recorded in the previous week. The ONS said: \"The rise in deaths between weeks 32 and 33 coincided with high temperatures in England and Wales, and heatwave warnings were issued by NHS England.\" There have been no further reported deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Wales, health officials have said. The total number of deaths in the country since the beginning of the pandemic remains at 1,593. Public Health Wales said the total number of coronavirus cases had increased by 28, bringing total cases in Wales to 17,774. The Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, said he hoped to make an announcement on whether children would be made to wear face coverings when they returned to school by tomorrow evening. \"Scotland have made a change in their arrangements after their schools had essentially been open for two weeks,\" he said during the Welsh government's coronavirus press briefing. \"I would much rather that we're in a position where if there's going to be any change, including if that change is just around guidance as opposed to mandating anything, that we're able to do so by the end of tomorrow so we're not looking to make a decision late in the week when there's a bank holiday weekend just before schools are due to reopen.\" The Tory chair of the education select committee, Robert Halfon, has called for \"more clarity\" on face coverings ahead of schools returning. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: Clearly at the moment the science in England is that masks are not required. I think it would be worth perhaps a bit more reassurance from the chief medical officer to explain the reasons for this, to [help] teachers and parents and students going back to school. Having said that, perhaps it might be better just to leave these decisions in terms of PPE, particularly with masks, to the headteachers of individual schools. He went on: \"I think if the chief medical officer has set out the reasons why masks weren't necessary and the science behind it. I think that would reassure a lot of people in education and parents wondering or not whether they're needed when they send their children back to school next week.\" I'm Amy Walker, taking over from my colleague Ben Quinn while he takes a break. I'll be keeping you up to date with all the key coronavirus developments from the UK for the next hour or so. Two more \"Nightingale\" courts have started to hear cases in efforts to clear the backlog exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) headquarters in Westminster and a former court building in Fleetwood, Lancashire, opened on Monday. A press conference room in the government building at 102 Petty France has been converted into a court room and will hear cases from east and west London family courts. In Fleetwood, the building will hear civil or family cases listed for Preston or Blackpool magistrates courts. It comes after Nightingale courts opened in Swansea, Middlesbrough, Hertfordshire and Telford last week. There are 10 in total so far, with two in Leeds and Peterborough yet to open. Not everything has been as transparent or as smooth as one might have hoped however. Here was the experience of the new arrangements yesterday of the Evening Standard's courts correspondent. The Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, has issued a stern warning against traditional pub crawls and stag and hen parties following a rise in coronavirus cases in Cardiff. Gething stopped short of putting a limit on the number of venues people should go to but he stressed that every visit to a new pub or bar was another chance for Covid to be transmitted. He said: \"At this point in time there isn't a need to close pubs and restaurants. This depends on the behaviour of all of us. This is a choice about how we behave to keep coronavirus at bay for all of us.\" There have been 47 positive tests in the last week - 37% of all cases in Wales. Public health officials said many of the new cases were among people between the ages of 20 and 30. Gething hinted that hospitality venues faced being shut before schools, adding: The government has been very clear in Wales that we won't close schools if other areas are driving infection rates. We will take other action first before we go to the possibility of school closures. People need to consider the choices they are making. We don't want to stop people enjoying themselves. We want people to enjoy themselves within the rules. More people going to more venues is more of a risk. I recognise it's difficult. It's an appeal to our common sense. Gething said that Welsh authorities had not said there is a limit to the number of places to go to but that people need to limit contact with others. The way I would have enjoyed drinking with my friends in my 20s is an entirely different place to where we are now. Facebook has recruited 10 former policy officials since the start of last year, adding to suspicions that technology firms are trying to develop a closer relationship to the government. The Times reported that officials left roles in government and with regulators to work on policy and communications for Facebook. Whitehall watchers said there is usually a \"mini exodus\" of staff from key departments in the weeks and months after a general election, but rarely as many as 10 civil servants departing to the same company. Senior Conservative MPs said that Facebook was seeking to limit regulations before they were introduced. Julian Knight, the Tory chairman of the Commons committee on digital, culture, media and sport, told The Times that the public \"have a right to question the cosy relationship between government and big tech at all levels\". Facebook said their policy teams play a key role in developing and applying Facebook's policies such as our community standards - which set out what is and isn't allowed on their platforms. Questioned about the exam results fiasco, Johnson added that in hindsight, the government \"might have done some things differently\". He told reporters that those who had done their A-levels and GCSEs this year, had been \"in many ways a remarkable generation\". They've had to stay at home, which has been difficult, it has posed risks, as I say, to their health, to their mental health, they've done a fantastic job, they've protected the NHS, they've helped to save lives, to get us through this pandemic and I'm just pleased that they now do have results that they can work with. And yes, you know if we had to do it again, we might have done some things differently, I'm certainly not going to deny that. But they've got a series of results that they can certainly work with and use to develop their careers. Guidance saying that face coverings are not required in England's schools could be altered if the medical advice changed, according to the prime minister. Boris Johnson told reporters: \"On the issue of whether or not to wear masks in some contexts - you know, we'll look at the the changing medical evidence as we go on. If we need to change the advice then of course we will.\" Asked why the UK government was ignoring World Health Organization (WHO) advice that children aged over 12 should wear masks, he said: \"The overwhelming priority is to get all pupils into school. And I think that the schools, the teachers, they've all done a fantastic job of getting ready and the risk to children's health, the risk to children's wellbeing from not being in school is far greater than the risk from Covid. If there are things we have to do to vary the advice on medical grounds, we will, of course, do that. But as the chief medical officer, all our scientific advisers, have said, schools are safe. Guidance on whether children in Wales should wear face coverings in schools is to be reviewed, according to authorities in Wales. The Welsh government's Health minister, Vaughan Gething, said: In light of the update to World Health Organization advice on the use of face coverings for children over 12 - and the decision by the Scottish government to introduce wider face covering wearing in schools - I've asked the children and schools advisory group... to consider the current guidance here in Wales. The briefing where Gething made those those comments can be watched again here. The Welsh move comes after it was announced that Scottish secondary school pupils will have to wear face coverings in corridors, communal areas and school buses from next week. There have been 44 cases of coronavirus confirmed in Scotland since yesterday, Nicola Sturgeon has announced at her regular media briefing, including seven in Tayside, where the cluster around the 2 Sisters food processing plant continues. Scotland's first minister said that over past six days more than 900 people have been tested at mobile testing unit outside the plant in Coupar Angus, and that there is still little evidence of community transmission. Sturgeon also said there had been a \"major spike\" in demand for testing over the weekend, and announced the establishment of 11 local walk-through testing centres, the first of these will be housed in the Victory Memorial Hall in St Andrews. She also said three mobile testing units would be deployed across the central belt of Scotland, the first of which will be operational in Glasgow this afternoon. On the decision to give \"obligatory guidance\" to young people to wear face coverings in high schools, she said: \"I don't under-estimate how challenging it is for teachers to do their already difficult jobs and be mindful of all the different requirements to keep Covid under control.\" Asked about compulsion, given that the guidance is not yet mandatory, she said that \"ideally we don't want to have an enforcement regime around this guidance in schools\". She went on: \"Schools already have behavioural policies in place, this is another aspect of that and in my view much better done in that way of being part of the process for young people understanding things we have to adhere to [to combat the virus].\" Problems with the UK government's website meant that it wasn't possible to book a local Covid-19 drive-through test for about three hours today. I've been contacted by someone in Brighton who was trying to book a test earlier and was found that the website was, intermittently, either down or else it directed him to go to London. I called the government's helpline and was told that the site was down for about three hours today. When the person in Brighton phoned an official number he was told there was nothing that could be done at the moment as the system was down and \"multiple calls\" with the same complaint had been coming in. He called back and was told \"very few (if any) people are able to book a test online today due to technical errors, and so I should just turn up at the test centre, do the swab test, and complete/enter barcode details AFTER completing the test.\" Headteachers and teaching unions have been responding to the decision in Scotland that all secondary pupils should wear face masks in schools from Monday. If there's to be a U-turn in England, they want it sooner rather than later, but most agree - whatever the government says - staff and students should be allowed to wear face coverings if they want to. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, urged ministers to review the existing guidance, which says masks are not necessary in schools, and to provide clear direction one way or another. \"We have two concerns,\" he said. First, parents, pupils, and staff, will be anxious about the situation and need reassurance from the government about the public health basis for its policy over face coverings in England, rather than it being left entirely to schools to explain the government's rationale. And, second, if there is going to be any U-turn by the government that it does this sooner rather than later because the start of the new term is imminent. A spokesman for the National Association of Head Teachers said: \"Where there are individual members of staff or pupils who feel the need to wear a mask in order to feel safe enough to come to school, then we have confidence that our members would be able to make a sensible decision and allow that. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added that it should be permissible for staff members and students to wear face masks if they wish to do so. We have to stay abreast of the science, so when the World Health Organization says that children over 12 should wear masks in communal areas at school, that ought to be listened to. Parents should avoid chatting with friends at the school gates after dropping their children off in order to help limit Covid-19's spread, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has suggested. Continuing his drive to get children back into England's classrooms in September, Williamson said that parents should show \"understanding and consideration\". The minister, who continues to face calls for his resignation over the handling of the exams fiasco, suggested that parents should \"drop their children off and then get on with all the tasks of their day\". In an interview with the Evening Standard, Williamson conceded that not all children may be back in class on the first day but his goal was to see them coming back \"over the next few weeks\". Williamson told the Evening Standard: We're asking all parents to show understanding and consideration to the whole school community. Most schools have put in place staggered starts to make sure that there's a swift and good flow-through of parents, and we just ask people to be respectful of the systems that are being put into place. We'd ask parents just to be really considerate, make sure they're able to drop their children off and then get on with all the tasks of their day. Virgin Atlantic's creditors will vote on a \u00a31.2bn rescue deal today, as the airline tries to secure its future following the coronavirus crisis. The airline last month revealed the privately-funded recapitalisation plan agreed with its shareholders and investors, after Virgin's attempts to win UK state support were unsuccessful. The plan is designed to help it survive another 18 months of travel turmoil, with a return to profit in 2022. The carrier, founded by Sir Richard Branson, has previously said it will run out of money and could collapse into administration if creditors do not back the deal. Almost 200 of the airline's affected trade creditors, each of whom is owed more than \u00a350,000, will vote on Tuesday at a hearing at the high court in London. Virgin Atlantic needs to gain support equivalent to 75% of the overall outstanding value of money owed. Senior officials from the exams body, Ofqual, are to face questions next week about the grades fiasco from MPs on the House of Commons education committee. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, is scheduled to come before the committee on 16 September at what the committee billed as a \"regular accountability session\". A statement released by the committee said it would question the chief regulator, Sally Collier, and the Ofqual chair, Roger Taylor, \"on what went wrong in the awarding of grades, where responsibility lies and how and why problems with the standardisation model were not identified earlier\". \"MPs are also likely to ask what steps are being taken to support students, schools and colleges who have lost out because of the standardisation model and subsequent U-turn, and about lessons learnt to ensure a fair system should exams be cancelled in the future.\" Both Collier and Taylor are due to appear on 2 September. Birmingham city council has announced new enforcement measures targeting businesses flouting Covid-19 restrictions, coming into force from tomorrow. The latest steps were approved following a meeting of local authority chiefs and the government's gold command, and come on the back of concerns about a recent rise in infections in the city - although the rate is now falling. In a statement, the council said the \"enhanced measures\" would tackle the fact much of the current guidance is \"not legally enforceable\" at the moment. Councillor Ian Ward, the leader of Birmingham city council, said: Staying focused now will also support our fragile economic recovery in the long term. No one wants to see a continual 'stop, start' approach as to what citizens can do and where they can go, least of all our business community, most of whom are adhering to the guidance and are doing all they can to keep our citizens safe. For those that are not we are now enacting powers to ensure that they do. These new powers will allow us to intervene when businesses are putting staff and customers at risk of infection. We reported yesterday that a police chief has warned that people are acting like \"the virus isn't out there\" after a weekend of illegal gatherings in the West Midlands, despite Birmingham edging closer to a local lockdown. Scientists in Wales will launch a study this week into whether mouthwash can be used to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. Covid-19 patients at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff will take part in new research to find out if it has the potential to reduce the levels of the virus in saliva. Sars-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with an outer fatty (lipid) membrane, and previous studies are said to show that agents usually found in mouthwash - such as low amounts of ethanol, povidone-iodine and cetylpyridinium - could disrupt the membranes of other lipid viruses. Dentyl is the only UK mouthwash brand to take part in the 12-week study led by Prof David Thomas from Cardiff University and called: \"The measurement of mouthwash anti-viral activity against Covid-19.\" Dr Thomas said: \"We are very keen to start this much-needed clinical trial as our review of the literature indicated that we need to look deeper into the possible positive impact that mouthwashes may play on the transmission of Covid-19. Senior political figures in England might have survived controversies over alleged breaches of social distancing or lockdown restrictions but pressure is building from Brussels on the European trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, who has been resisting moves to quit over breaches in Ireland. RTE's Tony Connelly tweets that European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has asked Hogan to provide further details of his movements in Ireland. The Irish representative on the European commission was asked on Saturday by Ireland's prime minister and deputy prime minister to consider his position after his attendance at a golf dinner caused public outrage and led to other political resignations. Hogan, who offered an initial apology on Friday only after the prime minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin, demanded one, said on Sunday he had listened carefully to the views of Martin and the deputy prime minister, Leo Varadkar. Deaths in the UK have risen above average for the first time since mid-June, according to new figures, but Covid-19 is not believed to be behind the rise. Instead, the heatwave during the week ending August 14 is likely to explain the weekly increase, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). There were 9,392 deaths from all causes in England and Wales in the week ending August 14 - 447 more deaths compared with the previous week. It took the number of deaths that week to 3.4% above the average for this time of year over the past five years - the first time the average has been exceeded since June 12. Meanwhile, deaths involving coronavirus have been falling. Some 139 deaths registered in the week ending August 14 mentioned \"novel coronavirus\", an 8.6% fall from the 152 deaths in the previous week. It is the lowest number of weekly deaths involving Covid-19 registered since the week ending March 20, before the lockdown. Overall, there were 10,580 deaths from all causes registered across the UK in the week ending 14 August - 265 deaths higher than the five-year average and 370 more deaths than the previous week. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog now. If you want to flag up pandemic-related stories that we should be covering today you can reach me on Twitter at @BenQuinn75 or by email. I will be logging off soon and handing over the blog to my colleague Ben Quinn. Below are some of the latest developments of the day so far:  A leading member of the Oxford university team trying to find a vaccine for coronavirus has not ruled it out being ready for this winter. Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity at Oxford university, said: \"If cases accrue rapidly in clinical trials we could have data to put before regulators this year.\"  Scotland's education minister, John Swinney, has announced that all secondary pupils should wear face coverings in corridors and communal areas from next Monday. The measure applies to all high schools but Swinney added that nobody should be sent home for not wearing a mask.  Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said school staff or young people would not be penalised for wearing facemasks when schools reopen, although the advice is that they are currently not necessary. Speaking on the Radio 4 Today programme, Sharma said that the government has followed scientific and medical advice.  Sharma also waded into the controversy over the Last Night of the Proms featuring traditional flag-waving anthems Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory. Following suggestions that the music might be axed because of perceived links to colonialism, the BBC confirmed on Monday night that the songs would be performed - but as orchestral versions with no singing. Sharma said he would like to see the lyrics sung and suggested the BBC could put subtitles up so people can join in from home. Three prisoners tested positive for coronavirus in a Teesside jail block that has now been locked down. It comes after widespread testing of almost 800 inmates at HMP Holme House in Stockton. One house block, of around 170 prisoners, has now been isolated as a precaution following the positive tests. A prison service spokesperson said: One house block has been isolated as a precaution after widespread testing of almost 800 prisoners resulted in three positive tests. The service also confirmed no prison officers have tested positive for Covid-19. The 770 inmates were tested as part of a DHSC-commissioned testing study in prisons across the country to help increase our understanding of the virus. Visits to Holme House have not been suspended, the service added. The business secretary, Alok Sharma, has waded into the controversy over the Last Night of the Proms featuring traditional flag-waving anthems Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory. Following suggestions that the music might be axed because of perceived links to colonialism, the BBC confirmed on Monday night that the songs would be performed - but as orchestral versions with no singing. Sharma said he would like to see the lyrics sung and suggested the BBC could put subtitles up so people can join in from home. Asked about the controversy, Sharma told Sky News on Tuesday: \"The Last Night of the Proms gives huge amounts of pleasure to millions of people. I personally think it's a very joyous occasion and it's going to be very strange this year that you're not going to have a live audience. \"I understand now that the BBC has said they will maintain some of these traditions. Personally, I would like to see the lyrics sung. I understand some songs will have lyrics sung and, of course, the BBC is always able to put on subtitles so if people want they can join in from home. \"I think what's really important is that if you're looking at this sort of stuff is, you should be looking to tackle the substance of problems, rather than the symbols. I think that's a point the prime minister has made very well.\" Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. People with eating disorders are at significant risk of negative impacts of the pandemic, a research paper says. Data was collected from 129 people experiencing, or in recovery from, an eating disorder during the early stages of the UK pandemic lockdown. Participants were aged between 16 and 65 years. When asked about the overall impact of the pandemic on their eating disorder symptoms, (86.7%) reported that their symptoms had worsened as a result of the pandemic, with over 30% reporting that their symptoms were much worse. The paper was published in the Journal of Eating Disorders. People with blood cancer are at greater risk of dying if they go to hospital with coronavirus than people with other types of cancer, research shows. A paper published by Lancet Oncology found that of 224 people with blood cancer (leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma) who got coronavirus and ended up in hospital, 36% of them died. There are more than 200,000 people with blood cancer who are in the \"extremely clinically vulnerable\" group. Analysis found that once you account for age and gender, people with leukaemia are more than twice as likely to die (125%) if they are diagnosed with coronavirus than the average person with cancer. People with lymphoma are 72% more likely to die, and people with myeloma are 65% more likely to die. People with other types of blood cancer appear slightly less likely to die (around 20% less likely) than the average person with cancer. Gemma Peters, chief executive of Blood Cancer UK, said: \"These findings confirm that the coronavirus is especially dangerous for people with blood cancer, and they will be very worrying for the 200,000 people in the UK who have been shielding because of it. \"Thankfully, the coronavirus is now less prevalent in society than it was a few months ago, and so we're no longer in a position where people with blood cancer shouldn't leave their homes at all. But given they are at greater risk than people with other types of cancer, it's important that people with blood cancer talk to their healthcare team about their own personal risk and that they do everything they can to avoid the virus. This includes avoiding coming into contact with people and avoiding crowded places, particularly indoors. And if they do develop symptoms of Covid-19 it is important they talk to their specialist blood cancer team immediately. \"As well as this, the government needs to do more to support people with blood cancer to protect themselves. In particular, ending the shielding scheme has effectively forced people with blood cancer to go back to work at a time when it is becoming increasingly clear they are high risk of dying if they get the virus.\" Tesco is to permanently employ 16,000 extra staff taken on during the pandemic to help support a surge in online grocery trade. The roles include 10,000 pickers, who select and pack grocery orders for home delivery, and 3,000 drivers, as well as a variety of other roles in stores and distribution centres. Tesco's move comes after the electrical goods specialist AO.com, the DIY chain Kingfisher and the delivery firms DPD and Hermes hired thousands more workers combined to cope with the rise in home deliveries. However, the shift online has hit high streets hard, with Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis and Boots among the chains shutting stores and cutting jobs. London department store Liberty is also planning redundancies via a voluntary scheme under which at least 50 of its 550-plus UK team are expected to go. Stress and exhaustion from the Covid-19 crisis threaten to intensify burnout among women working in the NHS just as it prepares to resume most services, according to a survey that has prompted calls for greater support for female staff. The pandemic had amplified alleged bullying, sexism and racism on the part of managers, some workers also warned, while 26% of women said they did not feel safe sharing personal concerns with their boss. This was especially true for staff from a minority ethnic background, who also reported feeling traumatised by the disproportionate impact of the virus, said the Health and Care Women Leaders Network of the NHS Confederation, which carried out the survey. The exams debacle could fatally undermine Boris Johnson's claim to be a champion of \"levelling up\", a former education secretary has said. Justine Greening, who was education secretary for two years under Theresa May, said that more had to be done to ensure young people were not failed again by the government. She said the fallout from the crisis, in which poorer pupils suffered disproportionately as A-level results were downgraded by algorithm until a humiliating government U-turn, could do to Johnson what Black Wednesday did to John Major. \"The exams crisis this summer threatens to be as damaging for the public's confidence in Boris Johnson's government's ability to level up Britain, as the ERM crisis was for John Major's government's competence on economic management,\" she said. Greening, writing for the Guardian, also said she believed the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, would have been aware of the risk to disadvantaged pupils before the exams crisis unfolded and that more must be done to help disadvantaged students as schools reopen next week. \"While talk about levelling up has continued, levelling down is what's happened in reality,\" she said. Coronavirus has led to more people switching jobs, research for the Office of National statistics shows. It published an article that looks at people switching occupation in early 2020, and compared with the same period of 2019, before the pandemic. In 2002, 6.1% changed occupation in the first half of this year, compared with 5.7% in the same period last year. Analysis of only those who have changed occupation in the first half of this year shows that associate professional and technical occupations experienced the greatest percentage of occupational outflows (20.9%) and occupational inflows (21.2%); over half (52.5%) also changed major industry. The Coronavirus pandemic has shone a light on the use of algorithms in decision making among government bodies, after one was used by the exam regulator Ofqual in recent A-level results. It downgraded almost 40% of grades assessed by teachers, culminating in a humiliating government U-turn and the system being scrapped. Guardian research shows that other uses of algorithms have been dropped with 20 councils no longer using an algorithm to flag claims as \"high risk\" for potential welfare fraud. The ones they flagged were pulled out by staff to double-check, potentially slowing down people's claims without them being aware. The Home Office recently stopped using an algorithm to help decide visa applications after allegations that it contained \"entrenched racism\". The charity the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) and the digital rights group Foxglove launched a legal challenge against the system, which was scrapped before a case went to court. Here is a look at some global updates around coronavirus. Gaza reported its first Covid-19 cases outside quarantine areas and declared lockdown. The first cases of coronavirus have been detected outside of quarantine facilities within the Gaza Strip, a potentially disastrous development given the enclave's fragile health system. MPs urge Boris Johnson to meet 'forgotten victims' of coronavirus. Boris Johnson must meet families whose relatives have been killed by coronavirus and fund research into the longer-term effects, known as \"long Covid\", to help the pandemic's forgotten victims, MPs have said. Their recommendations form part of a fresh set of demands made on the prime minister intended to shape how he prepares for a potential second wave of the illness this autumn. 'Very low evidence' for plasma therapy authorised by Trump, says WHO. In case you missed this in the earlier blog: Donald Trump on Sunday announced the emergency authorisation of convalescent plasma, a method involving taking plasma from people who have recovered from Covid-19, for coronavirus patients. Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the WHO, stressed that it was still unproven and that there was \"very low evidence\" it was safe and effective. Dr Fauci warns against rushing out a vaccine. Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, warned that distributing a Covid-19 vaccine under special emergency use guidelines before it has been proved safe and effective in large trials is a bad idea that could have a chilling effect on the testing of other vaccines. Usain Bolt has tested positive for coronavirus. World-record sprinter and eight-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt has tested positive for coronavirus and is self-isolating at his home in Jamaica after last week celebrating his 34th birthday with a big bash mask-free, Reuters reports. South Korea orders most Seoul schools to close. South Korea on Tuesday ordered most schools in Seoul and surrounding areas to close and move classes back online, the latest in a series of precautionary measures aimed at heading off a resurgence in coronavirus cases, Reuters reports. Scotland's education minister, John Swinney, has announced that all secondary pupils should wear face coverings in corridors and communal areas from next Monday. The measure applies to all high schools but Swinney added that nobody should be sent home for not wearing a mask. Swinney told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland: \"This is not going to be mandatory. We are recommending this is what should be done and we will encourage schools to pursue that as part of the work to maintain safety within schools. It's about making sure that everybody is looking out for each other.\" Yesterday, the Scottish government said that it had been consulting councils and teaching organisations about the measure after face coverings were recommended for secondary schools by the World Health Organization at the weekend. WHO said face coverings were useful where physical distancing between adults and pupils aged 12 and over was impossible, or in areas of high transmission. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said school staff or young people would not be penalised for wearing facemasks when schools reopen, although the advice is that they are currently not necessary. Speaking on the Radio 4 Today programme, Sharma said that the government has followed scientific and medical advice. \"Public Health England does not recommend at the moment [facemasks] in schools... We are always considering the latest advice and evidence but the current advice is that it is not recommended.\" When asked if people would be penalised for wearing them, he said this would not happen. \"It's about what makes sense. We have seen recent surveys from the ONS showing high level of confidence in terms of pupils returning safe settings in schools.\" He said that the focus was opening up the economy in a phased and \"cautious manner, getting businesses up and running\". When asked about whether the government would offer financial support to those who may need to quarantine and therefore lose wages, he said they \"look at all suggestions\" they receive. \"The key thing though is the best way we can restart the economy is by opening up in cautious manner,\" he repeated. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has said the first volunteers have now been dosed in its clinical trial of a new drug to help prevent and treat Covid-19. The group, which is also separately developing a Covid-19 vaccine together with scientists at Oxford University, said the drug - known as AZD7442 - is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies. AstraZeneca said the trial, which will include up to 48 healthy volunteers in the UK aged 18 to 55, will look at the safety of the treatment, as well as the body's reaction to the drug and how it processes it. The Cambridge-headquartered group said the phase 1 clinical trial is an \"important milestone\" in the development of the drug, which has the potential to act as a preventative for people exposed to the virus, as well as to treat patients already infected with Covid-19. A so-called monoclonal antibody combination works by mimicking the body's natural antibodies. The antibodies come from patients infected with coronavirus and were discovered by Vanderbilt University Medical Centre and then licensed to AstraZeneca in June. Astra then boosts the combined antibodies so that they \"afford at least six months of protection from Covid-19\". Mene Pangalos, executive vice-president of biopharmaceuticals research and development at Astra, said: \"This trial is an important milestone in the development of our monoclonal antibody combination to prevent or treat Covid-19. \"This combination of antibodies, coupled to our proprietary half-life extension technology, has the potential to improve both the effectiveness and durability of use, in addition to reducing the likelihood of viral resistance.\" If the trial is successful, Astra said it would look to move the treatment to late-stage phase 2 and phase 3 trials. The trial is being funded by the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which is part of the US Department of Health and Human Services. It comes after Downing Street said on Monday the UK would be first in line for the coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University and Astra, once approved. This followed reports that Donald Trump was considering granting emergency authorisation for it to be fast-tracked in the US. The Guardian has been writing about those who lost their lives from Covid-19. Hong Kong scientists reported of a healthy man in his 30s who became reinfected with coronavirus after falling sick to it months earlier. They say genome sequencing shows the two strains of the virus are \"clearly different\", making it the world's first proven case of reinfection. But the World Health Organization warned it is important not to jump to conclusions based on the case of one patient. Dr Jeffrey Barrett, senior scientific consultant for the Covid-19 genome project at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: \"Given the number of global infections to date, seeing one case of reinfection is not that surprising even if it is a very rare occurrence. \"It may be that second infections, when they do occur, are not serious - though we don't know whether this person was infectious during their second episode.\" A leading member of the Oxford university team trying to find a vaccine for coronavirus has not ruled it out being ready for this winter. The trials ongoing around the world hope to involve around 50,000 people and he said if cases accrue rapidly in clinical trials they could present data to regulators this year. It comes after the chief medical officer for England, Chris Witty, suggested that a vaccine would most reasonably be ready next winter or in the one after. Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity at Oxford university, said: \"I think Chris Witty is right to be cautious, it could take as long as that to demonstrate that the vaccine works and is safe and then we have to go through a process of regulators looking at that to make sure it is done correctly. But if cases accrue rapidly in clinical trials we could have data to put before regulators this year,\" he said. Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity at Oxford university - one of the lead researchers on its vaccine trial - has said that if coronavirus cases accrue rapidly at clinical trial stage they could have data to put before regulators this year. It comes after the chief medical officer for England, Chris Witty, suggested that a vaccine will most reasonably be ready next winter or in the one after. \"I think Chris Witty is right to be cautious, it could take as long as that to demonstrate that the vaccine works and is safe and then we have to go through a process of regulators looking at that to make sure it is done correctly. But if cases accrue rapidly in clinical trials we could have data to put before regulators this year,\" he said. When asked about the possibility of people being reinfected with the virus after a Hong Kong man caught Covid-19 twice, Pollard said: \"I think it is important in all vaccine development to look at changes in the virus, which happens over time, to make sure if the virus does change the vaccine is still effective against it.\" The chief executive of the Royal Statistical Society has told Ofqual to \"cease defending the indefensible\" in the latest exchange in a row over the algorithm used to determine this year's A-level and GCSE results. The dispute began with comments made by the RSS in which the society said it had offered to help with the algorithm but objected to the proposed confidentiality agreement that experts would be required to sign and claimed it had received no official response to its concerns. Ofqual's chair, Roger Taylor, rebuffed the criticisms on Sunday. He said Ofqual had published a copy of the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to dispute the \"restrictions you have incorrectly alleged\" and denied that the regulator had failed to respond to the issues raised by the RSS. An interesting look at six of the most promising treatments for Covid-19 so far from my colleague Sarah Boseley. Below is a look at the latest news and developments regarding coronavirus in the UK. Students will begin receiving their BTec results from Tuesday after exam board Pearson delayed their publication. Thousands of headteachers have written to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, accusing the government of repeatedly failing to listen or collaborate as schools prepare to reopen to millions of children across England. Pupils wearing masks is an option that should be kept under review, a union has said, despite the education secretary insisting the measure is not needed as schools in England prepare to reopen. The world's fastest man, Usain Bolt, is in quarantine after reportedly testing positive for Covid-19 just days after a party for his 34th birthday, which was attended by England footballer Raheem Sterling and several other sports stars. Stop and searches in London rose by 40% during lockdown and a lower proportion of them led to arrests, figures show. Four times as many adolescents are physically abused compared with younger children in England, analysis of police-recorded offences shows, with incidents against 11- to 18-year-olds soaring during the coronavirus lockdown. The world's fastest man, Usain Bolt, is in quarantine after reportedly testing positive for Covid-19 just days after a party for his 34th birthday, which was attended by England footballer Raheem Sterling and several other sports stars. Jamaica's health ministry said late on Monday that Bolt, the world 100m and 200m record holder, had tested positive for the virus. He had earlier posted a video on social media saying he was waiting to hear back on his results - before urging anyone who had come into contact with him recently to enter quarantine. Jamaica's minister of health and wellness, Dr Christopher Tufton, reportedly confirmed Bolt had been notified of the positive test and contact tracing was under way. Students will begin receiving their BTec results from Tuesday after exam board Pearson delayed their publication. Grading for the vocational qualifications was delayed to give the board more time to recalculate the grades after A-level and GCSE results were based on teacher estimates. Last week, Pearson said the regrading was needed to \"address concerns about unfairness in relation to A-levels and GCSEs and ensure no BTec student is disadvantaged.\" Cindy Rampersaud, senior vice-president for BTec and apprenticeships at the company, said all eligible results would be available by Friday. Around 200,000 level one and two entries were due to receive grades last Thursday, while 250,000 level three grades have already been awarded but were part of the reassessment. Justine Greening, the MP for Putney from 2005 to 2019, has written for the Guardian today on the exams crisis in England and Wales: The exams crisis in England and Wales this summer threatens to be as damaging for the public's confidence in the ability of Boris Johnson's government to tackle regional inequalities and level up Britain as the crisis over the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) was for John Major's reputation on economic management. How it responds now is pivotal for the country's future, but also the current administration's. As soon as the decision was taken to close schools in mid-March, it was clear that there needed to be a plan in place for reopening them and helping young people catch up on the education they lost out on during lockdown. It was also clear that children who were already less privileged were most affected by the shutdown. It was clear when life-defining exams were cancelled that there would also need to be a way to ensure university places, apprenticeships and wider employment opportunities wouldn't become even further out of reach. Thousands of headteachers have written to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, accusing the government of repeatedly failing to listen or collaborate as schools prepare to reopen to millions of children across England. In what appears to be a damaging breakdown in relations, headteachers say they are facing some of the most significant challenges of their professional lives but feel they are \"working in isolation\", unsupported by the government. School leaders, who are still picking up the pieces after the recent exams fiasco, say their confidence in government has been \"significantly knocked\". They are calling for urgent changes to current ways of working to help ensure a safe return to school. Hannah Bernard, head of business banking at Barclays, said their research showed more women were thinking of starting businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic. On the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Bernard was asked whether companies taking out loans would not be able to pay them back in time. \"You have to make sure support is in place and lots of preparation is made for businesses that may go through difficulties when they start to pay back loans. We are doing lots to make sure they are ready,\" she said. \"If someone took a loan out at the start of the scheme their first payment will be May next year. Lots of women have been spurred to start businesses due to lockdown,\" she said, citing research the banking giant did on this subject. Michael Fabricant, Conservative MP for Lichfield in Staffordshire, said he would like Rule, Britannia! to be performed by a solo singer at the Last Night of the Proms. It comes after the BBC confirmed on Monday night that the song will be performed as an orchestral version only. The change is down to Covid-19 restrictions, the corporation said, after reports the anthems could be axed for political reasons. Fabricant told BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"I think it is all very sad, Rule Britannia has some lovely words.\" He argued that while the BBC said the changes were due to coronavirus restrictions that other tunes will be sung, such as the national anthem. He said that a solo singer version would not be \"thin\". \"When you hear opera singers belting it out, I would not say that is a thin voice, I'd be happy with that compromise: a single voice singing it [Rule, Britannia!] loudly.\" Pupils wearing masks is an option that should be kept under review, a union has said, despite the education secretary insisting the measure is not needed as schools in England prepare to reopen. It comes as the Scottish government is expected to state its decision on face coverings in schools in light of the latest guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) that children aged 12 and over should wear a mask. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said as evidence continues to emerge, Westminster should review its guidance. The ASCL general secretary, Geoff Barton, told the Daily Telegraph: \"We would expect the government in Westminster to review its guidance on the use of face coverings in schools - which currently says they are not required - in light of the WHO guidance and the consultation taking place in Scotland. \"The evidence is clearly evolving on this issue and it is important that it is kept under review and that clear direction is provided to schools.\" But Prof Russell Viner, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said there was concern about younger children wearing face coverings. The WHO and UN children's agency Unicef suggested that face shields may be an alternative in situations such as speech classes where the teacher and pupils need to see each other's mouths. The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, has already said the issue should be kept under review. Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said her education secretary John Swinney is in the final stages of consulting with teachers and councils on whether to recommend the use of masks when moving around schools.

We are going to leave the EU, so this may be an opportunity to write a set of laws that are absolutely right for the modern times, that allow us get this balance right at the same time.

At the moment, the debate takes place between these two - are they one extreme or are they another? - and there's very good arguments to say that they are neither one extreme nor the other.\"</p><p>He suggested that competition law was another area where post-Brexit Britain could diverge from the EU. \"At the moment European competition law is ... based on a world of widgets,\" he said. \"There's another opportunity to have a really big look at how we run competition policy in the UK in the light of the changing technology and the fact that many of the innovations of our time have zero marginal cost.\"</p><p>The DCMS committee is investigating the impact of fake news on British politics, and members of the committee have repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the limited cooperation offered by technology executives. </p><p>Hancock said the government \"should also not rule out legislative options to insist on the transparency of platforms in this area\". He added: \"That isn't somewhere we have yet concluded is necessary, and I hope that it isn't, because they can come to the table voluntarily much quicker than it'll take to legislate, but of course we're prepared to do that.\"</p><p>One reason the minister may not be eager to legislate against people running social media platforms is that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/12/tim-berners-lee-web-weapon-regulation-open-letter\">he is one</url>. \"I have an app for my constituents,\" he noted. \"I can't be liable for what they publish, otherwise I wouldn't be able to allow them to publish it, because I can only be liable for what I publish.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-42293189</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RW1-7CX1-JCJY-G33R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"528\"/><timeReceived>5:28 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

The case concerned two specific instances when AFR was used on Bridges, but the department was said to have used it 50 times from 2017-2019.A panel of three judges ruled that this software violated 'privacy rights, data protection laws, and equality laws,' according to CNBC.[1]'This technology is an intrusive and discriminatory mass surveillance tool,' Bridges said. </p><p>'We should all be able to use our public spaces without being subjected to oppressive surveillance.'The ruling comes at a time when facial recognition is becoming increasingly common in law enforcement and could help set an important precedent, and not just in the U.K., where London police are set to begin using it soon.In China[2], facial recognition technology is widespread and densely integrated into public infrastructure. There, it is utilized not just for law enforcement purposes, but also to track citizens during their everyday lives as part of the government's social credits system, which rewards people for 'good behavior.' In June[3], the New York City Council overwhelmingly (44-6) voted in favor of a bill that provides oversight and regulation for the NYPD's use of facial recognition in its surveillance activities. Mayor Bill De Blasio later signed the bill into law, requiring the department to divulge how its software function as well as the rules by which it abides when using it. San Francisco and several other cities have banned the use of facial recognition by police amid concerns about accuracy, while some big tech firms have suspended sales of the technology to law enforcement Photo: GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / JUSTIN SULLIVAN [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/swp-facial-recognition-unlawful.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/swp-facial-recognition-unlawful.html</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/in-china-facial-recognition-public-shaming-and-control-go-hand-in-hand/\">https://www.cnet.com/news/in-china-facial-recognition-public-shaming-and-control-go-hand-in-hand/</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ibtimes.com/ny-city-council-passes-bill-mandating-oversight-nypd-surveillance-tech-2997087\">https://www.ibtimes.com/ny-city-council-passes-bill-mandating-oversight-nypd-surveillance-tech-2997087</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767159716794529525876100122</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JX-0DT1-F03R-N3T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"433\"/><timeReceived>5:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 11, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002KDX</classCode><className>GETTY IMAGES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS541922 COMMERCIAL PHOTOGRAPHY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS541430 GRAPHIC DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS518210 DATA PROCESSING, HOSTING &amp;

The UK government's Online Harms White Paper, published in the spring, is part of this process. Consultation on the paper, which aims to make the UK the world's safest place to go online, closed in July 2019 but given the fundamental objections raised in the published responses, draft legislation seems unlikely any time soon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The list of online harms in the government's sights are a roll call of modern social ills, from widely understood scourges such as terrorist content, child sexual exploitation and cyberstalking to less clearly defined phenomena like disinformation, trolling and intimidation. The list is deliberately open-ended to ensure the eventual legislation keeps pace with changing technology and online habits.</p><p>Until now, tackling such harms has relied on a patchwork of criminal law and regulation aimed at specific issues coupled with voluntary initiatives. However, following high-profile incidents both in the UK and abroad, the government concluded firmer action is necessary. It has proposed a statutory duty of care which would be imposed on entities as diverse as tech giants and social media companies, public discussion forums, cloud hosting providers and even retailers inviting online product reviews. Those affected would be required to take reasonable steps to keep users safe, and prevent others coming to harm as a direct consequence of activity on their services. This duty would be underpinned by regulatory codes issued by a dedicated regulator and, to facilitate enforcement action, overseas entities could be required to nominate a UK representative. Breaches of the duty would potentially lead to fines, the blocking of non-compliant websites and, in the worst cases, the imposition of civil and even criminal responsibility on senior company managers.</p><p>The UK is not alone in seeking new legislative tools to protect people online - policymakers in France, Germany and Australia have all introduced national laws for that purpose and, in a recent leak, it emerged that the European Commission (\"the Commission\") is considering a so-called \"Digital Services Act\", to be introduced in 2020 and enforced by a European supra-regulator, which would tackle issues such as online hate speech and disinformation. Already proving highly controversial is the Commission's suggestion of incentivising proactive measures such as the introduction of automated algorithmic filtering - effectively monitoring.</p><p>The UK proposals go significantly further than the Commission's, effectively stripping away the \"safe harbour\" which platform providers currently enjoy under EU law and requiring active steps to remove (and in some instances prevent the uploading of) harmful content if liability for third party content is to be avoided. Some critics have questioned whether such a step is justified when the behaviour at which the proposals - for example, cyber-bullying - are aimed is a symptom of a deeper societal ill rather than something which the platform provider has caused. Others have suggested that, when much of what we view on social media is dictated by unseen algorithms tracking our behaviour, an alternative approach to tackling some online harms might be to restrict the use of such hidden processing by big tech organisations.</p><p>The key objection raised to the UK government's proposals, however, is the potential threat they may pose to freedom of speech. That threat arises from the nature of the duty of care itself and from the vague definition and open-ended list of the harms they seek to address.</p><p>As the Internet Association, comprising the world's leading search and social media companies, suggests, \"duty of care\" carries with it a specific legal meaning which might work for obvious risks of, say, physical injury, but does not easily fit with the ambiguity of many online harm terms. For example, at what point does freedom of expression about misguided if genuinely held anti-vaccine views become \"disinformation\", and how is the platform provider with the duty of care to decide? In such circumstances, there is concern that fear of regulatory action could lead to disproportionate self-regulation by organisations, borne out of excessive caution, and rigid adherence to the new regulator's codes of practice which may not necessarily be appropriate.</p><p>The White Paper's proposals themselves acknowledge that many of the harms at which they are aimed are vague, for example, \"intimidation\" and \"coercive behaviour\". Putting aside the principle against imposing regulatory and criminal liability in respect of ill-defined behaviour, companies - particularly start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises - would be likely to err on the side of caution and delete material in borderline cases. In practice, this would usher in \"upload filtering\" to prevent the publication of material arbitrarily deemed harmful. This may ultimately have a chilling effect on public discourse and drive people to the dark web where the potential for exposure to extremes is greater still.</p><p>The non-exhaustive list of online harms at which the proposals are aimed is no doubt a well-intentioned attempt at \"future-proofing\" the legislation. However, the lack of a clear remit for the new regulator risks attracting intense media and political pressure to take action in the event of future scandals which only peripherally involve the online sphere. Further, the open-ended nature of the proposed regulatory remit risks encouraging more repressive regimes around the world to follow suit, justifying crackdowns on legitimate political dissent by reference to the UK regime.</p><p>As well as principled objections to the proposals, commentators have warned of the financial risk they pose to the UK's digital sector, said to contribute \u00a345 billion to the UK's GDP. Even though the proposals maintain that the regulator would take account of a company's size and \"reach\" when considering compliance, the cost of introducing measures such as upload filtering, particularly for start-ups and SMEs, may be prohibitive. Some companies may simply decide that the regulatory burden is too onerous for them to offer their services to UK customers.</p><p>The pervasiveness of the internet is bringing with it sometimes bewildering social and economic development. At the same time, this has amplified many familiar problems, leading to calls for tighter restrictions. The government's White Paper is a recognition of the irreversible societal changes which are taking place and, in effect, a first step towards establishing the acceptable norms of the future. However, when considering responses to the consultation and formulating the parameters which will determine our relationship with technology going forward, legislators should be careful to strike a balance between the need for regulation and the right to free speech.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

The podcast explores the crucial customs and border issues that are likely to be caused by protectionist laws and barriers that govern the movement of data, as well as tech related goods and services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The podcast will consider:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The practical and realistic implications of these laws and the protectionist approachThe issues that this will create where the accelerated race to develop smart tech is concernedThe entire product development process - from mining and manufacturing to product development - and the individual concerns that protectionism creates for these</p><p>Transcript</p><p>Andrew Cave: I'm Andrew Cave, Business Writer with The Daily Telegraph and Forbes Magazine and I'm here today with two experts to talk about trade and protectionism. I'm here with Ursula Johnson, Director of customs and trade at law firm Gowling WLG and Sean Giles, Associate in the European Union Trade and Competition Team at the same firm.</p><p>So this is an interesting time for trade being in the news, can you talk a bit about the general perspective with the Brexit talks and the focus on trade, has there ever been a time when trade and customs has been more in the news?</p><p>Ursula Johnston: No, I totally agree and thank you for that - it's an interesting open question. So I've been working in the customs and trade space for about 15 years and I've never seen customs and trade so high on the agenda, not only of governments but also businesses themselves as they struggle to come to terms with this sort of wholesale geopolitical change and move from a sort of free and open borders into large trading nations taking a much more protectionist outlook and looking to protect their domestic market. Now obviously that's very sharply felt in the UK, in the context of Brexit as we wait, today, for news and developments around whether Theresa May's proposal for a customs border either to be put between the UK and Europe, whether that will pass, business are really thinking about how can they move goods between the UK and the EU whilst maintaining frictionless trade.</p><p>Andrew: That's very interesting. And Sean, what in terms of protectionism, how much of a threat is all this to trade as we know it?</p><p>Sean Giles: Well I think you can see from the news agenda and the news headlines nowadaysthat there is a lot of talk about the US and China and the so called trade wall. We're just focussing on what this report calls the traditional protectionist measures, so that's tariffs and quotas that, there's no resource nationalism where you protect a certain resource within your country. But this report highlights a second run of nationalism and protectionism which is this digital protectionism which is a focus on the new oil that is data and the way countries are using legislation to prevent data from crossing borders which in the 21st century, in the digital age where companies are reliant on data ... and this is not just data companies but all companies that use data within their businesses. If you as a company cannot move your data from one country to another within your operations that makes it difficult for you to operate across borders.</p><p>Andrew: And this is a really interesting area and it's one where Gowling WLG has just issued a report called Protectionism 2.0 Digital Forces Driving the New Protectionist Agenda. Ursula, how much at threat is the technology sector when you introduce protectionism into what's been relative trade until now?</p><p>Ursula: Yes, I mean I think the main impact if I look at it from a business perspective and commercial perspective is you know it tends to lead to a decreased consumer demand and potentially produce a surplus and this really makes for inefficient trade and it generally just increases prices in the market. So, why does that come into fruition? Well, it means tariff increases so that's where individual countries take the decision to increase the customs duty rate on importing material, that pushes up the price to put a finished product into the market. When also you take into account that your natural resource material costs are  higher, you also have a slight reduction potentially in market access for the producers so export subsidies will tend to depress world prices and that will damage our profits, investments and ultimately jobs as well, particularly for those perhaps in the lower income populous of developing countries. Those people really rely on a strong export market for their services and for their goods that they manufacture from their services, so protectionism ultimately can be a rather ineffective and costly means of protecting your domestic labour force. Tariffs also sort of tend to decrease the welfare population just through higher prices and a stricter consumer as well as consumer costs so really the impact is quite wide ranging.</p><p>Andrew: Thank you, and Sean from an EU perspective, how much of a threat is protectionism to tech companies in Europe? We hear mostly about the big tech companies in silicon valley but what about the European companies?</p><p>Sean: I mean I think the impact's probably global, it's probably spread equally, I wouldn't say European companies are necessarily more or less exposed than US companies. However, there is obviously a high degree of data protection generally within Europe and we've seen that recently with the introduction of GDPR, but I think we should draw a line between data protection and data protectionism and I think what our report's talking about is these countries that are traditionally seen as liberal countries when it comes to traditional measures such as tariffs, that impose legislation that restricts the free movement of intellectual property and of digital data. So Australia would be a good example where they're traditionally seen as quite liberal in terms of their tariffs but then if you look at the laws around data protection and data protectionism in particular you aren't allowed as a foreign company to export health data on Australian nationals for example, unless you have an Australian data centre, which is obviously a non-tariff barrier that can be quite an issue for any non-Australian company that the Australian company just will not fix.</p><p>Andrew: So this is an example of unintended consequence is it, in terms of the privacy, GDPR and other privacy legislation and then the general EU talks which are about general trade, having all these unintended consequences on the tech sector?</p><p>Sean: I don't know if it's necessarily unintended consequences, I think there are very good public reasons why you would want to have strong data protection laws. I think the data protectionism aspect that then prevents the movement of data is a separate issue, you know on legitimate grounds to prevent the movement of data when you want to protect your nationals, but when it comes to restricting the flow of intellectual property and the flow of ideas and the flow of communications in such a way that it impacts on a business's ability to trade that soon becomes not even necessary ulterior motive but perhaps there is no data protection motive there in the first place, it's purely motivated by protectionism rather than looking at business welfare.</p><p>Andrew: So there's a bit of an interesting distinction between almost invisible technology, you know the data protection, IP issues and visible and very tangible technology which is affected by raw material suppliers and minerals and bits that are coming from all around the world lithium and cobalt and all the other things which mobile phones and batteries need. Can you talk Sean a bit about the whole global product development process; is that going to come under threat as protectionism rises?</p><p>Sean: I think it's definitely possible and I think that the key part at the moment what we're seeing in the context of Brexit and Trump is this move away from multilateralism which, you know, has traditionally been the dispute resolution mechanism between countries where they've sort of all seemingly agreed that actually we want to reduce barriers, we want to reduce tariffs, but since then, you know, since Trump's come into power and since the US particularly in the last 15 years, we've seen this sort of assertion of nationalism and we've seen this assertion of actually we need to protect our own, we need to put America first for example in the case of Trump and in the case of Brexit we see this move away from the rules based system which allows countries particularly within the EU, within the EU system to prevent one another from putting up trade barriers. Now if we look at a global picture we have the WTO Appellate Body and dispute resolution panels which are all appointed sort of, I consent that the WTO members which is most of the trading companies in this world and one issue that we're facing now is as countries turn away from this consent based system it makes it a lot more difficult at a geopolitical and macro level for tariffs to be reduced and for non-tariff barriers to be taken away and I think, I mean for businesses that's quite difficult unless they're at that table with their governments and they're able to influence policy changes.</p><p>Andrew: And that's very interesting, so it's all getting a lot harder for companies and for their boards. Ursula what should boards do about this, how can boards position themselves to deal with this and other threat they have to think about.</p><p>Ursula: Yes absolutely, I think protectionism certainly since the first report that we published on this topic has certainly rocketed up the agenda obviously fuelled by Brexit concerns, also the so called trade wars between China and US. So if I was talking to a board about this what would I be trying to pinpoint as perhaps some active steps they can take to address the risks that this throws up? I think the first thing is to understand the market that you operate in, and understand you know what individual countries' approaches to protectionism, what does that mean in terms of your business's strategy around procurement, manufacturing and distribution. Do you for example want to look at your manufacturing footprint globally and to think about shifting where that occurs? I also think businesses will be looking at markets which offer very limited barriers to trade whether that be tariff or non-tariff barriers, so either direct costs or indirect costs as opportunities to sort of achieve savings as they look to put manufacturing strategy together. I also think businesses can conduct a supply chain audit so they look at the commercial effects of the increased protectionism so that could include, for example currency manipulation, a change in regulation or even a wholesale change in government and the sort of political environment of a particular market that they operate in.</p><p>I also look, when I'm talking to companies around us about supply change audits and encourage them to look at the network or free trade agreements and look for opportunities again for reducing the costs base of sourcing and manufacturing.</p><p>Thirdly and very importantly, protectionism is obviously driven at a political level and therefore businesses that want, to have a stake and have a say in how this influences and how this impacts their business need to think about engaging in discussion with government and being able to demonstrate what is the impact of a particular policy change, either just for them as a business or for the market and for the population as a whole, so therefore the board may want to think about options for login for example.</p><p>I think lastly businesses, as the landscape bracket changes need to keep agile, they need to make sure that they understand the long term consequences of making a particular investment commitment and really can they design an operating model that gives them flexibility to move operations globally and be able to react in a way to geopolitical change that gives them a competitive advantage, and you know I think this has been very well summarised towards the end of the report.</p><p>Andrew: Thank you Ursula that's really interesting. So the report's called Protectionism 2.0 Digital Forces Driving the New Protectionist Agenda, this is a subject I'm sure we're going to be hearing about a lot more as the Brexit talks continue and this is an issue which isn't going to go away.</p><p>Thank you Ursula and thank you Sean, very much.</p><p>Ursula: Thank you Andrew.</p><p>Read the original article on  GowlingWLG.com</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

At the same time however, lurking on the Dark Web are fraudsters and rogue employees looking to ruin your festive shopping spree. Commercial disputes lawyer and cyber-crime expert, Oliver Smith looks at combatting the festive online fraud onslaught.</p><p>The winter holidays are the gift that keeps on giving for cyber criminals who thrive on popular promotional dates such as Black Friday, Cyber Monday and the January sale season. Indeed, theft of sensitive data from online businesses is a serious and growing problem, according to official figures for the High Court which show a 25% rise in data theft cases by disgruntled employees in 2016. Increased reliance on technology has made businesses more vulnerable to theft of large volumes of valuable data such as customer email addresses or other sensitive information like profit margins or passwords. The number of passwords consumers now have to remember means they, understandably, often use the same or similar passwords for many of their accounts. When one is compromised it can make other accounts vulnerable.</p><p>There are, however, technical and legal solutions available to the savvy online retailer and shopper. Many big tech companies like Apple, Microsoft and Google offer encrypted password apps which will remember or create any number of complex different passwords for all your online accounts. The best part is that you only need to remember one password to use it. Meanwhile, there are many new software programs for businesses to help them police and protect their data. This will become particularly important when the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into operation on 25 May 2018 which makes certain individuals at companies responsible for data breaches and allows large fines based on a percentage of annual turnover.</p><p>As a last resort, businesses may have to seek assistance from the courts by seeking an urgent interim injunction to stop a rogue employee using stolen data or selling it to a competitor. In extreme cases a judge may even allow solicitors, under supervision of another independent solicitor, to carry out an unannounced search of the ex-employee's home, new office or computers to find and preserve evidence of wrongdoing.</p><p>But what about consumers?</p><p>Shoppers concerned that a data breach may have affected them or led to them being defrauded online can contact the Information Commissioner's Office online for help in securing their data or claiming compensation. If the matter is high value or urgent, an intellectual property solicitor should be consulted.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.</p><p><br/> Mr Oliver Smith<br/> Keystone Law<br/> 48 Chancery Lane<br/> London<br/> WC2A 1JF<br/> UK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONDAQ-10655008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MONDAQ2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R5D-C8S1-JCF5-V448-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">149522</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"478\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Mondaq Ltd.

'This was back when computers were hand-built and getting to understand the components of computers themselves was a natural pathway into the IT industry.'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, it was the management side of IT where she particularly felt at home - progressing to executive and board level and delivering transformational IT projects and services to large clients around the world in the public and private sectors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Her interest was piqued by the factors that contributed to the success of IT project delivery. This led her to undertake a Doctorate of Business Administration in the centre for Project and Programme Management at Cranfield University. But as she began the programme, she notes: 'I found I was moving into the area of governance - and it became even clearer to me than ever that governance is a, if not the, key determinant in project success.</p><p>'There were other important factors like client engagement, the technologies you use, human capital, the skills and so on, but the common thread across everything was governance.'</p><p>As she delved deeper into her research, a particular perspective of effective corporate governance began to form, one which was fundamentally people-centric, which she explains 'empowers your employees to be bigger and better to effect change across the organisation.'</p><p>Today she runs MicroMax Consulting, which under the mission of 'driving growth through intelligent governance,' is looking to advise boards on the implementation of governance as a strategic enabler. As she explains: 'Governance is no longer the back office function that everybody tries to circumnavigate.' It is now front and centre of the business.</p><p>What value do you think governance brings to an organisation?</p><p>My perspective of governance is people-centric. Governance is about empowering people and utilising your human capital. That may seem like a no-brainer, but how do you do it? And how do you engender a culture within the organisation that is not disparate but is actually complementary to the thinking on governance.</p><p>People generally talk about governance in terms of accountability. Particularly the accountability of the board; the rules of engagement around how the board should function. But we need to bring governance and accountability down to the individual - empowering people to give them a greater sense of ownership.</p><p>\"When we tell people to comply, it goes against the natural state of the human brain\"</p><p>One may have a large team, with each team member providing a different role. If we give them a greater awareness and a greater sense of ownership of their role, we are likely to gain a more committed workforce. Then that flows up to the team leader, and then again further up, and that whole thread of accountability - from the bottom to the board level - runs through the organisation.</p><p>This way, people within the organisation do not shy away from challenge and responsibility. Rather, they take more pride in what they do.</p><p>How does your vision of governance mesh with a more conventional understanding?</p><p>When I talk about governance, I steer away from traditional governance, concerning compliance and regulation. This is certainly important, and especially for the highly-regulated industries there is a time and place for it, but it is not a panacea.</p><p>When things go wrong, it is not uncommon to see more regulation being piled on. However, I do not believe that is the answer.</p><p>My notion of governance says: we lighten our controls (but not jettison them), increase oversight, empower people and then put in the appropriate levels of internal and management controls and reporting. We are moving with the digital times, the language is all around negotiating, collaborating, emotional intelligence, empathy. It is more around commitment than compliance.</p><p>When we tell people to comply, it goes against the natural state of the human brain, because in doing so, we are trying to put them in a straitjacket. But when we give people ownership, we gain their commitment. And commitment is a much stronger currency.</p><p>Rather than blinkering our personnel, we need to show them the end result that we are trying to achieve, and then stop there. We allow them to infuse their own creativity and enjoy their jobs.</p><p>When it is crunch time and we need people to come in over the weekends, for example, people will be much more committed to doing so because they are treated well and with respect. We are human beings first and when we put in a domineering style of governance, we begin to dull our capability.</p><p>It should be people first and then the governance follows.</p><p>And what about governance at the board level?</p><p>When we talk about governance at the board level, we need to ensure that the corporate objectives align with our operational activities. Strategic alignment is a given - for an organisation to exist, function and perform, or even outperform its competitors, there must be harmony between strategic intent and governance.</p><p>\"When you have an overly dense process, people do not respond to it.\"</p><p>As I mentioned, corporate governance is all around accountability and ownership, leading the direction of the organisation and demonstrating behaviour. We need board sponsorship on projects. Successful projects are not necessarily those that have the best project managers, but those that have the best support network around them and backing by the board.</p><p>It is all about that cohesion and alignment.</p><p>What we sometimes forget is that we also need a feedback loop, because the projects also inform the overall strategy. If a project is misfiring and not delivering, then you need that information.</p><p>Do you feel governance is too often hamstrung by complex structure and processes to respond as efficiently as possible to challenge?</p><p>Governance by its nature is dense. Within organisations, there is a place for that classic definition of governance. There is a place for controls and a place for process. But what you find is that when you have an overly dense process, people do not respond to it.</p><p>I recall once, when I joined a new organisation, I was going for a committee meeting. One of the team members brought me the documentation to support the meeting and it was a door-stop. And they said, 'oh, but this is just the start. We have more.' The meeting was in half an hour.</p><p>I went to the meeting, listened twice as hard and made it through. And then I came back and told my team to rip up everything. There was too much information and detail, and it was a drag on the business.</p><p>We could now start with a blank sheet that I could use to actually implement my thinking and philosophies. We ended up with a framework that was more around the appropriate levels of internal controls, management controls and greater human oversight, with consistent behaviours across the organisation, rather than copious amounts of paper.</p><p>In the past, governance of IT has often been confined to IT departments and not really been considered by the board. Have you seen a change of perspective on this?</p><p>An organisation may not necessarily be an IT organisation, but more likely than not, IT will be front and centre of the business function. Everyone uses it and it will be pervasive throughout the organisation. We are, after all, living in the digital world.</p><p>In terms of reputational risk, all that needs to happen is for one thing to go wrong and it is on social media within minutes.</p><p>\"With the use of endpoint devices, the boundaries of a company extends to every single device in an individual's home\"</p><p>There is an issue that technological risk still is not as understood or as respected as other areas of risk. But the ground is changing, boards are taking note. We had the Equifax and TalkTalk hacks. There has been ransomware, such as WannaCry, and we think about identity theft and those kinds of problems. Technological risk is a major problem for the individual now and we as individuals take this personal awareness back into the organisation.</p><p>We now have the technology-enabled and agile workforce. With the use of endpoint devices, the boundaries of a company extends to every single device in an individual's home.</p><p>Gone are the days when IT was just about our infrastructure and defending our firewalls. So IT is certainly a concern for the top table.</p><p>And again, the risk, and the defence, is now down to people. The behaviours we engender within the organisation extend outside the boundaries of our firm. Somebody could post something damaging to the company's reputation on Twitter. Or somebody unknowingly unleashes a bug by clicking a link on one computer, automatically cascading it across the entire network. According to statistics, almost 90% of IT breaches are narrowed down to human error.</p><p>IT risk is the individual.</p><p>If our governance engenders a culture of enabling people to think and take ownership for their actions, then that is our first point of security.</p><p>Looking to company boards and directors, do you feel there is a skill shortage in this area?</p><p>To some degree, this area is not yet fully understood by boards because the tide is changing so quickly. The conventional thinker is no longer the mover and shaker. It is the unconventional - the outliers who are challenging the status quo.</p><p>The big tech companies and their founders started with very disruptive ideas and people are welcoming that now. Whereas if we look at the traditional board, that in itself is long past its sell-by-date. Companies are looking to find new talent - and this is why people are welcoming more diversity.</p><p>\"There must be a measure of accountability and responsibility for the views we espouse\"</p><p>When people talk about diversity, everybody think it is just about men versus women or the racial balance, but actually it is diversity of the mind as well.</p><p>You look at top companies, where the predominant trend has been an Oxbridge background or similar. And in essence, that is fine. Those work environments may have some of the biggest and brightest thinkers.</p><p>But the world is a lot bigger than that, and we can benefit from contrasting and complementary thinking. A savvy board chair listens and blends and infuses that diversity of thought together.</p><p>There has to be a validity to the thinking that we bring though and how that is executed and taken onboard within that boardroom. There must be a measure of accountability and responsibility for the views we espouse.</p><p>You also have a keen interest in mentoring. Can you tell me about your work with this and what companies can do to support emerging talent?</p><p>I am passionate about mentoring. When one has been a beneficiary, one should give back, so I do have mentees of my own. In my career, I have had some excellent mentors, and they have come from a diverse mix of backgrounds.</p><p>I have benefitted from their guidance and I have seen how mentoring can help people progress - not just in their careers but also in their personal lives.</p><p>I have not walked my road alone.</p><p>People have seen something in me and taken me under their wing and mentored me to the next position. Now it is incumbent upon me to then pass that on. But not just pass it on, but pass it on and then some, to the next generation of future leaders.</p><p>It is not about a one-way relationship. As with governance, everybody thinks it is a one-way ticket, but it is not. It is a symbiotic relationship. Mentees keep one bright, agile and informed - they keep one cool.</p><p>I was getting ready to give a talk in March this year, and I was putting my slides together for this talk - one of my mentees spent two hours on the phone giving me her suggestions to help jazz up my presentation. At the end, I had a slide deck that I knew was really engaging and to the point.</p><p>Or when I was shooting my corporate video, one of my mentees flew over to help. And she does not hesitate to come to me when she wants advice at work.</p><p>There is a give and a take, and we both grow from it. And the relationship is not just about this point in time. It is one that underpins life. We begin to form life-long friendships - whether on a professional basis or going beyond that to just common interests.</p><p>You recently were listed at number nine on the 2018 Financial Times EMpower list of top US and UK ethnic minority executives. How did you feel about this recognition?</p><p>That was quite a defining moment for me, and I did not really understand the enormity of it until it happened.</p><p>It was only when the embargo on the results was lifted on the press release and I started to see the reaction of people, that I realised it was a really big deal.</p><p>To be ranked, not just number nine overall but as the top tech professional, of course filled me with professional and personal pride as a black woman looking to inspire our future leaders. It made me feel that the things I had done - all the effort, hard work and support I received - had not been done in vain. It is the kind of thing that spurs one on to do bigger and better things.

The watchdog said it feared such an exercise would increase \u201cburdens on to businesses\u201d that were already suffering under Covid-19.</p><p>Intriguingly, it proposed a \u201ccode of conduct\u201d for the likes of Google and Facebook to police their use of data. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-regime-needed-to-take-on-tech-giants\"> A new digital regulator</url> would also force Google to share \u201cclick and query\u201d data with rivals to improve their algorithms and restrict Google\u2019s ability to appear as a default search engine on devices.</p><p>That would all take time to establish though and the CMA is passing the buck here. Damien Geradin, a lawyer who has championed antitrust action against Google, said: \u201cAs it may take several years for the UK government to set up the CMA\u2019s proposed pro-competition regime, this gives ample time to Google to pursue its abusive behaviour.\u201d </p><p>The Internet of (Five) Things</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1.

Broadcasters have been wrong-footed and newspapers strangely marginalised as the fight has beentaken to social mediaand populist buttons pressed wherever they can be found. And voters are weary.As the editor ofOpenDemocracy , Mary Fitzgerald.wrote in the New York Timesrecently:Yet, as with technology,Amara's lawmay apply: the impact of this campaign may be overestimated in the short term and underestimated in the long term. The list of offences has beenwell documented- but so far there seems to be little political price to pay.The Conservativesrebranded their Twitter accountto look like an independent fact checking account during a leaders' debate, tried to ' Google-jack ' the Labour Party's manifesto launch with a fake news site. Theyedited a videoof Labour's Keir Starmer to look as if he couldn't answer a question and doctored another tolook as if senior BBC journalists agreedwith their policies. </p><p>Meanwhile they reneged on talks forBoris Johnson to be interviewedby the BBC's Andrew Neil (as one Toryapparently briefed journalists : 'Better to take the hit for being chicken than undergo that' and refused to appear onChannel 4's climate debate- instead sending Michael Gove and Johnson's father Stanley as surrogates.The Liberal Democrats have been criticised for includingmisleading bar chartsin campaign literature which overstated their position as well as distributing campaign literature designed todeliberately look like independent local newspapers . They have also had todiscipline a staff memberfor faking an email in order to quash a news story they had branded 'irresponsible'.Labour has been less obviously mischievous, but Jeremy Corbyn brandished alleged trade documents that had beenlurking online for weeksas 'leaked proof the Tories want to sell the NHS' andrefusing to answer questionson topics not of their choosing.Tory 'young Turks'The Conservatives brought in a youngdigital team under Isaac Levido , an Australian political campaigner, to use the tactics that worked for Scott Morrison in theAustralian electionearlier this year. Working from what's apparently called 'the pod of power' in Conservative Central Office, they producerapid raw social media content , designed to shock people, arouse emotion, unlock anger, excitement and fear in what's called the 'battle of the thumbs' - a reference to the importance of smartphones and sharing online content. Perhaps, withpublic trust in politicians collapsing , they feel they have nothing to lose. But at the heart of these tactics is a cynical view of the public which cannot sustain a healthy political base in the long term. Meanwhile, trying to find a legitimate middle ground in a polarised world where you are 'either for us or against us', appears to be a mug's game for the broadcasters - which are regulated to beimpartial and accurate . The politically committed - who can regard any scrutiny as partisan - aren't interested in definitions of impartiality. Many would argue it is now irrelevant - hence thecomplaints about false balanceand public calls for broadcasters to 'call out the truth' rather than just present competing arguments. And the BBC has wobbled with someminor editorial errorswhich have been reluctantly acknowledged and jumped on by those searching for signs of bias. Channel 4 has taken a belligerent stance, with its head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne,calling Boris Johnson a 'known liar'at the Edinburgh TV Festival in the summer. The broadcaster also took anunflinching approach to 'empty chairing'the prime minister when he turned down a place at their climate debate. In return thegovernment made menacing noisesabout reviewing the channel's remit. Commendably bold by the broadcaster perhaps, but belligerence should be a last resort - as a former chair of Channel 4 used to say: 'Don't drive at a brick wall, drive round it.' In contrast, the BBC having first stood firm when the prime minister decided not to submit to a forensic cross-examination at the hands of Andrew Neil (unlike other party leaders), then gave way and provided a softer seat onthe Andrew Marr Sunday morning show- arguing they were still trying to persuade him to do the tougher interview as well. Don't hold your breath. It suggested vacillation at a time which called for steadfastness. Broadcasters appear wrongfooted, pushed into unhelpful stances, and newspapers' once strident voices now struggle to be heard in the online cacophony. But beneath the noise and smoke of social media, there has been plenty of good reporting. As the director of BBC News, Fran Unsworth,wrote in The Guardian , for all the criticism of the broadcaster's coverage - some justified, much not - it has continued to provide in-depth interviews with leaders, fact checking, policy analysis and more.It's there if you look for it - and broadcasting is stilltrusted more than print . And through a storm of partisan accusations broadcasters have steered a fair course. So maybe this is all just the melee of a rancorous campaign and, afterwards, calm will return. Maybe. Storing up troubleBut this is where the longer-term consequences come in. There's no question the political parties have sought to undermine the media by pressing populist buttons and disregarding the norms of election campaigns. And our media institutions have struggled to adapt swiftly to the new tactics - to the tone and timescale of digital campaigning and unconventional and disruptive strategies. As a result, they can appear clumsy and leaden-footed.The public broadcasters, like other areas of public life, have been through adifficult decade of austerityfunding where financial efficiency has been placed above public value. Now both the BBC and Channel 4 are likely to emerge from this election having alienated whoever wins. That's not conducive to a strong stable broadcasting environment ready to shoulder the responsibilities we expect of public institutions. The UK's broadcast channels - including ITV, Sky and Channel 5, alongside the BBC and Channel 4 - have been a national success story, holding the country together with moments of common experience, reflecting life across all the nations of the UK. In fragmenting times with populism on the rise, that seems less achievable. Consensus isbreaking downand is being replaced with pervasive scepticism and cynicism. Thegrowing divisionsare not just between Remain and Leave voters, but between urban and rural communities, north and south, rich and poor, the informed and the uninformed, young and old.This is partly driven by economic policy, but more by big technology. Social media has given everyone a voice - including those with little to say - and has lured the media and politicians into a populist strategy of trying to reflect the views of the masses. The big tech platforms have soaked up public attention, broken media business models, invaded our lives and sold our data. They have provided a platform for propaganda and disinformation which would not be allowed in the analogue world and placed their own profits above the public good. With Artificial Intelligence developing rapidly, society's management and understanding of the world of information is likely to fall even further behind. In spite ofthe many callsfor regulation or greater media literacy education, it seems unlikely any new government will have the courage or priorities to take on Facebook and Google. There is, as commentatorAzeem Azharhas described, an accelerating gap between new technologies and institutions' ability to respond. This is reflected in the slow responses, remote tone and a closed approach to managing crises that we see in pubic broadcasters. Although they believe they are adapting to the new digital world, the corporate culture running through them does not change. It's still run by officers and served by infantry. How might this be different for another election in five years' time? The UK needs a more transparent approach to political campaigns. As Sky's editor-at-large Adam Boultonreminded us last weekthere is support for an independent commission to organise future TV debates, similar to the USCommission on Presidential debates . This would mean the democratic imperative of aspiring leaders talking to the public was managed by an independent, transparent and formal process - no longer stitched up in locked room deals and gentlemen's agreements. Andonline political advertisingandparty fundingneed to be openly and transparently regulated and organised. No more foreign oligarchs paying hundreds of thousands for a dinner orgame of tennisand no more targeted Facebook ads with no requirement for truth or accuracy and no visibility beyond the targeted groups. The broadcasters, always competitive, need to collaborate in managing party relations and in managing their relations with the tech behemoths. Going it alone they will be stepped over. They need far greater transparency - explaining their values and judgements, the 'why' as well as the 'what' of their decision making to keep the public onside. And they may need to wean themselves off a secretive lobby system quotingunattributable anonymous sourceswith the latest scuttlebutt. Let's throw the doors open and have on-the-record press briefings in Westminster. Both politics andmedia need greater diversity . As one senior broadcasting executive told me this week: 'It's not enough to invite them to the table - we have to hand the table over to them', by which he meant the young and the ethnically and socially diverse.But of course none of this is likely to happen swiftly. The price of political dirty tricks is low or non-existent. The lure of keeping power behind closed doors is too great. Brexit will dominate public life for at least another five years. But the cynicism of political lies and the fear of losing control by opening up the corridors of power can't last. Either politics and institutions, including the media, adapt rapidly - with transparency, diversity and openness - or the historic social and technological changes we are experiencing will eventually break them.<url normalizedValue=\"https://menafn.com/updates/pr/2019-12/05/TC_6c4a99c5-e_Image_In_Body.png\"/>Click here to subscribe to our newsletter if you believe this election should be all about the facts.<br/>MENAFN0512201901990000ID1099376883</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1099376883</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNP-FYH1-F04Y-T0DK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1739\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 5, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Working from what's apparently called \"the pod of power\" in Conservative Central Office, they produce       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/3ybf1Ieguz6pvTohQBllae\">rapid raw social media content</url>, designed to shock people, arouse emotion, unlock anger, excitement and fear in what's called the \"battle of the thumbs\" - a reference to the importance of smartphones and sharing online content. </p><p>Perhaps, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/trust-politicians-falls-sending-them-spiralling-back-bottom-ipsos-mori-veracity-index\">public trust in politicians collapsing</url>, they feel they have nothing to lose. But at the heart of these tactics is a cynical view of the public which cannot sustain a healthy political base in the long term. </p><p>Meanwhile, trying to find a legitimate middle ground in a polarised world where you are \"either for us or against us\", appears to be a mug's game for the broadcasters - which are regulated to be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv-radio-and-on-demand/broadcast-codes/broadcast-code/section-five-due-impartiality-accuracy\">impartial and accurate</url>. The politically committed - who can regard any scrutiny as partisan - aren't interested in definitions of impartiality. Many would argue it is now irrelevant - hence the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publicmediaalliance.org/the-bbc-and-the-uk-election/\">complaints about false balance</url> and public calls for broadcasters to \"call out the truth\" rather than just present competing arguments. And the BBC has wobbled with some       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/helpandfeedback/corrections_clarifications/\">minor editorial errors</url> which have been reluctantly acknowledged and jumped on by those searching for signs of bias. </p><p>Channel 4 has taken a belligerent stance, with its head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/18/dorothy-byrne-on-calling-boris-johnson-a-liar-nobody-has-said-that-isnt-true\">calling Boris Johnson a \"known liar\"</url> at the Edinburgh TV Festival in the summer. </p><p>The broadcaster also took an <url normalizedValue=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/28/channel-4-will-replace-boris-johnson-ice-sculpture-climate-debate-11235550/\">unflinching approach to \"empty chairing\"</url> the prime minister when he turned down a place at their climate debate. </p><p>In return the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/28/ice-sculpture-to-replace-boris-johnson-in-channel-4-climate-debate\">government made menacing noises</url> about reviewing the channel's remit. Commendably bold by the broadcaster perhaps, but belligerence should be a last resort - as a former chair of Channel 4 used to say: \"Don't drive at a brick wall, drive round it.\" </p><p>In contrast, the BBC having first stood firm when the prime minister decided not to submit to a forensic cross-examination at the hands of Andrew Neil (unlike other party leaders), then gave way and provided a softer seat on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2019-12-01/boris-johnson-to-face-andrew-marr-but-not-andrew-neil/\">the Andrew Marr Sunday morning show</url> - arguing they were still trying to persuade him to do the tougher interview as well. Don't hold your breath. It suggested vacillation at a time which called for steadfastness. </p><p>Broadcasters appear wrongfooted, pushed into unhelpful stances, and newspapers' once strident voices now struggle to be heard in the online cacophony. But beneath the noise and smoke of social media, there has been plenty of good reporting. As the director of BBC News, Fran Unsworth, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/04/bbc-impartiality-precious-protect-election-coverage\">wrote in The Guardian</url>, for all the criticism of the broadcaster's coverage - some justified, much not - it has continued to provide in-depth interviews with leaders, fact checking, policy analysis and more.  </p><p>It's there if you look for it - and broadcasting is still <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bond.org.uk/news/2019/05/how-much-does-the-uk-public-trust-the-media\">trusted more than print</url>. And through a storm of partisan accusations broadcasters have steered a fair course. So maybe this is all just the melee of a rancorous campaign and, afterwards, calm will return. Maybe. </p><h>Storing up trouble</h><p>But this is where the longer-term consequences come in. There's no question the political parties have sought to undermine the media by pressing populist buttons and disregarding the norms of election campaigns. And our media institutions have struggled to adapt swiftly to the new tactics - to the tone and timescale of digital campaigning and unconventional and disruptive strategies. As a result, they can appear clumsy and leaden-footed.</p><p>The public broadcasters, like other areas of public life, have been through a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/22/public-services-face-real-terms-spending-cuts-of-up-to-40-in-decade-to-2020\">difficult decade of austerity</url> funding where financial efficiency has been placed above public value. Now both the BBC and Channel 4 are likely to emerge from this election having alienated whoever wins. That's not conducive to a strong stable broadcasting environment ready to shoulder the responsibilities we expect of public institutions. </p><p>The UK's broadcast channels - including ITV, Sky and Channel 5, alongside the BBC and Channel 4 - have been a national success story, holding the country together with moments of common experience, reflecting life across all the nations of the UK. In fragmenting times with populism on the rise, that seems less achievable. Consensus is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/rsa-blogs/2019/10/brexit-democracy-consensus\">breaking down</url> and is being replaced with pervasive scepticism and cynicism. The       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/assets/divided-britain.pdf\">growing divisions</url> are not just between Remain and Leave voters, but between urban and rural communities, north and south, rich and poor, the informed and the uninformed, young and old.</p><p>This is partly driven by economic policy, but more by big technology. Social media has given everyone a voice - including those with little to say - and has lured the media and politicians into a populist strategy of trying to reflect the views of the masses. The big tech platforms have soaked up public attention, broken media business models, invaded our lives and sold our data. They have provided a platform for propaganda and disinformation which would not be allowed in the analogue world and placed their own profits above the public good. </p><p>With Artificial Intelligence developing rapidly, society's management and understanding of the world of information is likely to fall even further behind. In spite of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/fake-news-report-published-17-19/\">the many calls</url> for regulation or greater media literacy education, it seems unlikely any new government will have the courage or priorities to take on Facebook and Google. </p><p>There is, as commentator <url normalizedValue=\"https://hbr.org/2019/04/podcast-exponential-view\">Azeem Azhar</url> has described, an accelerating gap between new technologies and institutions' ability to respond. This is reflected in the slow responses, remote tone and a closed approach to managing crises that we see in pubic broadcasters. Although they believe they are adapting to the new digital world, the corporate culture running through them does not change.

The price of political dirty tricks is low or non-existent. The lure of keeping power behind closed doors is too great. Brexit will dominate public life for at least another five years. But the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">cynicism</emphasis> of political lies and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">fear</emphasis> of losing control by opening up the corridors of power can't last. Either politics and institutions, including the media, adapt rapidly - with transparency, diversity and openness - or the historic social and technological changes we are experiencing will eventually break them. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Click here to subscribe to our newsletter if you believe this election should be all about the facts.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Sambrook does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONUK-128326</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONUK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XNK-C511-DXP7-10J7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463594</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1866\"/><timeReceived>3:31 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - United Kingdom</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7117\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 5, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

The proposals are part of a world-wide shift towards greater regulation of the online sphere driven by high profile tragedies such as the Christchurch mosque shootings, online threats to democracy, and perceived lack of accountability by dominant tech giants. Though controversial, the proposals are an assertion of governmental control of the online space, hitherto effectively ceded to arguably unwilling and ill-prepared platform providers.</p><p>This article was originally published by The Times on 16/01/20.

The Bank of England is due to announce the reverse gilt auction sizes beyond 6 August and has hinted that the programme will run more or less to the end of the year. This suggests a weekly gilt purchase rate somewhere close to \u00a34bn per week in order to meet the total \u00a3745bn target at that point.</p><p> In trying to gauge the policy stance further ahead, we expect the committee to note that the economy has enjoyed further recovery momentum recently... Welcome though this is, it of course reflects the response to the gradual unwinding of the lockdown. </p><p>What is more critical is how the economy looks towards the end of the year as, for example, the CJRS (furlough scheme) expires. Moreover members will also note the signs of higher coronavirus infection rates on Continental Europe, in the US and to an extent the UK. </p><p>The MPC's assessment of the current indicators will probably be one of guarded optimism, but tempered strongly by the risks facing the economy further ahead. We think there is a strong chance that the committee sanctions a further \u00a375bn- \u00a3100bn of QE in November.</p><p>     The Bank of England, London, Britain, April 14, 2020.

There's likely more of that to come, and with low interest rates dragging on revenues full year profits will not be pretty.</p><p>However, the bank's made progress on cost control despite pausing redundancies during the peak of the crisis, and with the transformation plan expected to pick up pace from here that should soften the blow to the income statement. Meanwhile the suspension of the dividend, while a blow to shareholders, has strengthened the balance sheet.</p><p>Having been confirmed as HSBC's permanent CEO in March, Noel Quinn's update to the bank's medium term financial targets and dividend policy at the full year will make for interesting reading. Low interest rates are a headwind that's here to stay, and a shrinking investment bank makes that more of a challenge.

Confidence rose to its highest since March 2018, with 62% of companies expecting production to be higher one year from now. Only 12% of firms forecast a contraction. Sentiment strengthened across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods industries. </p><p> Manufacturing employment fell for the sixth month running in July, albeit to the least marked extent since March. Where job cuts were registered, it was linked to redundancies, natural wastage and aligning capacity with current output needs. Purchasing activity was raised for the first time since last October, but stocks of inputs and finished products both fell further. Supply-chain disruption continued. Average input prices rose for the eighth month running in July, and at the fastest pace in over a year.

Growth of new orders in fact outpaced production, hinting strongly that August should see further output gains. The order book improvement has also helped restore business confidence about the outlook in July to January's pre-pandemic peak. </p><p>The job numbers remain a major concern, however, especially as the labour market is likely to be key to determining the economy's recovery path. Although the rate of job losses eased to the lowest since March, it remained greater than at any time since 2009, reflecting widespread cost-cutting in many firms where profits have been hit hard by the virus outbreak. Increased unemployment, job insecurity, second waves of virus infections and ongoing social distancing measures will inevitably restrain the recovery.</p><p>block-time published-time 9.26am BST </p><p>Spain, the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy, was the strongest-performing country overall, registering its highest PMI reading for over two years.

On Wall Street, tech stocks lifted the S&amp;P 500 more than 0.7%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq rallied more than 1.7%, with Apple and Facebook hitting all-time highs.</p><p> Gold has hit a new record high: it touched $1,984.66 an ounce in early Asian trade, and is now flat at $1,975.8 an ounce. The WHO said on Friday that in the past 24 hours there were nearly 300,000 new coronavirus cases reported - the largest daily increase on record.</p><p>Lawmakers in the US have yet to reach an agreement on a proposed $1 trillion stimulus package. Republicans and Democrats reportedly made some progress over the weekend.</p><p> The latest Caixin survey of Chinese manufacturing was better than expected at 52.8 for July, while economists were expecting 51.3. The previous reading was 51.2. Any higher reading above 50 indicates faster expansion; any reading below 50 points to contraction.</p><p>In Asia, stock markets were mixed. Japan's Nikkei rallied 2.3% while the Shanghai composite index rose 1.3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.85%. European shares are being called higher, ahead of PMI manufacturing reports across the region.</p><p> The Agenda </p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>8:15am BST: Spain Markit manufacturing PMI for July (forecast: 52)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>8:45am BST: Italy Markit Manufacturing PMI (forecast: 51.2)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>8:50am BST: France Markit Manufacturing PMI final(forecast: 52)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>8:55am BST: Germany Markit Manufacturing PMI final (forecast: 50)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>9am BST: Eurozone Markit Manufacturing PMI final (forecast: 51.1)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>9:30am BST: UK Markit/CIPS Manufacturing PMI final (forecast: 53.6)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>2:45am BST: US Markit Manufacturing PMI final (forecast: 51.3)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>3pm BST: US ISM Manufacturing PMI (forecast: 53.6)</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 7.39am BST</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-64917229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H4-3TK1-F021-64G0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6287\"/><timeReceived>7:35 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

The failings meant the data of some 87 million people was used without their knowledge.</p><p>\"Facebook failed to sufficiently protect the privacy of its users before, during and after the unlawful processing of this data,\" said Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner. \"A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better.\"</p><p>The ICO said a subset of the data was later shared with other organizations, including SCL Group, the parent company of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which counted U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign among its clients. News that the consultancy had used data from tens of millions of Facebook accounts to profile voters ignited a global scandal on data rights.</p><p>The fine amounts to a speck on Facebook's finances. In the second quarter, the company generated revenue at a rate of nearly $100,000 per minute. That means it will take less than seven minutes for Facebook to bring in enough money to pay for the fine.</p><p>But it's the maximum penalty allowed under the law at the time the breach occurred. Had the scandal taken place after new EU data protection rules went into effect this year, the amount would have been far higher - including maximum fines of 17 million pounds or 4 percent of global revenue, whichever is higher. Under that standard, Facebook would have been required to pay at least $1.6 billion, which is 4 percent of its revenue last year.</p><p>The data rules are tougher than the ones in the United States, and a debate is ongoing on how the U.S. should respond. California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video message to a big data privacy conference in Brussels this week that \"we have a lot more work to do\" to safeguard personal data.</p><p>About the U.K. fine, Facebook responded in a statement that it is reviewing the decision.</p><p>\"While we respectfully disagree with some of their findings, we have said before that we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and taken action in 2015. We are grateful that the ICO has acknowledged our full cooperation throughout their investigation.\"</p><p>Facebook also took solace in the fact that the ICO did not definitively assert that U.K. users had their data shared for campaigning. But the commissioner noted in her statement that \"even if Facebook's assertion is correct,\" U.S. residents would have used the site while visiting the U.K.</p><p>EU lawmakers had summoned Zuckerberg in May to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>In their vote on Thursday, they said Facebook should agree to a full audit by Europe's cyber security agency and data protection authority \"to assess data protection and security of users' personal data.\"</p><p>The EU lawmakers also call for new electoral safeguards online, a ban on profiling for electoral purposes and moves to make it easier to recognize paid political advertisements and their financial backers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APSTNE-8ccdf166f5534fe5a52ca6d14e4c0565</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TK4-9VY1-JC65-51HC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"636\"/><timeReceived>5:47 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press State &amp;

The failings meant the data of some 87 million people was used without their knowledge.</p><p>\"Facebook failed to sufficiently protect the privacy of its users before, during and after the unlawful processing of this data,\" said Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner. \"A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better.\"</p><p>The ICO said a subset of the data was later shared with other organizations, including SCL Group, the parent company of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which counted President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign among its clients. News that the consultancy had used data from tens of millions of Facebook accounts to profile voters ignited a global scandal on data rights.</p><p>The fine amounts to a speck on Facebook's finances. In the second quarter, the company generated revenue at a rate of nearly $100,000 per minute. That means it will take less than seven minutes for Facebook to bring in enough money to pay for the fine.</p><p>But it's the maximum penalty allowed under the law at the time the breach occurred. Had the scandal taken place after new EU data protection rules went into effect this year, the amount would have been far higher - including maximum fines of 17 million pounds or 4 percent of global revenue, whichever is higher. Under that standard, Facebook would have been required to pay at least $1.6 billion, which is 4 percent of its revenue last year.</p><p>The data rules are tougher than the ones in the United States, and a debate is ongoing on how the U.S. should respond. California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video message to a big data privacy conference in Brussels this week that \"we have a lot more work to do\" to safeguard personal data.</p><p>About the U.K. fine, Facebook responded in a statement that it is reviewing the decision.</p><p>\"While we respectfully disagree with some of their findings, we have said before that we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and taken action in 2015. We are grateful that the ICO has acknowledged our full cooperation throughout their investigation.\"</p><p>Facebook also took solace in the fact that the ICO did not definitively assert that U.K. users had their data shared for campaigning. But the commissioner noted in her statement that \"even if Facebook's assertion is correct,\" U.S. residents would have used the site while visiting the U.K.</p><p>EU lawmakers had summoned Zuckerberg in May to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>In their vote on Thursday, they said Facebook should agree to a full audit by Europe's cybersecurity agency and data protection authority \"to assess data protection and security of users' personal data.\"</p><p>The EU lawmakers also call for new electoral safeguards online, a ban on profiling for electoral purposes and moves to make it easier to recognize paid political advertisements and their financial backers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p> FILE- In this April 12, 2016, file photo, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talks about the company's 10-year roadmap during the keynote address at the F8 Facebook Developer Conference in San Francisco.

The failings meant the data of some 87 million people was used without their knowledge.</p><p>\"Facebook failed to sufficiently protect the privacy of its users before, during and after the unlawful processing of this data,\" said Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner. \"A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better.\"</p><p>The ICO said a subset of the data was later shared with other organizations, including SCL Group, the parent company of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which counted U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign among its clients. News that the consultancy had used data from tens of millions of Facebook accounts to profile voters ignited a global scandal on data rights.</p><p>The fine amounts to a speck on Facebook's finances. In the second quarter, the company generated revenue at a rate of nearly $100,000 per minute. That means it will take less than seven minutes for Facebook to bring in enough money to pay for the fine.</p><p>But it's the maximum penalty allowed under the law at the time the breach occurred. Had the scandal taken place after new EU data protection rules went into effect this year, the amount would have been far higher - including maximum fines of 17 million pounds or 4 percent of global revenue, whichever is higher. Under that standard, Facebook would have been required to pay at least $1.6 billion, which is 4 percent of its revenue last year.</p><p>The data rules are tougher than the ones in the United States, and a debate is ongoing on how the U.S. should respond. California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video message to a big data privacy conference in Brussels this week that \"we have a lot more work to do\" to safeguard personal data.</p><p>About the U.K. fine, Facebook responded in a statement that it is reviewing the decision.</p><p>\"While we respectfully disagree with some of their findings, we have said before that we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and taken action in 2015. We are grateful that the ICO has acknowledged our full cooperation throughout their investigation.\"</p><p>Facebook also took solace in the fact that the ICO did not definitively assert that U.K. users had their data shared for campaigning. But the commissioner noted in her statement that \"even if Facebook's assertion is correct,\" U.S. residents would have used the site while visiting the U.K.</p><p>EU lawmakers had summoned Zuckerberg in May to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>In their vote on Thursday, they said Facebook should agree to a full audit by Europe's cyber security agency and data protection authority \"to assess data protection and security of users' personal data.\"</p><p>The EU lawmakers also call for new electoral safeguards online, a ban on profiling for electoral purposes and moves to make it easier to recognize paid political advertisements and their financial backers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APNE-8ccdf166f5534fe5a52ca6d14e4c0565</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AP2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TK4-9NK1-DYN6-W4WH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304478</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"636\"/><timeReceived>5:47 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Associated Press</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 25, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

At the same time, European Union lawmakers demanded an audit of Facebook to better understand how it handles information, reinforcing how regulators in the region are taking a tougher stance on data privacy compared with U.S. authorities. Britain's Information Commissioner Office found that between 2007 and 2014, Facebook processed the personal information of users unfairly by giving app developers access to their information without informed consent. </p><p>The failings meant the data of some 87 million people was used without their knowledge. 'Facebook failed to sufficiently protect the privacy of its users before, during and after the unlawful processing of this data,' said Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner. 'A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better.' The ICO said a subset of the data was later shared with other organizations, including SCL Group, the parent company of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which counted U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign among its clients. News that the consultancy had used data from tens of millions of Facebook accounts to profile voters ignited a global scandal on data rights. The fine amounts to a speck on Facebook's finances. In the second quarter, the company generated revenue at a rate of nearly $100,000 per minute. That means it will take less than seven minutes for Facebook to bring in enough money to pay for the fine. But it's the maximum penalty allowed under the law at the time the breach occurred. Had the scandal taken place after new EU data protection rules went into effect this year, the amount would have been far higher   including maximum fines of 17 million pounds or 4 percent of global revenue, whichever is higher. Under that standard, Facebook would have been required to pay at least $1.6 billion, which is 4 percent of its revenue last year. The data rules are tougher than the ones in the United States, and a debate is ongoing on how the U.S. should respond. California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video message to a big data privacy conference in Brussels this week that 'we have a lot more work to do' to safeguard personal data. About the U.K. fine, Facebook responded in a statement that it is reviewing the decision. 'While we respectfully disagree with some of their findings, we have said before that we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and taken action in 2015. We are grateful that the ICO has acknowledged our full cooperation throughout their investigation.' Facebook also took solace in the fact that the ICO did not definitively assert that U.K. users had their data shared for campaigning. But the commissioner noted in her statement that 'even if Facebook's assertion is correct,' U.S. residents would have used the site while visiting the U.K. EU lawmakers had summoned Zuckerberg in May to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal. In their vote on Thursday, they said Facebook should agree to a full audit by Europe's cyber security agency and data protection authority 'to assess data protection and security of users' personal data.' The EU lawmakers also call for new electoral safeguards online, a ban on profiling for electoral purposes and moves to make it easier to recognize paid political advertisements and their financial backers. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10AS1309121540501671358251764500249</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10AS-130912</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TK4-9CY1-DXN1-C1TD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"649\"/><timeReceived>9:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Voice of America</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 25, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The failings meant the data of some 87 million people was used without their knowledge.</p><p>\"Facebook failed to sufficiently protect the privacy of its users before, during and after the unlawful processing of this data,\" said Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner. \"A company of its size and expertise should have known better and it should have done better.\"</p><p>The ICO said a subset of the data was later shared with other organizations, including SCL Group, the parent company of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which counted U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign among its clients. News that the consultancy had used data from tens of millions of Facebook accounts to profile voters ignited a global scandal on data rights.</p><p>The fine amounts to a speck on Facebook's finances. In the second quarter, the company generated revenue at a rate of nearly $100,000 per minute. That means it will take less than seven minutes for Facebook to bring in enough money to pay for the fine.</p><p>But it's the maximum penalty allowed under the law at the time the breach occurred. Had the scandal taken place after new EU data protection rules went into effect this year, the amount would have been far higher - including maximum fines of 17 million pounds or 4 per cent of global revenue, whichever is higher. Under that standard, Facebook would have been required to pay at least $1.6 billion, which is 4 per cent of its revenue last year.</p><p>The data rules are tougher than the ones in the United States, and a debate is ongoing on how the U.S. should respond. California is moving to put in regulations similar to the EU's strict rules by 2020 and other states are mulling more aggressive laws. That's rattled the big tech companies, which are pushing for a federal law that would treat them more leniently.</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a video message to a big data privacy conference in Brussels this week that \"we have a lot more work to do\" to safeguard personal data.</p><p>About the U.K. fine, Facebook responded in a statement that it is reviewing the decision.</p><p>\"While we respectfully disagree with some of their findings, we have said before that we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and taken action in 2015. We are grateful that the ICO has acknowledged our full co-operation throughout their investigation.\"</p><p>Facebook also took solace in the fact that the ICO did not definitively assert that U.K. users had their data shared for campaigning. But the commissioner noted in her statement that \"even if Facebook's assertion is correct,\" U.S. residents would have used the site while visiting the U.K.</p><p>EU lawmakers had summoned Zuckerberg in May to testify about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>In their vote on Thursday, they said Facebook should agree to a full audit by Europe's cyber security agency and data protection authority \"to assess data protection and security of users' personal data.\"</p><p>The EU lawmakers also call for new electoral safeguards online, a ban on profiling for electoral purposes and moves to make it easier to recognize paid political advertisements and their financial backers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-8ccdf166f5534fe5a52ca6d14e4c0565</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TK3-S851-JBVR-30H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"635\"/><timeReceived>01:48 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 25, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Wales</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) Bureau of Competition has established a task force dedicated to monitoring competition in U.S. technology markets and taking enforcement actions as warranted. While the remit of the task force largely overlaps with the FTC's existing enforcement activities, the announcement signals regulators' increasing focus on the industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Tech Task Force, established on February 26, 2019, is a stand-alone division that draws on existing staff  approximately 17 attorneys within the bureau who have experience in various technology markets, including those for online advertising, social networking, mobile operating systems and apps, and platforms. While the staff is not sufficiently robust to investigate or litigate conduct or mergers without assistance, the Task Force will coordinate with other divisions within the FTC as it weighs the need for longer-term changes. Even if it were to include staff from other divisions on its investigation or litigation teams, the number of permanent members limits the number and complexity of the matters it can handle. In announcing the task force, FTC Chairman Joseph J. Simons said that \"it makes sense for us to closely examine technology markets to ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition.\" The task force is led by Patricia Galvan, currently a deputy assistant director of the Mergers III Division, and Krisha Cerilli, currently counsel to the director of the Bureau of Competition.</p><p>The FTC's announcement outlined three areas of focus: anti-competitive conduct, prospective mergers and consummated mergers, all of which already fall within the ambit of the FTC's enforcement activity. The FTC has long investigated conduct by technology companies, like Google and Facebook, and it has challenged a number of tech mergers, including the merger between CDK and Auto/Mate, two providers of dealer management systems for car dealerships, and that of DraftKings and FanDuel, the two largest daily fantasy sports websites. Even mergers that the FTC has declined to challenge have been subjected to significant scrutiny, such as the online real estate database Zillow's acquisition of Trulia. Further, federal enforcers, including the FTC, challenged three consummated tech mergers in 2017, demonstrating that the practice is far from novel.</p><p>Yet populist pressure continues to encourage the FTC to enforce the antitrust laws more aggressively, particularly against the major tech companies. Both sides of the political aisle have called for increased scrutiny of the activities of so-called \"Big Tech.\" Commentators have criticized U.S. antitrust policy as being overly permissive, attributing the \"bigness\" of tech companies to merger enforcement that has been too lax and drawing attention to so-called \"killer acquisitions,\" in which companies acquire nascent companies, purportedly with the goal of heading off a challenge to their market dominance. In March 2019, presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for breaking up a number of the big tech companies, including unwinding consummated mergers to \"promote healthy competition in the market.\"</p><p>Concerns over privacy have likewise led to calls to apply antitrust principles more rigorously to regulate the use of customer data. Recent split decisions among the commissioners along political party lines in Staples/Essendant and Fresenius/NxStage  where Commissioners Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter issued strongly worded dissenting statements  suggest that the Democratic minority will echo these calls for more vigorous enforcement and closely scrutinize the task force's progress.</p><p>There are potential lessons to be learned about what could come next for the Tech Task Force from the 2002 creation of the FTC's Merger Litigation Task Force by Simons, who at the time was the director of the Bureau of Competition. Simons created the task force after the FTC struggled to win a series of challenges to hospital mergers. At the time, the FTC employed retrospective studies to assess its approach to such mergers and used the knowledge gained to hone its method for challenging such mergers. The Merger Litigation Task Force thus \"reinvigorated the [FTC]'s hospital merger review program, and also sharpened the agency's focus on merger enforcement in retail industries, particularly regarding matters involving food, beverages, and supermarkets,\" according to the February 26, 2019, FTC press release announcing the Tech Task Force. Perhaps most interestingly, the Merger Litigation Task Force also led to the creation of Mergers IV, the FTC division dedicated to mergers involving hospitals, consumer goods, supermarkets, funeral homes and retail outlets. While the FTC has made no such announcement, the creation of a permanent technology division is a real possibility.</p><p>Whether the Tech Task Force leads enforcers to impose materially stricter standards on tech companies is far less clear. The FTC shares oversight responsibility with the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ), including in matters involving technology and the digital economy, making the DOJ's approach to tech equally important. DOJ Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Andrew C. Finch has said that he is \"skeptical of the drastic calls for breaking up firms or turning tech platforms into regulated utilities,\" and the DOJ is unlikely to cede tech enforcement to the FTC. Both agencies share jurisdiction over conduct in many tech industries, but the clearance agreement between them allows one agency to take the lead on an investigation. Accordingly, the FTC could be more aggressive on those matters over which it takes the lead. Regardless of what cases the federal agencies would like to bring, they still have to apply the existing legal standards and convince a court to rule in their favor.</p><p>Nevertheless, the task force likely will have an impact in the years to come, as its creation increases the scrutiny of how technology companies conduct their business and negotiate deals, and may result in the FTC staff learning new and more focused methods for evaluating the potential competitive effects of tech conduct and mergers.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Via TruePublica.org,[3] Google is planning to move its British users' accounts out of the control of European Union privacy regulators, placing them under US jurisdiction instead, the company confirmed on 19 February. The shift, prompted by Britain's exit from the EU, will leave the sensitive personal information of tens of millions with less protection and within easier reach of British law enforcement. But it won't end there.    Alphabet Inc's Google intends to require its British users to acknowledge new terms of service including the new jurisdiction. </p><p> 'Nothing about our services or our approach to privacy will change, including how we collect or process data, and how we respond to law enforcement demands for users' information,' Google said in an emailed statement. 'The protections of the UK GDPR will still apply to these users.' If that was true, they would leave it where it was and not go to the expense. This is just the start of much more to come.  Unsurprisingly, a spokesman declined to answer questions.  Mission creep  The British state is the West's worst offender for breaches of privacy, mass surveillance and using its secretive 360-degree architecture of civilian supervision and control. For the government, more surveillance and gathered data is better, not worse. But Google's announcement will be followed by the other big tech firms and digital startups will look upon the UK as an increased opportunity to make money from fewer safeguards.  It was only two months ago that the Times reported that a leading British trade economist had warned thatNHS patient data[4]will be exploited by US technology companies under a trade deal with America. Alan Winters, director of the Trade Policy Observatory at Sussex University, said clauses on data sharing and algorithms that US negotiators want inserted into a deal will be used tocapture the value[5]in NHS patient records, estimated at 10 billion a year.  Last month, it wasreported[6]that the Department ofHealth and Social Care has been selling the medical data of millions of NHS patients to American and other international drugcompanies have misled the public into believing the information would be 'anonymous.'  Then just a few days ago it wasreported[7]that a US healthcare firm (praised by Donald Trump) has been handed millions of taxpayers money to help the NHS identify its most 'expensive' patients. The programme will rank people according to their risk of illness and has rightly sparked fears more could be turned down for operations because of a myriad of factors like age or weight. And, of course, it raises yet more fears the NHS could be on the table in a trade deal despite PM Boris Johnson's claims it is not for sale.  The contract was agreed between NHS England and Optum - which assesses patients for America's privatised insurance-led system. It divides NHS patients into high, medium and low-risk groups and identifies 'rising risk groups' such as those at risk of Type 2 diabetes.  Crimes  Optum is part of the United Healthcare Group who wasfined just last month for defrauding[8]its insured customers. It was also fined $2.5m for 'insurance violations.[9]' So bad is United Healthcare's fine record they have their own 'violations tracker[10]' that shows it has been fined over $200million in 35 cases it lost, just in the USA. Their crimes include false claims, consumer protection violations, price-fixing, insurance fraud, pension violations, employee discrimination to name just a few.  The company is ranked 6th in the 2019Fortune 500.  Anything goes policy  Moving UK users' data to the USA makes bulk surveillance easier, and data protection much harder. The US and UK have an agreement on data, whereby the UK uses the US to use data in such a way as would be illegal in the UK. In addition, it makes it much harder to locate those breaches and then prosecute them.  Jim Killock, Executive Director of Open Rights Group, said:  'Moving people's personal information to the USA makes it easier for mass surveillance programmes to access it. There is nearly no privacy protection for non-US citizens.  'We have no reason to trust a Donald Trump government with information about UK citizens. The possibilities for abuse are enormous, from US immigration programmes through to attempts to politically and racially profile people for alleged extremist links.  'Data protection rights will also become more fragile, and are likely to be attacked in trade agreements pushing 'data flows'.  'Google's decision should worry everyone who think tech companies are too powerful and know too much about us. The UK must commit to European data protection standards, or we are likely to see our rights being swiftly undermined by 'anything goes' US privacy practices.'

Digital Secretary Jeremy Wright was quoted in a British government press release[2] published April 8, 2019, as saying: 'The era of self-regulation for online companies is over. Voluntary actions from industry to tackle online harms have not been applied consistently or gone far enough.'The same press release included the announcement of an Orwellian 'mandatory 'duty of care,'' which 'will require companies to take reasonable steps to keep their users safe and tackle illegal and harmful activity on their services.'The press release at least attempted to soothe free speech advocates' concerns by claiming, \"The UK remains committed to a free, open and secure Internet.' </p><p>It later added that any regulation would 'protect users' rights online, being particularly mindful to not infringe privacy and freedom of expression.\"But as The Jerusalem Post observed about these potential new regulations: 'Foreign companies would be required to appoint a British-based director who would be held personally accountable for any breaches in the duty of care, under new 'senior management liability' rules. Breaches of the rules would result in fines, and could even result in jail time for the company managers.' The paper added that, 'According to The Times, the rules will cover terrorism, child abuse, illegal drug or weapon sales, cyber-bullying, self-harm, harassment, disinformation, violence and pornography.'Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party reportedly pledged to make these policy changes in a recently released manifesto, which read: 'We will legislate to make the UK the safest place in the world to be online   protecting children from online abuse and harms, protecting the most vulnerable from accessing harmful content, and ensuring there is no safe space for terrorists to hide online.' Campaign Against Antisemitism[3] seems assured that its censorious demands will be met, however. This organization which claims to have 'provided antisemitism training to Ofcom's executives,' praised the authoritarian new legislation: 'Campaign Against Antisemitism has long called for tougher regulations on social media sites and that social networks proactively search for and remove hate speech from their platforms. It is reassuring to hear that social media sites will be held responsible for cleaning up their own sites. It is vital that Ofcom ensures that complex hate crime on social media is properly identified and understood, and that antisemitism is carefully monitored.'

Digital Secretary Jeremy Wright was quoted in a British government press release[2] published April 8, 2019, as saying: 'The era of self-regulation for online companies is over. Voluntary actions from industry to tackle online harms have not been applied consistently or gone far enough.'The same press release included the announcement of an Orwellian 'mandatory 'duty of care,'' which 'will require companies to take reasonable steps to keep their users safe and tackle illegal and harmful activity on their services.'The press release at least attempted to soothe free speech advocates' concerns by claiming, \"The UK remains committed to a free, open and secure Internet.' </p><p>It later added that any regulation would 'protect users' rights online, being particularly mindful to not infringe privacy and freedom of expression.\"But as The Jerusalem Post observed about these potential new regulations: 'Foreign companies would be required to appoint a British-based director who would be held personally accountable for any breaches in the duty of care, under new 'senior management liability' rules. Breaches of the rules would result in fines, and could even result in jail time for the company managers.' The paper added that, 'According to The Times, the rules will cover terrorism, child abuse, illegal drug or weapon sales, cyber-bullying, self-harm, harassment, disinformation, violence and pornography.'Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party reportedly pledged to make these policy changes in a recently released manifesto, which read: 'We will legislate to make the UK the safest place in the world to be online \u2014 protecting children from online abuse and harms, protecting the most vulnerable from accessing harmful content, and ensuring there is no safe space for terrorists to hide online.' Campaign Against Antisemitism[3] seems assured that its censorious demands will be met, however. This organization which claims to have 'provided antisemitism training to Ofcom's executives,' praised the authoritarian new legislation: 'Campaign Against Antisemitism has long called for tougher regulations on social media sites and that social networks proactively search for and remove hate speech from their platforms. It is reassuring to hear that social media sites will be held responsible for cleaning up their own sites. It is vital that Ofcom ensures that complex hate crime on social media is properly identified and understood, and that antisemitism is carefully monitored.'

The fourth annual panel discussion, \"Healthcare M&amp;A exits: who's buying, what are they buying and why?\" also discussed trends they are seeing in new technologies entering the healthcare sector, concerns around patient data privacy and the steady rise of incubators and accelerators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Below are the highlights of the discussion, which featured:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Robert G. Shepler, Co-Founder and Co-Managing Partner, Telegraph Hill PartnersAmy Stevens, Executive Vice President of Provider Solutions, AVIA</p><p>Joshua Kaye: Telegraph Hill Partners has had a long, successful track record of healthcare investing. Tell us a little about your investment strategy - what areas are you finding attractive at the moment and why?</p><p>Bob Shepler: Telegraph Hill Partners is a healthcare-only private equity investment firm.  Our current Fund, THP 4, is $255 million in size.  We have a total of $900 million under management.  We will make 10 to 13 investments in a fund, so in a fund size the size of THP 4, we'll look to invest between $10 million and $40 million in a company.  The investment amount does not have to be all at once.  While we are healthcare-only, there are overlays to what we will consider.  One of the most differentiating criteria is that we avoid situations where there is a profile of a binary outcome.  Consequently, we avoid biotech investments.  We are very focused on technology and growing our companies through innovation. And we are maniacal about the business model.  Does the company have a business model that can generate superior operating results on a reasonable amount of capital?  A general description of our investment return profile is three to five times our money in three to six years, with our worst deal getting our money back.</p><p>Joshua Kaye: Do most of your deals have a roll equity component?  Are you partnering with founders or earlier institutional partners?</p><p>Bob Shepler: We are transaction agnostic.  We'll do buyouts from large companies, invest growth capital in founder-led innovative companies and recapitalize mature companies that we think can be reinvented.  We can be flexible in our terms and often have a founder maintain a significant owner stake post a transaction.  While we have co-invested with other institutional investors, we have done less partnering in recent years.  It is harder to quickly make critical business decisions when one has to build consensus with other institutional investors.  In 14 of our last 16 deals, we've been the majority owner post the transaction.</p><p>Joshua Kaye: My understanding is that AVIA partners with health systems to identify and accelerate their adoption of digital healthcare solutions.  What does that mean?  Who is AVIA partnering with?  How does partnering with AVIA truly accelerate healthcare innovation?</p><p>Amy Stevens: We are a member network that is comprised of providers, payers and partners.  Those partners are often in the broader ecosystem of healthcare, and they include organizations from private equity and banks to the American Hospital Association to EMRs.  We have a longitudinal relationship with our members and partners in that we work with them over a period of many years, so we are deep in their strategy shops and their C-suites.  We do the work a little differently - if you think about digital, we have some key issues that make it challenging for your actual buyers.  For investors, you want that health system to make that decision about your solution better, faster and all in.</p><p>So the question is, how do you do that?  When I ran health systems, I knew what my outcomes should look like and what the yield should be.  But in digital, we don't have that - it's new, untested and often creating fundamentally new types of work or services.  In the absence of results data or very early impact data, what you have is professional judgment.  That's where we come in.  We gather together a group of people who would actually be using the systems you are creating so they have the opportunity to put that professional judgment to work against solutions that are already in the market.  This gives us the opportunity to look at capabilities instead of companies.  Our underlying value proposition is that we help our members make a better decision faster and with confidence.</p><p>Joshua Kaye: From a VC fund perspective, we ended 2019 with a blazing hot fourth quarter in which biotech and other healthcare investments rose as much as 33 percent.  Do you see that continuing in 2020? If so, what do you think is driving that perspective?</p><p>Bob Shepler: There are no obvious signs of the investment climate having a serious breakdown any time soon.  The IPO market for therapeutic companies has remained relatively positive and that has driven optimism, but when that market shuts down, that will have a chilling effect on investor confidence.   While we do not directly invest in biotech and pharma companies, we have a number of business-to-business healthcare companies.  The positive funding environment for biotech and pharma, our companies' customers, has been beneficial for our companies as well.  We do not know when the IPO market will start to shut down, but when it does, it will have ripple effects throughout the healthcare market.</p><p>Joshua Kaye: Conventional wisdom has suggested that a winning digital health solution will help health systems or others move the needle on cost, quality and access to care.  But many of us remain mystified by the category of digital health and what that means.  Can you add any further refinement on what areas are truly more attractive in this category, particularly for health systems payers or other strategic players in the industry?</p><p>Amy Stevens: If you're thinking of the health system category, our version of M&amp;A has often been health systems buying other health systems or health systems buying pieces of the healthcare food chain.  We're seeing in that space a trend of failure though.  Some of the biggest deals that have been announced or attempted have not come to fruition and we've seen that in markets across the country.  We've also seen that the actual results of those M&amp;As are not yielding what was expected.</p><p>The M&amp;A world inside of the health system is turning now to ask, What would differentiate us instead of buying each other?  And the answer is radical automation and digitization.  We have to be strong and healthy operationally to survive, particularly against the Big Tech and large non-healthcare disruptors.  Automation and digitization sit at the core of what's going on inside of the larger picture of healthcare and healthcare systems.</p><p>The three areas where we see people applying tech or needing tech are inside growth, like creating a frictionless experience for those that are expected to use your services; care and care delivery, like determining where to send a patient and not just what the treatment should be; and cost - about 60 percent of all expenses inside the health system are on labor.  The US economy has seen that healthcare labor is one of the most driving and consistent labor growth sectors in the US.  Of that 60 percent, about 25 percent is spent on labor burden - those mind-numbing tasks that are perfect for automation so employees can focus valuable time elsewhere.</p><p>Joshua Kaye: How do you decide to invest in a healthcare platform? Can you share other key metrics?</p><p>Bob Shepler: As I mentioned, we avoid binary risk and seek out superior business models.  So when looking at companies, we first scrutinize whether the opportunity passes these two criteria.  This approach has real-world consequences as to what we will and will not invest in.  It's easiest to tell you what we avoid: biotech or pharma companies, early-stage companies, single-product medical device companies, pre-commercial biomarker discovery companies.  We also do not invest in facility-related companies.  We used to say we would not invest in startups, but as the prices of so many deals skyrocketed, we've done a few, but only after we were convinced there would not be a binary outcome.</p><p>What does this leave?  A lot.  At the highest level, if the company is in healthcare, has a technology focus, has commercial operations and a superior business model, it falls in our bailiwick.  The company does not have to be profitable, but it must have a business model that will allow it to get profitable in a reasonable period of time.  Fertile areas for us: research tools companies where there is a spectrum of analytics including hardware, software and chemistries; diagnostics where there is a platform technology that can be applied across a portfolio of tests; medical devices where there is already an approved product with a roadmap for future approvals; and contract manufacturers.  Healthcare IT is another area where we invest.  After assessment of the risk factor and business model, we focus on the targeted market, the technology, IP and the quality of the people involved.  We also focus on the deal terms.  Once we have a decent handle on these issues, we analyze the return profile to determine if it fits our targets.</p><p>Joshua Kaye: How often does a VC fund break up a C-suite or replace individuals?</p><p>Bob Shepler: If we are attracted to a company, our perspective is that the founder and management team members are the ones responsible for developing this exciting company.  Consequently, we seldom replace a management team.  We generally look at the team's experience and functionality.  It's much more about continuing to build the team and designing the organization moving forward.  Sometimes a founder will want to step down, but in that case, we'll ask him or her to help us find their replacement.</p><p>Joshua Kaye: Some would say that health systems continue to be widely underinvesting in such solutions, and their capital commitments pale in comparison to the VC space or what they're willing to potentially pay.  How does a health systems approach to evaluating an investment in a solution differ from the traditional venture capital?</p><p>Amy Stevens: Health systems are extremely invested in any solution they deploy because they ultimately are responsible for the end results (e.g., did a patient get better care? was administrative labor reduced?). But when you think of the question in terms of just financial capital, health systems are very used to investing in the market; they're just newer at financial investing in specific care and digital solutions. In many cases, health systems cannot close their annual gap to profitability off through their services business (billing for patient services). Their gap is closed by millions coming back from treasury investments.</p><p>Joshua Kaye: What are some of the key differences between incubators and accelerators and how does an entrepreneur identify or best pursue one that might be a better fit?</p><p>Amy Stevens: We are the lucky recipients of incubators and accelerators.  The AVIA network by design looks for solutions that are mature enough and that have at least a couple good proof points of live use out in market.  We represent 50 of the largest and most forward-thinking health systems that are willing to try digital solutions in ways that others aren't, but they also aren't willing to turn over the health and safety of their patients or their providers to solutions that are truly not proven.</p><p>Incubators tend to be in the idea stage and looking for shared resources - a physical place to show up, coaches, a maker lab, people who can pressure test your idea and help you find an ecosystem to build it.  Accelerators already have a use-case established, some level of a business model, some level of a team, $1 million to $5 million already booked and an established senior management team for at least two years.  And only two percent of those coming out of an incubator get into an accelerator.</p><p>Joshua Kaye: When thinking about a meeting between the executive team and an investment group, what are some missteps you've seen entrepreneurs make that have caused you to shy away?</p><p>Bob Shepler: You only get one chance to make a first impression.  Your goal in the pitch meeting is to leave the investor excited enough to do more work after the meeting.  So structuring the pitch presentation to achieve this end is critical.  In terms of how to think about the process, at a macro level, you need to do a good job of education; you need to address why the investment return profile is outsized; but you also you need to address why the risk profile of the investment is manageable.  This last point is made in maybe two percent of the pitch meetings and decks we see.  All professions have paradigms, and a fundamental one in investing is risk and return.  Ask yourself the question: why should any firm turn over $10 million to $40 million to me as steward of this capital?  My quick list of points that should be addressed in a pitch book and during a meeting are: Who are you?  What is the background of the key managers?  How did you/the company get to this point?  What is the history?  Give a realistic discussion of the market and what would be available to the company over its next one to five years.  Review the company's products, their technological advantages and the value/pricing paradigm.  Demonstrate there are no significant technological challenges left (avoiding the binary outcome) or review why the challenges left are not insurmountable.  What are the growth opportunities and who are the targeted customers?  What are the regulatory considerations?  Discuss the organization - current and how the organization should be built out and why.  Review key milestones that will create value.  Assess the competitive landscape.  Provide an IP summary.  Discuss the business model and provide a one-year relatively detailed projection as well as a summary three-to-five-year projection.  Provide a financing history and ownership profile.  Finally, indicate the current state of and schedule for the financing process.</p><p>Joshua Kaye: In this courtship, it's obviously a binary relationship.  While capital is often viewed as the great equalizer, not all investors are created equally.  What are a few criteria an entrepreneur may want to consider in determining the right partner or investor?</p><p>Bob Shepler: I'd suggest there is a fundamental question to ask before trying to figure out the right VC fund, and that is: is venture funding the right thing for you and your company?  In many cases I think the answer is no. So many entrepreneurs invent technologies that will not translate to becoming a VC-backed company having the best outcome for the entrepreneur. I see so many presentations on interesting technologies where the entrepreneur would be best served by avoiding venture capital and finding an alternative way to prove out the technology on a smaller amount of capital so that an exit does not have to be heroic amount to provide a worthwhile return for the entrepreneur.  But if venture capital is the right route, high integrity is the most important criteria to find in an investment partner.   Experience is next; experience in your sector, experience in building companies that are successful, experience as a successful investor.  Having the right chemistry with the investment firm's partners is so important.  To help figure all this out, make reference calls to portfolio company CEO's to get to the heart of what the VC will be like after an investment is made.  CEOs of companies that have been sold or failed are the richest sources of information.  One caveat: most early stage VCs have highly technical backgrounds.  This is essential for sorting out the next big thing.  Having someone with technical insight and money express enthusiasm for your technology is an exciting proposition.  The question is, once the investment has been made, is this person and firm any good at the myriad of things that leads to the creation of a valuable company?</p><p>Joshua Kaye: One of the trends we've been hearing about over the last few years is a shift from volume-based to value-based care.  Although it hasn't seen much success, do you still expect this trend to continue?</p><p>Amy Stevens: All money is at risk.  And with value-based care, some money is at risk.  How do you take your operations and fundamentally change them so you have a tight, automated set of services that you're providing, that can give you the best yield, no matter what your payer source is?  We would not want to be making decisions for patients based on risk.</p><p>So because now every dollar is at risk, every portion of the organization needs to be tighter and more efficient.  Health systems also need quality, productivity and satisfaction gain.</p><p>To achieve this, digital needs to become an asset.  Health systems are inefficient operations and the conversion to automation is the only solution left.</p><p>Joshua Kaye: From a health systems perspective, is there a control over patient data outside the hospital?</p><p>Amy Stevens: We are sitting on one of the richest data sets in the world.  We know not just about you, but we know about your next of kin.  We know about your propensity for disease, but we don't know enough about your social determinants of health.  There are new ways of collecting data where we can look for requests for housing and food and know if that request was filled.</p><p>When considering how many nights you've spent in a hospital in comparison to the number of nights you sleep in your home, most of your health data is happening outside the hospital and outside the walls of your caregiver.  There are ways to collect that data now so we can be much more predictive, like looking at your grocery receipts and your cell phone usage to assess any underlying health issues.</p><p>We can also use data, for instance, to help those with a substance use disorder.  Data can predict where you are going to go for your fix and a digital solution can send an electronic ping to a safety net to say, Please let them know you are in trouble.</p><p>Joshua Kaye: With tech giants stepping in with digital health solutions, will the health system ultimately become archaic?  If so, how is that influencing venture capital funds?</p><p>Bob Shepler: I reflect back on an innovation conference I went to 15 years ago.  One of the tracks had the heads of three premier information technology companies.  They made grand projections about what each of their firms was going to do in the healthcare space and how it was going to change healthcare.  The pain points they identified and the proposed solutions made a lot of sense.  But if you compare what they said to what they have actually achieved in the following decade and a half, they have not achieved all that much.  Changing healthcare is just very slow-going.  In regards to what prominent technology companies are saying, it doesn't affect how we are investing at all.  That's not to say they won't make an impact, but we don't think the impact will fall within the investment cycle of our current fund.</p><p>Joshua Kaye: From a digital health solution entrepreneur perspective, is this simply the concern around privacy of patient data?  Or will the convenience of these technologies ultimately make their way into the health systems and replace the smaller digital entrepreneurs?</p><p>Amy Stevens: We see that health systems are cautiously watching what's happening within the big tech side of things. We also see that they aren't thinking of them as direct competitors, but rather stepping back and saying, We just fundamentally are not going to look the same.</p><p>We won't have some of the same assets they have now, nor will we ever. Instead, how do we restructure healthcare going forward?  Health systems are looking for ways to reduce the time it takes to schedule an appointment from 96 hours to 24 hours. But if online shopping followed that same timeline, consumers would go nuts.  So the expectation that big tech is putting on health systems is starting to create pressure.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.
