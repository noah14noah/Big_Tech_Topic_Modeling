The good news is that the threat of biased AI and Orwellian surveillance systems no longer hangs over our collective heads like an artificial Sword of Damocles. The bad news: the threat's gone because it's become our reality. Welcome to 1984.</p><p><br/>\u00a0The annual report from AI Now is a deep-dive into the industry conducted by the AI Now Institute at New York University.

A lack of regulation and ethical oversight has lead to a near total surveillance state in the US. And the use of black box systems throughout the judiciary and financial systems has proliferated even though such AI has been proven to be inherently biased.<br/>AI Now notes that these entities saw a significant amount of push-back from activist groups and pundits, but also points out that this has done relatively little to stem the flow of harmful AI:<br/>Despite growing public concern and regulatory action, the roll-out of facial recognition and other risky AI technologies has barely slowed down. So-called \"smart city\" projects around the world are consolidating power over civic life in the hands of for-profit technology companies, putting them in charge of managing critical resources and information.<br/>For example, Google's Sidewalk Labs project even promoted the creation of a Google-managed citizen credit score as part of its plan for public-private partnerships like Sidewalk Toronto. And Amazon heavily marketed its Ring, an AI-enabled home-surveillance video camera. The company partnered with over 700 police departments, using police as salespeople to convince residents to buy the system. In exchange, law enforcement was granted easier access to Ring surveillance footage.<br/>Meanwhile, companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are fighting to be first in line for massive government contracts to grow the use of AI for tracking and surveillance of refugees and residents, along with the proliferation of biometric identity systems, contributing to the overall surveillance infrastructure run by private tech companies and made available to governments.<br/>The report also gets into \"affect recognition\" AI, a subset of facial recognition that's made its way into schools and businesses around the world. Companies use it during job interviews to, supposedly, tell if an applicant is being truthful and on production floors to determine who is being productive and attentive. It's a bunch of crap though, as a recent comprehensive review of research from multiple teams concluded.<br/>Per the AI Now 2019 report:<br/>Critics also noted the similarities between the logic of affect recognition, in which personal worth and character are supposedly discernible from physical characteristics, and discredited race science and physiognomy, which was used to claim that biological differences justified social inequality. Yet in spite of this, AI-enabled affect recognition continues to be deployed at scale across environments from classrooms to job interviews, informing sensitive determinations about who is \"productive\" or who is a \"good worker,\" often without people's knowledge.<br/>At this point, it seems any company that develops or deploys AI technology that can be used to discriminate - especially black box technology that claims to understand what a person is thinking or feeling - is willfully investing in discrimination. We're long past the time that corporations and governments can feign ignorance on the matter.<br/>This is especially true when it comes to surveillance. In the US, like China, we're now under constant public and private surveillance. Cameras record our every move in public at work, in our schools, and in our own neighborhoods. And, worst of all, not only did the government use our tax dollars to pay for all of it,\u00a0millions of us unwittingly purchased, mounted, and maintained the surveillance gear ourselves. AI Now wrote:<br/>Amazon exemplified this new wave of commercial surveillance tech with Ring, a smart-security-device company acquired by Amazon in 2018. The central product is its video doorbell, which allows Ring users to see, talk to, and record those who come to their doorsteps. This is paired with a neighborhood watch app called \"Neighbors,\" which allows users to post instances of crime or safety issues in their community and comment with additional information, including photos and videos<br/>A series of reports reveals that Amazon had negotiated Ring video-sharing partnerships with more than 700 police departments across the US. Partnerships give police a direct portal through which to request videos from Ring users in the event of a nearby crime investigation.<br/>Not only is Amazon encouraging police departments to use and market Ring products by providing discounts, but it also coaches police on how to successfully request surveillance footage from Neighbors through their special portal. As Chris Gilliard, a professor who studies digital redlining and discriminatory practices, comments: \"Amazon is essentially coaching police on . . . how to do their jobs, and . . . how to promote Ring products.<br/>The big concern here is that the entrenchment of these surveillance systems could become so deep that the law enforcement community would treat their extrication the same as if we were trying to disarm them.<br/>Here's why: In the US, cops are supposed to get a warrant to invade our privacy if they suspect criminal activity. But they don't need one to use Amazon's Neighbors app or Palantir's horrifying LEO app.\u00a0 With these,\u00a0Police can essentially\u00a0perform digital stop-and-frisks on any person they come into contact with using AI-powered tools.<br/>AI Now warns that these problems - biased AI, discriminatory facial recognition systems, and AI-powered surveillance - cannot be solved by patching systems or tweaking algorithms. We can't \"version 2.0\" our way out of this mess.<br/>In the US, we'll continue our descent into this Orwellian nightmare as long as we continue to vote for politicians that support the surveillance state, discriminatory black-box AI systems, and the Wild West atmosphere that big tech exists in today.<br/>Amazon and Palantir shouldn't have the ultimate decision over how much privacy we're entitled to.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITNEXT-M-409636</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITNEXT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRX-16N1-DYDW-71KY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410719</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1392\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>IT Next</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 16, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Analysing medical images is a natural fit for \"deep learning\", an artificial-intelligence (AI) technique which first attracted attention for its ability to teach computers to recognise objects in pictures. A variety of companies hope that bringing AI into the clinic will make diagnosis faster and cheaper. The machines may even be able to see nuances that humans cannot, assessing how risky a patient's cancer is simply by looking at a scan. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some AI researchers think that human beings can be dispensed with entirely. \"It's quite obvious that we should stop training radiologists,\" said Geoffrey Hinton, an AI luminary, in 2016. In November Andrew Ng, another superstar researcher, when discussing AI's ability to diagnose pneumonia from chest X-rays, wondered whether \"radiologists should be worried about their jobs\". Given how widely applicable machine learning seems to be, such pronouncements are bound to alarm white-collar workers, from engineers to lawyers. </p><p>In fact the application of AI to medicine suggests that the story is more complicated. Machine learning will indeed change many fields, allowing the rapid analysis of enormous piles of data to uncover insights that people might overlook. But it is not about to make humans redundant. And radiology, the very field that is used as a cautionary tale about the robopocalypse, shows why.</p><p>One is the nature of AI itself. The field is suffused with hype. Some papers show artificial radiologists outperforming the ones in white coats (see Science section). Others, though, still put the humans ahead. The machines may eventually take an unambiguous lead. But it is important to remember that AI, for the foreseeable future, will remain \"narrow\", not general. No human is as good at mental arithmetic as a $10 pocket calculator, but that is all the calculator can do. Deep learning is broader. It is a pattern-recognition technique, and patterns are everywhere in nature. But in the end it, too, is limited\u2014a sort of electronic idiot-savant which excels at one particular mental task but is baffled by others. Instead of wondering whether AI can replace a job, it is better to ponder whether it could replace humans at a specific task.</p><p>That leads to a second reason for optimism: the nature of work. Most jobs involve many tasks, even if that is not always obvious to outsiders. Spreadsheets have yet to send the accountants to the dole queue, because there is more to accountancy than making columns of figures add up. Radiologists analyse a lot of images. But they also decide which images should be taken, confer on tricky diagnoses, discuss treatment plans with their patients, translate the conclusions of the research literature into the messy business of real-life practice, and so on. Handing one of those tasks to a computerised helper leaves radiologists not with a redundancy cheque, but with more time to focus on other parts of their jobs\u2014often the rewarding ones.</p><p>A third reason for optimism is that automation should also encourage demand. Even in the rich world, radiology is expensive. If machines can make it more efficient, then the price should come down, allowing its benefits to be spread more widely and opening up entire new applications for medical imaging. In the Industrial Revolution the number of weavers rose as the work became more automated. Improved efficiency led to higher production, lower prices and thus more demand for the tasks that the machines could not perform. Medicine itself provides a more recent example. \"Expert systems\" were the exciting new AI technology of the 1970s and 1980s. They eventually made their way into hospitals as, for instance, automated diagnostic aids. That has been a boon, letting nurses\u2014or even patients\u2014undertake procedures that might previously have required a doctor. </p><p>No one knows how sweeping the long-term effects of AI on employment will be. But experience suggests that technological change takes longer than people think. Factory-owners took decades to exploit the full advantages of electricity over steam. Even now, the computer revolution in the office remains unfinished. Big tech firms such as Google, Facebook and Alibaba have the resources and the in-house expertise to begin making use of AI rapidly. Most other companies will proceed more slowly, especially in tightly regulated areas like medicine. If you happen to be training for a career in radiology\u2014or anything else that cannot be broken down into a few easily automated steps\u2014it is probably safe to carry on. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-7L791KD</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SH5-48D1-JBKN-B197-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"782\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

New York's Major\u00a0Bill DeBlasio\u00a0has come to a peaceful, short-term deal[1] with Uber that has seen the city drop plans to cap the number of Uber drivers pending a four-month traffic study.So. Much. </p><p>Tech.Some of the biggest names in tech are coming to TNW Conference in Amsterdam this May.But Airbnb's situation is still up in the air[2] as the Mayor struggles to decide if and how to regulate those people who are using Airbnb to create hotel businesses - and driving up rents for normal New Yorkers in the process. Now the most powerful names in tech, including Uber, Airbnb, Facebook, Google, eBay, Medium and Snapchat, have all put their cash[3] into a new lobbying group in the city that will be chaired\u00a0by\u00a0leading VC Fred Wilson. Tech:NYC[4]\u00a0is a\u00a0nonprofit, membership group that builds on the work of other organizations\u00a0like\u00a0NY Tech Meetup and the Partnership for New York City to support the growth of the now two-decades-old tech sector. It will, of course 'advocate for policies that will attract tech talent, jobs and opportunity to NYC'\u00a0that:underscore a regulatory environment that supports the growth of technology companies and technology talent in NYC promote inclusivity ensure access for all New Yorkers to connectivity, technology tools, and trainingThe team is no doubt keeping an eye out[5] for New York's first unicorn and so the organization is free to join for startups with fewer than 20 people. Its\u00a0new executive director in charge of day-to-day ops is Julie Samuels[6], someone who\u00a0cut her teeth as an attorney with the Electronic Frontiers Foundation[7] and recently\u00a0asked that the 2016 presidential candidates[8]\u00a0answer the big questions tech demands. Most notably perhaps: WTF do any of the candidates think about tech? Her\u00a0last job was as executive director at nonprofit Engine[9],\u00a0which advocates for startups in San Francisco and\u00a0has\u00a0produced a range of reports that cite[10]\u00a0tech as the golden goose for job creation. In a recent TechCrunch post, Samuels\u00a0claimed[11]\u00a0each new tech job is responsible for creating 4.3 local non-tech roles. As well as ongoing regulatory challenges, Mayor DeBlasio's administration has been criticized[12] for failing\u00a0to offer any real additional support to the tech sector following that of former Mayor Bloomberg.\u00a0Its efforts to engage the wider population through civic tech projects - including a proposed legislative voting platform - have also fallen pretty short. Given that many of Tech:NYC's members are embroiled in big questions of their own about their power over global markets, policymakers here might hope\u00a0the regulatory environment it seeks to promote isn't one that simply signs big checks over to the tech industry no questions asked. But with job and wealth creation key metrics with voters, the tech industry is an increasingly hard one to say no to, and Tech:NYC represents a new and strong voice that'll be hard to ignore.

For the past few months there has been an acceleration of updates from Airbnb. Many of the messages focus on how big-hearted the home-sharing company is. But Airbnb is likely to prove a blockbuster listing this year because it makes money, not because it\u2019s nice. </p><p>As a user, there is a lot to like about Airbnb. Homeowners earn spare cash by renting out their rooms. Guests have somewhere more interesting to stay than an anonymous hotel. The platform is easy to navigate. Meanwhile, its system of mutual feedback between renters and rentees help keeps things civil. </p><p>Co-founder and boss Brian Chesky inspires confidence, too. Unlike Travis Kalanick, the pugnacious founder of Uber, or WeWork\u2019s bombastic co-founder Adam Neumann, the 38-year-old appears to be remarkably level-headed. It is also good for a company to recognise the irresponsibility of pursuing profit at the expense of society. </p><p>But what sets Airbnb apart is the fact that it does not bleed billions of dollars. For the past two years it has not raised any new cash. Valued at $31bn at its latest funding round in 2017, its decision to go public seems fuelled by the expiration of stock options given to early employees, not the need for fresh capital. Airbnb is reportedly considering a direct listing, a low key way to join markets where no new shares are sold but existing investors can sell their stock.</p><p>After last year\u2019s disappointing run of initial public offerings, all this should come as a relief. No one wants to be responsible for another WeWork-style flop. Like many big tech start-ups, Airbnb has remained private for over a decade. Unlike them, it says it makes money. The company claims that it was profitable on an ebitda basis \u2014 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation \u2014 in both 2017 and 2018. </p><p>That is why a recent report in the Wall Street Journal that the company lost money in 2019 created such a jolt. The sum was not large compared with the billion dollar quarterly losses of online taxi company Uber. Nevertheless, Airbnb\u2019s $322m loss in the first nine months of the year, after a profit of $200m the previous year, is unnerving. </p><p>As a private company, Airbnb does not have to report financial details. There is no way of knowing what adjustments Airbnb makes for its ebitda figures, or what caused losses last year.</p><p>But it is an asset-light company that facilitates short-term rentals of places that it does not own, making money by charging a fee on both sides. A sudden uptick in costs looks odd. </p><p>The crucial question is what sort of costs these were. Spending money on updating the platform or marketing may be one-off charges. Taking more responsibility for properties will not.</p><p>The brand is so well-known that users tend to refer to the places they stay as \u201cAirbnbs\u201d. But the company has always emphasised that it is just a platform and therefore should not be responsible for the quality of listings, or for jobs such as collecting occupancy taxes or ensuring rooms comply with local regulations. </p><p>Continuing fights with city officials and reports of scam listings have changed that. Airbnb collects taxes in some jurisdictions. Now it plans to verify all of its listings. But oversight means higher costs, even if most verification will be done online. The world\u2019s largest hotel chain, Marriott International, has 1.4m rooms. Airbnb lists 7m properties. </p><p>Airbnb must also grapple with the spread of the coronavirus on the global tourism industry. New revenue lines would help balance rising costs. But so far these have been slower to take off than the core business. Tourist activities are less popular than accommodation rental. Airbnb bought hotel booking app HotelTonight last year and could add more rooms. But that may undermine what it considers its \u201cauthenticity\u201d as a different sort of travel site.</p><p>Airbnb will keep sending notifications about guest standards and other ways to \u201cbuild trust\u201d as it prepares to go public. But the cost of that extra oversight is the information to look out for. Responsibility is admirable. But profitability is Airbnb\u2019s best chance of becoming the big name tech listing that does not sink. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-d84fa41856f611eaabe58e03987b7b20</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y91-BDX1-JB77-K17R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"728\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 25, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDI0M0I0QjVFQjkwNDdCMzgwQUIyNTU4RUE4NTkyQUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjRFNjIwMDZBQ0FBNDdBRkFGRTMxMkE0RUNGMEVEMkQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTc0QzJDRUM0OTI1NDkyQTgyQzExM0RFMDAwRTAzOEI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUE2N0VFNDM5OUY4NENCQjlDQjQ1NjdGMkU4NkFFREQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;

AirBnB is responsible for increases in housing costs in many communities, as well as abuses of state and local laws. I'm not at all a fan of them as a business proposition. This post suggests a way to provide for AirBnB's supposed original intent, the occasional renting of spare rooms, without the profiteering By James Muldoon, a lecturer in political science at the University of Exeter. </p><p>Originally published at openDemocracy[1] So far 2020 has not been a good year for AirBnB. The company has missed its chance for an initial public offering (IPO) and racked up millions in losses - including a $250m payout to landlords for reservations cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. In a bid to save $800m, the company has suspended all its marketing activity for 2020 and given executives a 50% pay cut. After a spectacular rise, things now look uncertain for AirBnB and its global dominance over short-term rentals. Landlords are leaving it in droves following the 'AirBnBApocalypse[2]' and are putting their houses back in the long-term rental market to salvage their losses. The entire industry faces a devastating impact from the coronavirus pandemic due to knock-on effects of cancelled travel, events and conferences. AirBnB will eventually re-emerge, but it will no doubt be rattled by this experience and see a significant amount knocked off its market value. Previous attempts to regulate AirBnB have proved ineffective due to the company's deep pockets, lobbying power and willingness to fight regulations in courts across the world. The coronavirus has been the only force so far that has been capable of preventing the company's continual expansion. While it is temporarily halted, it's time we acknowledged that it is a threat to affordable housing and should be replaced by a democratically controlled alternative. AirBnB began with a feel-good story that captures the myth of the 'sharing' economy. A couple of friends rented out an air-mattress and decided to expand with the mission of helping families share their homes, make some extra money and meet new people along the way. In 2020, the reality is that more than half[3] of AirBnBlistings in London are entire homes, displacing resident Londoners, and almost half are hosts with multiple listings. The rapid expansion of AirBnB's extractive business model has gone hand in hand with a global covert war on attempts to tax and regulate it. The main beneficiaries of the business are venture capitalists and predatory landlords who run small rental empires, depriving locals of desperately-needed homes. But how did AirBnBbecame such a threat to local communities? And are there alternatives to the profit-driven models of platform capitalists that can keep wealth circulating within communities, and create a digital future owned by all? AirBnB's rise Scrolling through job advertisements you might be surprised to find the following: 'AirBnB seeks community organizers to organize and advocate for home sharing in cities throughout the United States and abroad.' The corporate giant, which currently hosts over 7 million listings in more than 100,000 cities across 220 countries and regions, still likes to depict itself as a grassroots community-led organisation. But the idea of AirBnB as a community of like-minded individuals interested in home sharing is little more than marketing spin. Its valuation of $31 billion dollars in 2017 would have placed it in the top 100 nation states in terms of GDP. It has a sophisticated communications plan to maintain its image as a pioneer of the 'sharing economy' while keeping its many litigations and disputes with authorities out of the news. This strategy has become increasingly difficult as it has continued to expand, with a growing collection of scientific studies and news reports casting doubt over its noble intentions and positive impact on local communities. Analysis conducted by the Economic Policy Institute[4], a non-partisan American think tank, reported that the economic costs of AirBnB to local communities likely outweighed the benefits. Research from the Harvard Business Review[5] found that AirBnB is negatively affecting the housing stock across the US due to the incentive for landlords to take properties out of the long-term rental market and turn them into profitable short-term rentals. A recent Guardian report[6] also found that AirBnBis threatening affordable housing across the UK. AirBnB rentals have become so prevalent in some parts of the country that there is up to one listing for every four properties, prompting calls[7] for increased government regulation and for a 90-day cap on all homes let on the platform. In 2018, AirBnB reached a landmark: they reported $200 million profit for the year and seemed poised for a successful public listing. But in the first nine months of 2019 AirBnB recorded a $322 million net loss, with the coronavirus now threatening to push its initial public offering date[8] back to 2021. As their public listing approaches, everything is on the line. Investors are already weary following the poor performance of other platform companies such as Uber Technologies Inc., Lyft Inc. and We Co. The fear is that further troubles could jeopardise their attempt to go public. At this crucial moment AirBnB is doing everything it can to assure investors that future regulations won't limit their profitability and maintain its positive image with the general public. AirBnB's Undercover War on Cities 'Read my lips: We want to pay taxes,' declared Chris Lehane, AirBnB's global head of public policy, in 2016. But despite their many public statements about partnering with cities and working with local communities, AirBnB has been one of the most litigious startups in Silicon Valley, fighting cities across the world in an attempt to avoid regulations. Since launching in 2008, AirBnB has been involved in at least 11 lawsuits[9] against local and state authorities in America, with legal action taken against Boston, Palm Beach County, Miami Beach and New York in the past two years. They have used their deep pockets in a protracted campaign to undermine regulators across the US. Officials at Palm Beach County, Florida have been attempting to force AirBnB to collect and pay the county's 6% occupancy tax[10] on visits since 2014. Three law suits later and millions of unpaid taxes still remain outstanding. 'We knew we were going to get sued,' Palm Beach County tax collector Anne Gannon reported to Wired[11] last year. 'That's what they do all over the country. It's their mode of operation.' In a joint letter[12] written in 2018, Amsterdam, Barcelona, \u200b\u200bBerlin, Bordeaux, Brussels, Krakow, Munich, Paris, Valencia and Vienna pleaded for the EU to more effectively regulate holiday rental website like AirBnB, claiming they were reducing the stock of long-term housing and adversely affecting neighbourhoods. Airbnb have ramped up lobbying efforts of EU institutions, spending millions in efforts to achieve less onerous regulations, according to a Corporate Europe Observatory report[13]. One of the primary threats to AirBnB's business model is enforceable caps on property rentals. Cities such as Amsterdam, London, Paris, Tokyo and San Francisco all have caps from between 60 to 120 days a year. Candidates in Paris' upcoming mayoral elections have suggested reducing their cap to as low as 30 night per year. Fears of the success of such a move have prompted AirBnB to demand[14] 'a single European oversight body for digital services,' which they could lobby instead of fighting battles against multiple cities. Airbnb recently won a legal battle in the Court of Justice of the European Union which foundAirBnB should be classified not as an estate agent but as an 'information society service,' thus avoiding tougher regulations. Throughout its ten year history, AirBnB has preferred to act without gaining permission and to allow regulators to chase them over violations. The resulting disputes have been like a global game of whack-a-mole, with AirBnB challenging local authorities' attempts to stand up to them. The company fights every battle out of fear that if a particularly onerous set of regulations prove successful in one city, others would be encouraged to follow suit. For example, after regulations took effect in San Francisco, AirBnB lost about 4,000 listings. What is clear in this pattern of behaviour is that Airbnb's priority every step of the way has been to ensure that stricter regulations do not affect their future market opportunities. Concerns about AirBnB's negative impact have only worried them following negative press, which is treated primarily as a PR exercise. AirBnB are prepared to work with cities so long as their business interests are not adversely affected. But in many cases, the rhetoric is simply a smoke-screen for a company that would prefer to operate with as minimal regulations as possible. AirBnB Versus the People In 2018, AirBnB publically declared[15] that the company was not simply shareholder-driven, but would attempt to benefit all of its stakeholders, including local communities. Two years later and Airbnb report to be still 'early in our work' with plans for the release of their first Annual Stakeholder Report in March of this year. But the only metric regarding protecting communities published in a recent update[16] is about measuring AirBnB's 'carbon footprint'. Despite ongoing concerns, none of the indicators address rent and housing affordability or the impact of Airbnb's activities on neighbourhoods. We should ask ourselves the following: if AirBnB care so much about local communities, why has it taken the company over 10 years to produce a stakeholder report? Why was this only seriously considered following a wave of negative press just before its IPO? If this is more than a simple marketing exercise, why are there no robust and measurable targets? AirBnB has consistently put its corporate interests ahead of those of local communities. In instances where being responsible and abiding by a cities' regulations has threatened its profitability, it has fought tooth and nail to undermine and defeat local elected representatives. Its fight against San Francisco, which was eventually settled out of court, cost the city[17] about $330,000 in legal fees. AirBnB's behaviour has opened up a new industry of companies [18]offering assistance to local authorities attempting to regulate short-stay accommodation. The company's reluctance to release its data to local authorities has also given rise to Inside AirBnB, 'an independent, non-commercial set of tools and data that allows you to explore how AirBnB is being used in cities around the world,' administered by community activist, Murray Cox. Since AirBnB rarely releases data of its operations, it's difficult to have an informed public debate over their policies and their effect on cities. AirBnB doesn't simply require more regulation. Instead, we need a complete overhaul of its extractive business model. It continues along its current path because there hasn't yet been a large enough outcry over its actions combined with a co-ordinated shift towards a more ethical alternative. But a growing number of activists hope that this could soon change. A Cooperative Alternative Fairbnb.coop[19] began in 2016 as a movement of people in Venice, Amsterdam and Bologna hoping to challenge the extractive model of existing holiday rental platforms. The organisation incorporated as a co-operative in October 2018 and has recently launched a beta version of its reservation system, allowing its 8000 registered users to book accommodation in five cities across Europe. For Damiano Avellino, co-founder of Fairbnb.coop, AirBnB has 'turned into a way for people to speculate.' This includes predatory landlords who buy up multiple properties to rent them out on AirBnB, as well as investors in the platform itself, who hope to turn a profit through the 23-25 percent commission paid to AirBnB on every transaction. The model of Fairbnb.coop tries to stay closer to the original concept of 'home sharing' while escaping the predatory aspects of Airbnb. As a workers' co-operative, Fairbnb.coop invests half of the 15% commission on bookings into social projects chosen by hosts and travellers. Whereas AirBnB is designed to maximise profits for its shareholders, Fairbnb.coop only retains as much as is required to continue running the platform. This is a reversal of the underlying business model of AirBnB, which relies on maintaining a monopoly over the short-term rental market and extracting profit by exploiting their position as broker. Its social projects enable the co-op to make a genuine contribution to the community. For example, travellers in Genoa can donate to the activities and projects of C.R.E.A, the Food Surplus Recovery Center and Mediterranean Laboratory, a space of culture and sharing. 'In Amsterdam the money will go to a community gardening project in the north and an urban agriculture project for migrant women in the south-east - both poorer parts of the city,' Spanish founder, Sito Veracruz, reported to the Guardian[20]. In addition to its pursuit of public utility over profit, Fairbnb.coop also aims to reduce the negative impact of tourism and short-stay rentals through a 'one host/one house' policy. This prevents landlords from taking properties off the long-term rental market by discouraging hosts with multiple lettings. Almost a quarter of London AirBnB hosts have five or more properties, with eleven hosts who have over 100 properties listed on the site, according to data from Inside AirBnB. Damiano Avellino argues that it's the communities themselves who have a right to decide on what further regulations should govern each city: 'how to choose the best regulation for each city is something that we should come up with together,' he claims. 'What is really important is to make sure the platform is governed as a commons and can act as a positive force for change in local communities.' The challenge for Fairbnb.coop is how to expand their ownership and governance structure beyond the original investor/workers of the enterprise. Fairbnb.coop has ambitions of bringing in more stakeholders that would have voting rights over how the enterprise is run. Currently Fairbnb.coop remains relatively small, but the model represents a genuine alternative to venture capitalist-funded Big Tech platforms.

Mr Lehane added that regulations should be tailored to each particular sector, differentiating Airbnb from its social media peers.</p><p>An oversight body should instate a consistent registration process for people looking to rent out homes on a short-term basis as well as give EU cities a framework for regulating home rentals, he said. Airbnb also intends to make data on home sharing available to city authorities through an independent third party in the coming weeks.</p><p>In December, Airbnb won a key ruling at the European Court of Justice that allowed it to avoid the onerous rules placed upon property agents in the EU.

They were a rebuke of Airbnb as it prepares to go public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you are hoping to book a cheap stay just a short train ride away from the bustle of Manhattan, good luck finding an Airbnb in Jersey City.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Tuesday, Jersey City residents voted overwhelmingly in favor of stricter regulations on short-term rentals that will almost certainly shrink the number of Airbnb listings in New Jersey\u2019s second-largest city.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The new restrictions were a major defeat for Airbnb as it prepares to go public and the latest in a string of laws that cities around the world have passed to regulate the home-sharing industry\u2019s explosive growth.</p><p>The Jersey City regulations <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">gained steam</url> following concerns that the platform\u2019s 3,000 listings, many run by large-scale investors, were pushing often-unruly tourists into residential areas, helping shoot up housing costs and accelerate gentrification.</p><p>Airbnb contended that its platform is a crucial source of extra income for homeowners who list their properties on its website and that the new restrictions were influenced by the hotel lobby. </p><p>The company collected enough signatures to trigger the referendum and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">devoted $4.2 million to fend off the new rules</url>, betting it could outspend its opponents by hiring political consultants and pollsters, and investing heavily in mailers and TV spots.</p><p>\u201cThey thought their money would win and I\u2019m proud that Jersey City said otherwise,\u201d Steven Fulop, Jersey City\u2019s mayor, said on Tuesday. \u201cIf I was an investor in Airbnb I would certainly take note, as this message of regulation wasn\u2019t sent by politicians, but it was dictated directly from the people.\u201d</p><p>Airbnb\u2019s opponents \u2014 the hotel industry and an influential hotel workers union \u2014 spent about $1 million in what quickly became the most expensive local referendum in New Jersey history. </p><p>Jersey City, with a population of 265,000 people, became an unlikely but valuable battleground for the $30 billion company as it grapples with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">an escalating crackdown on illegal Airbnbs in nearby New York City</url>, its largest market in the country.</p><p>What do the new regulations actually do?</p><p>The new restrictions allow homeowners to rent out portions of their homes as long as they\u2019re present during a guest\u2019s stay.</p><p>But they prohibit renters from listing their apartment and bar owners from renting a property on a short-term basis most of the year if they don\u2019t live on-site, effectively banning large-scale Airbnb operators who had converted hundreds of condos and townhouses into makeshift hotels.</p><p>It would, however, hurt residents who were making extra cash by renting out a second home for days at a time through Airbnb.</p><p>What does this mean for Airbnb?</p><p>The new ordinance won handily with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">about</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">70 percent</url> of the vote, a sharp rebuke for a company that mounted a robust multimillion dollar campaign and placed its fate in the hands of voters after failing to forge effective political alliances in Jersey City.</p><p>The restrictions were a sharp about-face in Jersey City, which had legalized Airbnb just a few years ago but sought to rein in the home-sharing industry as the number of listings ballooned. Other cities with Airbnb-friendly laws that are dealing with growing listings could follow suit.</p><p>While more than 96,100 Jersey City residents use Airbnb when traveling, the defeat underscored the difficulty that sharing economy companies increasingly face in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">mobilizing users as a constituency</url>.</p><p>In New York City, for example, Uber <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">successfully rallied its riders</url> in 2015 to help defeat a proposed cap on ride-hailing vehicles, but       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">it failed to replicate that success</url> in 2018 when the city passed a yearlong cap.</p><p>Airbnb did galvanize its hosts, but, in the end, they were outnumbered by a broad coalition of concerned neighbors and community groups backed by the hotel industry and local elected officials, including Mr. Fulop, a Democrat.</p><p>It was an off-year election, and both sides privately speculated that a higher turnout could have tipped the scales in Airbnb\u2019s favor. If anything, the vote settled any regulatory uncertainties in Jersey City ahead of the company\u2019s initial public offering, or I.P.O. </p><p>It could be inconsequential for the company\u2019s bottom line: Airbnb once heavily relied on business in its 10 largest cities, but those cities now account <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">for less than 10 percent</url> of its bookings as the company continues to expand in emerging destinations worldwide.</p><p>\u201cFrom the start of this campaign, we knew this was going to be one of the toughest fights we\u2019ve faced, with the big New York hotel industry determined to fight home sharing, but we had an obligation to stand up for our community,\u201d Christopher Nulty, a spokesman for Airbnb, said in a statement.</p><p>\u201cThere are Airbnb listings in over 100,000 cities around the world and we will continue to do all we can to support hosts,\u201d he added.</p><p>How has Airbnb fared in other cities?</p><p>Despite having legalized home-sharing in 2015, Jersey City now joins the ranks of other cities and towns that have tackled the spread of Airbnb and similar services. </p><p>Los Angeles, Amsterdam, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">Paris</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">Vancouver, British Columbia,</url> have all passed laws restricting short-term rentals.</p><p>Denver has gone further: The city began <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">filing criminal charges</url> against people who lie about whether their listed property is their primary residence. </p><p>Last year, Palma de Mallorca became <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">the first city in Spain to ban Airbnb</url>.</p><p>Airbnb has sometimes pursued ballot measures, in which citizens can directly vote on legislation and money can play an outsize role \u2014 as it did in Jersey City.</p><p>Airbnb collected enough signatures to fend off a bill in San Diego last year. </p><p>In San Francisco, where Airbnb is based, the company orchestrated an $8 million campaign to win a ballot question in 2015, but the city later passed legislation requiring hosts to register with the city, causing listings to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">drop by 50 percent</url>.</p><p>How does the vote relate to New York City\u2019s crackdown?</p><p>When it comes to Airbnb, Jersey City has effectively become New York City\u2019s sixth borough.</p><p>The city has more listings than the Bronx and Staten Island combined, and about the same ratio of listings to residents as Manhattan. A large portion of the listings are near public transit hubs that provide guests with quick access to Manhattan, just a four-minute train ride away. </p><p>Some experts say that as New York City intensified its war on illegal Airbnb operators through lawsuits and violations, Jersey City\u2019s more loosely regulated landscape became an attractive alternative for investors.</p><p>Sixty-five hosts who control 527 listings in New York City also operate about 492 listings in Jersey City, according to David Wachsmuth, a professor at McGill University who analyzed data from the analytics firm AirDNA.</p><p>\u201cThere are plenty of places that are vaguely Jersey-esque, smaller cities on the outskirts of major cities,\u201d Mr. Wachsmuth said. \u201cIf the major cities are cracking down, it\u2019s only natural that a larger and a larger slice of Airbnb activities there are going to these smaller cities.\u201d</p><p>New York City, which has about 50,000 Airbnb listings, passed a law in 2018 requiring home-sharing sites to provide monthly detailed information about their listings, including the identities and addresses of hosts.</p><p>In January, however, a federal judge <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">blocked the law</url> after Airbnb and other sites sued. The lawsuit is ongoing.</p><p>How do Jersey City residents feel?</p><p>For weeks, neighborhood meetings grew heated as Jersey City residents were bombarded with a barrage of mailers and advertisements.</p><p>Airbnb\u2019s critics argued the company ran a misinformation campaign under the name Keep Our Homes, labeling the regulations a \u201cban.\u201d Its supporters said that the ordinance was influenced by the hotel lobby\u2019s special interests and that Airbnb hosts were being harassed.</p><p>The vote was fraught up until the results came in.</p><p>On Tuesday night, the Keep Our Homes campaign <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">posted a video</url> that seemed to show Mr. Fulop encouraging a resident, standing by a voting booth, to cast his ballot in favor of the new restrictions. It is illegal       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/nyregion/airbnb-new-jersey.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article\">under state law</url> to electioneer within 100 feet of a polling place.</p><p>\u201cThe entire video would clearly show that I didn\u2019t approach anyone, didn\u2019t have any literature and didn\u2019t electioneer,\u201d Mr. Fulop said. \u201cThey ran a dirty campaign the entire time and should release the entire video, not an edited four second clip, followed by a press release from them.\u201d</p><p>At the heart of residents\u2019 frustrations were deep-rooted concerns about the impact Airbnb was having on their neighborhoods.</p><p>Beyond quality-of-life complaints \u2014 noise, trash and safety concerns \u2014 many residents worried that Airbnb was being used to remove entire swaths of apartments from the rental market, potentially raising rents in a city already grappling with the pressures of displacement.</p><p>\u201cThe secret is out that rents here are skyrocketing,\u201d said Corey Klein, a real estate attorney who lives in Jersey City. \u201cAirbnb, for every unit that is rented out to the budget traveler, that\u2019s one less unit available to a working family.\u201d</p><p>The vote, he said, was \u201ca way of Jersey City saying to the big tech giants that an election can\u2019t be bought here.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: Owners can still rent out part of their homes, but they have to be there, a direct slap at large operators.

Others, such as New York-based website developer Squarespace, are making Portland a customer service hub.</p><p>The influx of companies from outside the state is an outgrowth of Portland\u2019s maturing startup scene, said Jared Wiener, the Portland Development Commission\u2019s software industry liaison. A cluster of young companies are demonstrating that the city has enough tech talent to attract larger businesses.</p><p>\u201cIt means that people are realizing that what\u2019s happening here is something real,\u201d he said.</p><p>Airbnb said it received no state or city incentives for its Portland office.</p><p>The company wouldn\u2019t disclose a pay range for its Portland jobs, but customer service work in Multnomah and Washington counties paid an average of $36,115 annually last year. The pay range varied widely, though, and tech work like Airbnb likely tends toward the high end of that range, which approaches $50,000 a year.</p><p>Pablo Hernandez, previously a manager at Yahoo\u2019s customer service office in Hillsboro, will be the project manager overseeing the opening of the Portland office.</p><p>Airbnb officials said the company already has a number of Portland employees, working remotely. They said they chose the city for its expansion because of its proximity to headquarters in San Francisco and because Portland\u2019s sustainable ethos and embrace of the \u201csharing economy\u201d is a good cultural fit for the company.</p><p>Ironically, current city regulations generally don\u2019t allow the kind of short-term rental that Airbnb\u2019s business enables. The company is lobbying to change those rules, but Airbnb said those talks are \u201ctotally independent\u201d of the company\u2019s decision to open its Portland office.</p><p>Founded in 2008, privately held Airbnb has swelled from 130 employees in 2011 to several hundred now.</p><p>For Portland, Airbnb picked a 27,000-square-foot office in an Old Town building known as the Blagen Block, near the University of Oregon\u2019s Portland facility in the White Stag Block. Airbnb said it picked the spot because of its proximity to the waterfront mass transit \u2014 the MAX light-rail runs right by the site.</p><p>The company will occupy the first three floors and has an option to expand into the remaining floor, said Trevor Kafoury of brokerage firm CBRE, who represented the building\u2019s owner.</p><p>Before moving in this summer, Airbnb said plans to customize its office to make it a community space to welcome \u201cour hosts, guests and travelers.\u201d The company said it\u2019s too soon to say exactly what form that community space will take.</p><p>\u201cIf you look at their headquarters, it reminds me a lot of where they\u2019re looking\u201d in Portland, said Jill Miles, a recruitment officer for Business Oregon who had been courting Airbnb since October 2012. She recently visited the company\u2019s San Francisco office and said the culture and vibe there is very reminiscent of Old Town.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a nice fit,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u2022</p><p>Elliot Njus of The Oregonian contributed to this report.</p><p>See Airbnb, A4</p><p>Airbnb</p><p>Continued from A1</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OREGNN-MERLIN_23876093</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OREGNN2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BSG-7MV1-JCTS-G18X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">235910</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"714\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Oregonian All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Oregonian (Portland Oregon)</publicationName><edition>1M EDITION</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>March 15, 2014 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS334118 COMPUTER TERMINAL &amp;

Open Now[1]  Researchers from MIT, Stanford University, and the University of Pennsylvania have devised a method for predicting failure rates of safety-critical machine learning systems and efficiently determining their rate of occurrence. Safety-critical machine learning systems make decisions for automated technology like self-driving cars, robotic surgery, pacemakers, and autonomous flight systems for helicopters and planes. </p><p>Unlike AI that helps you write an email or recommends a song, safety-critical system failures can result in serious injury or death. Problems with such machine learning systems can also cause financially costly events like SpaceX missing its landing pad. Researchers say their neural bridge sampling method gives regulators, academics, and industry experts a common reference for discussing the risks associated with deploying complex machine learning systems in safety-critical environments. In a paper titled 'Neural Bridge Sampling for Evaluating Safety-Critical Autonomous Systems,' recently published on arXiv[2], the authors assert their approach can satisfy both the public's right to know that a system has been rigorously tested and an organization's desire to treat AI models like trade secrets. In fact, some AI startups and Big Tech companies refuse to grant access to raw models for testing and verification out of fear that such inspections could reveal proprietary information. 'They don't want to tell you what's inside the black box, so we need to be able to look at these systems from afar without sort of dissecting them,' co-lead author Matthew O'Kelly told VentureBeat in a phone interview. 'And so one of the benefits of the methods that we're proposing is that essentially somebody can send you a scrambled description of that generated model, give you a bunch of distributions, and you draw from them, then send back the search space and the scores. They don't tell you what actually happened during the rollout.' Safety-critical systems have failure rates so low that the rates can be tough to compute, and the better the systems get, the harder it is to estimate, O'Kelly said. To come up with a predicted failure rate, a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme is used to identify areas in a distribution believed to be in proximity to a failure event. 'Then you continue this process and you build what we call this ladder toward the failure regions. You keep getting worse and worse and worse as you play against the Tesla autopilot algorithm or the pacemaker algorithm to keep pushing it toward the failures that are worse and worse,' said co-lead author Aman Sinha. The neural bridge sampling method detailed in the paper draws on decades-old statistical techniques, as well as recent work published in part by[3] O'Kelly and Sinha that uses a simulation testing framework to evaluate a black box autonomous vehicle system. In addition to the neural bridge contribution in the paper, the authors argue in favor of continued advances in privacy-conscious tech like federated learning and differential privacy[4] and urge more researchers and people with technical knowledge to join regulatory conversations and help drive policy. 'We would like to see more statistics-driven, science-driven initiatives, in terms of regulation and policy around things like self-driving vehicles,' O'Kelly said. 'We think that it's just such a novel technology that information is going to need to flow pretty rapidly from the academic community to the businesses making the objects to the government that's going to be responsible for regulating them.' In other recent safety-critical systems news, autonomous shipping has grown during the COVID-19 pandemic[5], and last week a team of researchers detailed DuckieNet[6], a physical model for evaluating autonomous vehicle and robotics systems. Also last week: Medical experts introduced the first set of standards for reporting artificial intelligence use in medical clinical trials[7].

Good morning, and thank you so much.  Good morning, everyone, I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Tuesday, it is Tuesday, March 12th, your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. on the east coast.  The groundings of Boeing 737, the Max 8 jet expanding around the world, this morning.  Nearly half of all of the jets that have been delivered since May of 2017 have been parked, half of them.  The fallout, coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Carlos Ghosn replaced, the Renault, Nissan, Mitsubishi alliance unveiling a new board structure as the automakers chart their path forward.  And sports starts versus sports fans, Russell Westbrook threatening a couple during last night's game.  Meanwhile, UFC star Connor McGregor arrested, accused of smashing a fan's phone.  The details in sports, coming up.  A record sky high view.  It is not for the faint of heart.  How you can get a new look at New York City later this hour.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Markets this morning look like this, mixed story so far, Dow Industrials down 20 points -- 23 points, fractional move with the S&amp;P 500, and the NASDAQ are higher this morning.  Futures indicating a gain of about three points on the S&amp;P and 12 points higher on the NASDAQ.  Boeing is still set to weigh on the market this morning, certainly on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Take a look at the stock, down another two percent, as more countries and airlines across the world get set to ground their 737 Max 8 aircraft over safety concerns, following that deadly Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday.  The second crash for this type of plane in five months.  The two American carriers that fly the plane, Southwest and American Airlines continue to operate that 737.</p><p>Now, shortly after the Lion Air crash last year, I spoke with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, and asked him about the safety of that 737 Max 8.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DENNIS MUILENBURG, CEO, BOEING:  The real bottom line here -- the key is that the 737 Max is very safe, and we're very confident in that.  Safety is a core value for our industry and for our company, always has been, it always will be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But was there a change in terms of this model, the 737 that wasn't articulated to the pilots at the airlines, that they did not know how to respond in the event of a change.  That's what the charges are.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes, the 737 Max has some new capabilities that are embedded in it, and that's included in the training process that we go through.  You know, the airplane has gone through thousands and thousands of hours of testing and simulation, working with our pilots, ensuring that they have all the information they need to safely operate the airplane.  And in some cases those new systems are designed to take advantage of the capabilities of the airline.  And we've already issued a couple of follow-up bulletins coming out of the ongoing investigation, pointing pilots to existing flight procedures to handle the kind of scenarios that we're talking about in this incident.  So, we're going to continue to do that.  It's very important that we provide all of the information needed to safely operate these airplanes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is Kreindler &amp; Kreindler Partner and licensed pilot Daniel Rose.  Daniel, it's nice to have you on the program this morning.</p><p>DANIEL ROSE, PARTNER, KREINDLER &amp; KREINDLER:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you know about the 737 Max 8 jet?</p><p>ROSE:  Well, we know that there's a lot of focus on it right now because of two crashes within five months on a brand new aircraft which is really unprecedented.  We know that there's a system on board that is suspected of causing the first crash, which basically renders the aircraft uncontrollable and the pilots can't do anything about it.  We were told that it's -- you can do something about it, it's going to be fixed, and five months later, we see what appears to be the same thing, which is a real problem, and it kind of explains why so many countries are grounding the aircraft.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you heard Dennis Muilenburg right there, the CEO of Boeing, talk to me after the Lion Air crash, basically saying, yes, we need the Boeing mechanics to explain to the pilots the change here.  Do you think that could have been the failure that the pilots are unclear in terms of how to operate the new changes in this model?  Your firm specializes in aerospace litigation, right?  Tell us what you think is the issue?</p><p>ROSE:  Right.  Well, there should never be a situation like this where a brand-new plane requires special emergency procedures in order to prevent a failure from happening shortly after takeoff.  You know, the training is essentially what -- Boeing was saying was put a band aid on a problem that is really a design defect, and it needs to be fixed.  In fact, the system itself, this MCAS system, I would say, is a band aid on top of a bigger problem which is the aerodynamics of the plane.</p><p>Boeing tries to get the most, understandably, out of their plane, bigger engines, they mount them in a certain way, and all of a sudden the aircraft flies in a very different way and sometimes in an unsafe way, so they build this system, the MCAS system to compensate for that.  Don't tell anybody about it.  And it kicks on automatically without anybody knowing about it, and when it does it in the wrong situation, which is done now twice, it's not a safety system, it's actually causing crashes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  These are all the issues obviously that you would be putting into a complaint.  How significant are the lawsuits coming, or have they begun for Boeing?</p><p>ROSE:  They're -- well, they're certainly coming.  You know, unfortunately, aside from everybody that was on the plane, there were also Americans on the plane, given that American passengers and Boeing is an American company, one of the main legal hurdles involved in a case like this is whether the case would stay here or get litigated somewhere in like Ethiopia.  But with the Americans on board, certainly those passengers will have claims here in the United States, and they'll be significant, likely given the history here of second crash within two -- within five months, which probably a good argument for even the foreigners to be able to stay here and say whatever was relevant to this crash and this investigation, this lawsuit, took place in the United States because Boeing still hasn't fixed the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, characterize this problem now that Boeing is facing because not only do you have a situation where country after country are grounding the planes, I mean, a third of these planes that Boeing makes go to China, and China has grounded all of them, a third of the production.  And now, you've got the litigation issue.</p><p>ROSE:  Yes, honestly, probably litigation is the tail on the dog.  I mean, there's thousands of these on order, and that's the real significant issue, I think, for Boeing because if they have to redesign the system or even the plane to a significant extent, which I think has to be seriously considered given the scope of the problem, that's a huge problem.  You know, China, the plane is essentially built to fly in China and for their -- for their market, so it's not surprising that, you know, they're saying, hey, if this thing isn't safe, we don't want it, but the bottom line is Boeing is going to have to fix it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of a cost are we -- are we looking at for Boeing, or is it anybody's guess at this point?</p><p>ROSE:  Yes, the latter because this is a 60-year-old plane and with 1960s technology, essentially it's gone through four iterations, generations, many iterations, and each one kind of adds a little bit more onto it, bigger engines, bigger space, more passengers.  And it really has gotten to the point where the plane as it is, to me, is nothing like it was when it first came out.  And fundamentally, the way the plane flies and how stable it is, has been affected by all of these changes.  So, this system, this MCAS system was designed to try to correct this problem without changing anything fundamentally in the aircraft, but I think they're going to have to change things more fundamentally on the aircraft either -- a complete new design or a complete new system, and that could be very expensive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  I see.  And real quick, before we go, what's your reaction to these American jetliners that are not grounding the 737 like American and Southwest?</p><p>ROSE:  Yes.  I'm concerned because right now we know of two incidents and they didn't work out, they're 0 for 2.  I think American airlines, based on what Boeing and the FAA are saying, are saying if this happens, our pilots can take control and can save the plane.  I hope that's right, certainly, but we haven't seen whether that's been tested, whether there's been an incident where somebody has actually recovered.  Right now, we're over two and that's not comforting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll leave it there.  Daniel, thank you very much for your insights.</p><p>ROSE:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you.  Daniel Rose joining us there on Boeing.  Meanwhile, there's this, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is pushing back this morning against the Securities and Exchange Commission again in a new court filing.  Dagen McDowell, what's your take?  Good morning to you, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So, Tesla's CEO Elon Musk as you pointed is saying -- telling a federal judge that he did not violate a fraud settlement that restricted his social media communications, even suggesting that the government is trying to put a muzzle on him.  In a filing -- this was made late Monday, Elon Musk lawyers said the Securities and Exchange Commission has not shown that his tweet on February the 19th was material.</p><p>This is -- I'm quoting from The Wall Street Journal, while the federal agency is overreaching by suggesting he needs prior approval for any statement that relates to Tesla.  Here's a quote from Musk attorneys, undeterred and perhaps embarrassed by Musk criticism of it, the SEC urges the court to read and apply the order in an unconstitutional manner.  The tweet in question was sent, as I said, on February 19th.  It was about Tesla's anticipated production levels for 2019.  Musk's original message on Twitter said, \"Tesla made zero cars in 2011 but will make around 500,000 in 2019.\"</p><p>Sometime later, hours later, an in-house lawyer helped him clarify that message, saying I meant to say that annualize production at the end of 2019 was probably around 500,000, i.e. 10,000 cars a week.  Deliveries for the year is still estimated to be around 400,000.  The issue at hand is Tesla and its CEO, his attorney say did comply with the oversight policy by reviewing his tweet, providing context and clarity.  The lawyer has also told the court his tweet simplify repeated information that Musk had already made on the earnings call, that Tesla and self-included in the 2018 annual report.</p><p>The judge has to decide whether he is in contempt but I'm sure that the lawyers at the company have told Elon Musk stop calling the SEC, the (AUDIO GAP) or Short-Seller Enrichment Commission.  And he hammered the SEC in that interview with \"60 Minutes\" at the end of the year.  So, again, this is like a petty little fight between Musk and the SEC, maybe cooler heads will prevail.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sounds like that advice that you're bringing up there is probably the advice that the lawyers are giving him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How about shut up, shut up.  Talk about -- worry about selling that Model 3 and like not closing stores and managing your company, rather than picking on the SEC.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unbelievable.  All right.  Thank you.  Meanwhile, Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan, he's on the hot seat again on Capitol Hill today.  Cheryl Casone with that story and headlines now.  Cheryl, good morning to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  And Tim Sloan is going to testify before the House Financial Services Committee today.  He's going to focus on the fallout from the bank's fake account scandal.  This is the first time a bank CEO is going to appear before the committee now that it is led by the Democrats.  But Sloan's future may be in question, as regulators are seeking answers on whether he can repair the bank's image.  Over the last year, Wells Fargo's stock down nearly 15 percent.</p><p>Well, there are new details in the sexual harassment cases that happened over at Google.  The tech giant paid $135 million to two top executives who left the company.  They left over those allegations of sexual harassment, the price tag was revealed in a shareholder lawsuit at the time the reasons for the departures, Maria, were covered up.  Now, we know what those two executives were paid off by Google.</p><p>And then, automakers: Renault, Nissan, and Mitsubishi have created a new board of directors that excludes former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn.  The new board is going to oversee the French-Japanese partnership meeting every month in Tokyo or Paris.  Ghosn still is one of eight members of Nissan's board, but his recent request to attend a Nissan board meeting, Maria, rejected by a judge.  Ghosn was released last week from a Tokyo jail in $9 million bail after spending more than 100 days behind bars, he's accused still of underreporting his salary at Nissan which he denies.  Now, we're just waiting for that trial to begin, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl, thank you.  We're going to take a short break.  When we come back, the White House 2020 budget proposal is out, including billions of dollars for the military and funding for the border wall.  We've got the breakdown next and the pushback.  Plus, double trouble with fans, NBA star Russell Westbrook has some choice words for a couple of mid-game, while UFC Champ Connor McGregor allegedly smashes a fan's phone, and is later arrested.  Sports is coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, big show ahead -- conversation this morning.  Joining the conversation is CFRA Investment Strategists Lindsey Bell, along with American Enterprise Institute President, Arthur C. Brooks is here.  And Arthur, great to have you here, good to see you.</p><p>ARTHUR BROOKS, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE:  Thank you.  Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lindsey, always a pleasure to see you.  You're out with a new book called \"Love Your Enemies: How Decent People Can Save America From the Culture of Contempt.\"  Perfect timing to write such a book with all of the polarizing going on in this country.</p><p>BROOKS:  Yes, for sure.  I mean, I was -- over the past couple of years, I've seen kind of this freight train coming down the tracks is pulling the country apart.  And I was just blown away to see this data that one in six Americans have actually stopped talking to a family member or a close friend because of politics since the 2016 election.  And it's wonderful stuff that shows that we're actually more polarized than the Israelis and Palestinians, that's how much we actually don't understand each other.  I wrote a book on how we can actually get more -- we can actually be more persuasive, make our arguments better, at the same time become happier.  So, this is really a guidebook on how to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And is this about Trump derangement syndrome?</p><p>BROOKS:  It's about everybody's derangement syndrome.  What you find is that the Democrats are deranged about the Republicans.  Republicans are deranged about the Democrats.  And point in fact, 93 percent of us don't want to hate our neighbors.  We hate how polarized we become as a country.  So, we got to -- we actually can disagree, we should disagree, but we can do so and be happier, and actually win more arguments if we do it right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, please.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stay off social media.</p><p>BROOKS:  Yes, for sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Isn't that part of the problem because I -- like, even over the weekend, it's the language that people use for attention.  I was looking at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's little speech or whatever you want to call it, at South By Southwest, and she was talking about automation and the use of -- the rise of robots in the workplace.  And she said, we should not be haunted by the specter of being automated out of work.  We should be excited by that, but the reason we're not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you don't have a job, you are left to die, and that is at its core, our problem.  It's that kind of language that, again, people say these incendiary things for attention.  And we let them get away with it, and then I just quote it or some part of the problem.</p><p>BROOKS:  Well, I mean, the big problem is that we -- a lot of people in social media, particularly anonymous, and so they say things that they wouldn't ever say in person.  And just in general, you're not a human when you're not in person with somebody else looking into somebody else's eyes.  And there's a (INAUDIBLE) of that.  We don't see another person who simply has a different point of view.  So, I do recommend to take people, like, a lot more time off social media.  I recommend that people when they're on social media, they take responsibility for what they say, and that they mute the seven percent of Americans that are actually trying to fire us up and make us angry with each other, because they're getting rich and powerful and famous on the basis of this, including a lot of politicians that we all know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's certainly the issue of the day, for sure.  We're going to be talking about it this morning.  We've got a big program ahead.  We've got the Undersecretary of the U.S. Army here, Ryan McCarthy joining us, lots to talk about with him.  Along with California Congressman and House Armed Services Committee member John Garamendi; The New Voice CEO and former presidential candidate Herman Cain is here, and Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, four-star General Jack Keane joining us as well.  Don't miss a moment of it.  We got a big program ahead.  We are also taking a look at earnings and economic data.</p><p>Coming up, Facebook's mea culpa, the social media giant reversing course after removing ads from Senator Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign that calls for a break-up of major tech companies.  Then, the edge of the Big Apple, the world's highest outdoor viewing area set to open right here in Manhattan.  We'll tell you more about that, coming up.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Headlines across America now.  The Detroit Free Press this morning writing about \"What to do if your identity was stolen in the latest mass identity breach.\"  This, after a malware attack at Wolverine Solutions Group, potentially exposed personal information of hundreds of thousands of patients.  People who are affected will get a letter and are recommend to put a credit freeze and fraud alert on their account.  The Salt Lake Tribune reporting this morning that the Utah House passes a bill to add an 86 percent tax on e-cigarettes.  The tax is supposed to deter youth vaping, and generate more than $23 million in revenue.  That money would be distributed to local health departments and provide increases for Medicaid expansion.</p><p>The New York Time says, state lawmakers want to allow teenagers to get vaccines even if their parents say no.  A new bill would let any kid, 14 or older, be vaccinated or given booster shots for a range of diseases including mumps, tetanus shots, and the flu and measles.  This comes just days after a Congressional testimony from an Ohio teenager who got vaccinated against his mother's wishes, then appeared here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA to discuss the decision.  Interesting stories this morning.  What do you think about this e-cigarettes tax?</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  I mean, 86 percent is pretty high, but it comes nowhere near to what the tax is on regular cigarettes.  And here in New York State it's very high.  So, I mean, I think it will deter teenage usage, but you know, I don't know about the tax revenue they're expecting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The tax revenue seems small.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.</p><p>BROOKS:  Yes.  That's not the point.  You tax things for two reasons, either to raise money or to discourage the behavior.  Clearly, they're trying to discourage the behavior, and you find that taxes on that stuff actually disproportionately works with teenagers.  So, that's why they're doing it, it's worked in the past, it's going to work again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think it will work?  All right.</p><p>BROOKS:  Yes, I think it will.  I think it will discourage people from vaping and from e-cigarettes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they'll tax anything for revenue.  Remember tanning?  They tax the tanning booth, the tanning tax and the Obamacare.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was like a double-digit tax, too, it's like a 10-12 percent excess tax on tanning.</p><p>BROOKS:  Yes.  But that was to discourage that, too.  That was to discourage (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it's what -- really?</p><p>BROOKS:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I really need the Democrats wringing their hands about me going and laying in a tanning bed.</p><p>BROOKS:  That's a different issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is wild.</p><p>BROOKS:  That's a different issue.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the White House's 2020 budget military spending will get a huge boost.  We will tell you what programs will see a cut.  That's after this, and then a recall alert to tell you about, Honda is recalling a million vehicles over faulty airbags.  It is not the first time this has been done, we've got all the details after this.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, March 12th, your top stories right now 6:30 on the east coast on the button.</p><p>Mixed performances, this morning, for the markets, Dow Industrials down again because of another decline in Boeing, but the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ Futures are higher, NASDAQ up 10-1/2 points this morning.</p><p>On top of gains across the board yesterday on Wall Street, stocks late-day rally yesterday driven by technology stocks.  Pretty good rally at the close, Dow Industrials were up 200 points, 3 quarters of 1 percent, S&amp;P 500 was up 1-1/2 percent and the NASDAQ up better than 2 percent.</p><p>Global markets this morning, look like this, across Europe, we've got gains even though it's just fractional, FT-100 up 8-1/2 points, CAC Quarante in Paris, up 4 points, and the DAX Index in Germany up about 6 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, gains across the region, as you see, best performer there was Hong Kong and Japan, Japan up one and three quarters percent, Hang Seng and Hong Kong up 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>Facebook under fire over ads, the social media giant has pulled Elizabeth Warren's political ads from the site.  Now, it's apologizing, those ads had to do with breaking up technology.</p><p>Recall alert, Honda takes roughly 1 million cars off the road in two separate recalls, some could catch fire.  We've got all the details on what models we're talking about.</p><p>And sports stars versus sports fans, Russell Westbrook threatened a couple during last night's game.  Meanwhile, over at the UFC, star Conor McGregor was arrested, accused of smashing a fan's phone, the details in sports, right here, coming up.</p><p>And a record sky-high view, it is not for the faint of heart, how you can get a look at New York City, coming up.  Wait until you see that.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning, but first, our top story this half an hour, President Trump unveiled his budget proposal for the fiscal year 2020.  It includes boosting defense dollars to $750 billion and $8.6 billion for a southern border wall.  It would also cut $818 billion in projected Medicare spending over 10 years.</p><p>Joining me right now, Retired Four-Star General and FOX News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane, General, good to see you this morning, thanks so much for being here.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST:  Yes, good to see you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the President's budget?</p><p>KEANE:  Well, his part of the down payment, we've got to make, to get the military out of the deep hole it's been in, why is it in such a big hole?  Almost 17 years of fighting 9/11 wars and then, the Budget Control Act of sequestration, one of the most irresponsible reckless budget ever approved, kneecapped the military for the last four or five years.</p><p>So, what President Trump has done, similar to what President Reagan did in the -- in the 1980s, is attempt to recover the military, this is the third budget.  And we need about five or six years of this, steady state to be able to dig ourselves out of this hole.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, analyze why this is so important and compare the U.S.' budget and the expansion that you'd like to see in terms of military spending with the threats out there, General?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes, well, the major threats we are facing or return to big power competition with Russia and China, what's happening to us, Maria, well, United States military remains primary in the world.  Russia and China have closed the technology gap advantage that we have, so much so, that even in some special areas, their capabilities exceed ours.</p><p>And I spent a year on the commission of looking at the National Defense Strategy and we agree with what (INAUDIBLE) has been putting out recently in the last week or so, that if the United States fought a war with Russia or China, we would have casualty rates on personnel and high-capital assets not seen since World War II.</p><p>And more than that and, indeed, quite alarming is the fact that we would struggle to win and could even lose and our generals are saying much the same thing, so this Trump budget is absolutely crucial to get us back to the kind of military dominance that we've had in the world.</p><p>Not that we are looking for a fight, but what we have -- what we have found through the Cold War that when we have adequate military capabilities, it acts as a deterrence, and it worked very successfully with the Soviet Union.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  We want to deter China and Russia, we don't want to fight them, and the way to do that is you have got to have the capabilities, they have to see it's real and they have to know that you're wanting to use it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's extraordinary when you look at the companies involved because in China, you've got companies that are doing what the Chinese government tell them to do, right?  And Huawei is one of those companies that we talk about a lot and now there's a big threat around Huawei.</p><p>In the U.S., you've got this really -- the leading technology companies in the world, working on the leading things from A.I. to robotics, et cetera, and they are saying we're not going to work with the U.S. government, some of them, anyway.</p><p>I mean, that's the difference.  Whereas the Chinese companies are ramping up doing what the Chinese government tells them to do and in America, some of the leading technology companies refuse to work with the U.S. government and the Pentagon.</p><p>So, in February, we had Secretary of State Mike Pompeo here, talking about Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, increasingly viewed as a spy tool of the Chinese government by the United States.  This morning, the Wall Street Journal has their top story talking about this.</p><p>And they report on a letter by Rick Grenell, in Berlin, rather, to the company -- the country's economics minister, and they're talking about something we knew already after Mike Pompeo broke the news, in an interview with me, here, in February.  Listen to this, got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What we heard after your trip from Europe, there's a lot to talk about your trip to Poland because it was so important.</p><p>But what we read in the Journal yesterday and a lot of the reports was that Europe is pushing back on this idea that President Trump and your administration wants to ban or potentially stop, slow down the use of Huawei technology.  Is that what -- is that what you found in Europe?</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  So, we have spent time not just (INAUDIBLE) last week where we had some real successes, but over the past months, we've been out around the world just making sure everybody had the same information that countries understand the risk of putting this Huawei technology into their I.T. systems.</p><p>We can't forget the systems were designed by -- with the express work alongside the Chinese PLI, their military in China.  They are creating a real risk for these countries and their systems, the security of their people, Europeans care deeply about their privacy.</p><p>The risk of privacy from this technology is very, very real and we're out sharing this information, the knowledge that America has gained through its vast network and making sure countries understand the risk.  That's important.  We think they'll make good decisions when they understand that risk.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not even just the risks for them, it's the risks for the world, I mean, if you are in high-level talks about National Security, with Poland, with Five Eyes.  I mean, Americans' information is out there too because China has tapped into their network?</p><p>POMPEO:  There's a second piece that we've shared with them as well, which is, if a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won't be able to share information with them.  We won't be able to work alongside them.  In some cases, there's risk, we won't even be able to co-locate American resources, an American embassy, an American military outposts.</p><p>There's real risk and we want to make sure they know, not only the rest of their own people, but their risk of being able to work alongside the United States in keeping the world safe.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, General, when he said that to me, I was really struck, because that was, in fact, the first time that the U.S. made it official that they would share less information with European countries that use Huawei, your reaction?</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  We really don't have much choice.  What's happening here, is that Trump administration is playing catch-up because the Obama administration just summarily ignored the threat of Huawei and its development of the 5G and Artificial Intelligence technology.  And we were -- we were seeding the ground to them, as a matter of fact.</p><p>So, we really appreciate what Secretary Pompeo is doing to General Scaparrotti who's the Supreme Allied Commander in NATO in testimony last week, mentioned the danger of Huawei, he could envision a time in the future if Europe goes by the way of Huawei and the Communist Chinese government, because that's really who they are.</p><p>That we wouldn't be able to work side by side with NATO military countries and that is absolutely alarming, given the reality of what we are facing here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it really is, but these systems were cheap, I mean, that's how the Chinese got so many countries throughout Europe, throughout Africa, to adopt their Huawei systems because it was very cheap.  They said to African countries too, don't worry, we've got your back, we'll do your infrastructure set-up and they need the access to this -- to the technology, so they did it.</p><p>KEANE:  Yes.  And let's be factual here, the Communist Chinese Party, running China, is the number one prolific theft cyber offensive capability in the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>KEANE:  Nobody comes even close to them.  They steal data by the billions, on a regular basis.  What am I talking about?  Intellectual property, we know about that, intelligence, and also personal data, and they are --</p><p>What they are seeking here is to have access to any data that would be of vital interest to them throughout Europe, Europe is their second customer beyond China itself, and they are in a full court press to get the 5G network wireless system and to own that system inside of Europe.</p><p>And what that would mean to them, give them incredible geopolitical leverage and influence over Europe.  I'm stunned that the Europeans can actually entertain this thought, because while it may be, in fact, be cheaper to do that, the net loss in the long run is staggering for those countries involved.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does it hurt the U.S. as well, though, not to be able to share the information it needs to with European partners?</p><p>KEANE:  Oh, yes, absolutely, and vice versa.  Listen, standing up against the threats that we have in the world, is the allies working together that enable us to provide adequate deterrence.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KEANE:  And it's absolutely crucial that we do this not just in Europe, but also in emerging countries around the world as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  General, great insights as always, thanks so much.</p><p>KEANE:  Good talking to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon, sir, General Jack Keane, joining us.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's this, Facebook this morning is backtracking, after removing Senator Elizabeth Warren's ads, Cheryl Casone with the details here, this is a -- this is a biggie, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  It's really interesting what Facebook did here, Maria.  So, they've now restored Senator Warren's ads, following the reports that they were taken down.</p><p>These ads posted by Warren's presidential campaign called for the break-up of technology giants, including Facebook, Amazon, Google, the Facebook claims it removed them because they've violated its policies against the use of its corporate logo.</p><p>After restoring the ads, Facebook now says it wants to allow a robust debate, kind of a head scratcher here.  Anyway, move on.</p><p>Now, let's talk about these recalls at Honda this morning, about a million older vehicles in the U.S. and Canada need air bag inflators replaced.  The Takata inflators installed during previous recalls, they could be dangerous.  The models affected, go back as far as 2001.</p><p>Then, there's this, Maria, as a New Yorker, you are going to love this one, we are now building the world's highest outdoor observation deck in this city, to better enjoy the Big Apple's famous skyline.  The sky scraper is being built at 30 Hudson Yards.  It's going to feature an open air viewing area that jets out on the 100th floor.</p><p>They're going to call the New York edge, the nine-foot tall angled glass surrounding the deck allows visitors to lean over and look down on Manhattan, like lean over on the glass, from 1,100 feet in the air.  I know.  I know.  It's expected to open in early 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know about that.</p><p>CASONE:  Would you?  I mean, would you -- would you go up there?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I would, but I'm not leaning on anything, but yes, I would.  I'm not afraid to go up.</p><p>CASONE:  Not sure.  I will salute you as you're up there.  It freaks me out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is.  It definitely is.  Thanks Cheryl.  Coming up, double trouble, get this, NBA star Russell Westbrook has a row with fans, middle of the game, while UFC champ Conor McGregor is arrested for allegedly smashing somebody else's phone.  Wild sports this morning.</p><p>Then, quarterback, Nick Foles, joining the new team, the Lululemon team, we will tell you all about his ambassadorship with the brand, next up, right here, in sports.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Oklahoma City star, Russell Westbrook, in a heated exchange with a fan in Utah.  Jared Max is here with sports, and what a sports report today, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  A lot of fighting, Maria.  Westbrook said that he was heckled by two fans that were seated together at the game -- a couple who NBA star accused of making a comment toward that was racial and inappropriate.  Westbrook was caught on video making threats of violence to the pair saying he would mess them up, but he didn't say mess.  After the game, Westbrook said he's not a violent person.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSSELL WESTBROOK, PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER:  To say being disrespectful about me and my family to many years -- I've done all good things; I've never done anything to hurt or harm anybody.  I've never been in trouble.  I've never fought a fan, been in the league 11 years, clean slate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  Shane Keisel and Jennifer Huff say, they did not do anything wrong, told Westbrook to put ice on the knee.</p><p>Conor McGregor in trouble with the law, again.  And it's just around a year ago, he threw that hand dolly into the bus in Brooklyn.  Well, this time Miami Beach Police say that the 30-year-old fighter was leaving the Fountain Blue Hotel early Monday morning when a fan tried to take his photograph.  McGregor allegedly slapped the phone from the fan's hand and then stomped on it repeatedly and walked away with it.  He's charged with felony, strong-armed robbery and criminal mischief.  Just a couple of hours ago, McGregor posted this on Instagram.  The shirt he's wearing says: McGregor is back.  He writes: \"Patience in this world is a virtue.  I continue to work on.  I love my fans, dearly.  Love you all.\"</p><p>Former Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl MVP, Nick Foles, will officially become a member of the Jacksonville Jaguars tomorrow.  His deal, four years, $88 million -- with $50 million of that guarantied.  Meanwhile, Foles, also yesterday, announced that he would become a brand ambassador for Lululemon.  He says, it's all about, like him, community mindfulness and the sweat life.  He's the first mainstream sports endorsers for Lululemon, which makes technical athletic clothes for those who sweat.  And Nick Foles knows how to sweat.  They say, \"We just landed the sought-after free agent in football.  Welcome to the team Nick Foles.\"  New start.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do we know what they're paying him, at Lululemon?</p><p>MAX:  We don't know yet what they're paying.  And he's getting a lot of money, though, to play for Jacksonville Jaguars, and now it'll be put up or shut up time, because he's got to kind of play as the understudy in Philadelphia -- not as much expected and he just performed one time after another.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  McGregor might want to shut up and stay at home.  What do you make 100 million on the Mayweather fight?  There's no quicker way to lose money all that money than basically being a steaming jerk.</p><p>MAX:  Is this good for the sport?  Is this good for UFC?  I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't think so.  No way.</p><p>BROOKS:  Yes, it's going to be more mainstream.  As it is, it looks too violent, it looks too fringe, and if you want to make it in mainstream sport, you have to make it mover civilized.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's very mainstream already, number one.  But I want to see another fight with Nurmagomedov --</p><p>MAX:  Khabib.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Khabib Nurmagomedov, yes.</p><p>BELL:  Well, I think it's kind of good marketing, because it will people want to come out and see the underdog beat this bad guy now, right?</p><p>MAX:  Yes, I agree.  I think for the mainstream, this guy is the face of a sport, a little bit more class.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Read Arthur's book, \"Love Your Enemies.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's exactly right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I would just say that sport is already main -- it's extremely mainstream now.</p><p>MAX:  And look at all the violence, we need to tone it down.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can't get mad about that, and I get mad about football.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  True.  Jared, thanks.</p><p>MAX:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7 or in radio SiriusXM 115.  Quick break and then eye on trade.  Investors are watching and waiting for a firm deal between U.S. and China, as no date has been set for a summit between Xi Jinping and President Trump.  More on that right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  U.S.-China trade now, markets were higher overnight in Asia.  As you see, investors are watching the future of a deal as top officials from both countries held a phone conversation overnight.  It comes amid uncertainty over meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping.  Right now, no date is on the calendar.  We were expecting the end of March in Mar-a-Lago.  Joining us now is Larrea Wealth Management CEO, Aquiles Larrea.  Great to see you, Aquiles.  Thanks for being here.  How much is a deal with China important for investors right now?</p><p>AQUILES LARREA, CEO, LARREA WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Well, it's important from the sense that it's kind of already figured into this market that we're seeing.  However, there are lots of nuances, we're seeing that China, which owns Volvo is looking to take that car maker electric.  We're also looking to see are they going to be able to -- with the soybeans, are they going to fulfill that obligation to the United States and with the current talks with Mnuchin and their counterparts, are we going to really see a difference in the trade talks or is it already priced in and is it a nonfactor?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, the tariffs are obviously a big issue, Dagen, you've been talking about the impact of tariffs for a long-time.  It's actually weakened China's economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's weakened China's economy, it's putting pressure on a bunch of different industries here in the United States as well, particularly in any industry that uses steel and aluminum.  But I know Lindsey wanted to get in.</p><p>BELL:  Yes.  No, I mean, the industrial sector is one area that's really benefited from the China expectation for a China deal to get done, up 18-1/2 percent year to date versus the market up like 9-1/2 percent.  But you like that are, why?  And how far do you see it going?</p><p>LARREA:  I tend to like areas that get beat up.  I mean, we're seeing with Boeing right now, even before all of this has happened, Boeing was up year to date 12 percent, and the year before it was up 24 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Huge.  Had a huge '18.</p><p>LARREA:  Yes.  I mean, huge take away of 30 plus percent even before all of this thing started.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that was based on commercial traffic and how well the economy was going.</p><p>LARREA:  Correct, and there are a lot of related industries in the industrials that could benefit from this short-term down trend, and of course long-term uptrend.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what are you saying about Boeing?  You want to buy it or sell it?  What do you say?</p><p>LARREA:  We're doing white boats from drills right now.  In other words, we're selling off a portion, and we're keeping little bit for a rainy day, but we're definitely taking a little bit of profits in there.</p><p>BROOKS:  What do you see, actually, as the business cycle going forward?  Are you one of the guys that's expecting in the next 12 months to start going into a real recession?</p><p>LARREA:  Well, you know, I'm not going to disagree with people that are much smarter than I.  You know, they tend to say, hey, we're looking at 2020, 2021 for recession, and I believe that is -- although it's possible, how severe will the recession be and I don't think it's going to be as severe as they are predicting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you've got to allocate capital based on the backdrop, what kind of backdrop are you expecting from the U.S. economy?</p><p>LARREA:  Well, you know, we're hoping that the U.S. economy is going to keep growing and with all the moves that we're making in place, that it's going to keep growing and we're going to keep benefiting from that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Aquiles, good to see you.  Thanks so much.</p><p>LARREA:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Aquiles Larrea.  We'll be right back.  We've got a story on Apple revealing the date for a big event, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Show: MORNINGS WITH MARIA][Date: March 12, 2019][Time: 07:00:00][Tran: 031202cb.231][Type: SHOW] [Head: Interview with Rep.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday, March 12th.</p><p>Your top stories right now 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Mixed market performances this morning.  Take a look at futures, mostly higher.  Although the Dow Industrials once again being weighed down by Boeing.  The Dow futures down 34 points.  S&amp;P 500 futures up 1.25 points.  And the Nasdaq up 8.5 right now.</p><p>This after gains across the board yesterday.  Stocks staging a late day rally yesterday driven by technology.  Check out those moves.  Dow Industrials up 200 points at 4:00 on Wall Street yesterday.  S&amp;P 500 was up 40.  And the Nasdaq, very powerful move there, up 150 points at the close yesterday, better than 2 percent as a big rally in tech stocks really fueled things.</p><p>Global markets this morning are mostly higher, although European indices are mixed.  FT 100 is struggling to stay positive, up just one and two-thirds points.  The CAC 40 in Paris is now negative by a fraction.  And the Dax index in Germany up eight and two-thirds points right now.</p><p>In Asia overnight, gains across the region.  As you see, best performer was Japan.  Nikkei average up one and three-quarters percent.</p><p>The groundings of Boeing 737 Max 8 jets are expanding around the world.  Nearly half of all of the jets that have been delivered since May of '17 are now parked -- half of those jets.  The fallout coming up.  As you see Boeing shares down another 2 percent right now and that's weighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi not interested in impeachment of President Trump she says.  Yesterday she said it's not worth it.  But not every body in her party feels that way.</p><p>Closer to an exit, British Prime Minister Theresa May making some progress on her deal to leave the European Union as she faces a key vote today.</p><p>And a Bugatti fit for a baby?  Luxury automaker unveiling a small scale car -- not a small price tag.  We'll tell you all about that beauty for your children.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.  And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, \"Love Your Enemy\" author Arthur Brooks here, and the CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell.  Great to see you this morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good to be here.</p><p>ARTHUR BROOKS, AUTHOR:  Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to point something out really quickly.  This is front page of the \"Wall Street Journal\" today, that the U.S. is telling Germany to drop Huawei or see intelligence sharing -- the pact on intelligence sharing pared back -- a warning sent to Berlin, a story that you were way ahead of.</p><p>When was the Secretary of State Pompeo interview?  February 21st?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  February 21st.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You would have known this story.  You didn't need to wait for it to be on the front page of the \"Wall Street Journal\" if you watch this program every day.</p><p>So again, really far ahead on the concerns about the theft by China of our intellectual property.  You've been talking about it for literally years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And you know, when he was in on that day, February 21st, I knew that when he said it, it was incredible news.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  For him to stand there and say yes, we're going to share less information with our European partners if they have Huawei telecom, that's just an enormous story.  Because obviously the Five Eyes they've got real partnerships that they should be able to trust your telecom systems.  But that's how threatening this Huawei story really is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is -- I know this working with you.  You have these incredible instincts about what is right and wrong.  And you can see what will be an important story way before many other people see it.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Major kudos, Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean I was looking at the story and I'm like, well yes, we did this a month ago, February 21st.</p><p>And this is a major issue, Arthur.</p><p>BROOKS:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Chinese and Huawei telecom systems being deployed across the world gives the Chinese an ability to tap into everybody's data.</p><p>BROOKS:  Yes.  I mean, when you're talking about a big American, private American company, you wouldn't say that that's tapping into the information by the American government.  The problem is that there's a distinction, without a difference in China between state-owned enterprises and those that aren't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BROOKS:  They share information with the government.  And you know, this is a back door when we're sharing information with our allies, if there's a Chinese partner involved, until the Chinese change the way that they do business, until they're more democratic and more transparent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Once we share it with our allies, we lose control of that information, we really -- we don't have any -- much control over how that partner would then use that information or protect it.</p><p>BROOKS:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, this is not just data about, hey, I went to the store yesterday.  You could track our soldiers.  This is data about the military.  This is data about plans that the U.S. has in place with our partners.</p><p>BROOKS:  Yes.  And this has been -- it's just the new age of actually how we conduct warfare effectively without shooting each other.  You have to have information on each other.  You can have breaches in security like crazy.  Who knows what the implications of this are.</p><p>The United States has to protect itself.  And you know, in China when there's no distinction between the private sector and the public sector, we can't trust.  And this is a big problem -- this is a big problem for China, quite frankly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I just want -- it's our defense, our intelligence and also our financial system.  They're all interconnected.  I think it was really important that the Fed chief, Jay Powell, said in that interview on Sunday, that this is the one thing that he worries about more than anything else and that is cyber attacks and attacks on our financial system by state actors --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- and so it's all inextricably linked together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And apparently, we get thousands of cyber intrusions attacks a day.</p><p>BROOKS:  For sure.  Oh, for sure.</p><p>BELL:  And so Germany's been put on notice here officially but Britain and Italy have been two that really have been also kind of pushing back on this, not no use of Huawei's technology.  Britain is -- they have a test lab analyzing some of their stuff and they're saying that there are no back doors.</p><p>But there is a lot of really sophisticated intertwined spaghettified code that runs their network that could change at any time.  This is software that can really --</p><p>BROOKS:  Yes.  It means no back doors that we know of.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, and it's Huawei telecom.  So you push a button and all of the data take goes back to the Chinese government.</p><p>BROOKS:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean that's the bottom line.  And that's what Secretary Pompeo was telling us when he was here in February and he did tell us that the U.K. In particular was pushing back on not using Huawei, because it's expensive.  They use this and they use this Chinese telecom because it was cheap.  So did African countries.</p><p>So this is a real issue.  We'll keep following it for sure.</p><p>The White House unveiling a $4.7 trillion budget proposal meanwhile.  That budget includes $8.6 billion to build the President's long-promised border wall and another $750 billion for national defense of which $718 will go to the Pentagon amount for the military.</p><p>A $33 billion increase for the military budget.  It would also cut $818 billion from projected Medicare spending over 10 years.</p><p>Press Secretary Sarah Sanders laid out a blueprint for the budget at yesterday's briefing -- watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  President Trump's 2020 budget which was released today builds upon incredible success and keeps his promises to the American people.</p><p>It continues the President's pro job creation policies, keeps taxes low, combats the opioid epidemic, protects our veterans, defends our nation and secures our borders.</p><p>This budget demonstrates the President's vision to restrain Washington spending and reach a balanced budget by 2034.  This is a clear road map for a more fiscally responsible future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is California Congressman, Armed Services Committee member John Garamendi.  Congressman -- it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. JOHN GARAMENDI (D), CALIFORNIA:  Good to be with you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the budget proposal.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  Doesn't work.  It simply doesn't work.  Doesn't take into account the extraordinary deficit that we have.  Doesn't take into account the real needs that we have.  And by the way, that's American taxpayer money, not Mexican money that's going to be building that wall.</p><p>And at the same time he's cutting about the same amount of money out of the flood protections that Americans need all across this nation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you say to those people who continue to bring up the lines of people, thousands of people who are trying to get to America over the border, porous borders?  What do you say about all of the threats that the military, the U.S. faces today, not just the obvious threats like ISIS and the issues around Syria, Afghanistan, et cetera; but also China and these quieter things that are not in your face every day but we know that they're real threats like Huawei telecom, all of these things that the U.S. is trying to combat.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  Well, that's precisely the problem with this budget.  It's putting the money exactly where we don't need it.  We do need to recognize that most of those people that are coming across the border now are families escaping from the Central American countries and they're coming through the ports of entry.  They're not coming across the open borders.</p><p>So the problem really lies at the ports of entry which need to be beefed up and in fact some of that money is for that purpose and that's a good thing.</p><p>But to spend that money on a wall that most everybody says is not particularly useful isn't the best place to spend it.</p><p>We clearly have problems with technology.  Huawei is definitely a problem.  Your previous section on that was right on point.  So we need to deal with cyber security.  A good portion of that military budget has to go into the cyber security issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  So there are many different things we need to do.  And we don't need to cut education.  We don't -- the healthcare, you did mention Medicare, but take a look at Medicaid.  Over the next 10 years it will be $1.5 trillion reduction in Medicare --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  -- 60 percent of that goes to seniors.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The spending didn't just happen over the last two years, right.  I mean this has been an issue now for a decade or more in terms of this deficit.  Here's Arthur Brooks from AEI.</p><p>BROOKS:  Hi, Congressman.  One of the things that you would think that Republicans would be worried about is deficit spending but apparently they're not at this point.  I realize it's an aspirational budget.  Are Democrats now for the first time in a long time worried about deficit spending now that the Republicans apparently are not?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's not forget that the debt was doubled under President Obama from $10 trillion to $20 trillion.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  And let's not forget that most of that occurred as a result of the great collapse in 2008.</p><p>But leaving that aside, the tax cut that occurred in December of 2017 really amped up the deficit.  The deficit hawks simply left Washington.  My guess is, that they're going to return and there's going to be a mighty battle that will include the deficit.</p><p>I know the Democrats, we were very, very concerned about the deficit and remain concerned about it because ultimately, it is not sustainable.  The notion that we're going to have a balanced budget 14, 15 years out from now ignores the fact that we're probably going to wind up doubling the amount of money that we have to spend on interest payments over that period of time and it assumes over a 3 percent annual growth rate in the American economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So let me ask you this -- Congressman.  How do you explain all of these sky in the pie --</p><p>GARAMENDI:  Sky in the pie.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- you know, pie in the sky -- yes, pie in the sky ideas like a $93 trillion Green New Deal or a $32 trillion Medicare for all deal when you've got $22 trillion in debt?</p><p>GARAMENDI:  Doesn't work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  But these are coming from -- these are coming from your colleagues, obviously, right on the Democratic side.  If the Dems are so interested and worried about debt, how come they have no problem bringing forth these expensive ideas?</p><p>GARAMENDI:  Well, let's start with the Green New Deal.  If you take a look at it, we really do have a climate crisis.  We have to deal with it.  The Green New Deal speaks to many of the issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think the climate crisis is a bigger crisis than the crisis at the border?</p><p>GARAMENDI:  Absolutely it is.  No doubt about it.  And anybody that thinks otherwise isn't looking at what's happening around the world.  Sea level rise.</p><p>This week I'm going to be holding a hearing in my subcommittee, the readiness subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. Right now we've got a $3 billion problem at Camp LeJeune because of the flooding that took place last summer.  And we have an equal problem down at Tindall Air Force Base in Florida.  It was basically wiped out by a hurricane.  We've got to deal with the reality of the climate change just with the military alone.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then we should spend the $90 trillion then?</p><p>GARAMENDI:  No, I didn't say that, did I?  You may have said it.  But I didn't say it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  No.  Let's get real here.  The Medicare for all is an issue that's been out there for a long time, clearly Medicare works.  The Medicare for all legislation that's been proposed isn't Medicare.  It's really something quite different than that.  And we do need to deal with climate change.</p><p>You take a look at your city there in New York.  New York has extraordinary expenses, just to protect itself from the rising sea level and the inevitable hurricane that will come up the East Coast.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If New York cared about climate change then why doesn't our mass transit system work?  That's my biggest issue.  The mayor's talking about meatless Monday to save the planet.  And there's one thing that can save the planet and we have the largest city in the country and the subways don't work and the commuter rail system is an abomination.  I just had to say that.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because I get angry.  Do not take the subway.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  I hope you feel better now.  Yes, it is a problem.  And we do need mass transportation all across this nation.  That's a great place to spend our money.</p><p>Also, if you take a look at the President's budget, his transportation program is exactly what he put together last year which is no new money.</p><p>So we've got to really focus here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- apparently your colleague Nancy Pelosi says she does not want to impeach President Trump.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  Well, let's see what happens.  All of the investigations are incomplete.  When those investigations get complete, then the question of impeachment is really on the table.  Right now, it's not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right -- Congressman.  it's good to see you this morning, sir.</p><p>GARAMENDI:  Always a pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.</p><p>John Garamendi -- back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The list of countries and airlines grounding the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet is growing this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Maria -- this is interesting.</p><p>Australia has become the latest country to suspend the aircraft from its airports due to the deadly crash in Ethiopia on Sunday.  The country following similar moves by China, South Africa, Singapore, Indonesia, Brazil, even Mexico.</p><p>Here in the United States, though, the FAA still says it has no plans to ground the aircraft for now but it has ordered Boeing to make urgent improvements to it.  Boeing has confirmed it will deploy a software upgrade to -- software upgrade to the 737 Max 8.</p><p>Two airlines that fly that aircraft certainly not a (INAUDIBLE); and American, stock fell more than 5 percent yesterday.  It's lower again in the premarket today, 2 and a quarter percent to the downside.</p><p>Well, customers of United Healthcare are getting a new discount.  The insurance says that all of its Optum Pharmacies are going to pass drug maker rebates directly to the customers.  The policy takes effect in January.  This is the latest effort by the insurers to pass along more prescription drug savings to customers in the face of intense criticism from the Trump administration.</p><p>And then there's this, Apple announcing a major event this month.  It's going to take place on March 25th.</p><p>Apple is expected to debut its long-anticipated streaming service that will compete with Netflix and Hulu and Amazon Prime.  As far as the hardware, Apple has traditionally brought out new iPads in March and the next version of air pods might make an appearance.  There's talk that it might be a wireless air pod charging situation.</p><p>Shares of Apple are higher -- slightly higher in the premarket.  Apple actually has been paying some big name celebrities to develop television shows which Variety has been reporting on Maria?  So this is all kind of making sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  they're spending big money.  Everybody's got to keep up with Netflix I guess -- to compete, in terms of original content.</p><p>Thank you -- Cheryl</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, artificial intelligence in healthcare, how A.I. could improve your future checkups.</p><p>And then a baby Bugatti, the auto maker rolling out a new kids' ride with an adult price tag.  The cost coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Artificial intelligence transforming medicine.  Healthcare is seeing an increased use of A.I. but some are worried about its continued impact on the industry.</p><p>Joining us right now is Scripps Research executive vice president, the author of \"Deep Medicine\", Eric Topol.  Eric -- good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ERIC TOPOL, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, SCRIPPS RESEARCH:  Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, you say the U.K. is ahead of the U.S. In terms of A.I. being implemented in healthcare.  How, specifically?</p><p>TOPOL:  Well, I spent the last year and-a-half as -- commissioned as a review for the government for the NHS.  And I learned that they're started implement A.I., like, for example, getting rid of keyboards, so doctors don't do any typing, in emergency room settings, no less.  Patients love that because they have eye contact.</p><p>And reading scans, medical scans so that it revs up what a radiologist can do and then the leader in the world of genomics.  So they're taking the sequence and all the data that we've been talking about for years and they're actually implementing it into day-to-day practice.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's exactly one of the jobs Dagen that Kai Fu Lee said would go away -- radiologists.  Because reading the radiology -- the reading can be done quicker and easier by a machine, by A.I.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How long will that be before that happens?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  In the U.S.</p><p>TOPOL:  That's happening in China right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's happening in China right now.</p><p>TOPOL:  More accurate than a lot of radiologists and of course a lot faster and a lot less expensive.  But, you know, there is a concern that you want to have these algorithms at perfection level because if they're making a mistake, that's at scale.  They can't tolerate that.</p><p>So there's skepticism about implementing that in this country and I understand that but --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because there's implicit bias.</p><p>TOPOL:  Yes.  The bias is mainly the human side because the machine, once you put in the learning network, it's clean of bias.  But it's what we put in that's a problem.</p><p>At any rate we can get some accuracy, productivity, work flow improvement.  It's remarkable.  But we have to get on it and we don't have any resources.</p><p>We're talking about cutting the NIH budget when it actually is a way to invest to get A.I. to the point where it will be ready to implement and people are comfortable about it.</p><p>BROOKS:  One of the questions that we often have, you know, a lot of people watching us when they think about A.I. and, you know, machines taking over our healthcare system, they're not going to be able to talk to their doctor.</p><p>And this is actually pretty important for people because they feel better cared for when they're talking to a human.</p><p>TOPOL:  Right.</p><p>BROOKS:  What can you tell me about this?  Are you saying that the A.I. is going to enhance the human to human experience or are we going to be all talking to a computer and have that assess our health.</p><p>TOPOL:  That's the theme of deep medicine.  And that is, that we flip this, that little time we have with patients, which is average on seven minutes in an appointment, we now can augment that time because so much of the work is outsourced to machines.</p><p>And so with that gift of time, it gives that human touch, the bond.  We bring back the past.  Decades ago when this was a precious relationship, we can restore that now because we have machines and algorithms to get us back there.</p><p>BELL:  What about the cost?  You sort of alluded to that, budgets being cut for healthcare.  What about policy costs?  How do we get to where the U.K. is?</p><p>TOPOL:  Well, we have to dedicate resources like they have, put tens of billions of pounds into this A.I. implementation.  We haven't done that.  I hope we will because this is -- double down on this, it's going to be a great investment for saving costs in the future.</p><p>But more importantly I think is the care.  We've lost the care.  It's eroded because of the business of healthcare.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you're saying that the care in the socialized medical system in Britain is better than ours.  The outcomes are better than ours?</p><p>TOPOL:  That's been shown by the Commonwealth Fund which is a U.S. based --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I find that so hard to believe.</p><p>TOPOL:  I thought I was too.  When I when there to do this review, I had the same impression that it was going to be a very different look.  In fact, the NHS is the most revered institution in the U.K., above the royal family and the BBC.  And in the Commonwealth Fund, which is U.S.-based, it ranked U.K. first and out of 17 countries, you the U.S. 17th.  That's a U.S. neutral, very in depth review.   o it isn't what it seems.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  In outcomes across all diseases and medical conditions?</p><p>TOPOL: That's right.  In fact, the U.S. is worse, I think you know, for not only life expectancy, infant mortality, childhood mortality, material morality.  we're the worst of 37 countries.  We've got to do better.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This California hospital is facing backslash after the robotic telemedicine device told a family that their loved one is dying.  The machine displayed the video of a remote doctor who gave the family information about the appropriate amount of morphine to ease the patient's suffering.  Is this what we're talking about?</p><p>TOPOL:  This is pathetic, lack of care.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Totally pathetic.</p><p>TOPOL:  And it's not a robot.  It's a human doctor who is saying to a person you're going to die.  This is not the way to convey news, on a video.  So this thing about the robot, there's nothing about that.  That's not A.I.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're saying A.I. In the U.K. is superior to the U.S., not the healthcare system in terms of insurance, because we've got umpteen stories of those people who waited forever to get in, to get a procedure done, it was all done by bureaucrats.  But you're saying the A.I. input is superior, not necessarily the system and the way it works.</p><p>TOPOL:  The outcomes are and we're talking about one-third of the cost.  Instead of $11,000 per person, $13,000 in the U.S., we're talking about $4,000 in the U.K. per person in healthcare.  Some of the outcomes across the board are better -- not just A.I.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Eric -- great to have you on the program.</p><p>TOPOL:  Great to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for the info.</p><p>Eric Topol joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, Britain's crucial vote, Prime Minister Theresa May's plan to leave the E.U. Facing parliament today.</p><p>Then the wizarding world is going with you. Harry Potter entering mobile gaming by the creators of Pokemon Go.

There she is leaving her office.  Lawmakers are set to vote today on her withdrawal deal nearly two months after it suffered the largest ever commons defeat.  This as Theresa May says she has secured last minute concessions ahead of the vote.</p><p>Joining us right now, Fox Business reporter Ashley Webster who's been in London following this for several months now.  Ashley, good morning to you.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Groundhog Day.  Good morning to you Maria and everyone here.  Listen, did you see that the prime minister wasn't exactly smiling as she was getting into her car outside number 10.  Last night, there was euphoria.  She gone to  Strasbourg, spoken with the new leaders.  We have concessions, this is the deal that can get through, and then about 10 minutes ago the U.K. attorney general Geoffrey  Cox basically looked at the document, the new concessions and said, legal risk remains unchanged of the U.K. being trapped or stuck  in that Northern Ireland backstop, in other words nothing is really changed from the vote that they took on this plan back in January that was defeated by 230 votes.</p><p>So, things have changed a little bit.  I do not believe she can get this plan through today.  There's going to be a vote 07:00 p.m., U.K. time on this deal and I don't think it's going to go through, based on what the attorney general has said.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, people want a resolution, they want another resolution.</p><p>WEBSTER:  They do.  And you know, we were just saying, there is tremendous --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then it will never go through, right?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, if it gets knocked down tonight, which it probably will, I think based on this legal opinion, that the next thing will be a vote tomorrow on a no deal.  That will be defeated because 77 percent of M.P. voted to remain in the E.U. anyway.  They have no desire to drop out of the E.U. with no deal.</p><p>So, that means date on Thursday they'll have a vote on a delay of article 50, the Brexit deadline of March 29th.  And that could indeed go through.  So, how long will the delay be?  Who knows?  Three months, six months?  But the problem with that is that during that period of time you can expect an even softer Brexit than what Theresa May is offering now.</p><p>ARTHUR BROOKS, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE:  Ashley, what does it mean for her government?  What does it mean for Theresa May --</p><p>WEBSTER:  It's not good at all.  She has been -- this is -- this has been her entire premiership has been dealing with this.  So it will be three years in June since this vote was taken.  And if she can't get this across the line, I think her time in number 10 is up, t be honest with you.</p><p>She said she was going to quit before the next general election next year.  But if she can't get this through and we're left in chaos, she could very well see a general election called and I think she may be out.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Well, if they do ask for an extension, how is the E.U. going to respond?  Because you saw Jean-Claude Juncker say, like, you're not going to have a lot of options out of this.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right, but they've said this is it, you're not getting another deal.  And that's a good question, all 27 E.U. countries have to agree to the extension, I can't see them not.  But then the question becomes what can you achieve in the next three or six months that you couldn't achieve in the last three years?</p><p>So, you know, it just leaves the uncertainty.  If you watched Sterling last night, in a 22 month high against the E.U. as their announcement came from  Strasbourg 10 minutes ago, immediately dropped and is now down considerably against the Euro and the U.S. dollar because it's clear that this deal is not going to happen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Can I pivot back to the conversation we were having about the British healthcare system.  This notion that it's some sort of gold standard on the world stage.  Because I know that you would disagree with that.</p><p>BROOKS:  Yes, I know I would.  I mean, --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We were all shocked at what he was saying.  I was like, how is this possible?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The mortality rates in the United States are higher than comparable countries in across a number of different causes of death.  I will (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>WEBSTER:  I lived with the NHS for a long time.  And I was saying, my experience was good.  But I lived next to a hospital that was very highly rated.  I was an accident prone kid.  I was in and out all the time with broken collar bones and God knows what.  And it was very, very good.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But, what about the cost of it?</p><p>BROOKS:  Well, the cost is overwhelming.  And it's basically, there's danger that it's going to be a central factor in cratering the British economy in the next 10 years.  I mean, it's just the cost per patient is enormous.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It is.</p><p>BROOKS:  Not to mention the fact that the U.S. system, the fact we have bad outcomes on average is driven by the bottom 25 percent of the population which is where we needed to take care of things that we've been trying to deal with.  So the idea that --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're talking about smoking, opioids, obesity.</p><p>BROOKS:  Type two diabetes.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It's not free.  NHS is not free.  It comes out under your -- on your paycheck, you'll see national insurance.  Everyone pays for it.  You just don't get a bill when you go to the hospital.</p><p>BROOKS:  Right.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It's just, they treat you, you go home, there's no bill.  But you do pay for it.  Everybody pays for it through their salary.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And it's a much smaller country in terms of the attempted application about which is fully socialized medicine indeed.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.  Anyone who can afford private insurance in the U.K., gets private insurance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Righ.  Well, they were all in in Obamacare.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>BROOKS:  But the idea that we could scale that to a country of 330 million people, it's just insane.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, it's all about the economy and Britain and so.  That's a looming tsunami that Theresa May will have to deal with or one of the next prime minister or the one after that.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I mean, God bless her.  She stood up very well with arrows raining down on her every day.  But I think time is ticking and I think she could be out in the near future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, what does that mean?  Like in days?</p><p>WEBSTER:  General election, could we have a Jeremy Corbin prime minister?  God, I hope not.  But I don't think so.  I don't think Corbin has a lot of support.  He certainly in the labor party, maybe, but I don't know.  There's a lot of uncertainty which is hurting the economy, hurting business, and it's continuing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the rise of anti-Semitism in that party are hurting labor as well.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It's awful.  Awful.  People are bailing out of that party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's incredible the level of anti-Semitism, the level of anti-Americanism as well.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Oh, yes.</p><p>BROOKS:  We'll watch that space by the way, if you want to see what can happen on the American left, watch what's happening on the British left.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Absolutely.  There's a lot of parallels right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But what would that be?</p><p>BROOKS:  Well, I mean, when you see people saying overtly anti-Semitic things, whether they're anti-Semitics or not, I mean there's no reason to charge people of that.  But if they're saying anti-Semitic things, this is originating in leftist parties all around the world.  We have to take and to keep an eye on this.  This is the way that the worldwide left is moving and we see it actually taking over a party in Great Britain.  Maybe this is something we should pay attention to in the United States as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And what you've seen here with Nancy Pelosi kind of dismissing Omar's comments (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why can't she denounce Omar?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I've said this, that trivializes and ultimately normalizes a hatred bigotry that lead not that long ago to the murder of six million Jews.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you're right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, again, you have to be very careful because silence is accepting the unacceptable and making excuses for what are clearly anti-Semitic remarks is really beyond the pale.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it really is.  And why is she still on the Foreign Affairs Committee?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  If she cannot be fair to Israel and the Jews, she needs to step off.  But Nancy Pelosi refuses to do this.  It's an incredible story.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She doesn't understand and just doesn't know how to express herself well.  Well, you know what, there were some anti-Semitic tropes she was putting out in Twitter back in 2012.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, exactly.  Ashley, thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ashley Webster.</p><p>Coming up, keeping your kids safe, care.com, overhauling the vetting of babysitters after an alarming investigation, the caregiver controversy coming up.</p><p>And then, Bugatti's new ride.

Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Maria, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted last night about this.  He said the U.S. will withdraw all remaining personnel from at U.S. Embassy V.E. this week.  This decision reflecting the deteriorating situation in Venezuela as well as the conclusion that the presidents of U.S. Diplomatic staff at the embassy has become a constraint on U.S. policy.</p><p>Now, as the country's crisis continues, opposition leader Juan Guaido was on \"TRISH REGAN PRIMETIME\".  He said he will seek foreign military help.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUAN GUAIDO, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF VENEZUELA (through translator):  It is part of article 187 of our national constitution, which is not only for Venezuela, but it allows for an outside country to cooperate or to assist the Venezuela in this sense, as we -- as stated in this article of our constitution, which empowers me as the person-in-charge to employ whatever measures are necessary to enact this cooperation and this assistance for Venezuela.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, socialist President Nicolas Maduro maintains support right now from Russia, China, and Cuba.</p><p>All right, care.com unveiling new policies to improve its vetting system and background checks after a Wall Street Journal investigation.  Care.com says it's going to also take steps to remove fake day-care center listings.  This is the country's largest marketplace for baby-sitters and other caregivers, 32 million members.  The Journal investigation showed that the company's limited vetting of caregivers on its site well, frankly, was a problem.</p><p>OK, here is this, a magical new mobile game from the creators of Pokemon Go, it is Harry Potter: Wizards Unite.  It lets players interact with monsters and rival wizards using augmented reality.  This is very similar to Pokemon Go, which generated over $2 billion in revenue since it launched in 2016.  Harry Potter: Wizards Unite is set to come out later this year.  Harry Potter will never go away.</p><p>Then there is this, the famous Bugatti baby is being reborn.  The French car maker is giving the car a modern makeover for its 110th birthday.  The limited edition Baby II, it is mainly for kids, yes, it is much smaller than the original.  Top speed, 12 miles per hour in child mode.  All electric vehicle, Maria, $34,000.  Because what child doesn't need their own Bugatti?  Every child in America needs a Bugatti.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my God.  That is crazy.</p><p>CASONE:  Jesus, I don't think I could afford that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>BROOKS:  Maria, I don't know.  Maria, when -- you know, I'm so against socialism.  I'm so against it, but when I see the baby Bugatti, I'm thinking maybe socialism.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  $34,000 is a bargain though.  Because a real Bugatti is deep in the seven figures if you can ever get one.  So, you can't even get -- even if you had the coin, it's hard to get one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But you don't really want your 5-year-old driving around in that, right?  or 10-year-old.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maria, if I dropped some lbs, I could fit into it.  You know, it would be a good way to get around New York City maybe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You could fit into it right now -- you could fit into it right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Less annoying -- less annoying than a man with a pony tail on a scooter at age 50.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  Oh God, what a vision.</p><p>All right, quick break and then more savings than credit card debt, the solutions for a better financial future coming up.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Debt concerns are rising.  A new survey from Bankrate finds that 29 percent of Americans have more credit card debt than emergency savings.  39 million Americans have carried credit card debt for at least two years.</p><p>Joining us rights now is Ramsey Solution's financial expert, author of Everyday Millionaires, Chris Hogan.  And I know this is a real important one for you.  You're a stickler for debt, Chris.</p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTION:  Well, I really am, Maria, because debt is a thief.  It steals from your income.  It prevents you from taking care of the people that you love the most but also preparing for your financial future.  And so I want Americans to wake up and see debt for what it is.  A lot of people see it as a friend but in reality, it's an enemy, it's a preventer of your dreams.</p><p>BELL:  Hi, Chris, Lindsey Bell here.  So, what do we do if I've got a heck of a lot of debt and I've got no savings, what do I do with my paycheck?  How much of it do I put towards the debt versus savings?</p><p>HOGAN:  That's a great question, Lindsey.  I think the first thing is is budgeting.  Budgeting allows us to have control over our money.  So sit down, understand your income but also understand your expenses.</p><p>Now, the next step in attacking debt is to list your debt out.  Sit down, write it down, list it from smallest to biggest.</p><p>You see, I want you to attack the little one first because getting out of debt, it's about momentum.  It's not about interest rate.  So attack the little one while making minimum payments on the others and then you'll really begin to see progress.  But as you pay off one debt, take what you were paying there and move it to the next one.  It's the called the debt snow ball and I'm telling you, it's helped millions of people get out of debt.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I look at this increased income, Chris.  You always talked about getting a second job but if somebody's got a family and working 45 hours a week, 50 hours a week, not 80, which is what Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said, it's very hard to get a second job.  How do you increase your income outside of that?</p><p>HOGAN:  Well, Dagen, I think the first way to increase your income is by budgeting to have control over it.  The next step is to attack debt to get the debt out of your life.  When you get out of debt, you give yourself a raise.</p><p>But again, take a look around the house.  We all have so much stuff.  And Dagen, I know you do.  You can sell stuff to make extra money and take that money and send it to our debt.  Think of the talents that you have.  Maybe you could tutor, maybe you could do some things on the weekend.  Jobs are out there and they're available.  I just want people to realize, they've got to take control.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's selling your stuff though is some Marie Kondo magic.  You get --</p><p>BELL:  Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You go through your home and you window everything down to I only need four shirts, I only need X number of pairs of shoes.  There are so many places that you can sell things nowadays.  It's kind of astonishing.  And I'm a real reel person.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I've sold so much stuff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The real reeal.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, I have sold so much stuff.  You're right, Chris.</p><p>HOGAN:  No, it will --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's also gold, like old gold necklaces.  I mean, gold is selling at good prices.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jewelry, you'd be surprised.  You would be surprised.</p><p>BROOKS:  And by the way, everybody's talking about how when you simplify your life, you get happier.  So, maybe you get happier when you're actually getting yourself out of debt, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Look at Chris, he's never not smiling.</p><p>HOGAN:  I'm going to tell you right now, you get out of debt, you're going to be a whole lot happier because you don't have this thief stealing out of your pocket.  And so, you will be happier.  You'll improve the quality of your life, but you'll also give yourself a raise.  So, I want people to get out of debt and build up an emergency fund.</p><p>BROOKS:  Hi Chris, I've got a -- I've got a quick question for you.  And I know this is not what you're talking about but I've got to move you to one thing that we're about to talk about on the show which is the national debt and the deficit that we're talking about.  You said that debt is a thief, it's a preventer of our dreams, it steals from our children and our future.  Look what's going on with the U.S. debt, Chris.  I've got to have you weigh in.  We're going to want to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  22 point --</p><p>BROOKS:  $1.1 trillion in deficit spending in 2020.  Are we in your view -- are we -- are we empowering a thief?  Are we stealing from our future?  What say you?</p><p>HOGAN:  Oh, I think without a doubt, we're out of control in how we view debt.  We're looking at it as a tool from a government standpoint and so I want Americans to take back control.  Each and every household, take control of your money and then -- you know, the government needs to follow suit.  This trillions of dollars of debt, it's not going to go away by itself.  We've got to do something different to get a different result.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, give the appropriate as a caller in Washington, Chris.  Thank you so much.  Good to see you.</p><p>HOGAN:  Thank you all, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chris Hogan.

Great to see you this morning.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Good morning.</p><p>ARTHUR BROOKS, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE:  Good morning.</p><p>BELL:  Lots to cover today, from Brexit, to the budget and Boeing.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We should point out because you mentioned that nearly half of the planes delivered since May of 2017 have been ground by other nations but the Federal Aviation Administration has held off grounding Boeing planes after the crash waiting to see what they find out about this particular crash, although the FAA is expected by the end of next month to mandate a software fix for the automated-flight control system that did play a role in the first crash in Indonesia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Which is why -- what is it, southwest and American airlines have 737s, they haven't taken them out of the lineup, they're there as -- following the FAA's cues.</p><p>BELL:  Well, and safety authorities here in the U.S. have been very careful on tying the Ethiopian Air accident just recently to the Lion Air accident that happened in October but you have China out there, their regulators saying that there could be a connection, it's really very uncertain, a lot of people here are saying it's too early to draw connection.</p><p>BROOKS:  Their people -- the companies are very worried that the flying public is going to panic, and so that's why they're taking them off just in advance for that reason but there is no evidence at this point that there's a problem with the plane.  I strongly suspect that it's -- it will be cleared quickly and Boeing is going to be fine.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and China's reaction you have to look as Maria did yesterday at the backdrop of what's going on between the United States and China and some nations to suggest that China somehow knows more about a crash in Ethiopia than the U.S. safety regulators do and they were in the ground almost immediately in the country as part of the investigation of black boxes being -- have been recovered.</p><p>But there is that kind of rash move by some countries, potentially to make the United States look bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Boeing sells a third of all of that plane 737 to China.  Obviously, China --</p><p>BROOKS:  It's an incredible safe aircraft.  It has incredible safety record.  There's no evidence that something horrible were going wrong worldwide.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is what Dennis Muhlenberg told us the end of last year, the CEO of Boeing.  Meanwhile, President Trump outlines his plans to defense and border spending in his 2020 budget.  Blake Burman is at the White House this morning with the very latest there.  Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to you as well.  This is third budget put forth by President Trump and his administration but the first time that they have put a budget forward in which Democrats control the appropriations process up on the Hill in the House of Representatives.  The President wish list includes increasing defense spending by five percent, up to $750 billion.</p><p>While, also decreasing nondefense discretionary spending by that same amount, five percent.  Pair that the request $8.6 billion for new funding for the border wall and it's why Democrats say this is going nowhere fast, dead on arrival.  Senator Elizabeth Warren taking to Twitter last night, she wrote the following of the President's budget saying \"A budget is more about -- is about more than numbers, a budget is about values and the budge the President released today is another big wet kiss to the super rich and giant corporations and it guts programs for everyone else.\"</p><p>Now, she is echoing complaints from Democrats about the spending levels for Medicare and Medicaid but the Trump administration insists those levels are not being rolled back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUSSELL VOUGHT, ACTING WHITE HOUSE BUDGET DIRECTOR:  What we are doing is putting forward reforms that lower drug prices that because Medicare pays a very large share of drug prices in this country, has the impact of finding savings.  We're also finding ways, fraud, and abuse but Medicare spending will go up every year by healthy margins and no structural changes for Medicare beneficiaries.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  The budget that was put forth yesterday, Maria, would balance in 15th year.  It also includes deficits of somewhere between a trillion dollars, and $1.1 trillion for fiscal years '19, '20, '21, and '22.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big numbers there.  Blake, thank you.  Blake Burman at the White House.  Joining us right now is the New Voice CEO, former Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain.  Herman, it's good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>HERMAN CAIN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE NEW VOICE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not every president gets his budget proposals materialized, right?  What's your view on all of this?</p><p>CAIN:  At least, it's a budget.  I don't think the Democrats put forth a budget that was balanced in the eight years that Obama was president.  Second, it doesn't matter what budget the President puts forth, the Democrats are going to punch holes in it.  One of the most impressive parts of the budget to me is the fact that he says there is going to be a five percent across the board cut in nondiscretionary spening.</p><p>And it's going to come from looking for savings.  This is what a leader does.  The leader mandates a target and it's up to those that are running the various departments to go out and find those savings.  I've had to do that as the CEO and that's exactly what the President is doing.</p><p>BROOKS:  Hello, Mr. Cain, Arthur Brooks here from EEI.  It's nice to see you again.  I worry a lot when I see this, you know, when I see $1.1 trillion deficit in the best economy in the past 35 years which I saw great but we can't be running deficits like this when the thing is -- when we're an expansion, we're going to -- we're going to -- governments always do this, you know, we're going to -- we're balance this thing in the out-years.</p><p>We don't exactly know how but we're really going to do it and I know you've got to be skeptical about this too.  So give some hard advice and some real criticism to your brother Republicans.</p><p>CAIN:  The hard advice would be go find those savings, get serious about restraining spending.  That would be the hard advice.  The problem of it is that they never get serious about it.  Republicans or Democrats.</p><p>BROOKS:  Right.</p><p>CAIN:  You can't just -- you can't just blame President Trump and his administration who has been there now a little over two years for this mess that we are in.  Secondly, no one has mentioned that revenues to the treasury because of the tax cuts are up.  So you've got those going up which is a good thing but he is now also trying to put the brakes on spending, and all the Democrats can do is criticize, criticize, criticize and say we're not going to approve any money fort wall,</p><p>I think the President has taken bold step and at least putting this directional budget on the table.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But he hasn't taken a step towards bold spending cuts because again what two-thirds of Federal spending, Herman, are on autopilot or because of entitlement programs.  And there's no evidence -- again, President Trump ran on it, I'm not going to touch Social Security, I'm not going to touch Medicare, that's fine and dandy, I know he's got to run for reelection in 2020 again.  But if you keep -- again, this never gets discussed and never gets talked about by anybody.</p><p>CAIN:  You are right. Dagen.  The non-- the discretionary portion hasn't been touched because it's to require central changes.  The President has not addressed that yet.  I agree with you.  But if the President can't get a few measly billions of dollars for a wall, do you think that the Democrats and the liberals and the lunatics are going to let him get away within structural recommendations?  No.  Not yet.  I don't know when he is going to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CAIN:  But I do believe that before his first term is up he is going to get around to proposing some structural changes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean, they're going to be pushing back and they are pushing the Democratic National Committee looking into 2020 announcing that its chosen Milwaukee, Wisconsin to host the 2020 convention.  Republicans were quick to point out that the socialist history is pretty alive and well in Milwaukee, the town has elected three socialist mayors in the past.  The Wisconsin GOP tweeted this yesterday, with the 2020 Democrat presidential primary field currently stumbling over each other in a race for the radical left.</p><p>It makes sense that their party would choose to hold its convention and the only American city that has elected three socialist mayors.  It feels like this 2020 election is going to be a very clear choice between socialism versus capitalism, Herman.</p><p>CAIN:  I would absolutely agree with you.  Let's not forget, Milwaukee is in Wisconsin and it's a big mea culpa on behalf of Hillary Clinton because she did not go there when she ran for president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CAIN:  That is the other factor I think is at play and trying to go and show some love to the State of Wisconsin.  But a bigger point --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Herman, it can be summed up in two words.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Cheese curds.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BROOKS:  The Democratic Party is doing an epic trolling --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BROOKS:  -- by actually going to the state where she didn't -- she didn't campaign.  They're just trolling their own candidate.  This is the most amazing  thing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And why would -- do they not realize that?  Do they not get it?  What about the issue of socialism versus capitalism?  Are people clear on the differences?  Do you think -- I mean, because, you know,  you've got all of these ideas, the Green New Deal, you've got the Medicare for all, the tax on wealth, 70 percent tax rate.  Do people understand what this means and what these Federal programs look like, socialist, federal government takeovers?</p><p>CAIN:  Some people don't understand the difference between capitalism and socialism but the good news is most people know that socialism has never worked in a country, in the history of the world.  So the Republicans and the conservatives and all the voices out there, the big challenge is to make sure that people understand.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CAIN:  I am a firm believer that if people have the right information and the right understanding, they will make the right decision.  That is no contest between capitalism and socialism.  All you have to do is look at the success of the United States of America and make sure that the people understand that and they will not be swayed by these empty socialist promises coming from all the Democrat presidential wanna-bes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll see, we'll see.  All right, Herman.  Great to see you this morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>CAIN:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we didn't even get to Nancy Pelosi saying she doesn't want to impeach the President, Herman. We'll save that for next time.  Herman Cain.</p><p>CAIN:  OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up right after this, global backlash over Boeing this morning.  More countries across the world moving to suspend the 737 Max 8 jet in the aftermath of the deadly crash in Ethiopia.  We're breaking down the fallout.  And then internet revolution.  The World Wide Web turns 30 years old but its creator is issuing a warning sign.  What he is saying.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  I'm Cheryl Casone with some top headlines.  We're following more countries are grounding Boeing's 737 Max 8 jet.  Malaysia and Australia, the latest country to suspend the aircraft from their airports after the deadly crash in Ethiopia on Sunday.  The countries follow similar moves in China, South Africa, Singapore, Indonesia, Brazil and Mexico.</p><p>But here in the United States the FAA says it has no plans to ground the aircraft for now but it has ordered Boeing to make urgent improvements to it.  Boeing confirming it will deploy a software upgrade to the 737 Max 8.  Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg defended the airplane's safety to Maria after the Lion Air crash.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MUILENBURG:  The real bottom line here, the key is that the 737 Max is very safe and we're very confident in that.  Safety is a core value for our industry and for our company.  Always has been, it always will be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But was there a change in terms of this model, the 737 that wasn't articulated to the pilots at the airlines that they did not know how to respond in the event of a change.  That's what the charges are.</p><p>MUILENBURG:  Yes.  The 737 Max has some new capabilities that are embedded in it and that's included in the training process that we go through.  You know, the airplane has gone through thousands and thousands of hours of testing and simulation, working with our pilots ensuring that they have all the information they need to safely operate the airplane.  And in some cases, those new systems are designed to take advantage of the capabilities of the airplane.</p><p>We've already issued a couple of follow-up bulletins coming out of the ongoing investigation pointing pilots to existing flight procedures to handle with the kind of scenarios that we're talking about in this incident.  So we're going to continue to do that.  It's very important that we provide all of the information need to safely operate these airplanes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, Boeing stock down more than five percent yesterday.  It is now lower again in the premarket today down 3-1/4 percent as you can see here.  Well, Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan is going to testify before House Financial Services today, he's going to be grilled on the bank's fake account scandal.  First time a bank CEO is going to appear before the committee that is now led by Democrats but Sloan's future is in question.</p><p>Regulators are seeking answers on whether he can repair the bank's image.  Over the last year Wells Fargo stock down nearly 15 percent.  Well, automakers Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi have created a new board of directors that excludes former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn.  The new board will oversee the French-Japanese partnership meeting every month in Tokyo or Paris.  Ghosn is still one of eight members of Nissan's board but his recent request to attend the Nissan board meeting was rejected by a judge.</p><p>Ghosn released last week from the Tokyo jail for $9 million bail after spending more than 100 days behind bars.  He is accused of underreporting a salary at Nissan which he still denies.  And then there is this, the internet 30 turns 30 today.  Google celebrating with this doodle.  You can see it if you go to Google.  But the creator of the World Wide Web has a warning for all of us.  In a blog post Tim Berners-Lee writes, the web has brought a lot of good but also dysfunction.</p><p>And he says it's time for everyone to work towards trying to change the web for the better.  All right.  We've got a lot more coming up.  Investors eyeing U.S.-China trade as the top negotiators reportedly hold a call overnight.  Plus, Elon Musk goes fighting back.  The Tesla chief suggesting the SEC is infringing on his first amendment rights and holding him in contempt of court.  We are breaking down the fallout when we come right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Markets were mixed today.  A lot of questions about the U.S.-China trade story.  Top officials from both countries holding a phone conversation last night, there still uncertainty since the meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping has not been set which leaves investors anxious about the deal's future.  Joining us right now is Market Compass LLC founder and CEO, Amelia Bourdeau.  Good to see you, Amelia.  Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>AMELIA BOURDEAU, FOUNDER AND CEO, MARKET COMPASS LLC:  Great to see you.  Thanks for the invite.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A lot of uncertainties from the standpoint of a -- of a market adviser like your firm is.  From China to Brexit, how you invest right now and what's most important in terms of allocating capital?</p><p>BOURDEAU:  What's most important right now in terms of allocating capital volatility, if volatility stays low, meaning we have certain outcomes on today especially with the Brexit vote if we get an actual outcome that they take the deal, you will see sterling rally because markets like certainty, you see equities up in the U.K., you would see the sterling rally.  If we continue with some sort of uncertainty in terms of China trade and also Brexit,  that's going to ride volatility, that could weigh on, you know, U.S. equities because equities don't like uncertainty and any country.</p><p>And so what we're really looking for is some certainty from the market and both the China traded negotiations and Brexit today with their vote.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even without these two things you've got an economy that's lucky if it grows one percent in Europe for 2019.</p><p>BROOKS:  That's true.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how have you been advising your clients on that story?</p><p>BOURDEAU:  To be sure, the Euro, we've always -- we've already seen a great loss in the Euro but I think it will go to parity actually with the dollar.  Last week's ECB meeting, Draghi did a very interesting thing the ECB did.  They introduced the new loan facility, they said the economy is slowing, they slashed their growth forecast but they said the risks are still waited to the downside which is highly unusual for the ECB after taking all those measures and the reason they said it was still waited to the downside in Europe was because of Brexit and trade negotiations.  The ECB has no policy control over those --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lindsey?</p><p>BELL:  Well, the political environment over there really is also --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOURDEAU:  It is.  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  And the OECD you saw come out asking or telling the ECB, the European Commission that look, you probably need to inject more stimulus into the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOURDEAU:  Yes.</p><p>BELL:  -- really to stabilize things there.  Is that what you expect?  What do you think the next move is over there?</p><p>BOURDEAU:  I do.  It's very tough, we have European Parliamentary elections coming up at the end of May and some populist parties are coming to the forefront.  And why that's dangerous for the Euro especially is because these populist parties are anti-Euro, and so that's also going to weigh on the European sentiment.  It's also going to affect European government's ability to pass measures to stimulate the economy as well.</p><p>BROOKS:  What are you telling your clients about the odds of going into recession either in Europe and/or in the United States in the next 18 months?</p><p>BOURDEAU:  I think the odds are quite high that Europe will go into recession and the next -- I think even six months, I don't see the U.S. economy in recession at least for the next 12 months.  Just because, growth has been so strong in jobs and wages I know we just had a disappointing jobs number for February, but I think it's a bit of an aberration.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The wages were not disappointing.</p><p>BROOKS:  Yes.</p><p>BOURDEAU:  No, the wages were not disappointing, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The best was April 2009.  And finally people are making more money.</p><p>BOURDEAU:  Yes.  They are and that's great.  And so I don't see, you know, consumers halting their consumer spending at all.  I think it will just, you know, keep on going, we'll see a little, you know, drop-off in the housing sector but, you know, the U.S. economy is strong especially relative to the rest of the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Amelia, great to have your insights.  Thank you so much.</p><p>BOURDEAU:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amelia Bourdeau joining us there.  Coming up next.  We are talking about a forewarning from the U.S. as it tells Germany to drop Huawei Technology.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo broke the news with me here first just a few weeks ago.  U.S. Army Undersecretary Ryan McCarthy will join us in an exclusive interview weighing in next.</p><p>Then Musk slams this SEC.  The Tesla chief suggesting regulators are infringing on his first amendment rights and holding him in contempt of court.  The fallout coming up.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, March 12th.  Your top stories right now 8:30 am on the East Coast.  We have breaking news right now.  The February consumer price index is out.  It is up two-tenths of a percent right in line with the expectations.  In fact, year-over-year is actually lower than the estimate.  Year-over-year, the February CPI is up 1-1/2 percent versus an estimate of 2.2 percent year-over-year.  So, the inflation numbers are out this morning, they are either in line, if you look month-over-month, to lower than expected if you look year-over-year on consumer price inflation.  So, once again, we do have a CPI that shows very little or no inflation.</p><p>Markets this morning not really reacting, although the Dow Industrial Average has been -- has been lower all morning, because of Boeing.  Boeing's stock is down again.  The S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ are higher this morning.  The S&amp;P just turned higher again after the CPI number, which shows no inflation.  The NASDAQ up 13 points, it's adding on to big rally yesterday, up 150 points on the day yesterday on the NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe this morning, European indices are also mixed, take a look at the FT-100 which is higher by eight points, off of the highs of the morning through.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is down though, 12 points, and the DAX Index in Germany is down 24.  In Asia overnight, gains across the board.  Best performer was Japan.  Nikkei Average up 1-3/4 percent.  Hang Seng in Hong Kong up 1-1/2 percent.</p><p>Breaking news from American Airlines this morning.  It says it has confidence in the safe operation of its aircraft, including the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet after reviewing extensive flight data.  So here we are with American Airlines taking a cue from the FAA, which has deemed this plane safe.  Many countries trying, China including -- included, have ground the 737 after the crash in Ethiopia.</p><p>Big tech today, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and the hopeful, 2020 hopeful Liz Warren, lays out her vision for regulation.  The fallout from one of technology's biggest conferences, she wants to break these companies up.  We're going to get into it.  And then there's this, Tesla CEO Elon Musk firing back at regulators.  What he said about his tweeting habits later this hour as he continues to push back on the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>Meanwhile, our top story this morning is the 2020 budget proposal from the President.  The White House revealed a $4.7 trillion budget, highlights include $8.6 billion for a border wall, $750 billion for National Defense, with $718 billion going to the Pentagon, giving the military a $33 billion increase.  The President's budget also cuts $818 billion from projected Medicare spending over 10 years.  And joining me right now to talk about all of this is the Undersecretary of the United States Army, Ryan McCarthy.  Secretary, it's great to have you on this program.</p><p>RYAN MCCARTHY, UNDERSECRETARY OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY:  Maria, thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is an honor to have you.  Thank you for your great service in our wonderful U.S. army.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about the budget, here we have $22 trillion debt that we're all talking about and calls to pull it back, and yet the President proposes adding more to the defense side of the budget.  You're here on the front lines.  You're going to talk to us about where the priorities are.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you do that?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Absolutely.  Maria, the world is a very complex and dangerous place.  The U.S. Army has been in sustained combat operations for 17 years.  And all the while, other nations and around the world have studied our operating capabilities, our weapon systems, and have made the vast investments, both economically and militarily, to counter these capabilities.  So, the reflection of the overall DoD Topline, as well as the U.S. army budget, it is aggressive, it is substantial, we're very grateful for the FY '18-'19 deal that we got, but we have to keep going to rebalance the institution and to be able to pursue national objectives worldwide.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now one priorities is rebuilding readiness, right?  Tell me about that, as well as strengthening alliances and partnerships and improving perform and affordability through reform.  How are you doing that?  Tell us where you see this money being allocated.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So readiness is a term that we use pretty liberally.  Readiness is just like a professional athlete getting thousands of repetitions the summer before, an NFL season, or a NBA season taking free throw shots.  So, our soldiers have to be ready.  That mean -- when you have over 60 percent of the requirements worldwide to support national objectives militarily, it's filled by the U.S. Army.  So, readies will always be our number one priority, and over half of our budget is personnel and operating and maintenance.  So, we have to do what we must to have our people as ready as they can be.</p><p>The rest of the investments are in modernization.  Our modernization budget, it's been -- is going to be very aggressive, but we have signaled that with FY '18 and '19 by realigning billions of dollars of our SNC portfolio, about 80 percent against six signature priorities, Long Range Precision Fires, next generation combat vehicles, futuristic helicopters, our networks, our integrated air missile defenses and soldier lethality, ballistic helmets, machine guns, things like that.  So, these substantial moves were necessary because most of our systems are old.  Over 40 years old in most cases for our signature weapon systems and our formations, so we have to make these choices to move forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the modernization that you are in the middle of (INAUDIBLE) has a command, new command, army futures command, tell me about that.  How does that help the modernization?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So along with the moves of investments, we had to look at our ourselves and how we do business and they -- what the army recognize was that it was disparate.  The people involved with the decisions, what are the requirement, what is it, the how fast is the weapon system, are the range or the capabilities necessary, that's the customer or the war fighters.  Then we have experimentation, we have acquisition, they were spread across this million-person organization, so what we need to do is bring it all under one roof.</p><p>So, we went through restructuring, one of the most complex that we've done since 1973 and developed a four-star command that became the bridge to academia and business to get us back to the entrepreneurial spirit of the country where we've developed some of the finest systems that our war fighters have ever used in the history of the Department of Defense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  And we -- and we headquartered in Austin, Texas, it's a four-star headquarters, they operate in civilian clothes, they have a footprint and accelerator hub on the campuses of University of Texas in Austin, and a four-star commanders' building is in the University of Texas System.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And while you've done that to try to centralize things, you've also been making real cuts in the army, right?  Up against --</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- lots of --</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- priorities to spend less money.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So we wanted to show two things in this budget, was really fiscal discipline so look at -- every program was a zero-based budget approach.  The Army Leadership Secretary Esper, General Milley, our Chief of Staff, Vice Chief General McConville, our major commanders, all our four-star generals and select what we call staff codes.  So, it was a principles only exercise.  And of course the army staff has a sense of humor, they called it night court.</p><p>And so we sat there for about 70 plus hours, principals only, everybody had to do their own homework and then propose their budgets, and over time, we would look at how it laid in against the priorities, and if you couldn't defend it in that room, slap the table, and we either take the money or finance those efforts.  It was very, very aggressive, long, hot summer but we made some very complex choices, realigning over $31 billion across the five-year futures defense plan.  So, in the Department of Defense, we're really big.  We do it over a five-year horizon, so the moves that are made because you have to develop most of the weapon systems and scale it to an institution of over a million people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  All of this while some of the threats out there are trying hard to keep up or even beat the U.S. military.  I understand that China, for example, has more navy ships than an U.S. has navy ships, major concern for the U.S. government has been Huawei, and the telecom Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was here a few weeks ago.  Listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Europe is pushing back on this idea that President Trump and your administration wants to ban or potentially stop, slow down the use of Huawei technology.  Is that what -- is that what you found in Europe?</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We've been out around the world just making sure everybody had the same information, that countries understand the risk of putting this Huawei technology into their I.T. systems.  We can't forget these systems were designed by -- with the express work alongside, Chinese PLA, their military in China.  They are creating a real risk for these countries and their systems, the security of their people.  If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won't be able to share information with them.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  we talk a lot about the economic warfare going on between the U.S. and China, but there's real military aggressions as well.  Is this a concern for the army?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  It is.  We have looked at a couple things from an investment standpoint, as well as our operating concept.  The army had four -- over 40 years at -- operating business model what we called AirLand battle, and we're in the process of developing what we call multi-demand operations, is you would still have those AirLand components to (INAUDIBLE) of combat that we would fight together as a joint force, but adding cyberspace in space.  So this is going to change the way we do business coupled with the army network as our investment priority, laying in over $20 billion across the five-year future defense plan.  So, substantial investment and coupled with a new enterprise data strategy and how we'll protect our information.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tell me about that because technology is really critical here, and a lot of countries are using A.I. and many people say that they're ahead of the U.S. in terms of A.I.  Are we using A.I. within the military?  What -- how would you characterize technology in the U.S. army?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  So we developed an Artificial Intelligence Task Force retiring -- we're tying in with some world-class academic outlets, as well as companies.  But a lot of the challenge with A.I. is as much cultural conditioning of how we will use that in our operating model as well as the technologies that will invest against.  A.I. will be quite frankly the technology that will change warfare in the future and whoever gets their first will dominate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And do you feel like you have the tools needed to become number one?</p><p>MCCARTHY:  We're put -- we're putting our best and brightest forward, we're investing substantially, and it will be a priority for us in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Before you go, real quick in terms of the priorities for the U.S. army today.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Readiness, it'll always be number one.  We have 180,000 troops deployed in over 140 countries on our 17th year sustained combat operations in the Middle East, so we will always be focused there, to put our men and women the best position they can when they deployed, but substantial moves in modernization and more coming here in the near future.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, it's great to have you on the program.  Thanks so much.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Undersecretary Ryan McCarthy joining us, U.S. army.  Thank you so much sir.</p><p>MCCARTHY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Quick break and then an alarming new poll says millennials embracing are socialism as freshman politicians like Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez bring it to the forefront.  Stuart Varney weighs in on that.  And then mounting privacy problems, we are taking you live to the South by Southwest Conference, taking a look at how big tech is tackling major privacy concerns, all ahead, but first, a special update from the Tennis Channel.</p><p>JESSICA VILCHIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, guys, welcome back to another Tennis Channel court report for FOX Business, I'm Jessica Vilchis.  The WTA's newest star, Naomi Osaka, was under the spotlight at the BNP Paribas Open today as she American, Danielle Collins.  After a tight first set of 6-4, Osaka ran away with things, 6-2 in the second set to seal the match and book her spot in the round of 16.  Up next for Osaka will be Belinda Bencic who won recently won a title in Dubai.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAOMI OSAKA, TENNIS PLAYER:  Yes, I mean I just kind of realized that there's nothing else I'd rather do, and I'm really privileged to be here in the first place, so I might as well, you know, enjoy every step of the way.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VILCHIS:  A huge upset happened in the men's draw, as number three seed Alexander Zverev loss to the unseeded Jan-Lennard Struff.

A new Harris Poll shows that young Americans are embracing socialist policies more than past generations.  Joining us now the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Incredible, huh, Stu?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I think it's a problem for Republicans --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>VARNEY:  -- actually these views, social -- the millennials and the Generation Z people, 38 and under, that's the group we're talking about, this is the largest voting bloc in the 2020 elections, millennials and Generation Z.  This bloc firmly approves of socialistic policies.  In this Harris Poll, 73 percent approved of the government providing universal government-provided healthcare.  That essentially is socialized medicine.  67 percent approved of tuition-free college, that's another policy essentially out of the socialist playbook.  So, we have got this large voting bloc heavily in favor of socialist style policies and the Republicans are nowhere to be found on these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>VARNEY:  I mean I think it's a problem for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  And the President has, you know, Breitbart interview, he understands this.  He says, \"Look, it's easy to campaign on socialism, you offer free stuff, and you probably get, you know, you're going to win, not necessarily going to win, but you're going to do well.  Then he says 10 years later, \"Your country's destroyed,\" but that message is not getting through to millennials.  They support socialistic policies, problem for Republicans in my opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Wait until the 16-year-olds start voting.</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, stop it, Maria.  Don't want to ruin my day even though it's only Tuesday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry.</p><p>BROOKS:  I think we should the voting age to 40.  What do you think --</p><p>VARNEY:  What was that?</p><p>BROOKS:  Stuart, Stuart, this is Arthur.  How are you doing?</p><p>VARNEY:  How are -- is that Arthur Brooks?</p><p>BROOKS: Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  The man (INAUDIBLE) you want to move the voting age to 40?</p><p>BROOKS: Yes, I figure --</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm OK.  I'm 70.  I'll vote.</p><p>BROOKS: You're 70?</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BROOKS: Oh, I want to look like Stuart when I'm 70.  You know --</p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, I love you, Arthur.  Love you.</p><p>BROOKS: Stu, you know, you and I have talked about this for years and, you know, you and I agree on everything as you know.  I'm less worried about young people saying they're socialists today, and maybe I'm just a Pollyanna.</p><p>VARNEY:  Good.</p><p>BROOKS:  But, you know, what young people call themselves has very much to do with their sense of dignity and aspiration and opportunity and optimism.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BROOKS:  And it seems -- I mean I've seen it.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BROOKS:  You know, in 1976, two-thirds of young people 18 to 30 voted for Jimmy Carter by 1984, two-thirds voter for Ronald Reagan, they're very -- young people are --</p><p>VARNEY:  It's fascinating.</p><p>BROOKS:  -- very, you know, promiscuous in their -- sorry.  In their voting patterns and --</p><p>VARNEY:  But will you --</p><p>BROOKS:  And the way they see themselves.</p><p>VARNEY:  Will you please come on my show tomorrow?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, come on, Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY:  And, you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're going to use that for --</p><p>VARNEY:  -- I'm going to steal him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're going to use this time for that?</p><p>VARNEY:  I'm going to steal him off you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  I am.  I'm stealing him.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll see you in about 10 minutes, Stuart.  Top of the show, \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join -- we will see you then, Stuart.  Thank You.  Coming up, Musk versus the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Tesla CEO taking on regulators over his tweeting.  The details coming up.  And then global privacy concerns, we are take a live look at how big tech is battling mounting privacy issues.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Shares of DICK'S Sporting Goods tumbling this morning despite a double beat on earnings and revenue.</p><p>Gerri Willis on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange with more.  Hey, Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, Dagen.  That's right.  So DICK'S coming in beating on both the top and the bottom line, coming in at $1.22 on earnings versus $1.06, 2.49 billion in revenues versus 2.48 billion, even those that -- those shares slumping this morning and why?  It's same-store sales.  They came in 3.7 percent below, lower versus expecting of down 3.3 percent.  Now the company is optimistic in its conversation, its projections for next year.  If you remember, it's been a year since this company banned the sales of assault style rifles and limited -- halted sales of firearms to customers under 21.  Customers have been taking it out on DICK'S and trimming their visits to the store.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tesla, Elon Musk must sing in the court filings.  He did not file a terms of a fraud settlement that restricted his social media use, this to a federal judge who could hold him in contempt of court.  The SEC has required preapprovals of Elon Musk's tweets, but apparently, there is one tweet that got through directly from Mr. Musk which said that they would make 500,000 cars in 2019.  So, it was a production estimate that the SEC has trouble with.  We know that -- we know that Elon's problems with the SEC go way back.  He's called them a short-seller exchange commission, and the SEC obviously entrenched here on this idea that he is violating terms of his settlement.  The original tweet that offended he said he had secured funding to take the company private.  Dagen, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Gerri Willis at the New York Stock Exchange.  Still ahead, mounting privacy problems.  We're taking you live to South by Southwest, that conference for a look at how big tech is tackling privacy concerns.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Big tech companies facing backlash at South by Southwest.  Hillary Vaughn in Austin with the details.  Hey, Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Hey, Dagen.  Well, Instagram Cofounder, Mike Krieger, responding to Senator Elizabeth Warren's plan to cut Facebook down to size by having regulators retroactively reject Facebook's acquisition of Instagram.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE KRIEGER, COFOUNDER, INSTAGRAM:  I'm imagining the sci-fi version of this which is like the time traveler had to go back and unwind the Instagram acquisition, you prevent it from happening to like make sure it happens (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You heard it first, Elizabeth Warren time traveler.</p><p>KRIEGER:  You know, the cliche that every company is a tech company is increasingly true.  So, like, breaking up tech or, like, having those kinds of conversations, I just -- I think the conversation will go better and lead to better policy if we're really specific on the problems that we're trying to solve, and then specific on, like, what the implementation would be.</p><p>VAUGHN:  Warren is also targeting Google and Amazon, saying that they too need to be cut down to size because she thinks they'll be held accountable more easily that way.  Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Hillary.  Hillary Vaughn in Austin.  Lindsey, thank you.  Arthur, so good to see you.</p><p>BROOKS:  Nice to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Book again.  Love Your Enemies.</p><p>BROOKS:  Love Your Enemies.  It's on sale today.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We need to do a podcast just based on our conversations in the commercial break sometime without having to --</p><p>BROOKS:  I would love that.  I would love that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll make it happen right now.  \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart, it is all yours.</p><p>VARNEY:  Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TECHWR-2190200102</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TECHWR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMN-8FH1-JBHT-D4J3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"22408\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC.

In reality it's much safer , partly because the aviation industry is heavily regulated.Airlines must stick to strict standards for safety, testing, training, policies and procedures, auditing and oversight. And when things do go wrong, we investigate and attempt to rectify the issue to improve safety in the future.It's not just airlines, either. Other industries where things can go very badly wrong, such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices, are also heavily regulated. </p><p>Artificial intelligence is a relatively new industry, but it's growing fast and has great capacity to do harm. Like aviation and pharmaceuticals, it needs to be regulated.AI can do great harmA wide range of technologies and applications that fit under the rubric of 'artificial intelligence' have begun to play a significant role in our lives and social institutions. But they can be used in ways that are harmful, which we are already starting to see. In the 'robodebt' affair , for example, the Australian government welfare agency Centrelink used data-matching and automated decision-making to issue (often incorrect) debt notices to welfare recipients. What's more, the burden of proof was reversed: individuals were required to prove they did not owe the claimed debt. The New South Wales government has also started using AI to spot drivers with mobile phones. This involves expanded public surveillance via mobile phone detection cameras that use AI to automatically detect a rectangular object in the driver's hands and classify it as a phone. Read more: Caught red-handed: automatic cameras will spot mobile-using motorists, but at what cost? Facial recognition is another AI application under intense scrutiny around the world. This is due to its potential to undermine human rights : it can be used for widespread surveillance and suppression of public protest , and programmed bias can lead to inaccuracy and racial discrimination . Some have even called for a moratorium or outright ban because it is so dangerous.In several countries, including Australia, AI is being used to predict how likely a person is to commit a crime . Such predictive methods have been shown to impact Indigenous youth disproportionately and lead to oppressive policing practices.AI that assists train drivers is also coming into use, and in future we can expect to see self-driving cars and other autonomous vehicles on our roads. Lives will depend on this software.The European approachOnce we've decided that AI needs to be regulated, there is still the question of how to do it. Authorities in the European Union have recently made a set of proposals for how to regulate AI. The first step, they argue, is to assess the risks AI poses in different sectors such as transport, healthcare, and government applications such as migration, criminal justice and social security. They also look at AI applications that pose a risk of death or injury, or have an impact on human rights such as the rights to privacy, equality, liberty and security, freedom of movement and assembly, social security and standard of living, and the presumption of innocence.The greater the risk an AI application was deemed to pose, the more regulation it would face. The regulations would cover everything from the data used to train the AI and how records are kept, to how transparent the creators and operators of the system must be, testing for robustness and accuracy, and requirements for human oversight. This would include certification and assurances that the use of AI systems is safe, and does not lead to discriminatory or dangerous outcomes.While the EU's approach has strong points, even apparently 'low-risk' AI applications can do real harm. For example, recommendation algorithms in search engines are discriminatory too. The EU proposal has also been criticised for seeking to regulate facial recognition technology rather than banning it outright. The EU has led the world on data protection regulation. If the same happens with AI, these proposals are likely to serve as a model for other countries and apply to anyone doing business with the EU or even EU citizens.What's happening in Australia?In Australia there are some applicable laws and regulations, but there are numerous gaps, and they are not always enforced. The situation is made more difficult by the lack of human rights protections at the federal level.One prominent attempt at drawing up some rules for AI came last year from Data61, the data and digital arm of CSIRO. They developed an AI ethics framework built around eight ethical principles for AI. These ethical principles aren't entirely irrelevant (number two is 'do no harm', for example), but they are unenforceable and therefore largely meaningless. Ethics frameworks like this one for AI have been criticised as ' ethics washing ', and a ploy for industry to avoid hard law and regulation. Read more: How big tech designs its own rules of ethics to avoid scrutiny and accountability Another attempt is the Human Rights and Technology project of the Australian Human Rights Commission . It aims to protect and promote human rights in the face of new technology. We are likely to see some changes following the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's recent inquiry into digital platforms. And a long overdue review of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) is slated for later this year.These initiatives will hopefully strengthen Australian protections in the digital age, but there is still much work to be done. Stronger human rights protections would be an important step in this direction, to provide a foundation for regulation.Before AI is adopted even more widely, we need to understand its impacts and put protections in place. To realise the potential benefits of AI, we must ensure that it is governed appropriately. Otherwise, we risk paying a heavy price as individuals and as a society.<br/>MENAFN0103202001990000ID1099782725</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1099782725</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YB7-XVC1-F04Y-T2JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1003\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 1, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

For example, recommendation algorithms in search engines <url normalizedValue=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/\">are discriminatory</url> too. The EU proposal has also       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://qz.com/1805847/facial-recognition-ban-left-out-of-the-eus-agenda-to-regulate-ai/\">been criticised</url> for seeking to regulate facial recognition technology rather than banning it outright. </p><p>The EU has led the world on <url normalizedValue=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679\">data protection</url> regulation. If the same happens with AI, these proposals are likely to serve as a model for other countries and apply to anyone doing business with the EU or even EU citizens.</p><h>What's happening in Australia?</h><p>In Australia there are some applicable laws and regulations, but there are numerous gaps, and they are not always enforced. The situation is made more difficult by the lack of human rights protections at the federal level.</p><p>One prominent attempt at drawing up some rules for AI came last year from Data61, the data and digital arm of CSIRO. They developed an <url normalizedValue=\"https://data61.csiro.au/en/Our-Research/Our-Work/AI-Framework\">AI ethics framework</url> built around eight ethical principles for AI. </p><p>These ethical principles aren't entirely irrelevant (number two is \"do no harm\", for example), but they are unenforceable and therefore largely meaningless. Ethics frameworks like this one for AI have been criticised as \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.privacylab.at/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Ben_Wagner_Ethics-as-an-Escape-from-Regulation_2018_BW9.pdf\">ethics washing</url>\", and a ploy for industry to avoid hard law and regulation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: How big tech designs its own rules of ethics to avoid scrutiny and accountability</emphasis></p><p>Another attempt is the Human Rights and Technology project of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://tech.humanrights.gov.au/?_ga=2.264225740.1548026362.1582847177-65065222.1574494641\">Australian Human Rights Commission</url>. It aims to protect and promote human rights in the face of new technology. </p><p>We are likely to see some changes following the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries-ongoing/digital-platforms-inquiry/final-report-executive-summary\">inquiry</url> into digital platforms. And a long overdue       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oaic.gov.au/updates/news-and-media/oaic-welcomes-privacy-law-update/\">review</url> of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Privacy Act 1988</emphasis> (Cth) is slated for later this year.</p><p>These initiatives will hopefully strengthen Australian protections in the digital age, but there is still much work to be done. Stronger human rights protections would be an important step in this direction, to provide a foundation for regulation.</p><p>Before AI is adopted even more widely, we need to understand its impacts and put protections in place. To realise the potential benefits of AI, we must ensure that it is governed appropriately. Otherwise, we risk paying a heavy price as individuals and as a society.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Monique Mann currently receives funding from the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network and has previously received funding from the Consumer Policy Research Centre.

The magazine was on display at racks managed by advertising concessionaire Clear Channel when the airport authority was alerted to it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The magazine has been pulled from the Clear Channel advertising rack,\" said Brian Kulpin, a spokesman for the Reno-Tahoe Airport Authority. \"We do not allow advertising that endorses prostitution in the airport.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Prostitution is part of a gamut of topics and images that the airport prohibits from its advertising racks, Kulpin said. The airport does not allow nudity, politically oriented advertising, marijuana advertising, brothel advertising or depictions of guns, fire and explosions as a matter of policy.</p><p>Kulpin says that the airport authority has asked casinos to edit advertising that it considered too sexually explicit. Those casinos have always willingly complied, Kulpin said. Prostitution and marijuana are also against federal law, which can directly impact the airport because it receives federal grants, according to Kulpin.</p><p>But the magazine's publisher, Leslie McCarroll, disputed that her magazine is advertising. While it is distributed for free, the content is editorial, she said.</p><p>\"We felt it was worthy enough to do stories on the women who are in a legal profession in the state of Nevada and the oldest professional in the world,\" McCarroll said. \"It is 100 percent an editorial product.\"</p><p>McCarroll, who initially referred to the airport's move as censorship before saying she didn't want to use that word, said she would not fight the decision.</p><p>\"It's really not up to me, it's up to the airport,\" she said. \"It's sad.\"</p><p>'Very surprised and saddened'</p><p>The airport's decision was blasted by Mustang Ranch owner Lance Gilman, who was \"very surprised and saddened\" by it. Gilman only found out about the decision after he was asked about it by the Reno Gazette Journal on Thursday morning.</p><p>Gilman is also one of the principals behind the creation of the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, which is the industrial park that serves as the location for the Tesla Gigafactory and Switch Citadel.</p><p>Gilman accused the airport of being out of touch about the rights of women to choose the industry they work in, including legal prostitution.</p><p>\"The airport is behind the times as far as I'm concerned,\" Gilman said. \"The airport authority has no knowledge whatsoever of the legal industry - they've never seen the facility, they've never been to the Mustang Ranch, so they're really reacting out of ignorance instead of knowledge, which is unfortunate.\"</p><p>\"I say shame on them,\" Gilman added.</p><p>New Reno vs. Old Reno</p><p>Nevada's legal prostitution industry has been at the center of a fierce debate in a state that is eager to modernize its industries and diversify away from its old wild-wild-west reputation characterized by divorces and legal prostitution.</p><p>Even as the Silver State notches several high-profile wins by attracting Tesla's Gigafactory and other big tech names such as Apple, Google and Amazon, however, there remains staunch support in keeping some of the state's traditions, especially in Nevada's rural areas.</p><p>During the November 2018 elections, for example, Lyon County residents voted overwhelmingly against an advisory question that sought to rescind the county's brothel ordinance. The brothel ban initiative, Question One, was rejected by 75% of voters.</p><p>Gilman blamed the same groups behind moves such as Question One for making the airport pull Bliss Life's Mustang Ranch issue.</p><p>\"I think you have to respect everyone's opinion one way or another but to deny a legal business to be in a public area like that is very unfortunate,\" Gilman said. \"Bliss interviewed a lot of the ladies and really put into perspective the human side of the business and the value that the industry brings to many so hooray for Bliss Life.\"</p><p>Gilman's suspicion was right about the catalyst for pulling the magazines.</p><p>Melissa Holland, executive director of AWAKEN, a non-profit that protests the sex industry, brought the magazine's story to the attention of airport trustee Richard Jay, who shared her concern and forwarded it to CEO Marily Mora to take action, Jay said.</p><p>Jay, Mora and Holland serve together on the Northern Nevada Sex Trafficking Task Force.</p><p>\"We are leading the charge with this sex trafficking task force and we are designated as a safe place,\" Jay said. \"Then all the sudden this article talking about prostitution- right, wrong or indifferent- pops up. Personally speaking, I think it sends a mixed message.\"</p><p>Group that protests sex industry played role</p><p>Kulpin, however, insisted that the decision for removal was based on airport policy and its participation in programs such as Safe Place.</p><p>\"No one requested to airport staff or a trustee that we remove the magazine,\" Kulpin said. \"But Melissa Holland, of Awaken, who serves on the task force and who attended our Safe Place press conference, did bring the article to our attention and (the airport) removed the magazine from the advertising rack.\"</p><p>Holland, whose organization assists women who have been trafficked or who want to leave the sex industry, is a vocal opponent of both the legal and illegal trade. She supported the anti-brothel ballot question and helped push a bill to outlaw prostitution in the Nevada Legislature.</p><p>Allowing brothel publicity in the airport leads to a dangerous normalization of prostitution, she argued.</p><p>\"Pimps paying PR firms to promote the sex trade then creates a culture of acceptance and recruiting. When prostitution is legitimized, then the entire practice of exploitation is normalized,\" she said in a written statement. \"In other words, the entire community inadvertently becomes groomed. Their efforts to push this messaging into our community is counting on it!\"</p><p>Gilman, however, stressed that it was important to distinguish legal prostitution from the kind of activity mentioned by the airport.</p><p>\"The illegal industry is so, so detestable, ugly and dangerous,\" Gilman said. \"Nevada has a regulated industry that allows women to have a safe environment to ply the trade they have chosen.\"</p><p>Regardless, any form of prostitution is a no-go at the airport, according to Kulpin.</p><p>\"The article, which was a very strong endorsement of prostitution, was in a paid advertising section of the airport,\" Kulpin said. \"These types of advertisements are not allowed.\"</p><p>Jason Hidalgo covers business and technology for the Reno Gazette Journal. Anjeanette Damon is the government watchdog reporter for the RGJ.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The Winter 2020 issue of Bliss Life has been removed from racks at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport because it features a story on the Mustang Ranch brothel.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Provided by Bliss Media &amp;

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: All-out war, Iran is threatening it, so how will the U.S. respond to it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the Department of Defense is briefing members of the House Armed Services Committee this very hour on the attacks on those Saudi oil facilities, this as Iran's foreign minister is threatening to fight to the last American if it is attacked, that is, Iran is attacked, by the U.S. or Saudi Arabia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Oil holding steady, despite these mounting tensions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">John Roberts at the White House with all the latest -- hey, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Neil, good afternoon to you.</p><p>A lot more on this in the days ahead. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be back in Washington, D.C., tomorrow, where he will brief the president on his talks with officials in both Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.</p><p>Mike Pompeo saying definitively he believes this was Iran. No doubt, he says, on who is behind it. Listen here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I think it's abundantly clear. And there is an enormous consensus in the region that we know precisely who conducted these attacks. it was Iran. I didn't hear -- I didn't hear anybody in the region who doubted that for a single moment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Pompeo declared this to be an act of war, pointing the finger at Iran even prior to today.</p><p>But the president has yet to make that definitive declaration itself. This morning, at a CNBC conference, Vice President Mike Pence said the president's national security team is going to meet tomorrow as part of a thorough, deliberative process. Here's Pence.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The president has basically said, let's get to the bottom of what happened. We have organized an international investigation into what happened.</p><p>But the president will take all of this into account. And he will review the facts and he will make a decision about next steps.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: The United States will also make the case to the United Nations to seek some sort of support for actions against Iran. That likely will not happen until next week.</p><p>On the border yesterday, the president said that he has got plenty of options, though he is playing his hands close to his vest in terms of what he might do. Listen here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will see what happens. A lot of things could happen. If we can have a peaceful solution, that's good. It's possible that that won't happen. But there's never been a stronger country militarily, not even close.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Iran is threatening all-out war, as you pointed out at the top of this, Neil, still saying that it had nothing to do with last Saturday's attacks.</p><p>Listen to what the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said earlier today:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: I think it is important for the Saudi government to understand what they're trying to achieve. Do they want to fight Iran until the last American soldier? Is that -- is that their aim?</p><p>Because if that is the aim, they can be assured that this won't be the case.</p><p>QUESTION: Why?</p><p>ZARIF: Because Iran will defend itself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: President Trump has instructed the Treasury Department to tighten the screws on Iran to come up with new sanctions within the next 24 to 48 hours.</p><p>The vice president also announcing today, Neil, that the United States is going to limit the number of visas for the Iranian delegation at the United Nations General Assembly next week.</p><p>I think any retaliatory action, Neil, will probably wait until after the United States makes the case at the United Nations. So I think we're still a few days away from that, if it happens at all -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: And I believe, John, the president has talked about whatever response would be proportionate.</p><p>ROBERTS: Exactly.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you know what he meant by that?</p><p>ROBERTS: Yes, he was asked about that as he was leaving on his trip to Arizona and California.</p><p>The president hinted that maybe striking similar oil facilities in Iran might be something that's in the cards, but the president also said he'd like to solve this peacefully if he -- if he possibly could. So I think there's still a lot of options open.</p><p>I think there's a lot of talking that's going on behind the scenes that we don't know about to try to avoid an all-out conflict, because even if the United States did prevail in a conflict like that, Neil, it would -- it would create havoc in the Middle East.</p><p>CAVUTO: To put it mildly.</p><p>John Roberts, thank you, my friend, very much, John at the White House.</p><p>Should the U.S. even be backing Saudi Arabia in this fight, if it comes to that?</p><p>Well, Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard telling me on this show yesterday, not really.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TULSI GABBARD (D-HI), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm focused on how we can best keep the American people safe, on how we can make sure that we are -- we have our national security intact.</p><p>And so whatever actions that we take....</p><p>CAVUTO: And the Saudis are a bigger threat? And the Saudis are a bigger threat to that safety than Iran? I just want to be clear, Congresswoman.</p><p>GABBARD: The Saudis are directly supporting the very terrorist group that attacked us on 9/11 and that continue to pose a threat to the American people today.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, if the president were to take action against Iran, with or without Saudi intelligence or help, that would be a bad move, in your eyes?</p><p>GABBARD: That would be a very bad move. It wouldn't serve the interests of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Indiana Republican Senator Todd Young recently meeting with the Saudi Crown Prince Salman. He joins me right now.</p><p>Senator, what do you think of her position?</p><p>SEN. TODD YOUNG (R-IN): As I understand her position, it's that we should allow Iran to continue firing missiles into -- and drones into other countries' territories, violating their sovereignty, upsetting international oil markets, and continuing to perpetuate their funding of terrorist proxy forces around the Middle East and around the world, without any sort of proportionate response.</p><p>I think that's an untenable position. But I do share with the congresswoman a position that we need to do everything we can to avoid a war. We need to do everything we can to reestablish deterrence and ensure that we don't involve ourselves in some sort of situation that leads to further escalation and immerse ourself in a military conflict that we can't get out of.</p><p>I know that's the number one priority of the president of the United States, is trying to prevent war, rather than get into war. And that's why he's been incredibly emphatic about that.</p><p>CAVUTO: Senator, you're probably familiar with the fact that the congresswoman said that the president risks pimping out our soldiers on behalf of the Saudis.</p><p>What did you make of that?</p><p>YOUNG: If -- I didn't understand the first part of the question, but...</p><p>CAVUTO: Sure.</p><p>She charged that the president is pimping out our soldiers to the Saudis.</p><p>YOUNG: No.</p><p>Look, Saudi Arabia they have been, for sure, a complicated security partner over the years. And truth be told, because Republicans have pressed so hard over the years to ensure that we can exploit our own natural resources, our own oil and gas, we're less dependent on oil and gas resources from this region.</p><p>But, with all that said, that country remains important. It's important because we have 60,000 Americans on the ground right now. So, by definition, we want to make sure those Americans are safe and secure.</p><p>But perhaps even of greater importance, as we look eight or nine years into the future, because of the JCPOA, or the so-called Iran nuclear agreement that President Obama signed onto and that so many Democrats here in Washington have been supportive of, because of that agreement, the Iranians, the largest state sponsor of international terrorism, will have official legal sanction in just a number of years to be in breakout capacity, meaning they could develop a nuclear weapon to put on top of the missile technology they continue to develop.</p><p>So that's why it's important that the president is going to be speaking to our allies, to partners, really to the world at the United Nations, asking everyone to come together and see how we can continue to apply maximum economic pressure on the Iranians to bring them to the table, which is really the endgame here.</p><p>We want to bring the Iranians to the table, so that we can negotiate a peaceful settlement and get a better deal.</p><p>CAVUTO: Senator, thank you very much.</p><p>YOUNG: Thank you very much.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, in the meantime, one thing is very clear.</p><p>The State Department at the Pentagon are not on the same page on this, the State Department raising concerns that Iran was indeed behind this, the Defense Department not thoroughly convinced, in fact, taking a more wait- and-see approach until it is.</p><p>Retired Air Force Lieutenant General David Deptula.</p><p>General, is it usual for Defense and State to be at odds on something this big? I mean, they either were or they weren't. I read from the Pentagon review at this point they're not 100 percent. Perhaps the State Department is. Are you?</p><p>LT. GEN. DAVID DEPTULA (RET.), U.S. AIR FORCE: Well, to answer your last question first, based on everything I have seen, there's like no doubt that these attacks originated from Iran using Iranian equipment, under the authority of the supreme leader of Iran. So we can put that aside.</p><p>With respect to your first question, are there differences in the perspective between State and Defense? Yes, you bet there are. I mean, there are differences inside State and inside Defense.</p><p>CAVUTO: Sure. Sure.</p><p>DEPTULA: This is a significant issue. So...</p><p>CAVUTO: But there wasn't any difference, as far as you know, sir, that one is not quite convinced Iran's behind this, and the other is, or that that could jeopardize how the president responds to this?</p><p>DEPTULA: No, I think that the real issue here is the larger question.</p><p>And the larger question is, look, what ultimately are the United States' objectives that are directly affected with this latest aggressive move by Iran?</p><p>And so what comes into play in the discussion of the variety of different options, both the economic, as well as perhaps using elements of military force to coerce Iran to understand that it's in their best interest not to pursue the development of nuclear weapons and delivery means.</p><p>So that's what this is really about. And that's why you see deliberations ongoing in State, in the Department of Defense, and across the board.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>General, the president has talked about -- and I was raising it with our White House correspondent, John Roberts -- about proportionate response to this, if indeed it is fingered to Iran.</p><p>But if a proportionate response means going, let's say, after Iranian oil fields vs. Saudi oil fields, what they are alleged to have targeted, wouldn't that boomerang potentially on us? We're more energy-independent than we have ever been, of course, but for the world, it could mean higher oil -- energy prices.</p><p>Other defense analysts have said the more targeted approach might be going after their drones.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>DEPTULA: Well, Neil, once again, the question needs to be put in the context -- or the answer needs to be put in the context of an overarching strategy.</p><p>First, what the president needs to be doing -- and, in fact, all indicators are that he needs to form a coalition. Once again, this is an indication that Iran is trying to stimulate and put the United States into the position of being the aggressor, so that they can gain the support of their domestic population and put the United States out there as the one who is the aggressor.</p><p>Well, so what that means is, we need to be pretty smart when we think about what our options are. And I think being smart is to continue to turn the economic screws to coerce the Iranians that they have got to change their behavior.</p><p>Now, there might be some elements of military action that go along with this strategy. I would suggest that probably the most prudent way is to do it not in a very overt fashion, but in a covert fashion.</p><p>One day, an Iranian oil transport all of a sudden is missing. Command-and- control facilities start operating. There's no attribution. It just happens.</p><p>The Iranians will get the message.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, but we need to do it in concert with others, and that would include the Saudis. If they don't participate, would you be leery?</p><p>DEPTULA: Absolutely.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK.</p><p>DEPTULA: I mean, look, the attack was on the Saudi infrastructure...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>DEPTULA: ... and on the sovereign nation of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>So, this all has to be part of a coalition. That's why we have got to be careful that we don't fall into the trap that the Iranians are trying to pull us into, and that's into a direct confrontation involving the United States. That's what they want to happen.</p><p>CAVUTO: Got it. That certainly seems to be the case.</p><p>General, thank you very much.</p><p>DEPTULA: You bet, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Meanwhile, his job is safe for now, because to hear the president talk about it, the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, might not be a bad idea for him to freshen up his resume, even if experts say, try as he might, the president is probably stuck with Powell, whether he likes it or not.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: They have raised too fast. And I have been saying this openly. And they have lowered too slow.</p><p>QUESTION: Chairman Powell's job is safe?</p><p>TRUMP: It's safe. Yes, it's safe. I mean, sure. Why not?</p><p>QUESTION: You paused.</p><p>TRUMP: No, I don't pause. I mean, he's got a job, and I'm disappointed in him. I'm very disappointed in him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, he's safe. It's whatever.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Wow. Is that a ringing endorsement? Hmm, I don't know.</p><p>The president still hitting Fed Chairman Jerome Powell very hard. Could he be setting him up as a fall guy if the economy takes a turn?</p><p>Charlie Gasparino with us, Axios reporter Alayna Treene, market watcher Erin Gibbs.</p><p>The president has long been critical, Erin, as you know, of the Fed's policies, that they hiked too soon too fast, and now they're unwinding it. Even the Fed has pretty much acknowledged that. But he has said that, if they were more aggressive in the rate cuts even now, they could go a long way toward reversing this.</p><p>But it doesn't look like that's in the cards. So what do you think?</p><p>ERIN GIBBS, GIBBS WEALTH MANAGEMENT: No, I think that, to your point, he's definitely setting the Fed up as the potential fall guy, because Wall Street is fine with what happened.</p><p>We were basically flat. We're in a wait-and-see period. We are more concerned about tariffs than we are about the federal rate cuts. So I think there might be one more ahead, but, for now, Wall Street is very satisfied with what they did.</p><p>CAVUTO: Jerome Powell has posited, Alayna, that the reason he is cutting is because of the trade situation.</p><p>I don't know whether that was meant to zing the president, but to say, I wouldn't be in this predicament, we wouldn't be in this predicament if you -- if we didn't have this cloud over us.</p><p>Do you agree with that?</p><p>ALAYNA TREENE, AXIOS: Well, this was a big question that a lot of reporters yesterday were asking Fed Chair Jerome Powell, was, they did -- they questioned, are -- were these cuts, this quarter-point of a cut, was that to appease the president, who has clearly been making these public declarations for months now, asking him to cut rates?</p><p>But the Fed chair said, this is more of the economy's doing great, yes, but this is to assuage some concerns with consumers, and especially those on Wall Street, that the trade war is creating this uncertainty.</p><p>So rather than it being like the economy is in a bad place, we need to cut rates to help it, it's more of, we see these dark clouds on the horizon, why don't we cut rates by a quarter-point to potentially hold off a potential economic downturn?</p><p>And that was what his argument was.</p><p>CAVUTO: Charlie, what do you think of this battle, that it will ensue probably right to the election, between the president and the man he picked to run the Federal Reserve?</p><p>He's obviously disappointed in Jerome Powell. Powell isn't going anywhere. So how's this all going to play out?</p><p>CHARLIE GASPARINO, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: It's very interesting.</p><p>Well, first off, we should point out, if Jerome Powell wanted to appease the president, he would have probably cut 50 basis points, all right? So that's how -- that's how you would appease them.</p><p>Listen, Neil, I don't agree with what the president's doing here on a lot of issues. He's right that Jerome Powell missed the boat. He didn't see the storm clouds when they were forming in December. And he wasn't just -- he was raising the Fed Funds Rate and unloading the balance sheet on the long end. So that was a real problem. That caused the economy to slow significantly.</p><p>That said, you know, listen, these sort of battles between Fed chairs and presidents happen all the time. They just don't happen the way this is happening.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. In the open, right.</p><p>GASPARINO: It's usually done through -- yes, it's usually done through surrogates, and...</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. Like, when I trash you, never to your face. Always behind your back.</p><p>GASPARINO: Yes. Well, of course, yes. No, you do it to my face.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GASPARINO: But that's what I love about you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GASPARINO: But -- no, but if you can think about it, there's something really honest about this. The president doesn't like it. He's saying so.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>GASPARINO: And, usually, it's done by the guys behind the scenes, but this is playing out for everybody to see.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, that's a good point. There's no doubting where the president's coming from.</p><p>GASPARINO: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Erin, let me get your take, then, on where this goes.</p><p>If the Fed is to be read correctly, to your point -- I think it's a solid point -- that this is not going to be an unending process of rate cut after rate cut after rate cut.</p><p>How's that going to play out?</p><p>GIBBS: I think, look, whenever there's lower rates, that's going to help the stock market. So we might have one more cut, possibly two, which might will help push up stocks and then keep the yields very low, help with mortgages.</p><p>But I don't see this being a big move, unless we really see some bigger fears about the recession. So, remember, rate cuts sound great, because it sounds like it's cheaper money, but it actually means because the economy's doing worse, that there are clouds overhanging us.</p><p>So I would actually like to not see rate cuts, because that means the economy is doing better. And, sometimes, we forget about these things.</p><p>CAVUTO: The resiliency of this economy, Alayna, is remarkable. It's the one thing that the president clearly has going in his favor.</p><p>It might be off its more rocketing pace, but it's still fairly impressive. Is there a sense that people know that, and that that ultimately will save the day for the president? What are you hearing from people how this is playing out?</p><p>TREENE: Well, I mean, the biggest concern with people with inside the White House, as well as on the Trump campaign, is that if there is some sort of economic downturn, that is a huge issue for his reelection.</p><p>If the economy tanks, the president is in trouble in 2020.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, all that time.</p><p>TREENE: And so that's where, when we see the president complaining about rate cuts, complaining about what happened yesterday, that's where this is coming into play, because, if anything happens, and the economy takes a downturn...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: We don't know.</p><p>Real quick point, Charlie, very quick.</p><p>GASPARINO: Well, they are worried in the White House about the economy, and clearly on trade. And it's, like, the Larry Kudlows, the Mnuchins are clearly worried about a slowdown caused by that.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, they don't want to see that go south, do they? They don't want to see it go south.</p><p>GASPARINO: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: The Dow down 52 points on cross-concerns on all of these.</p><p>We will have more after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, some new worries about possible terror ties in that case about a former American Airlines mechanic, now charged with sabotaging an airplane.</p><p>Phil Keating in Miami on what is sparking those concerns.</p><p>Hey, Phil.</p><p>PHIL KEATING, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil.</p><p>That mechanic admits he sabotage that commercial jet, but he says it wasn't to harm anyone, it was just to make some extra cash.</p><p>And after more than a month, though, the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force investigating this man and the case, still to date no terrorism-related charges have been filed against him. Yet U.S. prosecutors in court now suggests thing that terrorism could have played a motive, and the result, bond denied.</p><p>The federal magistrate ordered Abdul-Majeed Marouf Ahmed Alani to continue to be held behind bars. In court, prosecutors revealed that FBI agents found ISIS videos on his phone showing graphic killings, and that he forwarded one of those videos to somebody with the urging for Allah to take revenge against non-Muslims.</p><p>Also, according to an American Airlines co-worker, Ahmed Alani told him that his brother was in Iraq and a member of ISIS, and that he flew to Baghdad in March to visit him, which the FBI says he lied about.</p><p>In July, the Miami-to-Nassau flight with 150 passengers on board turned back before taking off after an error light appeared regarding the navigation system in the cockpit.</p><p>Ahmed Alani's defense attorneys say a second navigation system still works and that the government is blowing this case out of proportion. Ahmed Alani's family flew into Miami for yesterday's bond hearing, saying nothing to the cameras; 60-year-old Ahmed Alani was born in Iraq and is a naturalized U.S. citizen.</p><p>He is charged with one count of willfully damaging, destroying or disabling aircraft. He says he thought if he could force that plane back to fix a mechanical problem, he being the mechanic would get more work and thus more overtime, which, in fact, actually did happen.</p><p>If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in federal prison. He will be back in downtown Miami at the U.S. courthouse tomorrow morning for his arraignment, where he will enter a plea of either guilty or not guilty. And we will be there, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Phil, great reporting, as always, Phil Keating on all that.</p><p>Meanwhile, adding to these terror fears, federal prosecutors indicting a New Jersey man, a separate case, for terrorist activities, claiming that he was scouting out locations in New York for Hezbollah to conduct a terror attack.</p><p>Former CIA operative Mike Baker on all of these confluence, developments that have a lot of folks getting nervous.</p><p>Mike, what do you think?</p><p>MIKE BAKER, FORMER CIA COVERT OPERATIONS OFFICER: Well, I mean, I think it's a -- it's a good reminder that, even though we're all fatigued from the war on terror, and sometimes we would just like to make it all go away and put it out of our mind, that that's not how it works.</p><p>Going to the latter story first, the arrest of the Hezbollah operative here in the United States, it's not the first time that's happened. We have picked up in cases, convicted other Hezbollah operatives.</p><p>And this individual happens to be a naturalized U.S. citizen. But he did that in 2005. The only problem is, in 1997, he joined Hezbollah, which has been a designated terrorist organization. It's a proxy for Iran, for the regime. And they carry out a great number of operations around the globe. He joined that organization in '97, so eight years before he lied on his citizenship papers and said he'd never been a member of a terrorist organization.</p><p>He since has spent his time doing a variety of things, including getting trained in explosives of weapons by Hezbollah, and conducting surveillance on a variety of targets, primarily in the New York City area, in the event that Hezbollah wants to, or, frankly, the Iranian regime wants to, in the future, conduct terrorist attacks on our own soil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Mike -- and I know over the years we have talked, you have always reminded me of how airlines, airplanes remain a focus of terrorists.</p><p>And then we get, lo and behold, this new development on this mechanic who was apparently trying to sabotage a plane. And it wasn't for the reasons or presumably for the reasons he stated. It could be much more sinister.</p><p>And you heard about the ISIS videos and destructive videos that he had available.</p><p>What is it with planes? What is it with targeting airlines? With all the safeguards and precautions, it is an unending focus of attack.</p><p>BAKER: It is. It's high-profile.</p><p>And it has -- it's been a target for decades, for generations. It will continue to be so.</p><p>And I think the biggest takeaway from this case with Alani and -- the American Airlines mechanic, who's now in jail and awaiting his trial...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>BAKER: ... the big takeaway from that is not just his particular case.</p><p>What it should force us to do is to rethink the way the TSA and the FAA, the two primary organizations responsible for screening potential airline employees, how they do that vetting, how they do the background checks.</p><p>There are some gaps. There are problems with the way they do it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, there are charges with guy, Mike, that he was militarized during that time, and now the others are charging that he might have become more radicalized going in as a mechanic.</p><p>BAKER: Right.</p><p>CAVUTO: But it is scary.</p><p>BAKER: Right.</p><p>And it's -- and it's -- whether it's someone who's being radicalized in a terrorist sense, or whether it's somebody who's starting to have personal issues, and that's going to impact their ability to think rationally, and they may lash out because of gambling or substance abuse.</p><p>The problem with background checks and vetting, not just with airlines, but a large number of other critical infrastructure areas, is that it's not an ongoing process.</p><p>The applicant comes in, he wants the job, you do the -- or she wants the job. You do the background check. Maybe you do civil, criminal. Maybe the FBI, depending on the job, does the background to some degree.</p><p>But then that's it. They get hired. The problem is, you have to continuously update that.</p><p>CAVUTO: Absolutely.</p><p>BAKER: And that should include social media. It should include a review of that person's social media usage.</p><p>But we tend to shy away, because, oh, that's a privacy issue. But it's not enough to just do one background check or one vetting on an individual, hire them and say, it's all good. This guy worked for American Airlines for almost 30 years.</p><p>CAVUTO: You're right.</p><p>BAKER: It should have been happening annually.</p><p>CAVUTO: And continually updated.</p><p>Mike Baker, thank you very, very much, my friend.</p><p>BAKER: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Good catching up with you.</p><p>BAKER: Sure.</p><p>CAVUTO: Meanwhile, a little face-to-Facebook on Capitol Hill, Mark Zuckerberg making the rounds today. How did it go?</p><p>After this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Hundreds rescued in Houston, as a tropical depression depresses and drenches Southeast Texas. A flash flood warning in effect for most of the area until later tonight. We will update you.</p><p>Back in 60.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, what the Zuck?</p><p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg going to Washington, getting an earful from lawmakers.</p><p>To FOX Business Network's Hillary Vaughn on what he's hearing -- Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil.</p><p>Well, Mark Zuckerberg wants the whole world to share about their lives on Facebook, but we caught up with him today. He didn't have anything to share with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, FACEBOOK: I'm sorry. I'm not taking questions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: But Zuckerberg was taking questions from some of his toughest critics in Congress.</p><p>He started the day meeting with Senator Mike Lee, who questioned the CEO about Facebook's conservative bias and antitrust concerns.</p><p>And then he had face time with one of the loudest Facebook skeptics on the Hill, Senator Josh Hawley, who's called for a third-party audit of Facebook to prove their platform is not rigged against conservatives.</p><p>This wasn't necessarily a meet-cute between the two. Hawley says he caught Zuckerberg off-guard with his questions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): The way that he can show that he's trying to do better is to sell Instagram and WhatsApp and to submit to an independent third party.</p><p>I think he was a little taken off-guard. And I think that he thought that wasn't a great idea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: Last night, Zuckerberg met for hours at a dinner with Democrats in the Senate, including Senator Mark Warner and Senator Richard Blumenthal, who wants Facebook to be broken up because he thinks big tech is too big.</p><p>But when asked if Zuckerberg was able to convince him that a breakup would be a bad idea, Blumenthal said he still has a long way to go before he changes his mind.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT): Even though we may differ, I was very impressed by the thoughtful comments on privacy. And I'm hoping that we can work together on the matter, even as we may differ on other issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: Neil, so there's a lot of concern that Facebook is getting too big. And there's a lot a lot of skepticism also on the Hill for Facebook's latest venture into cryptocurrency, with their new cryptocurrency, Libra.</p><p>A lot of people in Congress still not sold on that idea -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Hillary, thank you very much.</p><p>Well, earlier today on FOX Business, I had a chance to talk to Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner, who helped arrange the Zuckerberg visit, asking him if Facebook is getting the message.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA): The Facebook leadership realizes that failure to have federal legislation in this space is actually going to hurt them and the whole platform industry in the long run.</p><p>I think there's never been companies like Facebook and Google that are of such size and power, without any kind of regulatory oversight.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: My next guest agrees.</p><p>Attorney Lisa Kuharksi says some sort of regulation oversight is inevitable.</p><p>I guess we don't know what kind, right?</p><p>LISA KUHARKSI, ATTORNEY: Well, exactly.</p><p>I think what we're seeing is a lot of pressure on companies like Facebook that they can no longer hide behind the algorithm, so to speak. They tell us a lot about they have this oversight in place, they have software that picks out all of this language that we find offensive, that's prohibited, pornography, even political.</p><p>However, we can't see that -- we can't see that algorithm. It is proprietary. So now what we have is this next layer, Zuckerberg coming in and saying, I am now going to establish a committee, people to oversee our algorithm and to handle appeals.</p><p>So it's kind of their own compliance department.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But they -- these legislators want a lot more than that.</p><p>Now, it's elevated to the point where they have got this digital currency we want to regulate, look at that. You're getting -- you're getting -- you're freaking us out, and that, simply, they have gotten too big for their britches. Right?</p><p>KUHARKSI: Well, they have gotten too big for their britches, and they haven't provided a lot of confidence, right, in the markets?</p><p>They haven't provided a lot of confidence to Congress. So what we're going to probably see is an extension of -- there's a telecommunications act, Section 230, which kind of protects giants like Facebook from being -- they are shielded from these third parties that post on their site and they cannot be held liable.</p><p>However, there are carve-outs since this act of 1996. So there are carve- outs that hold liability for terrorism. You have to -- you have to -- you have to prohibit that from your site, and also for pornography.</p><p>CAVUTO: Or bad guys trying to influence an election or something like that, right? But that is tough, right?</p><p>KUHARKSI: Right. Well, that actually is not protected.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>KUHARKSI: So, politics really is really kind of a hot-button issue, right. Like, how do you cover that?</p><p>CAVUTO: So, what about -- conservatives raise the bias issue and the algorithms that slam conservative opinion, for example, getting -- and I'm going and branching way beyond Facebook to Google and others.</p><p>Where is all of this going? Because both parties seem to agree, we have got to rein all these guys in. Facebook is the face of it for the time being, but what do you think?</p><p>KUHARKSI: It's going to go to some sort of regulation, right?</p><p>We're looking at -- we're looking at a section of a code that was actually established before any of us even knew what the Internet was or even what users were. So it does need to be massaged a little bit.</p><p>The thing that I think that we have to be careful of -- and, especially, I hope that the Hill is asking the right questions -- we need people who are technologically educated, so that, when they do these carve-outs...</p><p>CAVUTO: Have you seen these Q&amp;A hearings, though?</p><p>KUHARKSI: You know, I mean...</p><p>CAVUTO: What button turns the thing on?</p><p>KUHARKSI: Yes, I think that education might be the key and getting some experts in.</p><p>But we also...</p><p>CAVUTO: But, in the end, just so I understand it, you do envision that there's going to be a government effort to rein these guys in?</p><p>KUHARKSI: I think the...</p><p>CAVUTO: Can you go too far here?</p><p>KUHARKSI: Yes.</p><p>And that's really the -- that's really the issue, right? I think that they're crying for a carve-out, especially protectionism, safety issues, privacy concerns.</p><p>But we don't want to go too far, so that we overreach and we quell startups, so the little guys, the smaller businesses, right, from coming into the market, because the giants, Google, Facebook, they can fight legal battles into the next...</p><p>CAVUTO: But today's giant is tomorrow's dinosaur, right? You got to be careful that market forces and competition...</p><p>KUHARKSI: You know, that used to be the case, right? But now we're seeing, like, the giants tend to eat up all the little people.</p><p>So we're trying to make a fair playing ground. Right?</p><p>CAVUTO: It's a tough balance. Tough balance.</p><p>KUHARKSI: I think the antitrust will also be impacted by this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Lisa, thank you very, very much, brilliant legal mind on all of this.</p><p>In the meanwhile, here is one way to get striking GM workers to the table. Take away their health benefits to sort of speed up the process.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, it's day four in that GM auto workers strike, but the company this time upping the ante today, removing strikers' health benefits, apparently in an attempt to get them to make a deal.</p><p>FOX Business' Grady Trimble in Detroit with the latest.</p><p>What's this all about, Grady?</p><p>GRADY TRIMBLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Neil, that's certainly an important issue.</p><p>But we have also learned about some movement possibly in these contract negotiations. We have just learned that the UAW sent a letter to its members.</p><p>And here's part of what that letter says: \"I can report to you today that, as of today, some progress has been made. The process of meeting will continue this weekend and beyond if a tentative agreement is not reached.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Senator Amy Klobuchar paid the picketers here in Detroit a visit. The presidential hopeful brought them coffee and donuts, and she assured them that she has their backs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And the hope is, when we did that, that wasn't just for the executives. That money was to make sure the companies, that we could have American-made cars.</p><p>And so that means American jobs that are good jobs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRIMBLE: And the issue she's raising certainly part of those contract negotiations, including, as you mentioned, health care.</p><p>This is the first sign, though, in several days of this strike that we're seeing any movement in the right direction toward a deal -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Grady, thank you very, very much.</p><p>So who says you need to make the presidential debate have any hope of making any buzz? The presidential candidate who is doing a pretty nice job on her own without ever showing up on stage at all.</p><p>CAVUTO: We are just getting word that a judge has blocked a California law that was aimed at forcing the president to release his tax returns separately in New York.</p><p>The president's attorneys have succeeded with a judge to have a stay of enforcement, the subpoenas that they were wishing to try to use to get the president's tax records.</p><p>So, in New York, where they're holding off on that, a stay while they wait for a hearing on this issue, and, in California, where a judge has sided with the president's request that forcing the release of his tax returns can't be done.</p><p>All right, we will keep you posted on that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tulsi Gabbard the latest to prove that there is indeed life and indeed political oxygen even if you are sucked out of a debate, create buzz of your own.</p><p>The Hawaii congresswoman generating plenty of that with her charge that the president is, in her words, pimping out our soldiers to the Saudis. Good for the Saudis, she says, not so good for us.</p><p>Now, Gabbard is not alone. Other candidates are finding there is life for those who don't get to the big stage.</p><p>Here to discuss, Independent Women Forum's Andrea Bottner, Democratic strategist Marjorie Clifton.</p><p>I always say -- and I will end it with you, Marjorie -- I will pick your brain first on this -- that whether you agree or disagree with the approach someone like a Congresswoman Gabbard is taking on this issue of Saudi Arabia, she's generating buzz, she's generating headlines.</p><p>And given her appearance on this show last night, she is generating a lot of stories. So who says you need to be at the debate to get that?</p><p>MARJORIE CLIFTON, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, and frankly, if you look at the past debates, there wasn't a lot of differentiation happening with -- as you kind of go down-ballot, a lot of the candidates that were up there.</p><p>And so I think, at this point, this is almost the primary Hail Mary for a lot of them, and trying to figure out, can they get enough of the fund- raising, enough of the followers to actually be a credible candidate?</p><p>And, look, we elected Donald Trump, who won the same kind of tactics of, how do you create a buzz, how do you draw attention to yourself, even if it is a little bit outlandish? So I think, at this point, this is a strategy you're seeing Beto, you're seeing others employ, trying out this sort of little off-the-beaten-path approach to getting attention.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm just wondering if others are taking cues, particularly from Tulsi Gabbard, about how to do that.</p><p>What do you think, Andrea.</p><p>ANDREA BOTTNER, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Well, I absolutely agree.</p><p>It's anything for attention, whatever you can do to get to 2 percent and be on that Democratic debate stage next month. But what really bugs me about what she's done the last couple days -- I thank her for her service, but because of her service, she should know and does know how devastating it is to go to war.</p><p>And so when she's out there saying that the president's not moving quickly enough, and we're the servants of Saudi Arabia, it's almost like she's taunting him to make a very quick and brash decision.</p><p>And we have seen that he's not doing that. He's waiting for the facts to come in. And he's going to make an informed decision after working with our allies.</p><p>So I think her -- a lot of her criticism, other than using some gross language, it's also disingenuine (sic). And I take offense at it, especially because of her role as someone in our armed services.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I also -- on that particular point, I did correct her on something she thought the president said.</p><p>And whether you like or dislike the president, when it came for waiting up for reaction from the Saudis, I believe the president was stipulating he wanted more proof that the Iranians were behind it, and that the Saudis, obviously, since they had a lot of the shrapnel, everything on their territory, they would be able to quickly discern that.</p><p>BOTTNER: Absolutely.</p><p>CAVUTO: I don't believe he was going to then take orders from the Saudis to attack Iran.</p><p>But be that as it may, there are candidates who do less controversial things. Andrew Yang comes to mind. When you think of him, Marjorie, and the mosh pit thing and the dancing and all -- he's a very good dancer -- and he gets attention.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: And I think that, whether you're in a debate or not, that's the stuff that gets played.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>BOTTNER: Yes.</p><p>CLIFTON: Yes. Well, I absolutely agree.</p><p>I mean, even think about in the last debate Julian Castro's one comment about, why would anyone listen to any of us when we're talking this way, and I think kind of calling out in some ways what people think, what they like.</p><p>Again, this is part of what the allure is of Donald Trump as a candidate to a lot of people. He says what's on his mind, whether you like it or not. He uses language that's offensive, whether you like it or not. And that does appeal to some people because it feels authentic.</p><p>And I think that is what Andrew Yang is trying to do, is sort of authentically be different and own that Silicon Valley tech approach. And I was recently in the area and talking to people. And people are talking about him.</p><p>And Tulsi Gabbard is the conversation du jour.</p><p>CAVUTO: No, you're right. You're right.</p><p>BOTTNER: Yes. Yes.</p><p>CLIFTON: You know?</p><p>And Beto's comments on guns as well. I mean, look, I mean, whether he...</p><p>CAVUTO: Buzz is buzz. It's not always good buzz, but buzz is buzz.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, imagine if the president were to start to do a mosh pit kind of a thing or dancing, or -- Katy bar the door.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Ladies, thank you both very, very much.</p><p>BOTTNER: Thank you.</p><p>CLIFTON: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, maybe I should try that. I should just do a little dancing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: That would be scary. What am I thinking?</p><p>Anyway, some more airports are looking to use facial recognition technology to help passengers skip these long lines, right? But some privacy advocates are saying, oh, no, no, that's what's crossing the line -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: A face-off over facial recognition, it's happening at airports.</p><p>Some airlines and travelers say it certainly speeds up the process. Others say, but at a cost.</p><p>Our Jacqui Heinrich looking into the whole matter at New York's JFK International Airport.</p><p>Jacqui, what's going on here?</p><p>JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Neil, right now, this software is only being used at certain airports and with certain airlines and only on international flights.</p><p>But the ACLU is in opposition to it because TSA wants eventually to expand it to all flights, including domestic ones, and that's causing some privacy concerns.</p><p>The process is pretty simple. Rather than showing your passport and a ticket at the gate, you smile for a photo, and Customs and Border Protection sends that image to a cloud, where it matches it with a picture of you that they already have, typically from your passport.</p><p>CBP says it deletes pictures of U.S. citizens within 12 hours, but images of some aliens can be held up to 14 days. And they have not outright said that they will never share that data with other federal agencies.</p><p>The ACLU says there needs to be some laws limiting the technology.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEEMA SINGH GULIANI, ACLU: Congress has never clearly authorized the TSA to use this technology. And it's simply not ready for airport use. We haven't debated the privacy concerns. And, frankly, we don't even understand what the agency wants to do and how they will be storing and using this data.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HEINRICH: CBP says it's really the fastest way to keep people safe.

Coauthored by University College London visiting professor Ian Hogarth and AI investor Nathan Benaich, the report aims to highlight technological breakthroughs and areas of commercial application for AI as well as the regulation of AI, its economic implications, and emerging geopolitical issues. Among other findings, this year's report implies AI remains mostly closed source, harming accountability and reproducibility, while corporate-driven academic 'brain drain' appears to be impacting entrepreneurship. </p><p>Self-driving cars are in the Precambrian stages. And political leaders are beginning to question whether acquisitions of AI startups should be scrutinized or outright blocked.AI researchAccording to Air Street Capital's report, only 15% of AI research papers publish their code, and there's been little improvement on the metric since mid-2016. Based on data from the website Papers With Code[3], which highlights trending research and the code to implement it, code availability has actually decreased from above 20% in December 2019. 'For the biggest tech companies, their code is usually intertwined with proprietary scaling infrastructure that can't be released,' the coauthors of the report concluded. 'This points to the centralization of AI talent and compute as a huge problem.' This development perhaps isn't surprising, given that professors are departing universities for corporations at an accelerating rate. The report points out that Google, DeepMind, Amazon, and Microsoft hired 52 tenured and tenure-track professors from U.S. colleges between 2004 and 2018 and that Carnegie Mellon, the University of Washington, and Berkeley lost 38 professors during the same period. To put that in perspective, no AI professor left in 2004, whereas in 2018, 41 AI professors resigned. The report's coauthors believe this has a traceable impact on entrepreneurship. Citing research conducted by the University of Rochester and CKGSB Business School China, graduates are 4% less likely to start an AI company for 4-6 years after the departure of tenured AI professors, which could trickle down to immigration[4]. The Paulson Institute-affiliated think tank MacroPolo[5] found that the majority of the top AI researchers working in the U.S. (69%) weren't trained in America. On the other hand, there's evidence to suggest international AI Ph.D. candidates studying in the U.S. are countering the brain drain despite immigration challenges, with data from the Center for Security and Emerging Technology[6] showing that 92% of graduates work in the U.S. post-graduation and 80% intend to stay if they can. In other encouraging news, universities continue to expand AI course enrollment. Stanford now teaches 10 times the AI students per year as during 1999-2004 and twice as many as 2012-2014; over 1,200 Stanford students took classes in natural language processing between 2016 and 2017.Self-driving carsBeyond AI and machine learning research broadly, the Air Street Capital report takes a critical look at progress (or lack thereof) in the over $7 billion autonomous vehicles industry. While over half of U.S. states have enacted legislation related to autonomous vehicles, the safety of those vehicles remains difficult to measure because the market tends to focus on miles per disengagement, a flawed metric[7]. Baidu recently made the dubious claim that it saw an 8,697% year-over-year improvement in disengagements from 2018 to 2019, beating out Waymo, Cruise, Zoox, Nissan, Nvidia, and Mercedes Benz. Overcoming the industry's hurdles might require new technological approaches, the report's coauthors suggest, citing the failure of Starsky Robotics[8]. The now-shuttered Starsky, which was the first company to drive an autonomous unmanned truck on a public highway, openly cited the challenges of scaling supervised machine learning. Use of machine learning in self-driving is mostly limited to perception, with large parts of the technology stack hand-engineered.Commercialization and politicsDespite the pandemic, academic brain drain, and setbacks in autonomous vehicles, the report asserts that the AI industry remains strong. According to Pitchbook data retrieved by the coauthors on August 13, the year 2020 is likely to hit over $25 billion in deal volume across over 350 deals. Since 2018, rounds over $100 million have consistently accounted for about 10% of all funding. But the report also warns that investments will likely slow down as countries enact legislation intended to keep companies within their borders. In June 2020, Germany passed a law to allow the government to review or block investments or takeovers by non-European Union-based robotics, AI, and semiconductor companies. That same month, the U.K. expanded its powers to intervene in mergers on public interest grounds, enabling it to review mergers and acquisitions involving AI companies where the target company has revenues exceeding 1 million (~$1.27 million). The report's coauthors predict that in response, a wave of Chinese and European defense-focused AI startups will collectively raise over $100 million within the next 12 months. 'Despite fears of an AI winter, [there's] innovation and progress behind the scenes,' Benaich said in a statement. 'Many of these AI developments are powered by the massive computing infrastructure that is increasingly in the hands of big tech companies.

The five-year-old start-up raised $160m from a diverse group of banks, tech groups and investment firms, in a deal that valued it at $1.8bn. </p><p>Many areas of fintech \u2014 especially those using data analytics to extend loans to consumers and smaller enterprises \u2014 have been caught out by the speed of the economic slowdown that has followed the pandemic.</p><p>But Airwallex, whose head offices are in Hong Kong, has held up better because it operates in a more promising fintech space: it helps small enterprises with operations beyond their home borders manage their foreign exchange needs, sending and receiving multiple currencies without handing exorbitant fees to the banks. </p><p>\u201cWe are building a digital payments infrastructure to help small and medium enterprises operate globally,\u201d said its co-founder, Jack Zhang.</p><p>Airwallex has ambitions that potentially far exceed eating into what has been a hugely profitable business for the banks. If successful, it will pose a challenge to one of the principal building blocks of the international monetary system \u2014 illustrating the speed with which technology makes it possible for new entrants to upend the status quo.</p><p>It is creating an entirely new infrastructure to replace the traditional pipes of the global payments system, now dominated by Belgium-based Swift, which is not controlled by any government but is still seen as part of a financial world dominated by the west.</p><p>\u201cIt is a big deal. It took five decades to build up Swift into a system which is low cost, robust and resilient,\u201d said\u00a0Dino Kos, who ran the markets group at the New York Fed for many years and is now an executive vice-president of CLS, which provides foreign exchange settlement services for the world\u2019s largest banks. \u201cThere is no alternative today.\u201d</p><p>While Swift has tried to be politically neutral, it has come under pressure in the past from the US, seeking information on transactions that may be violating US laws, added Mr Kos. At the same time, governments including those of Russia and China have talked about trying to develop an alternative to Swift \u2014 but have never actually done so.</p><p>Airwallex is gaining ground just as digital currencies have the potential to challenge both a system in which central banks have a monopoly on creating money and the US dollar dominates international payments. And it is in discussions with Facebook to explore synergies with that group\u2019s Libra experimental digital currency. Mr Zhang declined to comment on the talks. </p><p>Despite its potential disruptive power, Airwallex has sought to accrue allies among both traditional financial institutions and big tech.\u00a0Today, it is backed by a diverse group. Its investors include Tencent, Sequoia Capital, Hillhouse Capital, DST, and financial institutions such as credit card giant Mastercard, as well as regional banks, such as ANZ and BCA in Indonesia. </p><p>Salesforce invested in the latest fundraising round, enabling Airwallex to offer its services to the Salesforce ecosystem as it already does with the Tencent ecosystem. </p><p>\u201cThe existing system is inefficient and fragmentary,\u201d said Lucy Liu, Airwallex\u2019s co-founder, who is based in Shanghai. \u201cAnd while we want to build our own payments platform, both for settlement and payment, we want to work with banks and other financial institutions.\u201d</p><p>Even given these positive dynamics, Airwallex faces many challenges before it can begin to have a transformative effect.</p><p>As Mr Zhang noted, the digital world may be borderless but any financial product is heavily regulated by different jurisdictions. In the US, for example, the firm needs licences from all 50 states. An application to the People\u2019s Bank of China is subject to such tight non-disclosure agreements that Airwallex\u2019s founders cannot even disclose how long the process may take.</p><p>Precisely because it \u2014 and most of its customers \u2014 live in a digital world, Airwallex also faces global competition, not only from local Asian start-ups including Hangzhou-based PingPong Payments but those in Silicon Valley such as Stripe.</p><p>This has done little to dent its ambition. \u201cIf there is an alternative rails for the global payments system, you want to be part of it,\u201d said Mr Kos. \u201cYou do not want to be on the outside looking in.\u201d</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-6e90f9a2303d4c64849d718cd87f3727</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609J-M521-DXP9-94MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"750\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 7, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001VLL</classCode><className>FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS521110 MONETARY AUTHORITIES - CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>SIC6011 FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

While Pichai isn't the first big tech executive to say so publicly, his voice matters, given that Google is arguably the world's largest AI company. Mint takes a look.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why is there a need to regulate the use of AI?</p><p>AI depends on the gathering of data, automatically making it an issue that needs regulation. Any organization will require large amounts of data to train an AI software, so how its acquires the data must be regulated. When AI is put to use practically, it becomes an even more direct threat to privacy. For example, facial recognition can be used for mass surveillance. AI algorithms are usually built for specific tasks, but if left unchecked they can deviate from their desirable behaviour. For example, two Facebook chatbots created their own language when they were allowed to interface with each other in any way they wanted.</p><p>Who else has called for regulation of AI?</p><p>Pichai is not the first big name in tech to have sought regulations on AI. Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk has been vocal about the need for regulating AI several times in the past. Musk even said that \"by the time we are reactive in AI regulation, it's too late\". Microsoft president Brad Smith is another prominent person in tech who has called for regulation of AI. Pichai, in his editorial, advocated for AI to be regulated keeping in mind both the harm and societal benefits that the technology can be used for. He also said that governments must be aligned on regulations around AI for \"making global standards work\".</p><p>Click here to view enlarged graphic</p><p>Which fields are using the technology at present?</p><p>AI is a buzzword in almost every field. Smartphone makers are marketing AI-driven cameras, while governments have been looking to reap the benefits of AI in various areas. Regulation has to take into account all the use cases. The use of AI in governance, healthcare, law enforcement, etc. is more intrusive than, say, enhancing a phone camera's imaging capabilities.</p><p>What is the status on regulation of AI?</p><p>Pichai's editorial came soon after reports that the European Union was planning to ban the use of facial recognition in public areas for up to five years. This would give regulators time to figure out ways to avoid the abuse of such AI technologies. The US proposed certain principles for AI regulation earlier this month, which were more lenient than the EU's proposed policy. In May, 42 countries had adopted the inter-governmental policy guidelines on AI by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</p><p>Where does India stand on regulations?</p><p>While India has been vocal about the use of AI in various sectors, it is far from regulating it. A 2018 NITI Aayog paper proposed five areas where AI can be useful. In that paper, the think tank also noted the lack of regulation around AI as a major weakness for India. While presenting the 2019 Union budget, then interim finance minister Piyush Goyal had said the Centre was planning to launch a national programme on AI. While India's startup ecosystem has built several products using AI, we do not yet have principles for regulating it.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

To counter one of the ugliest forms of human behaviour, Logistimo, a Bangalore-based company, has helped secure steady supplies to thousands of women in rural clinics of a medicines pack to prevent pregnancies as well as HIV and other infections transmitted through rape.</p><p>Local staff upload basic data on the distribution of the \u201cPr\u00e9vention\u201d kits to a cloud-based system that issues text message warnings when supplies are running low. As a result, the project overseen by Panzi Hospital has countered one of the most widespread and fundamental brakes on tackling disease in much of the world: the timely restocking of medical supplies.</p><p>It is one of a number of digital health applications, many developed by and for those in emerging economies, that can boost prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease. But there are also practical hurdles, and hubristic claims for more high-tech solutions \u2014 including artificial intelligence \u2014 can prove a distraction while raising concerns over ethics, equity and evidence.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of hot air in the business with respect to AI,\u201d says Anup Akkihal, head of Logistimo, which focuses on less sophisticated but more robust technology adapted to local limitations in order to improve healthcare supply chains in poorer nations. \u201cDonors and aid agencies had a fear of missing out on the promise of AI, but have become more critical now because of data quality concerns.\u201d</p><p>When the FT/Lancet Commission was launched last year to explore the potential, the pitfalls and the governance issues around digital health in lower income countries, these dilemmas were central to its agenda. In the past few months, the spread of the coronavirus pandemic has brought them into fresh focus.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus\"> Covid-19</url> has highlighted the positives and negatives of digital healthcare and its impact around the world. With new treatments, diagnostics and vaccines slow to develop, the pandemic is a sobering reminder of the continued dominance of a disease control method unchanged since the Middle Ages: quarantine.</p><p>But technology is making a difference. The World Health Organization, Facebook and Gustav Praekelt, a South African software developer and philanthropist, are together combating misinformation by using WhatsApp to disseminate science-based data on the disease.</p><p>Asian countries from China to India have proved swifter than their richer peers in using smartphone ownership to track the movement of people to limit the spread of infection. The concern is that such applications, once embedded, could undermine privacy and human rights.</p><p>More broadly, the potential of digital technology to improve health outcomes is undeniable. Many lower tech applications are already well established, with Africa and Asia able to leapfrog tardy investments in fixed-line telecoms systems and rapidly develop mobile networks to reach the most rural, isolated and low-income families.</p><p>To narrow the enormous gap between richer and poorer parts of the world, some argue there is no alternative but to embrace higher-tech approaches. \u201cAfrica has 15 per cent of the world\u2019s population and a quarter of the global health burden but only 3 per cent of healthcare workers and 1 per cent of healthcare expenditure,\u201d says Sangu Delle, managing director of Ghana-based Africa Health Holdings, which invests in several companies exploring AI. \u201cTechnology has to be part of bridging the gap or it will be impossible to respond.\u201d</p><p>At the most basic level, SMS text messaging has become widespread. Even rudimentary mobile phones with low bandwidth can transmit health prevention messages and nudges to patients to take medicines for conditions such as tuberculosis and HIV. Telemedicine connects isolated patients directly to specialists, easing access to medical care at relatively low cost.</p><p>More sophisticated telecoms technology opens the possibility of remote diagnosis. Smartphones can capture audio and visual data and monitor movement, helping identify and share information to better understand medical conditions and track patient recovery.</p><p>Machine learning to identify patterns in \u201cbig data\u201d may have a greater impact. In disease surveillance and forecasting, as during the coronavirus pandemic, satellite images and heat maps help measure economic activity. Online media reports, social media chatter and clinical reports flag up patterns to predict the spread of infections, and plan and track the impact of different policies.</p><p>Computer analysis of satellite photos helps vaccination workers and anti-mosquito insecticide sprayers increase coverage, allowing them to reach remote communities and people living in rapidly growing slum dwellings not marked on traditional maps.</p><p>In drug development, AI has scope to find patterns in the growing volumes of genetic data, the compound \u201clibraries\u201d of pharmaceutical companies and clinical trial results. In January Exscientia, a spinout from the University of Dundee, announced a first clinical trial resulting from AI, which identified a potential drug for obsessive compulsive disorder in just a few months.</p><p>Technology can also help accelerate testing of experimental medicines by more quickly recruiting those best suited for trials. Hence the growth in partnerships between drug developers, patient groups and providers of genetic tests such as 23andMe.</p><p>There has been a surge in projects exploring AI\u2019s ability to more reliably interpret chest radiographs, retinal patterns and tomography readouts. The Novartis Foundation is working with Microsoft and the Fiocruz Institute in Brazil to collect and analyse digital photographs of skin lesions to help identify leprosy.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://kimetrica.com/\"> Kimetrica</url>, a social enterprise backed by Unicef, is exploring face scanning as a less invasive and more reliable predictor of malnutrition in children aged under five than the traditional measurement of the circumference of the mid-upper arm. Meanwhile, services such as Ada are offering ways for patients in low income countries to enter symptoms online to identify diseases.</p><p>A final application of digital tools is the management, operation and financing of healthcare. Alongside supply chain services such as Logistimo, \u201cdigital wallets\u201d such as MTiba and Mutti allow relatives to fund medical bills. That has sparked concerns because they prop up \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d payments that penalise the poor, rather than promoting fairer access for all. But such services have a beneficial side effect in the generation of large amounts of data on diagnoses and treatments prescribed, costs and patient outcomes. That offers a way for funders \u2014 whether individuals, donors or national health systems \u2014 to identify the best and most efficient providers.</p><p>Equity is one fundamental concern over technology and its expansion into developing countries with limited social safety nets. The gap between rich and poor is exacerbated by the \u201cdigital divide\u201d. While network coverage and smartphone ownership is rising globally, Ann Aerts, who chairs the Broadband Commission set up by the International Telecommunications Union, cautions: \u201cHalf of the world is still unconnected and it\u2019s the easier part that has been done. If we don\u2019t connect the rest, even very well intended solutions cannot scale up.\u201d</p><p>A second concern is over privacy and misuse of sensitive health information. Dubbed \u201cdata colonialism\u201d by Nick Couldry from the London School of Economics, the commercialisation of data provided by users is fuelling a debate over confidentiality and ownership.</p><p>A third issue is reliability and safety. Big Tech is less regulated than Big Pharma, and typically quicker to make dubious claims. AI has raised concerns over biases in big data sets, which may generate unreliable findings in regions or among ethnic groups on whom less information has been collected.</p><p>A recent review of AI analyses of medical images in the British Medical Journal, led by Myura Nagendran from Imperial College, highlighted other drawbacks including the small scale of most studies and the limited use of the \u201cgold standard\u201d of randomised controlled trials. \u201cMany arguably exaggerated claims exist about equivalence with or superiority over clinicians, which presents a risk for patient safety and population health at the societal level,\u201d the BMJ study concluded.</p><p>At a more practical level, competing technology providers also need consistent standards to ensure \u201cinteroperability\u201d and access to the cloud. \u201cThere is a lot of variability with the infrastructure to support the exponentially growing amount of data coming out of the health sector,\u201d cautions Jonathan Stambolis, head of Zenysis, a company that collects and harmonises data to help health systems in Africa and Asia.</p><p>None of these challenges is insurmountable, but they point to the need for clearer international guidelines, consistent regulation and tougher governance. As Delle argues: \u201cSome tech start-ups just come in, operate and take consumer data. There\u2019s a real gap, with a lot of regulators behind the curve on these innovations.\u201d\u2002</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-cdc166d4684511eaa6ac9122541af204</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YX2-7711-DXP9-94WJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1545\"/><timeReceived>3:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 15, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Physicians try to be systematic when identifying illness and disease, but bias creeps in. Alternatives are overlooked.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now a group of researchers in the United States and China has tested a potential remedy for all-too-human frailties: artificial intelligence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a paper published on Monday in Nature Medicine, the scientists reported that they had built a system that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0335-9\">automatically diagnoses common childhood conditions</url> \u2014 from influenza to meningitis \u2014 after processing the patient\u2019s symptoms, history, lab results and other clinical data.</p><p>The system was highly accurate, the researchers said, and one day may assist doctors in diagnosing complex or rare conditions.</p><p>Drawing on the records of nearly 600,000 Chinese patients who had visited a pediatric hospital over an 18-month period, the vast collection of data used to train this new system highlights an advantage for China in the worldwide race toward artificial intelligence.</p><p>Because its population is so large \u2014 and because its privacy norms put fewer restrictions on the sharing of digital data \u2014 it may be easier for Chinese companies and researchers to build and train the \u201cdeep learning\u201d systems that are rapidly changing the trajectory of health care.</p><p>On Monday, President Trump <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/business/ai-artificial-intelligence-trump.html\">signed an executive order</url> meant to spur the development of A.I. across government, academia and industry in the United States. As part of this \u201cAmerican A.I. Initiative,\u201d the administration will encourage federal agencies and universities to share data that can drive the development of automated systems.</p><p>Pooling health care data is a particularly difficult endeavor. Whereas researchers went to a single Chinese hospital for all the data they needed to develop their artificial-intelligence system, gathering such data from American facilities is rarely so straightforward.</p><p>\u201cYou have go to multiple places,\u201d said Dr. George Shih, associate professor of clinical radiology at Weill Cornell Medical Center and co-founder of MD.ai, a company that helps researchers label data for A.I. services. \u201cThe equipment is never the same. You have to make sure the data is anonymized. Even if you get permission, it is a massive amount of work.\u201d</p><p>After reshaping internet services, consumer devices and driverless cars in the early part of the decade, deep learning is moving rapidly into myriad areas of health care. Many organizations, <url normalizedValue=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/deep-learning-for-electronic-health.html\">including Google</url>, are developing and testing systems that analyze electronic health records in an effort to flag medical conditions such as osteoporosis, diabetes, hypertension and heart failure.</p><p>Similar technologies are being built to automatically detect signs of illness and disease in X-rays, M.R.I.s and eye scans.</p><p>The new system relies on a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/technology/google-artificial-intelligence.html\">neural network</url>, a breed of artificial intelligence that is accelerating the development of everything from health care to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/technology/self-driving-cars-aurora.html\">driverless cars</url> to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/technology/artificial-intelligence-risks.html\">military applications</url>. A neural network can learn tasks largely on its own by analyzing vast amounts of data.</p><p>Using the technology, Dr. Kang Zhang, chief of ophthalmic genetics at the University of California, San Diego, has built systems that can analyze eye scans for hemorrhages, lesions and other signs of diabetic blindness. Ideally, such systems would serve as a first line of defense, screening patients and pinpointing those who need further attention.</p><p>Now Dr. Zhang and his colleagues have created a system that can diagnose an even wider range of conditions by recognizing patterns in text, not just in medical images. This may augment what doctors can do on their own, he said.</p><p>\u201cIn some situations, physicians cannot consider all the possibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cThis system can spot-check and make sure the physician didn\u2019t miss anything.\u201d</p><p>The experimental system analyzed the electronic medical records of nearly 600,000 patients at the Guangzhou Women and Children\u2019s Medical Center in southern China, learning to associate common medical conditions with specific patient information gathered by doctors, nurses and other technicians.</p><p>First, a group of trained physicians annotated the hospital records, adding labels that identified information related to certain medical conditions. The system then analyzed the labeled data.</p><p>Then the neural network was given new information, including a patient\u2019s symptoms as determined during a physical examination. Soon it was able to make connections on its own between written records and observed symptoms.</p><p>When tested on unlabeled data, the software could rival the performance of experienced physicians. It was more than 90 percent accurate at diagnosing asthma; the accuracy of physicians in the study ranged from 80 to 94 percent.</p><p>In diagnosing gastrointestinal disease, the system was 87 percent accurate, compared with the physicians\u2019 accuracy of 82 to 90 percent.</p><p>Able to recognize patterns in data that humans could never identify on their own, neural networks can be enormously powerful in the right situation. But even experts have difficulty understanding why such networks make particular decisions and how they teach themselves.</p><p>As a result, extensive testing is needed to reassure both doctors and patients that these systems are reliable.</p><p>Experts said extensive clinical trials are now needed for Dr. Zhang\u2019s system, given the difficulty of interpreting decisions made by neural networks.</p><p>\u201cMedicine is a slow-moving field,\u201d said Ben Shickel, a researcher at the University of Florida who specializes in the use of deep learning for health care. \u201cNo one is just going to deploy one of these techniques without rigorous testing that shows exactly what is going on.\u201d</p><p>It could be years before deep-learning systems are deployed in emergency rooms and clinics. But some are closer to real-world use: Google is now running clinical trials of its eye-scan system at two hospitals in southern India.</p><p>Deep-learning diagnostic tools are more likely to flourish in countries outside the United States, Dr. Zhang said. Automated screening systems may be particularly useful in places where doctors are scarce, including in India and China.</p><p>The system built by Dr. Zhang and his colleagues benefited from the large scale of the data set gathered from the hospital in Guangzhou. Similar data sets from American hospitals are typically smaller, both because the average hospital is smaller and because regulations make it difficult to pool data from multiple facilities.</p><p>Dr. Zhang said he and his colleagues were careful to protect patients\u2019 privacy in the new study. But he acknowledged that researchers in China may have an advantage when it comes to collecting and analyzing this kind of data.</p><p>\u201cThe sheer size of the population \u2014 the sheer size of the data \u2014 is a big difference,\u201d he said.</p><p>PHOTO: Doctors competed against A.I. computers to recognize illnesses on magnetic resonance images of a human brain during a competition in Beijing last year.

And an experimental European research project is ensuring this axiom cuts very close to the industry\u2019s bone indeed by applying machine learning technology to critically sift big tech\u2019s privacy policies \u2014 to see whether AI can automatically identify violations of data protection law. The still-in-training privacy policy and contract parsing tool \u2014 which is called \u2018Claudette\u2018: Aka (automated) clause detector \u2014 is being developed by researchers at the European University Institute in Florence. They\u2019ve also now got support from European consumer organization BEUC \u2014 for a \u2018Claudette meets GDPR\u2018 project \u2014 which specifically applies the tool to evaluate compliance with the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. Early results from this project have been released today, with BEUC saying the AI was able to automatically flag a range of problems with the language being used in tech T&amp;Cs. </p><p>The researchers set Claudette to work analyzing the privacy policies of 14 companies in all \u2014 namely: Google, Facebook (and Instagram), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, WhatsApp, Twitter, Uber, AirBnB, Booking, Skyscanner, Netflix, Steam and Epic Games \u2014 saying this group was selected to cover a range of online services and sectors. And also because they are among the biggest online players and \u2014 I quote \u2014 \u201cshould be setting a good example for the market to follow\u201d. Ehem, should. The AI analysis of the policies was carried out in June, after the update to the EU\u2019s data protection rules had come into force. The regulation tightens requirements on obtaining consent for processing citizens\u2019 personal data by, for example, increasing transparency requirements \u2014 basically requiring that privacy policies be written in clear and intelligible language, explaining exactly how the data will be used, in order that people can make a genuine, informed choice to consent (or not consent). In theory, all 15 parsed privacy policies should have been compliant with GDPR by June, as it came into force on May 25. However some tech giants are already facing legal challenges to their interpretation of \u2018consent\u2019. And it\u2019s fair to say the law has not vanquished the tech industry\u2019s fuzzy language and logic overnight. Where user privacy is concerned, old, ugly habits die hard, clearly. But that\u2019s where BEUC is hoping AI technology can help. It says that out of a combined 3,659 sentences (80,398 words) Claudette marked 401 sentences (11.0%) as containing unclear language, and 1,240 (33.9%) containing \u201cpotentially problematic\u201d clauses or clauses providing \u201cinsufficient\u201d information. BEUC says identified problems include:  Not providing all the information which is required under the GDPR\u2019s transparency obligations. \u201cFor example companies do not always inform users properly regarding the third parties with whom they share or get data from\u201d  Processing of personal data not happening according to GDPR requirements. \u201cFor instance, a clause stating that the user agrees to the company\u2019s privacy policy by simply using its website\u201d  Policies are formulated using vague and unclear language (i.e. using language qualifiers that really bring the fuzz \u2014 such as \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cmight\u201d, \u201csome\u201d, \u201coften\u201d, and \u201cpossible\u201d) \u2014 \u201cwhich makes it very hard for consumers to understand the actual content of the policy and how their data is used in practice\u201d The bolstering of the EU\u2019s privacy rules, with GDPR tightening the consent screw and supersizing penalties for violations, was exactly intended to prevent this kind of stuff. So it\u2019s pretty depressing \u2014 though hardly surprising \u2014 to see the same, ugly T&amp;C tricks continuing to be used to try to sneak consent by keeping users in the dark. We reached out to two of the largest tech giants whose policies Claudette parsed \u2014 Google and Facebook \u2014 to ask if they want to comment on the project or its findings. A Google spokesperson said: \u201cWe have updated our Privacy Policy in line with the requirements of the GDPR, providing more detail on our practices and describing the information that we collect and use, and the controls that users have, in clear and plain language. We\u2019ve also added new graphics and video explanations, structured the Policy so that users can explore it more easily, and embedded controls to allow users to access relevant privacy settings directly.\u201d At the time of writing Facebook had not responded to our request for comment. Update: After publication, a company spokesperson sent this statement: \u201cWe have worked hard to ensure we meet the requirements of the GDPR, making our policies clearer, our privacy settings easier to find and introducing better tools for people to access, download, and delete their information. We sought input from privacy experts and regulators across Europe as part of these preparations, including our lead regulator the Irish DPC. \u201cOur work to improve people\u2019s privacy didn\u2019t stop on May 25. For example, we\u2019re building Clear History; a way for everyone to see the websites and apps that send us information when you use them, remove this information from your account, and turn off our ability to store it.\u201d Commenting in a statement, Monique Goyens, BEUC\u2019s director general, said: \u201cA little over a month after the GDPR became applicable, many privacy policies may not meet the standard of the law. This is very concerning. It is key that enforcement authorities take a close look at this.\u201d The group says it will be sharing the research with EU data protection authorities, including the European Data Protection Board. And is not itself ruling out bringing legal actions against law benders. But it\u2019s also hopeful that automation will \u2014 over the longer term \u2014 help civil society keep big tech in legal check. Although, where this project is concerned, it also notes that the training data-set was small \u2014 conceding that Claudette\u2019s results were not 100% accurate \u2014 and says more privacy policies would need to be manually analyzed before policy analysis can be fully conducted by machines alone. So file this one under \u2018promising research\u2019. \u201cThis innovative research demonstrates that just as Artificial Intelligence and automated decision-making will be the future for companies from all kinds of sectors, AI can also be used to keep companies in check and ensure people\u2019s rights are respected,\u201d adds Goyens. \u201cWe are confident AI will be an asset for consumer groups to monitor the market and ensure infringements do not go unnoticed. \u201cWe expect companies to respect consumers\u2019 privacy and the new data protection rights. In the future, Artificial Intelligence will help identify infringements quickly and on a massive scale, making it easier to start legal actions as a result.\u201d </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN655410920180706</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SR9-M201-DXCW-D544-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1130\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 6, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

New backseat driver tech aims to monitor you inside your car. Gary Numan once sang in the song 'Cars,' which sounded futuristic in its time:Here in my car I feel safest of all I can lock all my doors It's the only way to live In carsHowever, the age of cars being a symbol of freedom, autonomy, and self-responsibility appears to be over. </p><p>Your car could actually report you to the police.The cars of the near-future don't feel like the safe, private space about which Numan sang. And the responsibility is moving away from the driver over to A.I. in a sort of Wall-E type society. Cars are becoming more like moving living rooms at the cost of personal freedom. That is to say that self-driving, smart cars are here to stay and will monitor you and possibly report on you as they record you in your vehicle. Today we are talking about interior-facing, driver monitoring tech which the media endearingly calls 'a backseat driver.' But the technology actually has more control than a nagging passenger merely trying to direct your driving. As self-driving cars already take off in Arizona[3], the media cheers the surveillance technology from the bleachers. Any qualms about the tech are muted with sales copy straight from the creators of the products. It's not about 'if self-driving cars gain broad acceptance,' it's about 'when' self-driving cars gain broad acceptance, we are told.What is back-seat driver tech (interior-facing, driver monitoring technology)?In January, the international consumer electronics show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada showcased many A.I. and car tech companies and their many ways of analyzing the driver. In-car sensor technology is now capable of composing images on the driver, capturing motion, monitoring facial expressions in order to detect features about the driver and monitor whether they are too distracted, too sleepy, etc. This creepy description[4] from the report can hardly hide the intrusive tentacles of the tech:Whether by generating alerts about drowsiness, unfastened seat belts or wallets left in the backseat, the emerging technology aims not only to cut back on distracted driving and other undesirable behavior, but eventually help automakers and ride-hailing companies make money from data generated inside the vehicle. (Source[5])But what is 'other undesirable behavior'? Is it teen romance? Smoking? Dropping a McDonald's french fry in the back seat? The report never specifies. Continued:In-car sensor technology is deemed critical to the full deployment of self-driving cars, which analysts say is still likely years away in the United States. Right now, self-driving cars are still mainly at the testing stage. The more sophisticated in-car monitoring also could respond to concerns that technology that automates some - but not all - driving tasks could lead motorists to stop paying attention and not be ready to retake control should the situation demand it. (Source[6]) Backseat driver monitor tech is here whether we want it or notThe report continues:Interior-facing cameras inside the car are still a novelty, currently found only in the 2018 Cadillac CT6. Audi and Tesla Inc have developed systems but they are not currently activated. Mazda &lt;7261.T&gt;, Subaru &lt;9778.T&gt; and electric vehicle start-up Byton are introducing cars for 2019 whose cameras measure driver inattention. Startup Nauto's camera and AI-based tech is used by commercial fleets. Companies such as Israel's Guardian Optical Technologies and eyeSight Technologies, Silicon Valley's Eyeris Technologies Inc, Sweden's Smart Eye AB , Australia's Seeing Machines Ltd , and Vayyar Imaging Ltd, another Israeli company using radar instead of vision, are crowding the space. Many have already signed undisclosed deals for production year 2020 and beyond. (Source[7]) Here's the scary part and what we can do to stop intrusive A.I.The scary thing is, the corporations are not motivated by money, here. This is part of acclimating people to an Agenda 21/Agenda 2030 control grid. No one was actually asking for this technology. You may recall that automakers were subsidized to create self-driving cars by none other than DARPA[8].Download Your First Issue Free! Do You Want to Learn How to Become Financially Independent, Make a Living Without a Traditional Job ...nally Live Free? Download Your Free Copy of Counter MarketsNotably, some A.I. companies reveal that the tech is meant for automakers (not consumers), and what regulators want as well. From Business Insider[9]:It is not yet clear how consumers in the age of Facebook Inc and virtual assistants like Amazon.com Inc's Alexa will react to the potentially disconcerting idea of being watched - then warned - inside a vehicle, especially as cars become living rooms with the advent of self-driving. 'There's no doubt this is a hot area,' said Modar Alaoui, founder and CEO of Eyeris, in a recent interview. His company combines five 2D cameras with AI technology for 'in-vehicle scene understanding,' including car occupants' height, weight, gender and posture. Alaoui believes once automakers see the benefits of a camera tracking the driver, they will opt for more. Automakers are paying attention for multiple reasons. As Guardian Optical CEO Gil Dotan said, 'What automakers want is what either sells cars, or what regulators tell them to do.' \u2014 'The reason (the camera) is going to sweep across the cabin is not because of distraction but because of all the side benefits,' said Mike Ramsey, Gartner's automotive research director. 'I promise you that companies that are trying to monetize data from the connected car are investigating ways to use eye-tracking technology.' (Source[10])Notice the big push to get consumers to accept interior-facing cameras and facial recognition whether they want to or not? Even though it means that their data will be monetized for better ad placement to them, with no visible benefits to the driver. Ramsey goes on to say that advertisers could find out how many commuters look at their billboards thanks to eye-tracking tech which could be sold. If it's so great, why does there need to be a big push? It's because it's so intrusive. Why do automakers need to see 'the benefits of a camera tracking the driver' and why do drivers need to be tracked, especially their weight, gender and height? Every ride sounds like a doctor's visit! But who can afford this back-seat driver tech? Some of it has been quietly subsidized and perhaps many people will lose the ability to travel if they don't join in the smart grid. All we can do is continue to push back and refrain from joining in. Every time you go to buy a car, make sure you express your disgust at surveillance and facial tracking and keep the old-time cars as long as possible. A.I. companies assure that consumers will still be able to opt-out but that's what we were all told about smartphone privacy options. Now, it's common knowledge that phones are constantly listening.Jeepers, creepers - A.I. is more than just a staring contestAmericans are now comfortable with the idea of being watched and recorded. They've forgotten about the penetrating gaze of cameras, much like a laboratory animal is oblivious about the researcher studying it behind the two-way glass. But back-seat driver technology is not just another staring contest Indeed, this is more about A.I. learning and anticipating YOUR human behavior. And if what I've just said reminded you of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: Space Odyssey, then you are now starting to think about the potential dangers of futurist tech. 'The more you know about the user, the more you're able to fulfill his or her needs,' said Eric Montague, senior director of strategy for Nuance Automotive. His company usestracking tech, voice recognition, and even emotional analysis from a third-party company called Affectiva. No one asked to have all their needs fulfilled by facial recognition and eye-tracking - as though it's a foregone conclusion that the temperature of my butt warmer is more important than privacy. Indeed, it's not about your needs, it's about the needs of the government's surveillance programs for which they use monopolistic corporations to serve as the proxy for Intel gathering. And how brilliant it is it that this is all under the guise of new tech products. In other words, consumers are paying for their own laboratory experiment!What did you think of this new tech?Are you concerned about the expansion of A.I. in cars? How do you plan to handle these trends? Let us know in the comments below!

A new feature for Amazon's Alexa might be indicative of that fact. On Wednesday, Amazon rolled out voice commands to delete the recordings[1] that take place every time you use the 'Alexa' wake word so users can protect their privacy without the need to open the Alexa app or dig through the Amazon website. That's good news for people worried that Alexa might inadvertently share their voice recordings with other people \u2014 as has happened in the past on multiple occasions[2] \u2014 or that people may manually review their recordings[3]. An Amazon spokesperson told VentureBeat the voice command was added to show Amazon's commitment to privacy. </p><p>The more likely reason is because Amazon is smart and sees the regulatory writing on the wall. Just hours before the new voice command was announced, the California State Assembly passed the Anti-Eavesdropping Act[4]. The legislation will now be considered by the California State Senate. AB 1395 requires the makers of ambient listening devices like smart speakers to receive consent from users before recording their voices. Legislation nearly passed last month by the Illinois state legislature would have done the same. In addition to Alexa's newfound commitment to privacy, tech giants like Facebook and Google have been vocal in recent weeks about the importance of privacy. Both have had some pretty serious security breaches in recent months[5]. At the F8 developer conference in April, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg declared 'The future is private' and expounded on plans[6] to make end-to-end encryption part of all of its messaging apps. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has also been talking aggressively about his company's belief in privacy for all, and rolled out things like Incognito Mode for Google Maps[7] and new privacy commitments[8].Privacy has become a selling pointRecent actions by tech giants appear to be an attempt to prove they can regulate themselves, as well as a way to shield against regulatory action to come. Regulation of tech companies could very well become a talking point in the coming election year, particularly among people like presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who will make an appearance today in Oakland and has said Facebook, Google, and Amazon should be broken up. But barring federal action, legislative bodies at both the state and local level have become a battleground in the privacy debate across the United States, perhaps in no place as much as California. Beginning January 1, 2020, tech giants will have to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)[9]. AB 375, aka the CCPA, was passed in 2018 and requires businesses respond to consumer requests to delete their data and explain how it's used. Businesses that fail to comply can face legal action or fines. Tech giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon, Uber, and Lyft are seeking a number of amendments before the law goes into effect[10]. As the fifth largest economy in the world and home to companies like Google and Facebook, privacy policy in California could, like GDPR in Europe, have an outsized influence on tech data collection and privacy policy far beyond its borders. But it's not just privacy. In addition to legislation to regulate smart speakers and other ambient listening devices, on Wednesday the California State Assembly also passed AB 5[11], a bill to make it tougher to label workers as independent contractors instead of employees. These fights mirror those around facial recognition software use by governments. Amazon's Rekognition has become a poster child for surveillance capitalism[12] and dystopian fear of a surveillance state. Introduced last week, legislation in the California State Senate would outlaw facial recognition use on police body cam footage. This follows a ban of facial recognition in San Francisco[13]. Oakland and Berkeley are considering a similar ban[14]. Each of these pieces of legislation related to privacy could be addressed with overarching privacy legislation from Washington D.C. However amendments to the CCPA turn out, it seems like a step in the direction of empowering consumers and perhaps someday federal law. Until then, expect to hear politicians and tech company leaders and lobbyists tell you how much they care about privacy. As such a populous state and large economy, to some extent it's always been a smart thing to pay attention to California, but particularly watch what happens in the months ahead, not just in Silicon Valley but also Sacramento. Major changes could be on the horizon for privacy, facial recognition, ambient listening devices, and the future of the gig economy, and those changes will have impact that goes beyond California.

Critics of the Advanced Technology External Advisory Committee (ATEAC)[2] seemed to primarily oppose Heritage Foundation president Kay Cole James, who Google employees say voiced anti-immigrant, anti-gay, and anti-transgender statements[3]. Another member of the eight-person committee resigned[4]. It never held a single formal meeting. Before opposition began to mount, on its face, Google's advisory appeared to be little more than posturing. The group was only scheduled to meet quarterly and did not appear to have any binding power. </p><p>ATEAC appeared to be an attempt to send signals to consumers around the world and lawmakers in Washington at a time when talking about regulation of big tech has become populist politics. It's roughly the same reason Microsoft[5] and Facebook[6] are anxious to talk about regulation. But Google isn't alone in its posturing. Politicians, including many 2020 presidential candidates[7], want to convince voters that they care about the adverse impacts of big tech's monopolies, and big tech companies are posturing to prove they can regulate themselves and that theycare deeply about ethical issues like bias in AI systems. The average person would be wise to be skeptical of statements made by both parties. Researchers, technologists, and the rest of the world will debate the significance of how Google, which sees itself as an AI company instead of a tech company, employs an army of AI researchers, and is creator of the popular machine learning framework TensorFlow, got things so wrong. In hindsight, it would have been much better if Google created a controversial council made up of people knowledgeable about AI who they can argue represents a diverse range of points of view and experiences. After all, the most poignant lesson drilled into the heads of AI practitioners in recent years is that a great range of perspectives can lead to better AI models. Instead, they appear reactionary and shortsighted. If there's a silver lining here, it's that Google initially got things wrong, but listened to dissent and corrected course. That's in sharp contrast to Amazon, which also got pushback this week on ethical grounds over use of its facial recognition software Rekognition. Prominent AI researchers essentially called bullshit[8] on claims by top Amazon machine learning and global policy VPs who tried to discredit a recent audit that found Rekognition lacking in its ability to recognize people of color, accurately classify men and women, or account for people beyond binary definitions of sexual orientation. They also implored Amazon to stop selling Rekognition to law enforcement agencies. Amazon reportedly attempted to sell Rekognition to the Department of Homeland Security, and was used in trials by police departments in Washington and Florida[9]. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)[10] this week rejected an Amazon petition to stop a vote by shareholders that could curb Rekognition use until an audit and civil rights review can take place. Shareholder protest over Rekognition dates back to last year[11]. It could be that Google chose to disband its council because it was wary of direct action by its employees, tens of thousands of whom walked out of the majority of its offices worldwide last year demanding change, or that Google feared another ongoing campaign like the kind brought about by working with the U.S. military for Project Maven[12]. There's also the possibility that Google learned some lessons from those experiences. After Maven was made public, internal debate led to the creation of Google's AI guidelines, which included a commitment not to create autonomous weaponry[13]. If this external advisory committee business ends like Maven, maybe the next such body Google forms will be more robust, able to withstand criticism and actually lead to better AI systems. Right now, Google looks more like a company willing to dissent, consider criticism, and correct course, while Amazon looks like a company that wants to suppress dissent. Disbanding an external advisory council after 10 days is a bad look. Fighting with shareholders, researchers, and the SEC is worse. Both companies need to respond by being proactive about the moral and ethical implications of the AI systems they deploy, and genuine in their efforts to make them as democratic and accepting of all people as possible. There's more at stake than a bad user experience with Amazon shopping or the ads you see in Google. Getting things wrong for Rekognition or the sorts of issues ATEAC was to consider could ruin or end human lives.

Open Now[1]  In the United Kingdom there's been some landmark AI news recently involving government use of the technology. First, use of facial recognition by South Wales Police was ruled unlawful by a Court of Appeal[2] judge in part for violating privacy, human rights, and failure by police to verify the tech did not exhibit race or gender bias. How the U.K. treats facial recognition is important since London has more CCTV cameras than any major city outside of China[3]. Then, U.K. government officials used an algorithm that ended up benefiting kids who go to private schools and downgrading students from disadvantaged backgrounds[4]. Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended the algorithm[5] grading results as 'robust' and 'dependable for employers.' </p><p>Students burned exam results in Parliament Square and chanted 'Fuck the algorithm.'[6] Ultimately, the government gave students the choice[7] to pick between a teacher assessment or algorithm score. In the U.S., government use of AI was also called into question as police in Miami and New York used facial recognition[8] to identify protestors at Black Lives Matter protests. Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have talked at length about the notion that facial recognition shouldn't be used at protests because it can chill people's constitutional right to freedom of speech[9]. Around the time the that news emerged that Clearview AI is working with ICE last week, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report[10] that found an increase in facial recognition use by businesses and recommended Congress take action. A prominent group representing facial recognition companies also put forward its own ethical guidelines, which have already been violated by some companies[11]. Amid all these controversies came this week's Democratic National Convention, where technology was both a topic of policy discussion and the enabler of the event itself. It was an entirely virtual convention, where roll call votes to nominate the candidates, speeches, musical performances, and major speeches were recorded or performed live around the country. In his acceptance speech Thursday, Biden talked about[12] his plan to address COVID-19 if elected and said the U.S. faces four historic crises: COVID-19, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression[13], calls for racial justice reform, and climate change. He talked about the idea of this generation wiping out the stains of racism from the American character. He also talked about a plan to create five million new jobs in manufacturing and technology. A plan laid out last month includes a $300 billion research and development investment in areas like 5G and artificial intelligence. In her acceptance speech[14], Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris introduced herself to the country, the first Black woman and Indian woman vice presidential candidate in U.S. history. She mentioned the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th amendment granting some women the right to vote; talked about how President Trump is unfit for office; and acknowledged that people who are Black, Latinx, and indigenous are dying of COVID-19at disproportionately higher rates. 'This is not a coincidence. It is the effect of structural racism, of inequities in education and technology, health care and housing, job security and transportation,' Harris said. A closer look at the Biden 2020 campaign plan to address racial inequity finds a plan of action that touches on a range of areas, from fair government contracting and opportunities for entrepreneurs and small businesses to closing the racial wealth gap, ending housing discrimination, and eliminating cash bail systems. Artificial intelligence is also in multiple parts of the platform, like the Biden education plan[15] to bring computing education to grade schools so children can grow up and get jobs in AI, and the Biden foreign policy plan[16], which says 'We must ensure the technologies of the future like AI are bound by laws and ethics and promote greater shared prosperity and democracy.' The foreign policy plan continues to say 'Technology companies \u2014 which benefit from the fruits of democracy \u2014 should make concrete pledges for how they can ensure their algorithms and platforms are not empowering the surveillance state, facilitating repression in China and elsewhere, spreading hate, spurring people to violence, and remaining susceptible to misuse.' The platform also pledges that as president Joe Biden would charge the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau to try to ensure algorithms used for credit scores are free of discrimination. Algorithmic bias is mentioned in the context of credit scores and social media platforms. However, the Biden plans to address racial inequity and criminal justice do not appear to include support for or plans to limit surveillance technology or acknowledge a history of cooperation between big tech companies and police[17]. The Democratic Party 2020 platform[18] mentions artificial intelligence four times, primarily in the context of research and development, but also mentions the importance of military investments necessary to 'meet the threats of the future.' It also says 'Democrats believe that algorithms and platforms should empower people instead of the surveillance state.' By contrast, addressing surveillance is a part of the Movement for Black Lives policy platform[19]. Organizers created the first platform in 2016, and updated earlier this month ahead of the Black National Convention[20], an approach akin to the creation of a Black national agenda drawn from a similar gathering first held in 1972[21]. More than 50 organizations that are part of the Black community endorsed the plan. Like the Biden 2020 campaign, the Movement for Black Lives also calls for an end to the cash bail system[22], but it also calls for the end of pretrial detention and pretrial risk assessment, something the Partnership on AI said last year algorithms that automate bail processes are not yet fit for use[23]. Based on the Biden 2020 plan and Democratic Party platform, we get an idea of what Harris meant when she said technology plays a role in structural racism. VentureBeat reached out to the Biden 2020 campaign for more details. It's been supposed in the past that if another AI winter[24] comes along it would be the result of something like compute restraints or research progress hitting a wall. What if the winter comes about because the wider public's negative interactions with or negative perception of tech like facial recognition sours a willingness to accept or trust the results? To some degree, it seems a good thing for people to be reminded that algorithms make mistakes, but when people in power use algorithms to make decisions about people's lives, what happens is that mistrust settles in, like the kind a recent NYU-Stanford University study[25] of U.S. federal government of AI alluded to. The Biden-Harris campaign has shared some of its viewpoints on AI; there's certainly an awareness of algorithmic bias present in the platform, and Kamala Harris has a history of questioning racial bias built into AI[26], including facial recognition. She also has an extensive history with Silicon Valley[27] and has proposed legislation like the AI in Government Act to remove hurdles of government adoption of the technology. Depending on how Election Day goes on Nov. 3, laws like a facial recognition moratorium[28], facial recognition ban, or national biometric law[29] like the kind recently introduced in the U.S. Senate could be on the way from Congress or the next presidential administration. There's a lot that has to be decided between now and then, but no matter who wins the next presidential election, the use of predictive policing, pretrial risk assessments, facial recognition, and other AI applications will remain a controversial part of racial justice reform. Justified fear that these systems will only exacerbate and amplify existing injustices means even if such AI is extensively tested before being deployed, it raises the risk of reducing trust in AI and governments alike.

In this same vein, he talked about how some people see'an antitrust situation'[2]with Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Before Trump's latest Twitter tirade began,on SundaytheNew York Timesreported[3] that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis wrote a memo to President Trump earlier this year asking him to create a national strategy for AI akin to the kind China has created. China's strategy was introduced last year and aims tomake China the world leader in AI by 2030[4], in part through 'military-civil fusion' with companies like Baidu and Tencent. Mattis reportedly said in the memo the United States isn't keeping pace with China and recommended a presidential commission be created. </p><p>Whilequoting an article by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger[5], Mattis wrote that the commission should be established in order to inspire 'a whole country effort that will ensure the U.S. is a leader not just in matters of defense but in the broader 'transformation of the human condition.'' The memo was apparently sent weeks after the Trump administrationformed an AI advisory council[6]. Do not consider the Mattis memo and Trump's argument with Google in isolation. The president more than likely doesn't believe he's being discriminated against or care about antitrust regulation and is just teeing off on big tech companies to win points with his far-right base. But even if he does actually believe Google treated him unfairly, it may not be in the best interest of the United States to argue with a company closely associated with the growth of AI and tools like TensorFlow. Right now, he should probably be listening to his defense secretary and thinking about what a national AI strategy should look like for the United States, and exploring the topic with companies like Google. Recent months have been marked by friction between tech workers and the federal government. Thousands of Google employees spoke up in opposition to working with the Department of Defense on Project Maven, opposition that led Google todiscontinue its contract with the DOD[7]and CEO Sundar Pichai to declareGoogle will not participate in the creation of autonomous weaponry[8]. ManyMicrosoft employees also shared their unwillingness to support ICE[9]due to President Trump's program to separate families at the U.S.-Mexico border. Employees at some tech companies have quit in protest in response to military contracts, but not everyone is against the idea. Computer vision startup Clarifai also participated in Maven, and CEO Matt Zeiler said Clarifaichose to work with the government in the interest of national security[10]. More work between tech companies and defense or intelligence officials is likely on the way. TheJoint AI Center (JAIC) established by the Department of Defense in June[11]is scheduled to open next month, and director Brendan McCord apparently plans to seek help from academia and industry. In calling for a 'whole country effort,' Mattis' memo appears to allude to more partnerships with private companies, but even if that doesn't happen, stakeholders making influential tools for AI like the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, PyTorch, or TensorFlow should probably be consulted when considering a national AI strategy. Algorithmic bias and the need to regulate tech giants are serious issues worth consideration, but right now the president should be having conversations with companies like Google about how they can cooperate with the JAIC or put in their two cents on a national AI strategy, not sending tweets about how Google didn't promote his inauguration. If you believe, as Vladimir Putin does, thatthe nation that leads in AI will control the world[12], apparently there's a lot at stake, and national security is a president's first responsibility.

Register now[2] for an early bird 40% discount.Artificial intelligence garnered a lot of attention from the usual players \u2014 governments, tech giants, and academics \u2014 throughout 2019. But it was also a big year for business AI, with even more growth expected ahead. In a March KPMG survey, more than half of business executives said their company would implement enterprise-scale AI within two years[3]. That is partly what drives PwC estimates[4] that AI will deliver $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Impressive leaps in 2019 have enabled new business applications for virtual assistants, such as Salesforce's updated Einstein Voice Assistant[5] for sales and customer service apps and IBM's intelligent agent Watson Assistant[6]. Meanwhile, governmental deployment of AI around the world has led to abuses and concomitant regulation. But along with concerns about power in AI[7] comes the technology's potential to help make everyday life a little better.Automated AI for the enterpriseThe enterprise cloud market heated up with increased implementation of automated machine learning (AutoML) that allows customers to apply AI to use cases such as marketing, customer service, and risk management. </p><p>The biggest players in cloud computing \u2014 Google, Microsoft, and Amazon \u2014 spotlighted AI tools and automation in their annual tech showcases. Microsoft summed it up at Ignite 2019[8]with its tagline for Azure Cognitive Search: 'Use AI to solve business problems.'[9] At the Google Cloud Next conference[10] in April, Google announced new AutoML classes, premade Retail and Contact Center AI services, and the collaborative model-making tool AI Platform[11]. In December, Amazon launched a blizzard of AI-powered enterprise tools at its re:Invent 2019 conference[12]. One of the more intriguing tools from Google Cloud Next was AutoML Natural Language[13], released widely in December, which analyzes text from a range of document and formatting types to feed sentiment analysis, legal document parsing, and publications management. Amazon rolled out a similar tool for AWS, called Textract[14], in April. Microsoft, meanwhile, pumped up the subject matter virtual agents, sentiment analysis, and business process automation available on its business-focused Power Platform[15].AI at the edgeAt the other end of the network \u2014 the edge \u2014 software advances like federated and multimodal learning are enabling artificial intelligence on smartphones and other devices, with the promise of greater control and better privacy protections[16] compared to AI processed in the cloud. In June, Apple introduced Core ML 3[17], which allows iOS devices to perform machine learning for the first time. Google incorporated federated learning into its TensorFlow development environment back in 2017, and the effort is bearing fruit: In October, Google promoted the many AI touches on the Pixel 4[18] smartphone, from speech recognition to greatly improved camera features. Hardware is also becoming more efficient, with 'real AI' powered by mobile chips. Examples abound: Arm is building up its product line to power machine learning and AI[19] in a wide selection of devices. Intel promoted Keem Bay, a vision processing unit[20] that brings inferencing tasks to edge devices. Google offered Coral AI[21], a range of boards and kits for neural network machine learning that work on the edge. And Nvidia released the Jetson Xavier NX[22] to power AI for drones, cars, and other mobile edge devices. In addition, a new focus on power efficiency[23] could help reduce the environmental (and financial) impact of running all those AI systems. Google created a controller that keeps its experimental quantum processor cool enough to function while using just 2 milliwatts[24] of power. On the consumer side, Facebook announced DeepFovea[25], an AI technique that improves the power draw of VR headsets. And even closer to home, Sense released a line of AI devices[26] to monitor and reduce household energy use, while Evolve Energy's AI helps solar and wind power customers[27] find the best prices and save energy.Shipping and shoppingBesides consumer energy monitors like the above, 2019 saw huge advances in areas like autonomous cars and the internet of things (IoT). AI also made inroads into such everyday tasks as grocery shopping[28]. Self-driving cars from the likes of Uber[29], Lyft[30], Alphabet's Waymo[31], Tesla[32], and Argo[33] are the pretty face of autonomous vehicles, and consumer sentiment[34] reports suggest the public is warming to the idea. But commercial trucking was where the money was in 2019. Carmaker Volvo is so confident in the viability of its smart trucks that it's going to break out its driverless financials[35] starting in 2020, although it faces competition from the likes of TuSimple, which is testing delivery for the U.S. Postal Service[36]; Daimler, which is testing autonomous trucks[37] in Virginia; and Starsky Robotics, which relies on remote teleoperators[38] to run its test fleet. Competition in the AI assistant market is still greatest between Amazon[39] and Google[40], rivalry that has spurred the performance and capabilities of voice recognition and personal assistants. Amazon and Microsoft launched the Voice Interoperability Initiative[41] in September, along with a slew of partners \u2014 absent Apple, Samsung, and Google \u2014 that seek to allow devices to run more than one assistant. There's good reason for Microsoft to join, since it's become clear its Cortana is not beating Amazon's Alexa[42] or Google Assistant anytime soon. But Samsung's Bixby also stepped back[43] in acknowledgment of its market position. As for which voice assistant is best, Google Assistant keeps coming out on top in accuracy tests[44], although in a May 2019 test by Tom's Hardware, Alexa and Siri were not far behind[45]. AI went mainstream for grocery shopping in 2019. Walmart is using AI to improve online grocery ordering[46], employing machine intelligence to figure out what consumers are likely to need, and it's begun using driverless vans[47] to ferry goods between stores in Arkansas. Meanwhile, Microsoft helped grocery chain Kroger create cashierless stores[48] using smart shelves and other intelligent technology, while the Giant Eagle chain[49] turned to Grabango for its own AI trial.Governmental give-and-takePoliticians and corporations clashed throughout 2019 over the appropriate use and oversight of AI. Famously, one of Democratic senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren's campaign promises is to break up big tech businesses like Google and Amazon. 'With fewer competitors entering the market, the big tech companies do not have to compete as aggressively in key areas like protecting our privacy,' Warren's campaign blog[50] states. And her rivals[51] brought up AI specifically in the Democratic debates. Beyond the general concern of private-market encroachments upon personal freedoms, governments from the Massachusetts town of Somerville[52] to the nation of the U.K.[53] are examining how the public sector should use AI technology \u2014 and coming to differing conclusions. While China has been using facial recognition to regulate cell phone accounts[54] and allegedly round up[55] the Uighur minority population, most governments in the U.S. that examine the technology do so to limit or ban its use. Especially in California, San Francisco[56] and other cities[57] are enacting bans on use of facial recognition by public entities, particularly police departments. Detroit has no such ban, and indeed its police chief, James Craig, is enthusiastic about facial recognition's potential to fight crime. This led to an August 2019 Twitter beef for the ages between Chief Craig and Detroit's U.S. Congressional Representative, Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), that ended in an awkward demonstration[58] of the technology that frustrated both sides. The tide could turn if President Trump wins re-election in 2020, as his administration takes a more collaborative approach[59] to AI. If the eventual Democratic nominee is Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT), and he wins, Chief Craig might be out of luck[60]. But legislation to regulate facial recognition has been surprisingly nonpartisan[61] so far.Smart citiesDespite privacy concerns over government use of AI, the technology can improve everyday life, especially if proper care is taken to consider the ethics[62]. The amount of data being created by smart cars[63], roadside cameras, public transit, and other sensors is overwhelming, but by feeding it into AI systems, companies like Waycare[64] are helping cities predict and improve traffic flow. StreetLight Data[65] takes a different approach: By tapping into cellphone location data, it can track and predict traffic for vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. London is using Waze[66] to tackle traffic congestion in the city center and reduce air pollution. Elsewhere, Alphabet division Sidewalk Labs[67] is helping Toronto[68] push the envelope of smart city technology[69], fed by weather and usage patterns, to create a high-tech innovation district[70]. Norway has emerged as a hotbed for startups leveraging AI to build better cities. Oslo-based Spacemaker[71]'s software allows city planners to estimate the effect of each planning decision and optimize for a range of goals, courtesy of machine learning. And in August, the city of Trondheim unveiled Powerhouse[72], a smart office building designed to generate more energy than it consumes and apply the excess to powering other smart city tech, such as road monitoring. As 2019's projects come to fruition in 2020 and beyond, it will be interesting to watch how AI develops in the real world. Ethical oversight will be needed to make sure the technology continues to serve humanity[73], rather than the other way around.

That said, a large chunk of the push to \"do something\" about Google, Facebook and Twitter's supposed assault on free speech is also little more than wet nonsense[2] driven by people who don't understand how the internet or First Amendment work[3]. And a lot of the recent breathless hyperventilation in DC[4] and vilification of \"big tech\" is being driven by the telecom sector, which has spent years demanding that their broken and uncompetitive monopoly market be mindlessly deregulated, while the healthier, more competitive online content and ad space face onerous new regulations[5]. We've discussed at length how the telecom industry has grown bored with the slow, steady profit made from upgrading and running broadband networks[6], and has shifted its focus toward the sexier realm of online advertising. Granted, when large ISPs try to directly compete in that space they tend to fall flat on their faces[7], since running government-pampered monopolies has dulled their innovative and competitive edge. As a result, the Comcast/AT...erizon version of \"competition\" usually involves two things they're actually good at: cheating by distorting the playing field[8] (aka net neutrality violations) and lobbying. </p><p>The motivation here (money) isn't really mysterious. Cable lobbyists routinely call for regulation of[9] companies they're trying to compete with in the online ad space, and loyal policymakers and lawmakers are frequently happy to oblige[10] to keep campaign contributions flowing. Telecom executives like to pretend this is just fair play, given Netflix and Google's (long since dead[11]) support of net neutrality. The difference: ISPs really were trying to use their broadband monopolies to harm competitors, and Google and Netflix's arguments were largely being made in good faith. There's no good faith ISP arguments occurring here. ISPs don't actually care about privacy, transparency, or your right to spread hate on Twitter. And ISP BFFs like Ajit Pai have long demonized Silicon Valley giants[12] by using straight up nonsense[13] in order to make their argument (like the time he tried to claim a run of the mill Netflix CDN was a network neutrality violation[14]). All while turning a blind eye to ample problems in the telecom sector. This inconsistency was again on proud display this week in a post by Pai over at Medium[15] ahead of this week's Silicon Valley hearings. In it, Pai laments all manner of problems with Silicon Valley giants, from their disdain for privacy, to a lack of total transparency. You'll notice that most of the concerns Pai expresses were comically-absent as he dismantled popular net neutrality (and ISP transparency[16]) protections last fall:\"Are these tech giants running impartial digital platforms over which they don't exercise editorial judgment when it comes to content? Or do they in fact decide what speech is allowed and what is not and discriminate based on ideology and/or political affiliation? And again, going back to the first point: where is the transparency?\"Pai's sudden interest in transparency is downright adorable. But you'd have to be blind not to notice how the things Pai demonizes Silicon Valley for pale in comparison to many of the things we've seen in the telecom sector[17]. You'd also have to be blind not to notice how Pai's arguments perfectly mirror the telecom industry lobbying talking points[18] accidentally leaked to us last week by US Telecom. From ISPs efforts to charge customers more for privacy[19] to using bullshit fees to jack up your bill[20], Pai never bats an eyelash when AT...r Comcast engages in this kind of behavior, yet hyperventilates when talking about Google, Facebook, and Twitter doing things notably less terrible (or hallucinated entirely). Pai spent the last five years insisting that ISPs shouldn't face \"burdensome regulations,\" despite the fact ISPs like Comcast operate natural monopolies. Yet here he is, advocating for new regulatory restrictions to be foisted upon ISP competitors who actually do face competition:\"The public deserves to know more about how these companies operate. And we need to seriously think about whether the time has come for these companies to abide by new transparency obligations. After all, just as is the case with respect to broadband providers, consumers need accurate information in order to make educated choices about whether and how to use these tech giants' platforms.\"Part of the problem is that this conversation on what to do about Facebook, Google and Twitter has been infected by our idiotic need to apply partisanship to fucking everything, regardless of whether it makes intellectual sense. Net neutrality, for example, has long been played up as a \"partisan\" issue by ISPs to sow dissent and derail consensus, despite the fact that an overwhelming bipartisan majority of Americans[21] support it. Here too, ISPs are using baseless, inconsistent, and inflammatory rhetoric[22] to enflame partisan divides and censorship fears with an eye on hampering competitors. There's absolutely a legitimate conversation to be had here in terms of what to do about privacy and speech in the Facebook and Twitter era. And that may or may not involve crafting new regulations. But it might be nice if people wised up to the fact that a huge swath of the conversation is being dictated not by parties acting in good faith with a genuine eye on valid solutions, but by telecom monopolies eager to pee in the discourse pool simply to fatten their wallets.Permalink[23] | Comments[24] | Email This Story[25] [ 1]: <url

He joked that his nightmare scenario would be refereeing a dispute between Verizon and Sinclair Broadcasting, another company he has been accused of helping with his policies.</p><p>\u201cHow do you choose,\u201d he said, \u201cbetween a longtime love and a newfound crush?\u201d</p><p>The agency was expected to vote on Thursday to dismantle the so-called net neutrality rules, which prohibit internet service providers from blocking or charging websites for higher quality delivery to consumers. It would also dial back the stance established during the Obama administration that broadband should be regulated like a utility. The three Republican commissioners, including Mr. Pai, have said they will vote for the proposal, outnumbering the two Democratic commissioners.</p><p>Passing the plan would be the biggest victory in Mr. Pai\u2019s eventful 11-month tenure as the head of the F.C.C. Under his leadership, the agency has already opened the door for more media mergers, curtailed a high-speed internet program for low-income families and allowed broadband providers to raise rates to business customers.</p><p>All of this activity has made Mr. Pai, 44, a former lawyer for Verizon and a longtime government bureaucrat, the target of many <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/07/technology/net-neutrality-protests-opposition.html\">angry protests</url>. In recent days, government officials \u2014 including 18 state attorneys generals and dozens of Democratic members of Congress \u2014 have asked the F.C.C. to delay the vote. On Wednesday,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.doj.state.or.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ag_letter_12-13-2017.pdf\">the attorneys general</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.doj.state.or.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ag_letter_12-13-2017.pdf\">said</url> that many of the 23 million public comments that had been filed to the agency about net neutrality appeared to be fraudulent. Mr. Pai has ignored the delay requests.</p><p>But Mr. Pai\u2019s changes have also made him a pivotal official in the Trump administration\u2019s rush to shed regulations. The effects of his decisions have rippled across the industries Mr. Pai oversees. The looser rules on media ownership, for example, has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/us/politics/how-a-conservative-tv-giant-is-ridding-itself-of-regulation.html\">enabled</url>Sinclair Broadcasting\u2019s $3.9 billion bid for Tribune.</p><p>\u201cAjit Pai has the potential to be one of most consequential commissioners in the agency\u2019s history,\u201d said Gus Hurwitz, an assistant professor at the University of Nebraska College of Law, who is an expert in telecom policy and who supports Mr. Pai\u2019s proposal.</p><p>Even Mr. Pai\u2019s detractors acknowledge that Mr. Pai has been efficient at moving his agenda. Mark Cooper, a staff member of Consumer Federation of America, said Mr. Pai has far outpaced his recent predecessors, even if Mr. Cooper does not agree with those efforts.</p><p>\u201cIn every way,\u201d Mr. Cooper said, \u201chis decisions are bad for consumers and good for big corporations.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pai declined to be interviewed for this article. But in a statement, the F.C.C. said that he \u201chas been focused on making the agency more transparent, closing the digital divide, and updating the Commission\u2019s rules to reflect the modern communications marketplace.\u201d</p><p>The agency added that \u201cthe F.C.C. has modernized its rules across a wide range of areas to encourage more competition and innovation.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pai\u2019s deregulatory fervor began well before the presidential election and his nomination by President Trump.</p><p>The child of immigrants from India who settled in Kansas, Mr. Pai was lauded by Republicans and Democrats when he was appointed in 2011 by President Obama to the F.C.C. Lawmakers and public interest groups hoped the young nominee would bring a greater appreciation for how communications was shifting online than past commissioners.</p><p>But for five years as a minority member of the F.C.C., Mr. Pai consistently voted against regulations such as those limiting business broadband prices and a broadband subsidy for low-income Americans. He complained that the agency\u2019s Democratic leaders, including Tom Wheeler, were too heavy-handed with companies.</p><p>The biggest offense, in his opinion, were the 2015 net neutrality rules, which included the declaration that broadband would be subject to more utility-style rules. He said the regulations would burden the fast-growing high-speed internet market. In dissenting comments during the debate over the rules, he echoed the arguments of telecom companies that the F.C.C.\u2019s net neutrality rules made it hard for telecoms to expand their networks, leading to less innovation in business plans and would eventually harm the economy.</p><p>He also accused the White House of presidential interference in the activities of the F.C.C., an independent agency. Mr. Pai said that the agency had taken its direction only after President Obama posted a video in favor of the net neutrality rules.</p><p>\u201cWe are flip-flopping for one reason and one reason alone,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-15-24A5.pdf\">he said</url> at the time. \u201cPresident Obama told us to do so.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Pai\u2019s consistent opposition attracted supporters from free-market think tanks and conservative commentators like Rush Limbaugh and Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser who recently praised the proposal to scrap net neutrality rules. Mr. Pai became a frequent guest on Fox News and other conservative media and was praised in the editorial pages of The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>\u201cHow fortunately ironic that it is Ajit Pai himself, as the Trump-appointed chair of the F.C.C., that will pull the plug on the ill-intended act called \u2018net neutrality,\u2019\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"http://dailycaller.com/2017/12/08/roger-stone-time-for-real-net-neutrality/\">Mr. Stone wrote</url> recently in The Daily Caller.</p><p>Supporters of net neutrality argue that telecom companies want to become the gatekeepers of the internet, deciding whether sites have access to fast or slow connections. But Mr. Pai has responded by saying the bigger threat is from the big tech companies. Google, Twitter and Facebook, he argues, can deprive consumers of free expression.</p><p>He says Twitter, for example, sometimes wrongly suspends users just because they do not share the same views as the company.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves,\u201d Mr. Pai said last month at an event sponsored by the R Street Institute, a free markets think tank. \u201cWhen it comes to an open internet, Twitter is part of the problem.\u201d</p><p>PHOTOS: Under Ajit Pai, the Federal Communications Commission has moved aggressively to scale back regulations.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday December 12th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The race is on in Alabama, polls open one hour from now.  Voters are  deciding between Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones in the  highly-contested special election for the senate.  The very latest as each  candidate makes a last-ditch effort to drum up support.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Terrorism in New York -- authorities are searching for answers this morning  while Homeland Security reveals the Bangladeshi man suspected of detonating  a pipe bomb near New York City's port authority bus terminal entered the  United States through so-called chain migration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The White House responded to the news saying that it would not have  happened under President Trump's immigration policy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  This attack  underscores the need for Congress to work with the President on immigration  reforms that enhance our national security and public safety.  The  President is certainly concerned that Congress, particularly Democrats,  have failed to take action.</p><p>Specifically the President's policy has called for an end to chain  migration and if that had been in place, that would have prevented this  individual from coming to the United States.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got the very latest this morning from the scene coming  up.</p><p>Markets are mixed today.  Futures indicating a higher opening for the Dow  Industrials, up about 25 points right here.  S&amp;P 500 also up 1 point.  And  Nasdaq however is flat, negative by a point.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the major indices are higher across the board.  The  FT 100 up a fraction.  CAC 40 and the -- the CAC 40 is up a quarter of a  percent.  And the DAX index also up a fraction.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were lower across the board, by the way, on the  heels of another record setter yesterday on Wall Street.  Shanghai  composite down one and a quarter percent.</p><p>Several former NFL stars hit with sexual misconduct allegations.  The  details as they are suspended from the NFL network.</p><p>And American Express says put the pen away -- why they are no longer  requiring signatures for purchases.</p><p>Plus users turning on Netflix as the streaming site reveals its top-watched  shows.  It also puts viewers on Blast for their binge-watching habits.  The  tweet that's sparking privacy concerns -- coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to break it all  down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street Journal's\"  global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath; and Beyond Sport global ambassador,  Fox News contributor John Layfield.  Great to see you.</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It's great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good  morning.  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good to be here with you.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Bitcoin -- that's the -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're loving the bitcoin.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes, yes.  We can't stop talking about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  $16,000.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm more into talking about the tax plan because I'm wondering  if this new provision in the Senate plan is going to create a selloff in  the stock market by year-end -- Jon.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think there's a real problem with year-end  tax planning right now because they're going to have a bill done in the  next week and a half and anyone who wants to position their 2017 taxes for  year-end, they don't know -- they are going to have a week to respond and  they're going to still be figuring out what's inside the bill.  There just  not a lot of time to work with here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there is this story in the Journal, right -- Dagen, about  the small investment community basically taking a look at this idea that  you have to sell your big winners first.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Top story in the Journal -- stock investors face  a new tax hit (ph).  This is the number one story that the Journal is  reporting.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Only Congress could turn simple math into calculus.  It was a  very simple tax policy and they -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was simple.  What the heck happened?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  This provision that Dagen is talking about -- it's about first  in-first out, they only get $2 billion out of that over ten years.  It's  not clear why they need to do that when it's going to anger so many people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we're going to talk about that this morning.  </p><p>And joining the conversation is AOL co-founder, Revolution chairman Steve  Case is here.  New York Congressman Pete King also joining the  conversation; and the inspiration of the acclaimed 2015 movie \"Joy\", the  self-made millionaire, inventor of the Miracle Mop Joy Mangano is with us  this morning.  You don't want to miss that.  We will find out her  entrepreneurial story.</p><p>But first our top story this hour.  The Alabama polls open one hour from  now.  Republican candidate Roy Moore, Democratic candidate Doug Jones  campaigned in Alabama yesterday in a last-ditch effort to gain support.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUDGE ROY MOORE (R), ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE:  We are up our neck in  alligators.  We are up to neck in people that don't want change in  Washington, D.C.  They want to keep it the same, keep their power, keep  their prestige and keep their position.  And we've got to change that.  </p><p>DOUG JONES (D), ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE:  I'm not going to worry about the  fact that Roy Moore has been kicked out of office twice.  I'm not going to  worry about the fact that he took money from a charity.  And, you know  what, I believe those women in Etowah County but you know what, my party is  more important.</p><p>I am going to tell you, folks, it is time.  And I think we are going to see  it tomorrow.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now from Washington is the \"Daily Caller\"  editor in chief Christopher Bedford.  Christopher -- good to see you.   Thanks for joining us this morning.  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"DAILY CALLER\":  Thanks for having  me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  First topic -- your take on the Alabama Senate election?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  I think it's pretty hard to see Roy Moore not winning this  election today despite the fact he's had all these allegations that have  come out against him but voters there support him.  And you know, maybe if  the Democrats run a more conservative Democrat as opposed to someone who is  extremely liberal on abortion, on health care, on taxes -- they might have  had more of a fighting chance to unseat a Republican in this race.  But  it's really hard to see it.</p><p>And they are trying, though.  They are sending Barack Obama down.  They're  sending the former first lady down.  They're sending Cory Booker down.  A  lot of Democratic all-stars are going to try and change this but right now  the polls are generally, with a few outliers, looking like Roy Moore is  going to win.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Roy Moore -- I thought that it looked like Doug Jones was 10  points ahead according to a Fox News poll.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  I know, the Fox News poll was an interesting blast and everyone  has been talking about it for the last 24 hours.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  But if you look at the Real Clear Politics average of all the  polls, Roy is still holding up a few points ahead.  And that's the word I'm  getting on the ground and it's going to be wild if Fox News turns out to be  the outlier that makes everyone else look foolish in this crazy polling  world we have these days.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Christopher -- is part of this sentiment, you know, forget the  veracity of the claim, we don't have time to figure out if these  allegations are true.  Is part of this simply that you've seen in elections  in the western hemisphere like with Theresa May, with Brexit, with  President Trump -- people just don't like to be told what to do.  And is  that part of what's going on in Alabama?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  I think that's true.  The people in Alabama have really largely  been dismissed and attacked repeatedly by national news media and by  national political figures who sort of called them stupid or said how could  you support this bigot.  Or how could you support this molester?</p><p>And also places like the \"Washington Post\" and CNN have lost a lot of their  capital with Republican voters from years and years of unfair coverage even  just this last week of three massive retractions in the news.  Republican  voters and conservatives are less likely to believe them than ever.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Christopher -- you're saying though if it wasn't the  \"Washington Post\" that broke the story about these women and their  allegations, that if it was some other publication who had done it, that it  would somehow have changed the way that people would vote in that state?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  It's possible.  You hear it repeatedly -- repeatedly, consider  the source.  I don't think that's necessarily always fair because the  source of these allegations are different women in the state of Alabama,  but since it's come out and especially after decades of not having come out  while Roy Moore has been a very public figure in Alabama, then the national  news media descends on the state, shows more interest in it than it has  since the 60s and they come out with all these allegations from people and  it comes from a source that's less trusted in the state, that definitely  hurt it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to what happened yesterday in New York.  New  York City is reeling from a bombing in Times Square.  The White House  responded to suspicion that the Bangladeshi suspect currently in custody  entered through U.S. chain migration.</p><p>This comes as Reuters is reporting that Bangladeshi police are questioning  the suspect's wife.  Christopher -- what's your take on this?</p><p>BEDFORD:  And it's not just chain migration, it's Donald Trump's other  bogeyman -- it's the diversity lottery.  The person who came in, came in  through a diversity lottery, a relative of his.  And this suspect here,  very likely suspect, since the pipe bomb went off in his pocket, was the  fourth removed family member to be able to -- the most distant removed  family member to be able to come through on this diversity lottery and then  through chain migration.</p><p>These kind of things, this is actually maybe almost a good thing for the  Republicans and for Donald Trump because it's the kind of terror attack  where no one was hurt except for the suspect.  We don't have a lose of  life.  You have someone who is clearly connected to ISIS and it makes too,  the President's point for him.</p><p>It's going to be difficult to defend this.  There are a lot of people on  the left that have been saying migration has got nothing to do with this.   Of course, it's got something to do with it, that's why he was here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You would think so but you're not really hearing the  mainstream media connect the dots on that one.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Not yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, not yet.</p><p>Let me ask you about this dossier scandal because this is really something  that the \"Daily Caller\" has been doing such a good job on.  A senior  Justice Department official demoted for concealing meetings with the men  behind the anti-rump dossier, has personal ties to Fusion GPS.</p><p>This is a Fox News exclusive.  His wife worked for Fusion GPS in 2016  during the election.  Every day we get another point of conflict of  interest around this Russia probe, around Fusion GPS and Hillary Clinton.   Your take on this.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I wanted to withhold judgment for a while when it first came out  that a lot of these people at a point had donated to Democrats, a lot of  these investigators.  Because you want to say that these people are going  to do their jobs.  They're investigators.  They're professionals.</p><p>But every single day we are seeing more and more problems.  Or actually  it's actually -- Republicans are not getting answers in Congress when they  are asking the FBI, why weren't we told about this person with these  connections?  why do we have to find about this from the news media?  Why  is the FBI not reporting back to us about all of these conflict of  interests, really blatant ones.</p><p>I mean this guy was married to somebody at Fusion GPS.  That's a pretty  close connection right there.  And I think these kinds of things are going  to lead for a call for another special investigator and possibly Jeff  Sessions to appoint one to keep an eye on the investigators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not happening, though.  That's the thing.</p><p>I mean people want to see justice and that's -- what you're saying is still  not happening.  And there have been subpoenas out for information --  haven't there, Dagen -- from Congress.  There have been subpoenas out to  actually get information and there's stonewalling going on for years.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know how do you -- how much taxpayer money though,  Chris, is it going to take to basically -- to use the President's phrase --  drain the swamp?  The more you find out about what goes to Washington, the  more disgusted the average American is about everybody in bed with everyone  -- you know, everybody in bed together.</p><p>There's back scratching and there's never any justice for the average  person.  There's never any conclusion that is satisfying to the taxpayer  who are footing these bills.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  One of the most annoying things you'll find about Washington,  D.C. is as soon as you go out and you go out for dinner or go out for a  drink, one of the first things someone asks you is so what do you do.</p><p>You don't get that in other cities because Washington, D.C. is so  interconnected, everyone is somehow working with everyone and they have an  interest in that.  The swamp is deeply connected with each other.  These  people have an active interest in keeping outsiders out of it.</p><p>And Donald Trump is actually causing massive disruption with these people.   It's causing chaos.  I mean all my neighbors' sons right now, they have all  this (INAUDIBLE) signaling about how they stand up and they were just  against Trump and let no man put hate in your heart.</p><p>Everyone around this city is resisting him.  And it's going to take a lot  of effort.  It's going to take a few years.  And I think we're going to see  a see a couple of fires, brush fires along the way before anything gets  done on the swamp.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So just to be clear.  Fusion GPS basically came up with  this dossier which was never verified and was a bunch garbage and that was  one of the justifications for wiretapping Donald Trump.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  That's what we're trying to figure out if that was one of the  justifications.  And right now what we are certain of is that it was full  of garbage that has caused massive disruption in the news media and then it  likely influenced the FBI and Department of Justice to move in on the Trump  administration.</p><p>And now we are finding out the FBI agents were intimately connected to it.   That does not look good for Mueller or his probe.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, one thing we do know is that Christopher Steele, the  former British intelligence agent who was paid by Fusion GPS and the  Democrats to work with Russians to put together this dossier that the FBI  was talking to him about putting him on the payroll.  We know that.  That  is a fact and that has been proven.</p><p>So, again, to Christopher's point -- is it going to be up to Bob Mueller  and his conflicted team?  I mean there are more conflict that we haven't  even covered today.  Is it going to fall to him to investigate the FBI  which he ran for 12 years?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is he going to investigate the FBI, he ran it? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Jim Comey, his very close friend -- is it going to be up to  him and his team to investigate what went on with this dossier.  And to  Chris' point, you've got to have somebody else doing it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we will see.  If we actually do get the special  prosecutor, another special prosecutor looking at it.  I don't know.  I  don't have a high expectation of that -- Chris.  But we'll see.</p><p>I want to get your take on this breaking news.  President Trump is tweeting  this morning.  Here is what he said.  \"Despite thousands of hours wasted  and many millions of dollars spent the Democrats have been unable to show  any collusion with Russia.  So now they are moving on to the false  accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don't know and/or have  never met.  Fake news.\"</p><p>Wow, the President coming up this morning, talking about the allegations  from the women who are trying to get a congressional investigation going  about inappropriate behavior, sexual inappropriate behavior.  Chris -- your  thoughts?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  It was wild to watch the White House press conference yesterday.   It was almost like it was coordinated amongst a blob of people who think  all the same.  We get a terror attack in New York.  We had tax reform  coming down.  We've got a special election tomorrow in Alabama.</p><p>And almost every one in the press wanted to talk about -- all they wanted  to talk about was these accusations.  The President so far has denied them.   Sarah Huckabee Sanders up there saying I speak for the President, the  President flat out denies this.</p><p>It does not mean it's not going to stop and when you see Democrats so  brutally cleaning out their own house of anyone who has been accused of any  kind of sexual misconduct, I see them as doing that to try and set  themselves up to retake the moral high ground and go hard after President  Trump over these accusations.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, Megyn Kelly had them on her show and then they did  a press conference after that.  You're right.  Christopher -- thank you.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will see you soon, sir.  Christopher Bedford there.</p><p>Still ahead -- when it comes to a pen, you can leave home without it.  Why  American Express is ditching its signature requirements.</p><p>And then binge in the New Year -- Netflix revealing the most streamed shows  of 2017.  The surprising series that took the top spot.  Plus the new  privacy concerns sparked by a tweet from the streaming giant.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>When we told you yesterday about the outpouring of support for Tennessee  middle-schooler who went viral talking about bullying, now there are  questions about his mother's motives for posting that video.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details right now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- Maria.</p><p>So there were more than 22 million hits on Kimberly Jones' heartbreaking  footage of her son Keaton describing being called \"ugly\" at a school.   Someone even launched a go fund me campaign that raised more than $58,000.   But as attention spread so did interest in her.</p><p>She started her own go fund me page actually and then she slammed the  original fundraiser and they are questioning whether she's just trying to  make a quick buck off of her son.</p><p>Reports also began to emerge that she had posted multiple images of  confederate flags on her Facebook account.  Jones has since made her  Facebook page private.  </p><p>Well, American Express trying to stay competitive.  Starting next April,  the company will no longer require a signature regardless of the amount  you're spending.  Right now you have to sign for any purchase over $50.  Of  course, the latest credit cards have a computer chip for additional fraud  protection.  No signature required if you buy something online or on your  phone.  But it's been a strong year for American Express.  The stock is  actually up more than 30 percent.</p><p>Well, streamers that saw Netflix's tweet over the weekend were a little  creeped-out with how much the company seems to know about their viewing  habits.  Netflix tweeted this, \"To the 53 people who watched a Christmas  Prince every day for the past 18 days who hurt you question?\"  Well, the  tweet got a lot of laughs.  It was re-tweeted over 100,000 times but also  some backlash because viewers are thinking, hey, wait a minute, do I have  any privacy with you, maybe I don't.</p><p>All right, but all that viewership data proving useful to Netflix.  The  company has come up with its official \"shows we devoured\" list which means  a series was viewed more than two hours per day.</p><p>The list is surprisingly topped by -- this is interesting -- \"The True  Crime\" spoof \"American Vandal\".  Followed by the Brazilian series \"3  Percent;  the controversial \"13 Reasons Why\", \"Anne with an E\" and  \"Riverdale\".  The most popular streaming day in 2017 was actually New  Year's Day.  Netflix stock up sharply so far this year.</p><p>And no, Dagen -- \"Narcos\" wasn't on that list or \"The Crown\".</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Neither was \"House of Cards\".  </p><p>CASONE:  I don't know what to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you seen any of those shows on that list -- Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Neither have I.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I haven't either.</p><p>CASONE:  What's wrong with me?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I haven't seen any of those shows.</p><p>CASONE:  Am I a nerd?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is that possible?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know.  Something is deeply wrong with me.  I did.  I'm  almost done -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I have not seen any of it -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jon?  What are these shows?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm almost done with the second season of \"The Crown\".  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is it?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not as good as the first season, shall we say.  It's a lot  about Prince Philip -- kind of boring.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's like \"House of Cards\" -- it wasn't as good as it  got older.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  No.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And now Foghorn Leghorn is gone.  I'm talking about Kevin  Spacey.</p><p>I'll say -- I'll say.  I'm Frank Underwood.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Is Foghorn Leghorn even around anymore?  What a great reference.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll say - I'll say -- I'll say.  There you go.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, harassment there, then you have harassment scandals  hitting the NFL Network as well.</p><p>We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back, the fallout after three of the network's analysts  received suspensions over new allegations there.</p><p>And then the Ball brothers making a fast break to an unexpected  destination.  Get this -- Lonzo Ball's two youngest sons are going pro just  weeks after UCLA suspended one for shoplifting on a trip to China.  When  the basketball players will be traveling to Lithuania -- that's next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Former NFL players are suspended from the NFL Network over sexual assault  allegations.</p><p>Jared Max with the story now -- Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS:  Maria -- good morning.</p><p>Hall of Fame running back Marshall Faulk, along with fellow NFL Network  analyst Heath Evans and Ike Taylor have been suspended by the NFL Network  after all three were named in sexual misconduct lawsuit by a former NFL  Network wardrobe stylist.  Jami Cantor who was with the company from 2006  until October 2016.  She filed a wrongful termination suit this October.   Yesterday filed a further complaint.  It alleges sexual harassment and  assault.</p><p>Cantor claims that Faulk groped and fondled her, inappropriate text  messages sent from the others.  In addition to inappropriate texts from  Donovan McNabb, former NFL quarterback and colleague of Cantor's at the  time plus NFL Network executive Eric Weinberger.</p><p>McNabb now with ESPN yet to receive potential punishment.  Weinberger,  president of \"The Ringer\" placed on indefinite leave.</p><p>Monday night football south Florida, Tom Brady going for ninth straight win  in ninth straight division title but very Brady celebration pre-empted by  the Miami Dolphins defense.</p><p>Brady intercepted twice by Xavien Howard last night.  Worst game for Brady  statistically in four seasons.  Jay Cutler three touchdowns for Miami which  held New England to 25 rushing yards and didn't allow the Patriots to  convert a single third down.  That hasn't happened in 26 years.  Dolphins  win it 27-20.</p><p>You know that old saying, if at first you don't succeed, at stealing Louis  Vuitton sunglasses on a basketball trip to China, then get suspended by  UCLA indefinitely -- try, try again to play ball in another country.</p><p>LiAngelo Ball and his younger brother LaMelo Ball are going to be playing  ball together.  The two younger brothers of L.A. Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball  and also the son of LaVar Ball have signed a one year contract to play for  a pro team in Lithuania called Prienu Vytautas.</p><p>LaMelo was only 16.  He was a junior in high school.  He dropped out.   LiAngelo ball is now 19 years old and probably in need of a new pair  sunglasses after that whole mess which became an international incident.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lithuania.  </p><p>MAX:  Yes.  Yes.  And it's not really about money because they're not going  to paid that much.  There's reports that maybe guys make about $500 a  month.  Now you actually get a tax break certainly playing over there.  But  it's really about spreading the Big Baller brand.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Probably the last we're going to hear of them athletically.</p><p>MAX:  Boy, you wonder, they're still kids.  And the coach is said to be the  LaVar Ball of Lithuania.  I don't know that means.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- a buffoon that over-hypes himself.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Hey, how is the Olympics?  Going high-tech.  Humanoid  robot Hubo just carried the 2018 Olympic flame.  Hubo was given the honor  yesterday in South Korea as part of the journey the torch will make before  the games start in February.  This is one of the 85 robot volunteers  assisting in the Winter Games.  Pretty cool.</p><p>MAX:  Maria -- he looks a little bit -- was it the movie \"Short Circuit\" I  think back in the 80s?  He looks a little bit or a little R2D2.  Check this  out.  There was new research from McKenzie (ph) that says that as much as  one-third of American workforce could be out of work of 2030 because of  automation.  That 400 million to 800 million people globally could be  displaced.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MAX:  Maybe some of these robots should have some defects in them so we can  keep ourselves employed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a real concern.  </p><p>MAX:  Yes.  I mean, you know, we laugh about it now but the next 17 year  what holds?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's incredible that they've come up with that -- that  it's 2030 that that's when they'll be that pervasive, robotics everywhere.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I'm a little skeptical of arguments like that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  There were reports like that out ten years ago saying that all  of our jobs were going to be outsourced to India.  And you know, like  radiologists -- we still have plenty of radiologists.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're doing prostate cancer surgery robotically.  I mean  the robotics have been very important and a great growth story for health  care.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It's very important but they're not taking away all the  doctors.  That's my point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know that they are displacing doctors.  Exactly,  exactly.  Yes.</p><p>MAX:  Can they tell me who is going to win the Super Bowl?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They might.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  You need a flux capacitor for that.  </p><p>MAX:  Exactly. -- 88 miles an hour.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  That's right.</p><p>MAX:  With Bill Belichick behind the wheel or answering questions from  reporters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nice \"Back to the Future\" reference -- and \"Back to the Future\"</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Thank you very much.  What happened with Tom Savage and the  concussion.  How did Houston Texas miss that?  </p><p>MAX:  Well, the NFL is really dropping the ball.  There's investigations  going on because the quarterback -- he shouldn't have been allowed to come  back into the game.  All of the concern of head safety.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  And so it was a missed concussion protocol.  They're talking  about revamping and they dismissed -- </p><p>MAX:  It seems like not everybody has their left hand and right hand  working together all the time.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, a lot of players game that system too, don't they.  They  get their baseline down so that when they do get hurt they don't get pulled  out.  </p><p>MAX:  It doesn't seem like it's all on the same page yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared -- thank you.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  Happy Tuesday.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Tuesday,  December 12th, your top stories right now 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>21st Century Fox looks like is losing a bidder for some of its assets.  The  Wall Street Journal reporting Comcast, Comcast is stepping down, no longer  pursuing a deal for key entertainment and media businesses, Disney is still  eyeing a deal.  It's anybody's guess if maybe Comcast steps away because  the deal with Disney is more likely.  The very latest on the major mania in  the media sector.</p><p>Futures this morning show markets will open higher.  Dow Industrials at the  high of the morning right here, up 40 points.  S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also  higher by a fraction.</p><p>In Europe, similar story money moving into equities this morning, European  indices higher across the Board.  FT 100 up a quarter of a percent.  CAC  quarante up almost one half of a percent and the Dax Index up almost a  quarter of a percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, different story.  Markets were lower across the board at  the close.  Worst performer, China.</p><p>We are watching oil prices this morning.  They are rising as a key European  pipeline was shut down for repairs.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Comcast confirmed  yesterday it is no longer in the race to pursue movie and television assets  from 21st Century Fox, leaving Disney as the only serious bidder.</p><p>Meanwhile, AT&amp;T gears up for its fight against the Department of Justice  over its bid to acquire Time Warner, they say, we want this and we're not  going to sell anything to get it.</p><p>Joining us this morning is AOL cofounder, former CEO, the current chairman  and CEO of Revolution, Steve Case.  Steve, it's good to see you.</p><p>STEVE CASE, CEO, REVOLUTION:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  And you were around when we  saw the last bout of last of mergers in media and telecom and that was  obviously a big move for a lot of these companies making these companies  bigger.  The $164 billion AOL-Time Warner merger was the largest in  history.</p><p>What do you make of the current M&amp;A climate?  What are you seeing out  there?</p><p>CASE:  Well, you say, it does feel like Deja Vu all over again.  It's a lot  of same discussions happened 20 years ago about the role of content versus  distribution.  Do you need to be integrated, in particular the battle back  then was the debate between this content king or distribution king.</p><p>It's pretty clear that the consumer is king and the platforms, the Amazon  or Netflix or Facebook that have direct connections to consumers are the  once that are advantage.  As a result, Disney is basically saying they're  going to pull back from Netflix and do their own direct to consumer  offering.  I think they're trying to bulk up, whether it'd be the Fox  assets or other assets to have a credible offering to go directly to  consumers.  So it's someway this is similar battles that we were hearing 20  years ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think?  So you think the consumer is king, but once  again, people are really bidding up content, because -- look at Amazon  right now, it's a little different, and, by the way, I can't believe it was  20 years ago.  You're right.  It was 20 years ago.</p><p>Amazon willing to pay out billions and billions of dollars for original  content, is that where this is going?  Where people are going to start  doing more original content or using the sale of established content for  example Fox, the Simpsons, you know, so many great shows, this is us, among  those being talked about, is that where the value is?</p><p>CASE:  Well, I think the value as I said is with the services that have  direct to consumer offerings.  So, how do you bundle together something  that's credible which is a mix of brands and content people are already  familiar with as well as some original content.</p><p>Again, this is not a new idea.  HBO, 30 or 40 years ago really was  pioneering that highly leverage some of the movies that are already made  but invest in original content, Sopranos or other kinds of things to  differentiate.  So we're continuing to see that move forward.</p><p>So the only difference is now that there's a new companies that didn't  exist 20 years ago Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, et cetera, Apple as well  existed but wasn't really focused so much on media content.  So the battle  will continue, and the ones that really have that consumer connection,  direct consumer connection are likely going to be the winners.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Those companies have their own investment arm.  You look like  an Amazon, it's acquiring.  It's got an investment arm, acquiring  technology companies.</p><p>Let's talk about the fight over net neutrality.  I mean, Apple cofounder,  Steve Wozniak and the man known as the father of the internet, Vint Cerf  are leading a new push to prevent the FCC vote on Thursday.</p><p>The group of internet experts are calling on congress to stop the FCC from  overturning rules that prevent internet providers from throttling or  outright blocking online content.  Your thoughts.</p><p>CASE:  It is also as an old debate.  It's sort of like that.  Prince song  from 1999, the debates in the 90ss around open access.  Now the debate is  around net neutrality.  As a core, it's how do you play the internet as  platform for innovation particularly allow disruptive start-ups  entrepreneurs all over the country to start innovating and not just have  the incumbents kind of lockdown their elites.</p><p>So I'm very concerned about net neutrality.  I share the view of some of  the people who wrote this week saying we need to make sure that the  internet remains open for innovation and we err on side of making sure  things are tilted in favor of those disruptive, those entrepreneurs that  are really trying to launch new things not the existing incumbents trying  to kind of protect their lead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's this push to invest in the heartland.  Your company  launching a $150-million fund, focused on investing in start-ups away from  the coast in the middle of the country.  This is really interesting,  especially when you look at backers including big names like Eric Schmidt,  Jeff Bezos, Meg Whitman, Howard Schultz.  Tell us what your thinking is and  these tries of the rest fund.</p><p>CASE:  Well, I think the -- well, there's great innovation in places like  Silicon Valley, and New York City, and Boston.  Right now, the vast  majority of venture capital goes to those cities.  Last year, 75 percent of  went to just three states, California, New York and Massachusetts.  So the  other 47 states, fight over 25 percent, yet there is great entrepreneurs  all over the country building great companies.</p><p>There is not a lot of venture capital attention.  So this Rise of the Rest,  we launched about four years ago.  It's now accelerating, as you mentioned.   We launched last week this new fund and we've got about three dozen of  Americas most iconic, respected entrepreneurs and investors, and  executives, and families all joining us saying they believe in the idea of  Rise of the Rest.  They believe there are great entrepreneurs everywhere.   They believe there are great investment opportunities everywhere and I hope  is what capitalize more focus on middle of the country start-ups and will  result in great breakout successes in those communities, also in the  process create a lot of jobs, and more hope in those communities.</p><p>A lot of people wake up in the morning, feeling like they're anxious about  the future.  They're not sure what the role of technology is going to be in  their family and their community.  I want to make sure, by backing startups  everywhere, they are creating jobs everywhere, that will really change that  dynamic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's interesting because it's like you look around the world,  everybody wanted to be the Silicon Valley, right?  Even in Russia, they  created this culpable project and yet there are little mini Silicon Valleys  innovation hubs throughout the country.  You look at Biotech Upstate New  York.  There's all of these little hubs everywhere, where you actually can  tap into real innovation happening not necessarily just Silicon Valley.</p><p>CASE:  Absolutely.  And we've seen that we now there are 33 cities on a  rise.  The rest road trips that will three, three and a half years.  8,000  miles by bus, so we've been to places like Pittsburgh where a lot of great  things are happening with the robotics because of Carnegie-Mellon, buffalo,  some of the Biotech things that trade a lot of things around mobility New  Orleans.  A lot of things around Ag tech, Louisville and St. Louis around  Ag tech, farming.</p><p>We're seeing innovation happening all over the country.  We're trying to  change the dynamic on with this rise of the rest to make sure their  entrepreneurs in those places have access the capital to grow and scale  their companies.</p><p>It's long and understood that creativity is wildly dispersed.  Opportunity  is not and really trying to level the playing field so everybody,  everywhere who has an idea really has a shot at American dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some of these companies though are more powerful than they ever  have been.  When you look at the big five, the FANG companies, right?   Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, they have so much power, given all of  the data, and the information that they have, about us, all.</p><p>Do you think the regulatory market changes the regulatory environment  changes for technology, given the fact that this is a completely different  industry, than just 10 years ago or five years ago, Steve?</p><p>CASE:  Yes, I think it's beginning to change.  We start seeing that the  last couple years in the European Union.   Brussels got a backing, has  starting to slow some of the things happening with some of the big tech,  and we're seeing a growing backlash in this country as well.</p><p>People are proud of what's happening in Silicon Valley, but also nervous  about some of the implications, and including here in Washington, D.C.,  there's a lot more focus obviously even some congressional committees  looking into what was the role of Facebook or other things even in the  election.</p><p>So it now become so much more central in terms of our everyday lives.  Had  such a big impact on our economy.  It's not surprising that there's more of  a focus on the role of big tech if you will.  And do I think Silicon Valley  needs to be careful.</p><p>Last decade, as you well know, Wall Street sort of been the bad guy, I  think Silicon Valley is at risk of becoming kind of the new bad guy where  people love some of the products and service that come from Silicon Valley.   They are a little nervous about some of the steps -- some companies in  Silicon Valley are taking.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I was asking, because you know, in the last 10  years, we saw the financials basically sit on cash, they were unwilling to  do anything with their money, because they didn't know what regulation was  around the corner, then you had Dodd-Frank.  You wonder if that's going to  happen to the technology sector.  Now, they're the big spenders.  Will they  be the big spenders in the future if they've got congressional oversight  that's much tougher than they saw in the past?  And then, of course, Steve,  there's bitcoin.</p><p>So you're obviously a student of this industry for a long time 25 years,  even more.  What do you think of bitcoin, Steve?</p><p>CASE:  Well, I think it's exciting one though, but take this in their core  technologies around block chain.  But again, it does feel a little bit like  20 years ago where there's a phenomena, a mania almost around dotcom.  Now,  here's a little bit of a mania particularly on the trading side around  bitcoin and ICOs, things like that.</p><p>So think the core technology of block chain ability to track things I think  is very important, but I think there is a little bit too much speculation  right now and will be interesting to see how things settle.</p><p>I saw even yesterday, as he stepped in to stop ICO, an initial coin  offering that was happening and this idea that you can raise capital in an  unregulated way which has happened recently.  I don't think that is  sustainable.</p><p>So I think we have to separate what's happening in terms of the core  technologies like block chain and what's happening in terms of speculation,  around that, whether it be bitcoin and ICOs.  I think that we need to be a  little more careful than we've been in recent months around thinking about  that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Winklevoss brothers yesterday said that this is regulated  but I suspect if this action keeps up with bitcoin, it's going to be  regulated a lot more.</p><p>CASE:  I think it's no question.  It got talked about and I book in the  third.  There's next wave of industries and the role of policy regulations  playing a deeper role whether it'd be financial services or health care, or  some smart cities important aspects of our lives.  There's going to be more  regulations.</p><p>Entrepreneurs hate hearing that particularly in Silicon Valley, but I think  it's going to be true and we're going to see that with bitcoin as well,  there's no question, the regulators not just in this country but around the  world are going to make sure they have adequate protections in place to  make sure these technologies, these platforms can have a positive impact on  the market as opposed to kind of have potentially some unintended  consequences that could be negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great insights, Steve.  We'll be watching the Rise of the Rest  fund.  Always great to talk with you, sir.  Thank you.</p><p>CASE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Steve Case there.</p><p>Still ahead, smoking leads to a fiery confrontation on Southwest Airlines  flight.  A passenger threatens to kill everybody onboard after crews asked  her to put out her cigarette.  The frightening footage that ended in felony  charges.  That's next.</p><p>And then scouting for new flavors.  Yoplait teams up with Girl Scouts for a  twist on yogurt, back in a minute.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news right now.  San Francisco mayor,  Ed Lee has died.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  We're just getting some new details into this, Maria.  Lee died  early this morning, according to his office.  The \"San Francisco Examiner\"  says that Lee died after suffering a heart attack while shopping at a local  Safeway store near his home.  He was pronounced dead at Zuckerberg San  Francisco General Hospital early this morning.</p><p>Lee was a big supporter of San Francisco as sanctuary city.  He strongly  defended that controversial policy after Kate Steinle was murdered in 2015  by convicted felon who was deported five times.</p><p>Mayor Ed Lee dead at the age of 65.</p><p>Well, a 24-year-old woman has been arrested after she threatened to kill  passengers on a Southwest Airlines flight from Portland to Sacramento.   This happened after she was caught smoking in the airplane bathroom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I swear if you don't -- I will -- kill everybody on  this -- plane.  I will kill everybody on this -- plane.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, she was physically restrained by crew and passengers until  the plane was able to safely land in Sacramento.</p><p>Well, amid the spike in reports of sexual assault and harassment in the  news lately, feminism is Merriam Webster's word of the year for 2017.  The  dictionary says the word was the top lookup throughout the year starting as  early as January during the women's march on Washington, shortly after the  inauguration.</p><p>Well Girl Scout cookies are not going to be available for a few months,  darn it.  But thankfully, Yoplait yogurt is coming out with something to  satisfy the cravings.  Girl Scout cookies that come in yogurt form.  Later  this month Yoplait is releasing new flavors inspired by the different  cookies, thin mint, peanut butter chocolate, and caramel coconut.  Yes,  please.  Those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I'll take it.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up next, AR, a reality?  We will talk to the company that succeeded  with augmented reality where major technology threatened to fail.  Wait  till you see this, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  With the holiday shopping season in full swing,  now, one of the hottest gifts out there, is augmented and virtual reality  headsets.</p><p>The company has taking the lead in bringing AR glasses to the market is not  Google, by the way, it is a company based out of Rochester, New York  called, Vuzix.</p><p>So joining me right now is founder and CEO of Vuzix, Paul Travers.  Paul,  good to see you.</p><p>PAUL TRAVERS, CEO, VUZIX:  Maria, thanks for having us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>So, how was Vuzix able to do what other huge tech companies were unable to  do for so many years in terms of glasses?  We want to look at the  spectacles here.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Well, all these other guys are making things that are massive  quite frankly and Vuzix makes lightweight wearable, all-day long kinds of  devices.  We started the enterprise.  We actually have to go all the way  back to the defense market.</p><p>The defense guys, Special Forces guys, asked if we could make Oakley-style  subclasses.  Nobody likes to look like a nerd when they put this stuff on.   If you look at VR market today, all these things are giant sort of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're really big on your head.  Let me check these out.  See  how light they are.  Can I try this on?</p><p>TRAVERS:  Yes, please do.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you have two models here on set.  This one is the M300?</p><p>TRAVERS:  That's actually the Blade.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, this is -- OK.  So this is the Blade.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Yes.  And it's B to C and consumers, those kinds of things.  With  those glasses on, you want to take your phone out of your pocket?  Put  those glasses on, you'll be able to -- Sam, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What I like is that I don't feel like a geek.</p><p>TRAVERS:  And you don't look like one either.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know about that.  But tell me what this Blade does.</p><p>TRAVERS:  So with your phone in your pocket.  Imagine you're walking down  the street and there's a Pokemon Go character that's up to the right,  everybody knows Pokemon Go.  Millions of users in a week.  The Pokemon Go  character comes up, you look and through the glasses you see this character  sitting on a street or you're getting directions and the directions are in  your glasses.  A phone call comes in, you can answer with the glasses on.   It's beginnings of leaving your phone in your pocket.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  OK.  So I don't have to take my phone out with this.   This is going to show me -- let's do the other model. This one is the M300  Enterprise Class smart glasses.  This is for enterprise, tell us.  Put  those on.  Let me know what it's for.</p><p>TRAVERS:  That's correct.  So these guys are worn like this, around your  neck when you're in a warehouse situation that put glasses on, and this  becomes effectively the barcode scanner.  So instead of taking a handheld  barcode scanner, going over to the box -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here, here's the barcode scanner.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Actually in this particular case, Sam, we're operationally --  well, let me actually run it here.  So I'm looking through these glasses  and you can see, this is nothing more than a blueprint.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ooh, look at the screen.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Through the glasses, you can see there's literally a multistory  building sitting here that's not real.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What we're seeing on that screen is what you're seeing in your  glasses?</p><p>TRAVERS:  That's correct.  That's correct.  So you can imagine so many  applications where this can become a valuable tool.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  you made the analogy earlier, if you're on a plane, on your --  unloading the baggage from a plane.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Yes.  We worked with folks like SATS at Changi Airport and they  have the gate folks wearing these glasses.  The pallet comes by, on the  side of pallet, a few barcode, barcode kind of a thing.  Through these  glasses you see all of the information about where that pallet goes on a  plane.  What section of the plane it belongs in.</p><p>If it doesn't belong on that plane, they will have a red marker on the  outside of it and just like this building that's not real or marker is not  real, but digitally, they can put it in remove it ad at the same time -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They know where the baggage goes on the plane.</p><p>TRAVERS:  They can turn around a plane in one half, the amount of time  compared to how they do it today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's very cool.  So Vuzix recently entered into a supply  agreement with Toshiba.  Tell us about that.</p><p>TRAVERS:  I can tell you a little bit about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Well, it's very exciting for me, actually.  It's one of the  largest, probably orders that smart glasses have seen, quite frankly.   Toshiba is a major player in the laptop space.  They're coming out with a  line of products that are wearable, etch-oriented and they're buying smart  glasses from Vuzix.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really?  Cool stuff.</p><p>TRAVERS:  We learn a lot more about that here.  It's a multimillion-dollar  contract for Vuzix and sometime here in the first quarter, Toshiba will be  sharing a lot more.  What is the world and 3D?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I feel that if you don't have augmented reality or A.I. or some  sort, you're going to be left behind, because every industry is using it at  this point.</p><p>TRAVERS:  We have companies getting -- doing things 500 percent ROI, It's  really hard to ignore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool stuff.  Paul, thank you so much.</p><p>TRAVERS:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, Paul from Vuzix there.</p><p>Still ahead, inventing inspiration.  We will talk to a self-made Joy  Mangano about her widely popular home shopping network empire.</p><p>And the acclaimed 2015 movie loosely based on her life, starring Jennifer  Lawrence.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday December 12th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The race is on in Alabama, polls open one hour from now.  Voters are  deciding between Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones in the  highly-contested special election for the senate.  The very latest as each  candidate makes a last-ditch effort to drum up support.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Terrorism in New York -- authorities are searching for answers this morning  while Homeland Security reveals the Bangladeshi man suspected of detonating  a pipe bomb near New York City's port authority bus terminal entered the  United States through so-called chain migration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The White House responded to the news saying that it would not have  happened under President Trump's immigration policy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  This attack  underscores the need for Congress to work with the President on immigration  reforms that enhance our national security and public safety.  The  President is certainly concerned that Congress, particularly Democrats,  have failed to take action.</p><p>Specifically the President's policy has called for an end to chain  migration and if that had been in place, that would have prevented this  individual from coming to the United States.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got the very latest this morning from the scene coming  up.</p><p>Markets are mixed today.  Futures indicating a higher opening for the Dow  Industrials, up about 25 points right here.  S&amp;P 500 also up 1 point.  And  Nasdaq however is flat, negative by a point.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the major indices are higher across the board.  The  FT 100 up a fraction.  CAC 40 and the -- the CAC 40 is up a quarter of a  percent.  And the DAX index also up a fraction.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were lower across the board, by the way, on the  heels of another record setter yesterday on Wall Street.  Shanghai  composite down one and a quarter percent.</p><p>Several former NFL stars hit with sexual misconduct allegations.  The  details as they are suspended from the NFL network.</p><p>And American Express says put the pen away -- why they are no longer  requiring signatures for purchases.</p><p>Plus users turning on Netflix as the streaming site reveals its top-watched  shows.  It also puts viewers on Blast for their binge-watching habits.  The  tweet that's sparking privacy concerns -- coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to break it all  down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street Journal's\"  global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath; and Beyond Sport global ambassador,  Fox News contributor John Layfield.  Great to see you.</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It's great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good  morning.  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good to be here with you.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Bitcoin -- that's the -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're loving the bitcoin.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes, yes.  We can't stop talking about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  $16,000.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm more into talking about the tax plan because I'm wondering  if this new provision in the Senate plan is going to create a selloff in  the stock market by year-end -- Jon.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think there's a real problem with year-end  tax planning right now because they're going to have a bill done in the  next week and a half and anyone who wants to position their 2017 taxes for  year-end, they don't know -- they are going to have a week to respond and  they're going to still be figuring out what's inside the bill.  There just  not a lot of time to work with here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there is this story in the Journal, right -- Dagen, about  the small investment community basically taking a look at this idea that  you have to sell your big winners first.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Top story in the Journal -- stock investors face  a new tax hit (ph).  This is the number one story that the Journal is  reporting.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Only Congress could turn simple math into calculus.  It was a  very simple tax policy and they -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was simple.  What the heck happened?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  This provision that Dagen is talking about -- it's about first  in-first out, they only get $2 billion out of that over ten years.  It's  not clear why they need to do that when it's going to anger so many people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we're going to talk about that this morning.  </p><p>And joining the conversation is AOL co-founder, Revolution chairman Steve  Case is here.  New York Congressman Pete King also joining the  conversation; and the inspiration of the acclaimed 2015 movie \"Joy\", the  self-made millionaire, inventor of the Miracle Mop Joy Mangano is with us  this morning.  You don't want to miss that.  We will find out her  entrepreneurial story.</p><p>But first our top story this hour.  The Alabama polls open one hour from  now.  Republican candidate Roy Moore, Democratic candidate Doug Jones  campaigned in Alabama yesterday in a last-ditch effort to gain support.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUDGE ROY MOORE (R), ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE:  We are up our neck in  alligators.  We are up to neck in people that don't want change in  Washington, D.C.  They want to keep it the same, keep their power, keep  their prestige and keep their position.  And we've got to change that.  </p><p>DOUG JONES (D), ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE:  I'm not going to worry about the  fact that Roy Moore has been kicked out of office twice.  I'm not going to  worry about the fact that he took money from a charity.  And, you know  what, I believe those women in Etowah County but you know what, my party is  more important.</p><p>I am going to tell you, folks, it is time.  And I think we are going to see  it tomorrow.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now from Washington is the \"Daily Caller\"  editor in chief Christopher Bedford.  Christopher -- good to see you.   Thanks for joining us this morning.  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"DAILY CALLER\":  Thanks for having  me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  First topic -- your take on the Alabama Senate election?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  I think it's pretty hard to see Roy Moore not winning this  election today despite the fact he's had all these allegations that have  come out against him but voters there support him.  And you know, maybe if  the Democrats run a more conservative Democrat as opposed to someone who is  extremely liberal on abortion, on health care, on taxes -- they might have  had more of a fighting chance to unseat a Republican in this race.  But  it's really hard to see it.</p><p>And they are trying, though.  They are sending Barack Obama down.  They're  sending the former first lady down.  They're sending Cory Booker down.  A  lot of Democratic all-stars are going to try and change this but right now  the polls are generally, with a few outliers, looking like Roy Moore is  going to win.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Roy Moore -- I thought that it looked like Doug Jones was 10  points ahead according to a Fox News poll.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  I know, the Fox News poll was an interesting blast and everyone  has been talking about it for the last 24 hours.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  But if you look at the Real Clear Politics average of all the  polls, Roy is still holding up a few points ahead.  And that's the word I'm  getting on the ground and it's going to be wild if Fox News turns out to be  the outlier that makes everyone else look foolish in this crazy polling  world we have these days.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Christopher -- is part of this sentiment, you know, forget the  veracity of the claim, we don't have time to figure out if these  allegations are true.  Is part of this simply that you've seen in elections  in the western hemisphere like with Theresa May, with Brexit, with  President Trump -- people just don't like to be told what to do.  And is  that part of what's going on in Alabama?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  I think that's true.  The people in Alabama have really largely  been dismissed and attacked repeatedly by national news media and by  national political figures who sort of called them stupid or said how could  you support this bigot.  Or how could you support this molester?</p><p>And also places like the \"Washington Post\" and CNN have lost a lot of their  capital with Republican voters from years and years of unfair coverage even  just this last week of three massive retractions in the news.  Republican  voters and conservatives are less likely to believe them than ever.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Christopher -- you're saying though if it wasn't the  \"Washington Post\" that broke the story about these women and their  allegations, that if it was some other publication who had done it, that it  would somehow have changed the way that people would vote in that state?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  It's possible.  You hear it repeatedly -- repeatedly, consider  the source.  I don't think that's necessarily always fair because the  source of these allegations are different women in the state of Alabama,  but since it's come out and especially after decades of not having come out  while Roy Moore has been a very public figure in Alabama, then the national  news media descends on the state, shows more interest in it than it has  since the 60s and they come out with all these allegations from people and  it comes from a source that's less trusted in the state, that definitely  hurt it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to what happened yesterday in New York.  New  York City is reeling from a bombing in Times Square.  The White House  responded to suspicion that the Bangladeshi suspect currently in custody  entered through U.S. chain migration.</p><p>This comes as Reuters is reporting that Bangladeshi police are questioning  the suspect's wife.  Christopher -- what's your take on this?</p><p>BEDFORD:  And it's not just chain migration, it's Donald Trump's other  bogeyman -- it's the diversity lottery.  The person who came in, came in  through a diversity lottery, a relative of his.  And this suspect here,  very likely suspect, since the pipe bomb went off in his pocket, was the  fourth removed family member to be able to -- the most distant removed  family member to be able to come through on this diversity lottery and then  through chain migration.</p><p>These kind of things, this is actually maybe almost a good thing for the  Republicans and for Donald Trump because it's the kind of terror attack  where no one was hurt except for the suspect.  We don't have a lose of  life.  You have someone who is clearly connected to ISIS and it makes too,  the President's point for him.</p><p>It's going to be difficult to defend this.  There are a lot of people on  the left that have been saying migration has got nothing to do with this.   Of course, it's got something to do with it, that's why he was here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You would think so but you're not really hearing the  mainstream media connect the dots on that one.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Not yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, not yet.</p><p>Let me ask you about this dossier scandal because this is really something  that the \"Daily Caller\" has been doing such a good job on.  A senior  Justice Department official demoted for concealing meetings with the men  behind the anti-rump dossier, has personal ties to Fusion GPS.</p><p>This is a Fox News exclusive.  His wife worked for Fusion GPS in 2016  during the election.  Every day we get another point of conflict of  interest around this Russia probe, around Fusion GPS and Hillary Clinton.   Your take on this.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I wanted to withhold judgment for a while when it first came out  that a lot of these people at a point had donated to Democrats, a lot of  these investigators.  Because you want to say that these people are going  to do their jobs.  They're investigators.  They're professionals.</p><p>But every single day we are seeing more and more problems.  Or actually  it's actually -- Republicans are not getting answers in Congress when they  are asking the FBI, why weren't we told about this person with these  connections?  why do we have to find about this from the news media?  Why  is the FBI not reporting back to us about all of these conflict of  interests, really blatant ones.</p><p>I mean this guy was married to somebody at Fusion GPS.  That's a pretty  close connection right there.  And I think these kinds of things are going  to lead for a call for another special investigator and possibly Jeff  Sessions to appoint one to keep an eye on the investigators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not happening, though.  That's the thing.</p><p>I mean people want to see justice and that's -- what you're saying is still  not happening.  And there have been subpoenas out for information --  haven't there, Dagen -- from Congress.  There have been subpoenas out to  actually get information and there's stonewalling going on for years.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know how do you -- how much taxpayer money though,  Chris, is it going to take to basically -- to use the President's phrase --  drain the swamp?  The more you find out about what goes to Washington, the  more disgusted the average American is about everybody in bed with everyone  -- you know, everybody in bed together.</p><p>There's back scratching and there's never any justice for the average  person.  There's never any conclusion that is satisfying to the taxpayer  who are footing these bills.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  One of the most annoying things you'll find about Washington,  D.C. is as soon as you go out and you go out for dinner or go out for a  drink, one of the first things someone asks you is so what do you do.</p><p>You don't get that in other cities because Washington, D.C. is so  interconnected, everyone is somehow working with everyone and they have an  interest in that.  The swamp is deeply connected with each other.  These  people have an active interest in keeping outsiders out of it.</p><p>And Donald Trump is actually causing massive disruption with these people.   It's causing chaos.  I mean all my neighbors' sons right now, they have all  this (INAUDIBLE) signaling about how they stand up and they were just  against Trump and let no man put hate in your heart.</p><p>Everyone around this city is resisting him.  And it's going to take a lot  of effort.  It's going to take a few years.  And I think we're going to see  a see a couple of fires, brush fires along the way before anything gets  done on the swamp.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So just to be clear.  Fusion GPS basically came up with  this dossier which was never verified and was a bunch garbage and that was  one of the justifications for wiretapping Donald Trump.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  That's what we're trying to figure out if that was one of the  justifications.  And right now what we are certain of is that it was full  of garbage that has caused massive disruption in the news media and then it  likely influenced the FBI and Department of Justice to move in on the Trump  administration.</p><p>And now we are finding out the FBI agents were intimately connected to it.   That does not look good for Mueller or his probe.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, one thing we do know is that Christopher Steele, the  former British intelligence agent who was paid by Fusion GPS and the  Democrats to work with Russians to put together this dossier that the FBI  was talking to him about putting him on the payroll.  We know that.  That  is a fact and that has been proven.</p><p>So, again, to Christopher's point -- is it going to be up to Bob Mueller  and his conflicted team?  I mean there are more conflict that we haven't  even covered today.  Is it going to fall to him to investigate the FBI  which he ran for 12 years?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is he going to investigate the FBI, he ran it? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Jim Comey, his very close friend -- is it going to be up to  him and his team to investigate what went on with this dossier.  And to  Chris' point, you've got to have somebody else doing it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we will see.  If we actually do get the special  prosecutor, another special prosecutor looking at it.  I don't know.  I  don't have a high expectation of that -- Chris.  But we'll see.</p><p>I want to get your take on this breaking news.  President Trump is tweeting  this morning.  Here is what he said.  \"Despite thousands of hours wasted  and many millions of dollars spent the Democrats have been unable to show  any collusion with Russia.  So now they are moving on to the false  accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don't know and/or have  never met.  Fake news.\"</p><p>Wow, the President coming up this morning, talking about the allegations  from the women who are trying to get a congressional investigation going  about inappropriate behavior, sexual inappropriate behavior.  Chris -- your  thoughts?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  It was wild to watch the White House press conference yesterday.   It was almost like it was coordinated amongst a blob of people who think  all the same.  We get a terror attack in New York.  We had tax reform  coming down.  We've got a special election tomorrow in Alabama.</p><p>And almost every one in the press wanted to talk about -- all they wanted  to talk about was these accusations.  The President so far has denied them.   Sarah Huckabee Sanders up there saying I speak for the President, the  President flat out denies this.</p><p>It does not mean it's not going to stop and when you see Democrats so  brutally cleaning out their own house of anyone who has been accused of any  kind of sexual misconduct, I see them as doing that to try and set  themselves up to retake the moral high ground and go hard after President  Trump over these accusations.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, Megyn Kelly had them on her show and then they did  a press conference after that.  You're right.  Christopher -- thank you.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will see you soon, sir.  Christopher Bedford there.</p><p>Still ahead -- when it comes to a pen, you can leave home without it.  Why  American Express is ditching its signature requirements.</p><p>And then binge in the New Year -- Netflix revealing the most streamed shows  of 2017.  The surprising series that took the top spot.  Plus the new  privacy concerns sparked by a tweet from the streaming giant.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>When we told you yesterday about the outpouring of support for Tennessee  middle-schooler who went viral talking about bullying, now there are  questions about his mother's motives for posting that video.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details right now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- Maria.</p><p>So there were more than 22 million hits on Kimberly Jones' heartbreaking  footage of her son Keaton describing being called \"ugly\" at a school.   Someone even launched a go fund me campaign that raised more than $58,000.   But as attention spread so did interest in her.</p><p>She started her own go fund me page actually and then she slammed the  original fundraiser and they are questioning whether she's just trying to  make a quick buck off of her son.</p><p>Reports also began to emerge that she had posted multiple images of  confederate flags on her Facebook account.  Jones has since made her  Facebook page private.  </p><p>Well, American Express trying to stay competitive.  Starting next April,  the company will no longer require a signature regardless of the amount  you're spending.  Right now you have to sign for any purchase over $50.  Of  course, the latest credit cards have a computer chip for additional fraud  protection.  No signature required if you buy something online or on your  phone.  But it's been a strong year for American Express.  The stock is  actually up more than 30 percent.</p><p>Well, streamers that saw Netflix's tweet over the weekend were a little  creeped-out with how much the company seems to know about their viewing  habits.  Netflix tweeted this, \"To the 53 people who watched a Christmas  Prince every day for the past 18 days who hurt you question?\"  Well, the  tweet got a lot of laughs.  It was re-tweeted over 100,000 times but also  some backlash because viewers are thinking, hey, wait a minute, do I have  any privacy with you, maybe I don't.</p><p>All right, but all that viewership data proving useful to Netflix.  The  company has come up with its official \"shows we devoured\" list which means  a series was viewed more than two hours per day.</p><p>The list is surprisingly topped by -- this is interesting -- \"The True  Crime\" spoof \"American Vandal\".  Followed by the Brazilian series \"3  Percent;  the controversial \"13 Reasons Why\", \"Anne with an E\" and  \"Riverdale\".  The most popular streaming day in 2017 was actually New  Year's Day.  Netflix stock up sharply so far this year.</p><p>And no, Dagen -- \"Narcos\" wasn't on that list or \"The Crown\".</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Neither was \"House of Cards\".  </p><p>CASONE:  I don't know what to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you seen any of those shows on that list -- Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Neither have I.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I haven't either.</p><p>CASONE:  What's wrong with me?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I haven't seen any of those shows.</p><p>CASONE:  Am I a nerd?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is that possible?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know.  Something is deeply wrong with me.  I did.  I'm  almost done -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I have not seen any of it -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jon?  What are these shows?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm almost done with the second season of \"The Crown\".  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is it?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not as good as the first season, shall we say.  It's a lot  about Prince Philip -- kind of boring.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's like \"House of Cards\" -- it wasn't as good as it  got older.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  No.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And now Foghorn Leghorn is gone.  I'm talking about Kevin  Spacey.</p><p>I'll say -- I'll say.  I'm Frank Underwood.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Is Foghorn Leghorn even around anymore?  What a great reference.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll say - I'll say -- I'll say.  There you go.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, harassment there, then you have harassment scandals  hitting the NFL Network as well.</p><p>We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back, the fallout after three of the network's analysts  received suspensions over new allegations there.</p><p>And then the Ball brothers making a fast break to an unexpected  destination.  Get this -- Lonzo Ball's two youngest sons are going pro just  weeks after UCLA suspended one for shoplifting on a trip to China.  When  the basketball players will be traveling to Lithuania -- that's next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Former NFL players are suspended from the NFL Network over sexual assault  allegations.</p><p>Jared Max with the story now -- Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS:  Maria -- good morning.</p><p>Hall of Fame running back Marshall Faulk, along with fellow NFL Network  analyst Heath Evans and Ike Taylor have been suspended by the NFL Network  after all three were named in sexual misconduct lawsuit by a former NFL  Network wardrobe stylist.  Jami Cantor who was with the company from 2006  until October 2016.  She filed a wrongful termination suit this October.   Yesterday filed a further complaint.  It alleges sexual harassment and  assault.</p><p>Cantor claims that Faulk groped and fondled her, inappropriate text  messages sent from the others.  In addition to inappropriate texts from  Donovan McNabb, former NFL quarterback and colleague of Cantor's at the  time plus NFL Network executive Eric Weinberger.</p><p>McNabb now with ESPN yet to receive potential punishment.  Weinberger,  president of \"The Ringer\" placed on indefinite leave.</p><p>Monday night football south Florida, Tom Brady going for ninth straight win  in ninth straight division title but very Brady celebration pre-empted by  the Miami Dolphins defense.</p><p>Brady intercepted twice by Xavien Howard last night.  Worst game for Brady  statistically in four seasons.  Jay Cutler three touchdowns for Miami which  held New England to 25 rushing yards and didn't allow the Patriots to  convert a single third down.  That hasn't happened in 26 years.  Dolphins  win it 27-20.</p><p>You know that old saying, if at first you don't succeed, at stealing Louis  Vuitton sunglasses on a basketball trip to China, then get suspended by  UCLA indefinitely -- try, try again to play ball in another country.</p><p>LiAngelo Ball and his younger brother LaMelo Ball are going to be playing  ball together.  The two younger brothers of L.A. Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball  and also the son of LaVar Ball have signed a one year contract to play for  a pro team in Lithuania called Prienu Vytautas.</p><p>LaMelo was only 16.  He was a junior in high school.  He dropped out.   LiAngelo ball is now 19 years old and probably in need of a new pair  sunglasses after that whole mess which became an international incident.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lithuania.  </p><p>MAX:  Yes.  Yes.  And it's not really about money because they're not going  to paid that much.  There's reports that maybe guys make about $500 a  month.  Now you actually get a tax break certainly playing over there.  But  it's really about spreading the Big Baller brand.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Probably the last we're going to hear of them athletically.</p><p>MAX:  Boy, you wonder, they're still kids.  And the coach is said to be the  LaVar Ball of Lithuania.  I don't know that means.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- a buffoon that over-hypes himself.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Hey, how is the Olympics?  Going high-tech.  Humanoid  robot Hubo just carried the 2018 Olympic flame.  Hubo was given the honor  yesterday in South Korea as part of the journey the torch will make before  the games start in February.  This is one of the 85 robot volunteers  assisting in the Winter Games.  Pretty cool.</p><p>MAX:  Maria -- he looks a little bit -- was it the movie \"Short Circuit\" I  think back in the 80s?  He looks a little bit or a little R2D2.  Check this  out.  There was new research from McKenzie (ph) that says that as much as  one-third of American workforce could be out of work of 2030 because of  automation.  That 400 million to 800 million people globally could be  displaced.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MAX:  Maybe some of these robots should have some defects in them so we can  keep ourselves employed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a real concern.  </p><p>MAX:  Yes.  I mean, you know, we laugh about it now but the next 17 year  what holds?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's incredible that they've come up with that -- that  it's 2030 that that's when they'll be that pervasive, robotics everywhere.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I'm a little skeptical of arguments like that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  There were reports like that out ten years ago saying that all  of our jobs were going to be outsourced to India.  And you know, like  radiologists -- we still have plenty of radiologists.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're doing prostate cancer surgery robotically.  I mean  the robotics have been very important and a great growth story for health  care.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It's very important but they're not taking away all the  doctors.  That's my point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know that they are displacing doctors.  Exactly,  exactly.  Yes.</p><p>MAX:  Can they tell me who is going to win the Super Bowl?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They might.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  You need a flux capacitor for that.  </p><p>MAX:  Exactly. -- 88 miles an hour.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  That's right.</p><p>MAX:  With Bill Belichick behind the wheel or answering questions from  reporters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nice \"Back to the Future\" reference -- and \"Back to the Future\"</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Thank you very much.  What happened with Tom Savage and the  concussion.  How did Houston Texas miss that?  </p><p>MAX:  Well, the NFL is really dropping the ball.  There's investigations  going on because the quarterback -- he shouldn't have been allowed to come  back into the game.  All of the concern of head safety.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  And so it was a missed concussion protocol.  They're talking  about revamping and they dismissed -- </p><p>MAX:  It seems like not everybody has their left hand and right hand  working together all the time.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, a lot of players game that system too, don't they.  They  get their baseline down so that when they do get hurt they don't get pulled  out.  </p><p>MAX:  It doesn't seem like it's all on the same page yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared -- thank you.  Catch Jared's sports reports on \"FOX NEWS  HEADLINES 24/7\" or Sirius Radio Sirius XM 115.</p><p>Still to come -- up in smoke.  A Southwest flyer threatens passengers  midair after crews asked her to snub out her cigarette.  The frightening  footage from the flight.  That's coming up.</p><p>And then merger mania, AT&amp;T gearing up for its federal fight over the deal  to acquire Time Warner.  We talk to AOL co-founder and Revolution chairman  Steve Case about what the wave of mega mergers means for the business.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  Happy Tuesday.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Tuesday,  December 12th, your top stories right now 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>21st Century Fox looks like is losing a bidder for some of its assets.  The  Wall Street Journal reporting Comcast, Comcast is stepping down, no longer  pursuing a deal for key entertainment and media businesses, Disney is still  eyeing a deal.  It's anybody's guess if maybe Comcast steps away because  the deal with Disney is more likely.  The very latest on the major mania in  the media sector.</p><p>Futures this morning show markets will open higher.  Dow Industrials at the  high of the morning right here, up 40 points.  S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also  higher by a fraction.</p><p>In Europe, similar story money moving into equities this morning, European  indices higher across the Board.  FT 100 up a quarter of a percent.  CAC  quarante up almost one half of a percent and the Dax Index up almost a  quarter of a percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, different story.  Markets were lower across the board at  the close.  Worst performer, China.</p><p>We are watching oil prices this morning.  They are rising as a key European  pipeline was shut down for repairs.  Crude oil now at 58.41 a barrel.</p><p>A southwest flight was diverted over a cigarette.  Get this.  A passenger  caught smoking in the lavatory then he makes death threats to the entire  flight.  The story coming up.</p><p>And then Merriam Webster, out of its word of the year.  Find out the  dictionary's pick, coming up.  What do you think it might be?</p><p>Plus, a healthy way to eat Girl Scout cookies.  Yoplait now offering thin  mint-flavored yogurt.  All those stories coming up first this morning.</p><p>And first, our top story this half an hour.  Will mergers reshape the media  business?  According to the Wall Street Journal, Comcast confirmed  yesterday it is no longer in the race to pursue movie and television assets  from 21st Century Fox, leaving Disney as the only serious bidder.</p><p>Meanwhile, AT&amp;T gears up for its fight against the Department of Justice  over its bid to acquire Time Warner, they say, we want this and we're not  going to sell anything to get it.</p><p>Joining us this morning is AOL cofounder, former CEO, the current chairman  and CEO of Revolution, Steve Case.  Steve, it's good to see you.</p><p>STEVE CASE, CEO, REVOLUTION:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  And you were around when we  saw the last bout of last of mergers in media and telecom and that was  obviously a big move for a lot of these companies making these companies  bigger.  The $164 billion AOL-Time Warner merger was the largest in  history.</p><p>What do you make of the current M&amp;A climate?  What are you seeing out  there?</p><p>CASE:  Well, you say, it does feel like Deja Vu all over again.  It's a lot  of same discussions happened 20 years ago about the role of content versus  distribution.  Do you need to be integrated, in particular the battle back  then was the debate between this content king or distribution king.</p><p>It's pretty clear that the consumer is king and the platforms, the Amazon  or Netflix or Facebook that have direct connections to consumers are the  once that are advantage.  As a result, Disney is basically saying they're  going to pull back from Netflix and do their own direct to consumer  offering.  I think they're trying to bulk up, whether it'd be the Fox  assets or other assets to have a credible offering to go directly to  consumers.  So it's someway this is similar battles that we were hearing 20  years ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think?  So you think the consumer is king, but once  again, people are really bidding up content, because -- look at Amazon  right now, it's a little different, and, by the way, I can't believe it was  20 years ago.  You're right.  It was 20 years ago.</p><p>Amazon willing to pay out billions and billions of dollars for original  content, is that where this is going?  Where people are going to start  doing more original content or using the sale of established content for  example Fox, the Simpsons, you know, so many great shows, this is us, among  those being talked about, is that where the value is?</p><p>CASE:  Well, I think the value as I said is with the services that have  direct to consumer offerings.  So, how do you bundle together something  that's credible which is a mix of brands and content people are already  familiar with as well as some original content.</p><p>Again, this is not a new idea.  HBO, 30 or 40 years ago really was  pioneering that highly leverage some of the movies that are already made  but invest in original content, Sopranos or other kinds of things to  differentiate.  So we're continuing to see that move forward.</p><p>So the only difference is now that there's a new companies that didn't  exist 20 years ago Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, et cetera, Apple as well  existed but wasn't really focused so much on media content.  So the battle  will continue, and the ones that really have that consumer connection,  direct consumer connection are likely going to be the winners.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Those companies have their own investment arm.  You look like  an Amazon, it's acquiring.  It's got an investment arm, acquiring  technology companies.</p><p>Let's talk about the fight over net neutrality.  I mean, Apple cofounder,  Steve Wozniak and the man known as the father of the internet, Vint Cerf  are leading a new push to prevent the FCC vote on Thursday.</p><p>The group of internet experts are calling on congress to stop the FCC from  overturning rules that prevent internet providers from throttling or  outright blocking online content.  Your thoughts.</p><p>CASE:  It is also as an old debate.  It's sort of like that.  Prince song  from 1999, the debates in the 90ss around open access.  Now the debate is  around net neutrality.  As a core, it's how do you play the internet as  platform for innovation particularly allow disruptive start-ups  entrepreneurs all over the country to start innovating and not just have  the incumbents kind of lockdown their elites.</p><p>So I'm very concerned about net neutrality.  I share the view of some of  the people who wrote this week saying we need to make sure that the  internet remains open for innovation and we err on side of making sure  things are tilted in favor of those disruptive, those entrepreneurs that  are really trying to launch new things not the existing incumbents trying  to kind of protect their lead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's this push to invest in the heartland.  Your company  launching a $150-million fund, focused on investing in start-ups away from  the coast in the middle of the country.  This is really interesting,  especially when you look at backers including big names like Eric Schmidt,  Jeff Bezos, Meg Whitman, Howard Schultz.  Tell us what your thinking is and  these tries of the rest fund.</p><p>CASE:  Well, I think the -- well, there's great innovation in places like  Silicon Valley, and New York City, and Boston.  Right now, the vast  majority of venture capital goes to those cities.  Last year, 75 percent of  went to just three states, California, New York and Massachusetts.  So the  other 47 states, fight over 25 percent, yet there is great entrepreneurs  all over the country building great companies.</p><p>There is not a lot of venture capital attention.  So this Rise of the Rest,  we launched about four years ago.  It's now accelerating, as you mentioned.   We launched last week this new fund and we've got about three dozen of  Americas most iconic, respected entrepreneurs and investors, and  executives, and families all joining us saying they believe in the idea of  Rise of the Rest.  They believe there are great entrepreneurs everywhere.   They believe there are great investment opportunities everywhere and I hope  is what capitalize more focus on middle of the country start-ups and will  result in great breakout successes in those communities, also in the  process create a lot of jobs, and more hope in those communities.</p><p>A lot of people wake up in the morning, feeling like they're anxious about  the future.  They're not sure what the role of technology is going to be in  their family and their community.  I want to make sure, by backing startups  everywhere, they are creating jobs everywhere, that will really change that  dynamic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's interesting because it's like you look around the world,  everybody wanted to be the Silicon Valley, right?  Even in Russia, they  created this culpable project and yet there are little mini Silicon Valleys  innovation hubs throughout the country.  You look at Biotech Upstate New  York.  There's all of these little hubs everywhere, where you actually can  tap into real innovation happening not necessarily just Silicon Valley.</p><p>CASE:  Absolutely.  And we've seen that we now there are 33 cities on a  rise.  The rest road trips that will three, three and a half years.  8,000  miles by bus, so we've been to places like Pittsburgh where a lot of great  things are happening with the robotics because of Carnegie-Mellon, buffalo,  some of the Biotech things that trade a lot of things around mobility New  Orleans.  A lot of things around Ag tech, Louisville and St. Louis around  Ag tech, farming.</p><p>We're seeing innovation happening all over the country.  We're trying to  change the dynamic on with this rise of the rest to make sure their  entrepreneurs in those places have access the capital to grow and scale  their companies.</p><p>It's long and understood that creativity is wildly dispersed.  Opportunity  is not and really trying to level the playing field so everybody,  everywhere who has an idea really has a shot at American dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some of these companies though are more powerful than they ever  have been.  When you look at the big five, the FANG companies, right?   Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, they have so much power, given all of  the data, and the information that they have, about us, all.</p><p>Do you think the regulatory market changes the regulatory environment  changes for technology, given the fact that this is a completely different  industry, than just 10 years ago or five years ago, Steve?</p><p>CASE:  Yes, I think it's beginning to change.  We start seeing that the  last couple years in the European Union.   Brussels got a backing, has  starting to slow some of the things happening with some of the big tech,  and we're seeing a growing backlash in this country as well.</p><p>People are proud of what's happening in Silicon Valley, but also nervous  about some of the implications, and including here in Washington, D.C.,  there's a lot more focus obviously even some congressional committees  looking into what was the role of Facebook or other things even in the  election.</p><p>So it now become so much more central in terms of our everyday lives.  Had  such a big impact on our economy.  It's not surprising that there's more of  a focus on the role of big tech if you will.  And do I think Silicon Valley  needs to be careful.</p><p>Last decade, as you well know, Wall Street sort of been the bad guy, I  think Silicon Valley is at risk of becoming kind of the new bad guy where  people love some of the products and service that come from Silicon Valley.   They are a little nervous about some of the steps -- some companies in  Silicon Valley are taking.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I was asking, because you know, in the last 10  years, we saw the financials basically sit on cash, they were unwilling to  do anything with their money, because they didn't know what regulation was  around the corner, then you had Dodd-Frank.  You wonder if that's going to  happen to the technology sector.  Now, they're the big spenders.  Will they  be the big spenders in the future if they've got congressional oversight  that's much tougher than they saw in the past?  And then, of course, Steve,  there's bitcoin.</p><p>So you're obviously a student of this industry for a long time 25 years,  even more.  What do you think of bitcoin, Steve?</p><p>CASE:  Well, I think it's exciting one though, but take this in their core  technologies around block chain.  But again, it does feel a little bit like  20 years ago where there's a phenomena, a mania almost around dotcom.  Now,  here's a little bit of a mania particularly on the trading side around  bitcoin and ICOs, things like that.</p><p>So think the core technology of block chain ability to track things I think  is very important, but I think there is a little bit too much speculation  right now and will be interesting to see how things settle.</p><p>I saw even yesterday, as he stepped in to stop ICO, an initial coin  offering that was happening and this idea that you can raise capital in an  unregulated way which has happened recently.  I don't think that is  sustainable.</p><p>So I think we have to separate what's happening in terms of the core  technologies like block chain and what's happening in terms of speculation,  around that, whether it be bitcoin and ICOs.  I think that we need to be a  little more careful than we've been in recent months around thinking about  that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Winklevoss brothers yesterday said that this is regulated  but I suspect if this action keeps up with bitcoin, it's going to be  regulated a lot more.</p><p>CASE:  I think it's no question.  It got talked about and I book in the  third.  There's next wave of industries and the role of policy regulations  playing a deeper role whether it'd be financial services or health care, or  some smart cities important aspects of our lives.  There's going to be more  regulations.</p><p>Entrepreneurs hate hearing that particularly in Silicon Valley, but I think  it's going to be true and we're going to see that with bitcoin as well,  there's no question, the regulators not just in this country but around the  world are going to make sure they have adequate protections in place to  make sure these technologies, these platforms can have a positive impact on  the market as opposed to kind of have potentially some unintended  consequences that could be negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great insights, Steve.  We'll be watching the Rise of the Rest  fund.  Always great to talk with you, sir.  Thank you.</p><p>CASE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Steve Case there.</p><p>Still ahead, smoking leads to a fiery confrontation on Southwest Airlines  flight.

Let me check these out.  See  how light they are.  Can I try this on?</p><p>TRAVERS:  Yes, please do.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you have two models here on set.  This one is the M300?</p><p>TRAVERS:  That's actually the Blade.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, this is -- OK.  So this is the Blade.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Yes.  And it's B to C and consumers, those kinds of things.  With  those glasses on, you want to take your phone out of your pocket?  Put  those glasses on, you'll be able to -- Sam, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What I like is that I don't feel like a geek.</p><p>TRAVERS:  And you don't look like one either.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know about that.  But tell me what this Blade does.</p><p>TRAVERS:  So with your phone in your pocket.  Imagine you're walking down  the street and there's a Pokemon Go character that's up to the right,  everybody knows Pokemon Go.  Millions of users in a week.  The Pokemon Go  character comes up, you look and through the glasses you see this character  sitting on a street or you're getting directions and the directions are in  your glasses.  A phone call comes in, you can answer with the glasses on.   It's beginnings of leaving your phone in your pocket.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  OK.  So I don't have to take my phone out with this.   This is going to show me -- let's do the other model. This one is the M300  Enterprise Class smart glasses.  This is for enterprise, tell us.  Put  those on.  Let me know what it's for.</p><p>TRAVERS:  That's correct.  So these guys are worn like this, around your  neck when you're in a warehouse situation that put glasses on, and this  becomes effectively the barcode scanner.  So instead of taking a handheld  barcode scanner, going over to the box -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here, here's the barcode scanner.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Actually in this particular case, Sam, we're operationally --  well, let me actually run it here.  So I'm looking through these glasses  and you can see, this is nothing more than a blueprint.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ooh, look at the screen.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Through the glasses, you can see there's literally a multistory  building sitting here that's not real.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What we're seeing on that screen is what you're seeing in your  glasses?</p><p>TRAVERS:  That's correct.  That's correct.  So you can imagine so many  applications where this can become a valuable tool.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  you made the analogy earlier, if you're on a plane, on your --  unloading the baggage from a plane.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Yes.  We worked with folks like SATS at Changi Airport and they  have the gate folks wearing these glasses.  The pallet comes by, on the  side of pallet, a few barcode, barcode kind of a thing.  Through these  glasses you see all of the information about where that pallet goes on a  plane.  What section of the plane it belongs in.</p><p>If it doesn't belong on that plane, they will have a red marker on the  outside of it and just like this building that's not real or marker is not  real, but digitally, they can put it in remove it ad at the same time -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They know where the baggage goes on the plane.</p><p>TRAVERS:  They can turn around a plane in one half, the amount of time  compared to how they do it today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's very cool.  So Vuzix recently entered into a supply  agreement with Toshiba.  Tell us about that.</p><p>TRAVERS:  I can tell you a little bit about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Well, it's very exciting for me, actually.  It's one of the  largest, probably orders that smart glasses have seen, quite frankly.   Toshiba is a major player in the laptop space.  They're coming out with a  line of products that are wearable, etch-oriented and they're buying smart  glasses from Vuzix.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really?  Cool stuff.</p><p>TRAVERS:  We learn a lot more about that here.  It's a multimillion-dollar  contract for Vuzix and sometime here in the first quarter, Toshiba will be  sharing a lot more.  What is the world and 3D?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I feel that if you don't have augmented reality or A.I. or some  sort, you're going to be left behind, because every industry is using it at  this point.</p><p>TRAVERS:  We have companies getting -- doing things 500 percent ROI, It's  really hard to ignore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool stuff.  Paul, thank you so much.</p><p>TRAVERS:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, Paul from Vuzix there.</p><p>Still ahead, inventing inspiration.  We will talk to a self-made Joy  Mangano about her widely popular home shopping network empire.</p><p>And the acclaimed 2015 movie loosely based on her life, starring Jennifer  Lawrence.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street Journal's\" global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath; and Beyond Sport global ambassador, Fox News contributor John Layfield. Great to see you.</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Good morning. Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Good to be here with you.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Bitcoin -- that's the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're loving the bitcoin.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Yes, yes. We can't stop talking about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well --</p><p>HILSENRATH: $16,000.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm more into talking about the tax plan because I'm wondering if this new provision in the Senate plan is going to create a selloff in the stock market by year-end -- Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, you know, I think there's a real problem with year-end tax planning right now because they're going to have a bill done in the next week and a half and anyone who wants to position their 2017 taxes for year-end, they don't know -- they are going to have a week to respond and they're going to still be figuring out what's inside the bill. There just not a lot of time to work with here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And there is this story in the Journal, right -- Dagen, about the small investment community basically taking a look at this idea that you have to sell your big winners first.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST: Top story in the Journal -- stock investors face a new tax hit (ph). This is the number one story that the Journal is reporting.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Only Congress could turn simple math into calculus. It was a very simple tax policy and they --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was simple. What the heck happened?</p><p>HILSENRATH: This provision that Dagen is talking about -- it's about first in-first out, they only get $2 billion out of that over ten years. It's not clear why they need to do that when it's going to anger so many people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we're going to talk about that this morning.</p><p>And joining the conversation is AOL co-founder, Revolution chairman Steve Case is here. New York Congressman Pete King also joining the conversation; and the inspiration of the acclaimed 2015 movie \"Joy\", the self-made millionaire, inventor of the Miracle Mop Joy Mangano is with us this morning. You don't want to miss that. We will find out her entrepreneurial story.</p><p>But first our top story this hour. The Alabama polls open one hour from now. Republican candidate Roy Moore, Democratic candidate Doug Jones campaigned in Alabama yesterday in a last-ditch effort to gain support.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUDGE ROY MOORE (R), ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE: We are up our neck in alligators. We are up to neck in people that don't want change in Washington, D.C. They want to keep it the same, keep their power, keep their prestige and keep their position. And we've got to change that.</p><p>DOUG JONES (D), ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE: I'm not going to worry about the fact that Roy Moore has been kicked out of office twice. I'm not going to worry about the fact that he took money from a charity. And, you know what, I believe those women in Etowah County but you know what, my party is more important.</p><p>I am going to tell you, folks, it is time. And I think we are going to see it tomorrow.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now from Washington is the \"Daily Caller\" editor in chief Christopher Bedford. Christopher -- good to see you. Thanks for joining us this morning.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"DAILY CALLER\": Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: First topic -- your take on the Alabama Senate election?</p><p>BEDFORD: I think it's pretty hard to see Roy Moore not winning this election today despite the fact he's had all these allegations that have come out against him but voters there support him. And you know, maybe if the Democrats run a more conservative Democrat as opposed to someone who is extremely liberal on abortion, on health care, on taxes -- they might have had more of a fighting chance to unseat a Republican in this race. But it's really hard to see it.</p><p>And they are trying, though. They are sending Barack Obama down. They're sending the former first lady down. They're sending Cory Booker down. A lot of Democratic all-stars are going to try and change this but right now the polls are generally, with a few outliers, looking like Roy Moore is going to win.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Roy Moore -- I thought that it looked like Doug Jones was 10 points ahead according to a Fox News poll.</p><p>BEDFORD: I know, the Fox News poll was an interesting blast and everyone has been talking about it for the last 24 hours.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BEDFORD: But if you look at the Real Clear Politics average of all the polls, Roy is still holding up a few points ahead. And that's the word I'm getting on the ground and it's going to be wild if Fox News turns out to be the outlier that makes everyone else look foolish in this crazy polling world we have these days.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Christopher -- is part of this sentiment, you know, forget the veracity of the claim, we don't have time to figure out if these allegations are true. Is part of this simply that you've seen in elections in the western hemisphere like with Theresa May, with Brexit, with <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>-- people just don't like to be told what to do. And is that part of what's going on in Alabama?</p><p>BEDFORD: I think that's true. The people in Alabama have really largely been dismissed and attacked repeatedly by national news media and by national political figures who sort of called them stupid or said how could you support this bigot. Or how could you support this molester?</p><p>And also places like the \"Washington Post\" and CNN have lost a lot of their capital with Republican voters from years and years of unfair coverage even just this last week of three massive retractions in the news. Republican voters and conservatives are less likely to believe them than ever.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Christopher -- you're saying though if it wasn't the \"Washington Post\" that broke the story about these women and their allegations, that if it was some other publication who had done it, that it would somehow have changed the way that people would vote in that state?</p><p>BEDFORD: It's possible. You hear it repeatedly -- repeatedly, consider the source. I don't think that's necessarily always fair because the source of these allegations are different women in the state of Alabama, but since it's come out and especially after decades of not having come out while Roy Moore has been a very public figure in Alabama, then the national news media descends on the state, shows more interest in it than it has since the 60s and they come out with all these allegations from people and it comes from a source that's less trusted in the state, that definitely hurt it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me move on to what happened yesterday in New York. New York City is reeling from a bombing in Times Square. The White House responded to suspicion that the Bangladeshi suspect currently in custody entered through U.S. chain migration.</p><p>This comes as Reuters is reporting that Bangladeshi police are questioning the suspect's wife. Christopher -- what's your take on this?</p><p>BEDFORD: And it's not just chain migration, it's <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>other bogeyman -- it's the diversity lottery. The person who came in, came in through a diversity lottery, a relative of his. And this suspect here, very likely suspect, since the pipe bomb went off in his pocket, was the fourth removed family member to be able to -- the most distant removed family member to be able to come through on this diversity lottery and then through chain migration.</p><p>These kind of things, this is actually maybe almost a good thing for the Republicans and for <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>because it's the kind of terror attack where no one was hurt except for the suspect. We don't have a lose of life. You have someone who is clearly connected to ISIS and it makes too, the President's point for him.</p><p>It's going to be difficult to defend this. There are a lot of people on the left that have been saying migration has got nothing to do with this. Of course, it's got something to do with it, that's why he was here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You would think so but you're not really hearing the mainstream media connect the dots on that one.</p><p>BEDFORD: Not yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, not yet.</p><p>Let me ask you about this dossier scandal because this is really something that the \"Daily Caller\" has been doing such a good job on. A senior Justice Department official demoted for concealing meetings with the men behind the anti-rump dossier, has personal ties to Fusion GPS.</p><p>This is a Fox News exclusive. His wife worked for Fusion GPS in 2016 during the election. Every day we get another point of conflict of interest around this Russia probe, around Fusion GPS and Hillary Clinton. Your take on this.</p><p>BEDFORD: I wanted to withhold judgment for a while when it first came out that a lot of these people at a point had donated to Democrats, a lot of these investigators. Because you want to say that these people are going to do their jobs. They're investigators. They're professionals.</p><p>But every single day we are seeing more and more problems. Or actually it's actually -- Republicans are not getting answers in Congress when they are asking the FBI, why weren't we told about this person with these connections? why do we have to find about this from the news media? Why is the FBI not reporting back to us about all of these conflict of interests, really blatant ones.</p><p>I mean this guy was married to somebody at Fusion GPS. That's a pretty close connection right there. And I think these kinds of things are going to lead for a call for another special investigator and possibly Jeff Sessions to appoint one to keep an eye on the investigators.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's not happening, though. That's the thing.</p><p>I mean people want to see justice and that's -- what you're saying is still not happening. And there have been subpoenas out for information -- haven't there, Dagen -- from Congress. There have been subpoenas out to actually get information and there's stonewalling going on for years.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't know how do you -- how much taxpayer money though, Chris, is it going to take to basically -- to use the President's phrase -- drain the swamp? The more you find out about what goes to Washington, the more disgusted the average American is about everybody in bed with everyone -- you know, everybody in bed together.</p><p>There's back scratching and there's never any justice for the average person. There's never any conclusion that is satisfying to the taxpayer who are footing these bills.</p><p>BEDFORD: One of the most annoying things you'll find about Washington, D.C. is as soon as you go out and you go out for dinner or go out for a drink, one of the first things someone asks you is so what do you do.</p><p>You don't get that in other cities because Washington, D.C. is so interconnected, everyone is somehow working with everyone and they have an interest in that. The swamp is deeply connected with each other. These people have an active interest in keeping outsiders out of it.</p><p>And <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is actually causing massive disruption with these people. It's causing chaos. I mean all my neighbors' sons right now, they have all this (INAUDIBLE) signaling about how they stand up and they were just against Trump and let no man put hate in your heart.</p><p>Everyone around this city is resisting him. And it's going to take a lot of effort. It's going to take a few years. And I think we're going to see a see a couple of fires, brush fires along the way before anything gets done on the swamp.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So just to be clear. Fusion GPS basically came up with this dossier which was never verified and was a bunch garbage and that was one of the justifications for wiretapping <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>BEDFORD: That's what we're trying to figure out if that was one of the justifications. And right now what we are certain of is that it was full of garbage that has caused massive disruption in the news media and then it likely influenced the FBI and Department of Justice to move in on the Trump administration.</p><p>And now we are finding out the FBI agents were intimately connected to it. That does not look good for Mueller or his probe.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, one thing we do know is that Christopher Steele, the former British intelligence agent who was paid by Fusion GPS and the Democrats to work with Russians to put together this dossier that the FBI was talking to him about putting him on the payroll. We know that. That is a fact and that has been proven.</p><p>So, again, to Christopher's point -- is it going to be up to Bob Mueller and his conflicted team? I mean there are more conflict that we haven't even covered today. Is it going to fall to him to investigate the FBI which he ran for 12 years?</p><p>BARTIROMO: How is he going to investigate the FBI, he ran it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: And Jim Comey, his very close friend -- is it going to be up to him and his team to investigate what went on with this dossier. And to Chris' point, you've got to have somebody else doing it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we will see. If we actually do get the special prosecutor, another special prosecutor looking at it. I don't know. I don't have a high expectation of that -- Chris. But we'll see.</p><p>I want to get your take on this breaking news. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is tweeting this morning. Here is what he said. \"Despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia. So now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don't know and/or have never met. Fake news.\"</p><p>Wow, the President coming up this morning, talking about the allegations from the women who are trying to get a congressional investigation going about inappropriate behavior, sexual inappropriate behavior. Chris -- your thoughts?</p><p>BEDFORD: It was wild to watch the White House press conference yesterday. It was almost like it was coordinated amongst a blob of people who think all the same. We get a terror attack in New York. We had tax reform coming down. We've got a special election tomorrow in Alabama.</p><p>And almost every one in the press wanted to talk about -- all they wanted to talk about was these accusations. The President so far has denied them. Sarah Huckabee Sanders up there saying I speak for the President, the President flat out denies this.</p><p>It does not mean it's not going to stop and when you see Democrats so brutally cleaning out their own house of anyone who has been accused of any kind of sexual misconduct, I see them as doing that to try and set themselves up to retake the moral high ground and go hard after <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>over these accusations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, Megyn Kelly had them on her show and then they did a press conference after that. You're right. Christopher -- thank you.</p><p>BEDFORD: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will see you soon, sir. Christopher Bedford there.</p><p>Still ahead -- when it comes to a pen, you can leave home without it. Why American Express is ditching its signature requirements.</p><p>And then binge in the New Year -- Netflixrevealing the most streamed shows of 2017. The surprising series that took the top spot. Plus the new privacy concerns sparked by a tweet from the streaming giant.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>When we told you yesterday about the outpouring of support for Tennessee middle-schooler who went viral talking about bullying, now there are questions about his mother's motives for posting that video.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details right now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes -- Maria.</p><p>So there were more than 22 million hits on Kimberly Jones' heartbreaking footage of her son Keaton describing being called \"ugly\" at a school. Someone even launched a go fund me campaign that raised more than $58,000. But as attention spread so did interest in her.</p><p>She started her own go fund me page actually and then she slammed the original fundraiser and they are questioning whether she's just trying to make a quick buck off of her son.</p><p>Reports also began to emerge that she had posted multiple images of confederate flags on her Facebook account. Jones has since made her Facebook page private.</p><p>Well, American Express trying to stay competitive. Starting next April, the company will no longer require a signature regardless of the amount you're spending. Right now you have to sign for any purchase over $50. Of course, the latest credit cards have a computer chip for additional fraud protection. No signature required if you buy something online or on your phone. But it's been a strong year for American Express. The stock is actually up more than 30 percent.</p><p>Well, streamers that saw Netflix's tweet over the weekend were a little creeped-out with how much the company seems to know about their viewing habits. Netflixtweeted this, \"To the 53 people who watched a Christmas Prince every day for the past 18 days who hurt you question?\" Well, the tweet got a lot of laughs. It was re-tweeted over 100,000 times but also some backlash because viewers are thinking, hey, wait a minute, do I have any privacy with you, maybe I don't.</p><p>All right, but all that viewership data proving useful to Netflix. The company has come up with its official \"shows we devoured\" list which means a series was viewed more than two hours per day.</p><p>The list is surprisingly topped by -- this is interesting -- \"The True Crime\" spoof \"American Vandal\". Followed by the Brazilian series \"3 Percent; the controversial \"13 Reasons Why\", \"Anne with an E\" and \"Riverdale\". The most popular streaming day in 2017 was actually New Year's Day. Netflixstock up sharply so far this year.</p><p>And no, Dagen -- \"Narcos\" wasn't on that list or \"The Crown\".</p><p>BARTIROMO: Neither was \"House of Cards\".</p><p>CASONE: I don't know what to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have you seen any of those shows on that list -- Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE: No.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Neither have I.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I haven't either.</p><p>CASONE: What's wrong with me?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I haven't seen any of those shows.</p><p>CASONE: Am I a nerd?</p><p>BARTIROMO: How is that possible?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't know. Something is deeply wrong with me. I did. I'm almost done --</p><p>LAYFIELD: I have not seen any of it --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jon? What are these shows?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm almost done with the second season of \"The Crown\".</p><p>BARTIROMO: How is it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's not as good as the first season, shall we say. It's a lot about Prince Philip -- kind of boring.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's like \"House of Cards\" -- it wasn't as good as it got older.</p><p>HILSENRATH: No.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And now Foghorn Leghorn is gone. I'm talking about Kevin Spacey.</p><p>I'll say -- I'll say. I'm Frank Underwood.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Is Foghorn Leghorn even around anymore? What a great reference.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'll say - I'll say -- I'll say. There you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, harassment there, then you have harassment scandals hitting the NFL Network as well.</p><p>We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back, the fallout after three of the network's analysts received suspensions over new allegations there.</p><p>And then the Ball brothers making a fast break to an unexpected destination. Get this -- Lonzo Ball's two youngest sons are going pro just weeks after UCLA suspended one for shoplifting on a trip to China. When the basketball players will be traveling to Lithuania -- that's next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Former NFL players are suspended from the NFL Network over sexual assault allegations.</p><p>Jared Max with the story now -- Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS: Maria -- good morning.</p><p>Hall of Fame running back Marshall Faulk, along with fellow NFL Network analyst Heath Evans and Ike Taylor have been suspended by the NFL Network after all three were named in sexual misconduct lawsuit by a former NFL Network wardrobe stylist. Jami Cantor who was with the company from 2006 until October 2016. She filed a wrongful termination suit this October. Yesterday filed a further complaint. It alleges sexual harassment and assault.</p><p>Cantor claims that Faulk groped and fondled her, inappropriate text messages sent from the others. In addition to inappropriate texts from Donovan McNabb, former NFL quarterback and colleague of Cantor's at the time plus NFL Network executive Eric Weinberger.</p><p>McNabb now with ESPN yet to receive potential punishment. Weinberger, president of \"The Ringer\" placed on indefinite leave.</p><p>Monday night football south Florida, Tom Brady going for ninth straight win in ninth straight division title but very Brady celebration pre-empted by the Miami Dolphins defense.</p><p>Brady intercepted twice by Xavien Howard last night. Worst game for Brady statistically in four seasons. Jay Cutler three touchdowns for Miami which held New England to 25 rushing yards and didn't allow the Patriots to convert a single third down. That hasn't happened in 26 years. Dolphins win it 27-20.</p><p>You know that old saying, if at first you don't succeed, at stealing Louis Vuitton sunglasses on a basketball trip to China, then get suspended by UCLA indefinitely -- try, try again to play ball in another country.</p><p>LiAngelo Ball and his younger brother LaMelo Ball are going to be playing ball together. The two younger brothers of L.A. Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball and also the son of LaVar Ball have signed a one year contract to play for a pro team in Lithuania called Prienu Vytautas.</p><p>LaMelo was only 16. He was a junior in high school. He dropped out. LiAngelo ball is now 19 years old and probably in need of a new pair sunglasses after that whole mess which became an international incident.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lithuania.</p><p>MAX: Yes. Yes. And it's not really about money because they're not going to paid that much. There's reports that maybe guys make about $500 a month. Now you actually get a tax break certainly playing over there. But it's really about spreading the Big Baller brand.</p><p>LAYFIELD: Probably the last we're going to hear of them athletically.</p><p>MAX: Boy, you wonder, they're still kids. And the coach is said to be the LaVar Ball of Lithuania. I don't know that means.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAYFIELD: -- a buffoon that over-hypes himself.</p><p>MAX: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. Hey, how is the Olympics? Going high-tech. Humanoid robot Hubo just carried the 2018 Olympic flame. Hubo was given the honor yesterday in South Korea as part of the journey the torch will make before the games start in February. This is one of the 85 robot volunteers assisting in the Winter Games. Pretty cool.</p><p>MAX: Maria -- he looks a little bit -- was it the movie \"Short Circuit\" I think back in the 80s? He looks a little bit or a little R2D2. Check this out. There was new research from McKenzie (ph) that says that as much as one-third of American workforce could be out of work of 2030 because of automation. That 400 million to 800 million people globally could be displaced.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MAX: Maybe some of these robots should have some defects in them so we can keep ourselves employed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a real concern.</p><p>MAX: Yes. I mean, you know, we laugh about it now but the next 17 year what holds?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's incredible that they've come up with that -- that it's 2030 that that's when they'll be that pervasive, robotics everywhere.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I'm a little skeptical of arguments like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You are?</p><p>HILSENRATH: There were reports like that out ten years ago saying that all of our jobs were going to be outsourced to India. And you know, like radiologists -- we still have plenty of radiologists.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But they're doing prostate cancer surgery robotically. I mean the robotics have been very important and a great growth story for health care.</p><p>HILSENRATH: It's very important but they're not taking away all the doctors. That's my point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't know that they are displacing doctors. Exactly, exactly. Yes.</p><p>MAX: Can they tell me who is going to win the Super Bowl?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: They might.</p><p>LAYFIELD: You need a flux capacitor for that.</p><p>MAX: Exactly. -- 88 miles an hour.</p><p>LAYFIELD: That's right.</p><p>MAX: With Bill Belichick behind the wheel or answering questions from reporters.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Nice \"Back to the Future\" reference -- and \"Back to the Future\"</p><p>LAYFIELD: Thank you very much. What happened with Tom Savage and the concussion. How did Houston Texas miss that?</p><p>MAX: Well, the NFL is really dropping the ball. There's investigations going on because the quarterback -- he shouldn't have been allowed to come back into the game. All of the concern of head safety.</p><p>LAYFIELD: And so it was a missed concussion protocol. They're talking about revamping and they dismissed --</p><p>MAX: It seems like not everybody has their left hand and right hand working together all the time.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, a lot of players game that system too, don't they. They get their baseline down so that when they do get hurt they don't get pulled out.</p><p>MAX: It doesn't seem like it's all on the same page yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jared -- thank you. Catch Jared's sports reports on \"FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7\" or Sirius Radio Sirius XM 115.</p><p>Still to come -- up in smoke.

The Wall Street Journal reporting Comcast, Comcast is stepping down, no longer pursuing a deal for key entertainment and media businesses, Disney is still eyeing a deal.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Comcast confirmed yesterday it is no longer in the race to pursue movie and television assets from 21st Century Fox, leaving Disney as the only serious bidder.</p><p>Meanwhile, AT&amp;T gears up for its fight against the Department of Justice over its bid to acquire Time Warner, they say, we want this and we're not going to sell anything to get it.</p><p>Joining us this morning is AOL cofounder, former CEO, the current chairman and CEO of Revolution, Steve Case. Steve, it's good to see you.</p><p>STEVE CASE, CEO, REVOLUTION: Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. And you were around when we saw the last bout of last of mergers in media and telecom and that was obviously a big move for a lot of these companies making these companies bigger. The $164 billion AOL-Time Warner merger was the largest in history.</p><p>What do you make of the current M&amp;A climate? What are you seeing out there?</p><p>CASE: Well, you say, it does feel like Deja Vu all over again. It's a lot of same discussions happened 20 years ago about the role of content versus distribution. Do you need to be integrated, in particular the battle back then was the debate between this content king or distribution king.</p><p>It's pretty clear that the consumer is king and the platforms, the Amazon or Netflixor Facebook that have direct connections to consumers are the once that are advantage. As a result, Disney is basically saying they're going to pull back from Netflixand do their own direct to consumer offering. I think they're trying to bulk up, whether it'd be the Fox assets or other assets to have a credible offering to go directly to consumers. So it's someway this is similar battles that we were hearing 20 years ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think? So you think the consumer is king, but once again, people are really bidding up content, because -- look at Amazon right now, it's a little different, and, by the way, I can't believe it was 20 years ago. You're right. It was 20 years ago.</p><p>Amazon willing to pay out billions and billions of dollars for original content, is that where this is going? Where people are going to start doing more original content or using the sale of established content for example Fox, the Simpsons, you know, so many great shows, this is us, among those being talked about, is that where the value is?</p><p>CASE: Well, I think the value as I said is with the services that have direct to consumer offerings. So, how do you bundle together something that's credible which is a mix of brands and content people are already familiar with as well as some original content.</p><p>Again, this is not a new idea. HBO, 30 or 40 years ago really was pioneering that highly leverage some of the movies that are already made but invest in original content, Sopranos or other kinds of things to differentiate. So we're continuing to see that move forward.</p><p>So the only difference is now that there's a new companies that didn't exist 20 years ago Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, et cetera, Apple as well existed but wasn't really focused so much on media content. So the battle will continue, and the ones that really have that consumer connection, direct consumer connection are likely going to be the winners.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Those companies have their own investment arm. You look like an Amazon, it's acquiring. It's got an investment arm, acquiring technology companies.</p><p>Let's talk about the fight over net neutrality. I mean, Apple cofounder, Steve Wozniak and the man known as the father of the internet, Vint Cerf are leading a new push to prevent the FCC vote on Thursday.</p><p>The group of internet experts are calling on congress to stop the FCC from overturning rules that prevent internet providers from throttling or outright blocking online content. Your thoughts.</p><p>CASE: It is also as an old debate. It's sort of like that. Prince song from 1999, the debates in the 90ss around open access. Now the debate is around net neutrality. As a core, it's how do you play the internet as platform for innovation particularly allow disruptive start-ups entrepreneurs all over the country to start innovating and not just have the incumbents kind of lockdown their elites.</p><p>So I'm very concerned about net neutrality. I share the view of some of the people who wrote this week saying we need to make sure that the internet remains open for innovation and we err on side of making sure things are tilted in favor of those disruptive, those entrepreneurs that are really trying to launch new things not the existing incumbents trying to kind of protect their lead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And there's this push to invest in the heartland. Your company launching a $150-million fund, focused on investing in start-ups away from the coast in the middle of the country. This is really interesting, especially when you look at backers including big names like Eric Schmidt, Jeff Bezos, Meg Whitman, Howard Schultz. Tell us what your thinking is and these tries of the rest fund.</p><p>CASE: Well, I think the -- well, there's great innovation in places like Silicon Valley, and New York City, and Boston. Right now, the vast majority of venture capital goes to those cities. Last year, 75 percent of went to just three states, California, New York and Massachusetts. So the other 47 states, fight over 25 percent, yet there is great entrepreneurs all over the country building great companies.</p><p>There is not a lot of venture capital attention. So this Rise of the Rest, we launched about four years ago. It's now accelerating, as you mentioned. We launched last week this new fund and we've got about three dozen of Americas most iconic, respected entrepreneurs and investors, and executives, and families all joining us saying they believe in the idea of Rise of the Rest. They believe there are great entrepreneurs everywhere. They believe there are great investment opportunities everywhere and I hope is what capitalize more focus on middle of the country start-ups and will result in great breakout successes in those communities, also in the process create a lot of jobs, and more hope in those communities.</p><p>A lot of people wake up in the morning, feeling like they're anxious about the future. They're not sure what the role of technology is going to be in their family and their community. I want to make sure, by backing startups everywhere, they are creating jobs everywhere, that will really change that dynamic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's interesting because it's like you look around the world, everybody wanted to be the Silicon Valley, right? Even in Russia, they created this culpable project and yet there are little mini Silicon Valleys innovation hubs throughout the country. You look at Biotech Upstate New York. There's all of these little hubs everywhere, where you actually can tap into real innovation happening not necessarily just Silicon Valley.</p><p>CASE: Absolutely. And we've seen that we now there are 33 cities on a rise. The rest road trips that will three, three and a half years. 8,000 miles by bus, so we've been to places like Pittsburgh where a lot of great things are happening with the robotics because of Carnegie-Mellon, buffalo, some of the Biotech things that trade a lot of things around mobility New Orleans. A lot of things around Ag tech, Louisville and St. Louis around Ag tech, farming.</p><p>We're seeing innovation happening all over the country. We're trying to change the dynamic on with this rise of the rest to make sure their entrepreneurs in those places have access the capital to grow and scale their companies.</p><p>It's long and understood that creativity is wildly dispersed. Opportunity is not and really trying to level the playing field so everybody, everywhere who has an idea really has a shot at American dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Some of these companies though are more powerful than they ever have been. When you look at the big five, the FANG companies, right? Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, they have so much power, given all of the data, and the information that they have, about us, all.</p><p>Do you think the regulatory market changes the regulatory environment changes for technology, given the fact that this is a completely different industry, than just 10 years ago or five years ago, Steve?</p><p>CASE: Yes, I think it's beginning to change. We start seeing that the last couple years in the European Union. Brussels got a backing, has starting to slow some of the things happening with some of the big tech, and we're seeing a growing backlash in this country as well.</p><p>People are proud of what's happening in Silicon Valley, but also nervous about some of the implications, and including here in Washington, D.C., there's a lot more focus obviously even some congressional committees looking into what was the role of Facebook or other things even in the election.</p><p>So it now become so much more central in terms of our everyday lives. Had such a big impact on our economy. It's not surprising that there's more of a focus on the role of big tech if you will. And do I think Silicon Valley needs to be careful.</p><p>Last decade, as you well know, Wall Street sort of been the bad guy, I think Silicon Valley is at risk of becoming kind of the new bad guy where people love some of the products and service that come from Silicon Valley. They are a little nervous about some of the steps -- some companies in Silicon Valley are taking.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what I was asking, because you know, in the last 10 years, we saw the financials basically sit on cash, they were unwilling to do anything with their money, because they didn't know what regulation was around the corner, then you had Dodd-Frank. You wonder if that's going to happen to the technology sector. Now, they're the big spenders. Will they be the big spenders in the future if they've got congressional oversight that's much tougher than they saw in the past? And then, of course, Steve, there's bitcoin.</p><p>So you're obviously a student of this industry for a long time 25 years, even more. What do you think of bitcoin, Steve?</p><p>CASE: Well, I think it's exciting one though, but take this in their core technologies around block chain. But again, it does feel a little bit like 20 years ago where there's a phenomena, a mania almost around dotcom. Now, here's a little bit of a mania particularly on the trading side around bitcoin and ICOs, things like that.</p><p>So think the core technology of block chain ability to track things I think is very important, but I think there is a little bit too much speculation right now and will be interesting to see how things settle.</p><p>I saw even yesterday, as he stepped in to stop ICO, an initial coin offering that was happening and this idea that you can raise capital in an unregulated way which has happened recently. I don't think that is sustainable.</p><p>So I think we have to separate what's happening in terms of the core technologies like block chain and what's happening in terms of speculation, around that, whether it be bitcoin and ICOs. I think that we need to be a little more careful than we've been in recent months around thinking about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The Winklevoss brothers yesterday said that this is regulated but I suspect if this action keeps up with bitcoin, it's going to be regulated a lot more.</p><p>CASE: I think it's no question. It got talked about and I book in the third. There's next wave of industries and the role of policy regulations playing a deeper role whether it'd be financial services or health care, or some smart cities important aspects of our lives. There's going to be more regulations.</p><p>Entrepreneurs hate hearing that particularly in Silicon Valley, but I think it's going to be true and we're going to see that with bitcoin as well, there's no question, the regulators not just in this country but around the world are going to make sure they have adequate protections in place to make sure these technologies, these platforms can have a positive impact on the market as opposed to kind of have potentially some unintended consequences that could be negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great insights, Steve. We'll be watching the Rise of the Rest fund. Always great to talk with you, sir. Thank you.</p><p>CASE: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon. Steve Case there.</p><p>Still ahead, smoking leads to a fiery confrontation on Southwest Airlines flight. A passenger threatens to kill everybody onboard after crews asked her to put out her cigarette. The frightening footage that ended in felony charges. That's next.</p><p>And then scouting for new flavors. Yoplait teams up with Girl Scouts for a twist on yogurt, back in a minute.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news right now. San Francisco mayor, Ed Lee has died. Cheryl Casone with the story now. Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: We're just getting some new details into this, Maria. Lee died early this morning, according to his office. The \"San Francisco Examiner\" says that Lee died after suffering a heart attack while shopping at a local Safeway store near his home. He was pronounced dead at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital early this morning.</p><p>Lee was a big supporter of San Francisco as sanctuary city. He strongly defended that controversial policy after Kate Steinle was murdered in 2015 by convicted felon who was deported five times.</p><p>Mayor Ed Lee dead at the age of 65.</p><p>Well, a 24-year-old woman has been arrested after she threatened to kill passengers on a Southwest Airlines flight from Portland to Sacramento. This happened after she was caught smoking in the airplane bathroom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I swear if you don't -- I will -- kill everybody on this -- plane. I will kill everybody on this -- plane.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well, she was physically restrained by crew and passengers until the plane was able to safely land in Sacramento.</p><p>Well, amid the spike in reports of sexual assault and harassment in the news lately, feminism is Merriam Webster's word of the year for 2017. The dictionary says the word was the top lookup throughout the year starting as early as January during the women's march on Washington, shortly after the inauguration.</p><p>Well Girl Scout cookies are not going to be available for a few months, darn it. But thankfully, Yoplait yogurt is coming out with something to satisfy the cravings. Girl Scout cookies that come in yogurt form. Later this month Yoplait is releasing new flavors inspired by the different cookies, thin mint, peanut butter chocolate, and caramel coconut. Yes, please. Those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. I'll take it. Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up next, AR, a reality? We will talk to the company that succeeded with augmented reality where major technology threatened to fail. Wait till you see this, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. With the holiday shopping season in full swing, now, one of the hottest gifts out there, is augmented and virtual reality headsets.</p><p>The company has taking the lead in bringing AR glasses to the market is not Google, by the way, it is a company based out of Rochester, New York called, Vuzix.</p><p>So joining me right now is founder and CEO of Vuzix, Paul Travers. Paul, good to see you.</p><p>PAUL TRAVERS, CEO, VUZIX: Maria, thanks for having us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>So, how was Vuzix able to do what other huge tech companies were unable to do for so many years in terms of glasses? We want to look at the spectacles here.</p><p>TRAVERS: Well, all these other guys are making things that are massive quite frankly and Vuzix makes lightweight wearable, all-day long kinds of devices. We started the enterprise. We actually have to go all the way back to the defense market.</p><p>The defense guys, Special Forces guys, asked if we could make Oakley-style subclasses. Nobody likes to look like a nerd when they put this stuff on. If you look at VR market today, all these things are giant sort of --</p><p>BARTIROMO: They're really big on your head. Let me check these out. See how light they are. Can I try this on?</p><p>TRAVERS: Yes, please do. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you have two models here on set. This one is the M300?</p><p>TRAVERS: That's actually the Blade.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, this is -- OK. So this is the Blade.</p><p>TRAVERS: Yes. And it's B to C and consumers, those kinds of things. With those glasses on, you want to take your phone out of your pocket? Put those glasses on, you'll be able to -- Sam, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What I like is that I don't feel like a geek.</p><p>TRAVERS: And you don't look like one either.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't know about that. But tell me what this Blade does.</p><p>TRAVERS: So with your phone in your pocket. Imagine you're walking down the street and there's a Pokemon Go character that's up to the right, everybody knows Pokemon Go. Millions of users in a week. The Pokemon Go character comes up, you look and through the glasses you see this character sitting on a street or you're getting directions and the directions are in your glasses. A phone call comes in, you can answer with the glasses on. It's beginnings of leaving your phone in your pocket.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. OK. So I don't have to take my phone out with this. This is going to show me -- let's do the other model. This one is the M300 Enterprise Class smart glasses. This is for enterprise, tell us. Put those on. Let me know what it's for.</p><p>TRAVERS: That's correct. So these guys are worn like this, around your neck when you're in a warehouse situation that put glasses on, and this becomes effectively the barcode scanner. So instead of taking a handheld barcode scanner, going over to the box --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Here, here's the barcode scanner.</p><p>TRAVERS: Actually in this particular case, Sam, we're operationally -- well, let me actually run it here. So I'm looking through these glasses and you can see, this is nothing more than a blueprint.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ooh, look at the screen.</p><p>TRAVERS: Through the glasses, you can see there's literally a multistory building sitting here that's not real.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What we're seeing on that screen is what you're seeing in your glasses?</p><p>TRAVERS: That's correct. That's correct. So you can imagine so many applications where this can become a valuable tool.</p><p>BARTIROMO: you made the analogy earlier, if you're on a plane, on your -- unloading the baggage from a plane.</p><p>TRAVERS: Yes. We worked with folks like SATS at Changi Airport and they have the gate folks wearing these glasses. The pallet comes by, on the side of pallet, a few barcode, barcode kind of a thing. Through these glasses you see all of the information about where that pallet goes on a plane. What section of the plane it belongs in.</p><p>If it doesn't belong on that plane, they will have a red marker on the outside of it and just like this building that's not real or marker is not real, but digitally, they can put it in remove it ad at the same time --</p><p>BARTIROMO: They know where the baggage goes on the plane.</p><p>TRAVERS: They can turn around a plane in one half, the amount of time compared to how they do it today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's very cool. So Vuzix recently entered into a supply agreement with Toshiba. Tell us about that.</p><p>TRAVERS: I can tell you a little bit about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Come on.</p><p>TRAVERS: Well, it's very exciting for me, actually. It's one of the largest, probably orders that smart glasses have seen, quite frankly. Toshiba is a major player in the laptop space. They're coming out with a line of products that are wearable, etch-oriented and they're buying smart glasses from Vuzix.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really? Cool stuff.</p><p>TRAVERS: We learn a lot more about that here. It's a multimillion-dollar contract for Vuzix and sometime here in the first quarter, Toshiba will be sharing a lot more. What is the world and 3D?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I feel that if you don't have augmented reality or A.I. or some sort, you're going to be left behind, because every industry is using it at this point.</p><p>TRAVERS: We have companies getting -- doing things 500 percent ROI, It's really hard to ignore.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cool stuff. Paul, thank you so much.</p><p>TRAVERS: You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you, Paul from Vuzix there.</p><p>Still ahead, inventing inspiration. We will talk to a self-made Joy Mangano about her widely popular home shopping network empire.</p><p>And the acclaimed 2015 movie loosely based on her life, starring Jennifer Lawrence. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Tuesday morning. Welcome back, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2017121202cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R5D-6D41-JB20-G3TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8308\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 12, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00023A6</classCode><className>AMERICAN EXPRESS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

He claims, but cannot prove, that he encountered a one-armed man minutes before he discovered his wife's dead body. After his escape he drifts from town to town trying to find the ghostly figure and to elude the man obsessed with recapturing him.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The damage that globalisation has done to America's economy is as obvious to some as Dr Kimble's guilt was to his pursuers. Careful academic studies have linked competition by Chinese manufacturers to the growing propensity of prime-aged men to drop out of the labour force. A pillar of trade theory says that increased commerce with labour-rich countries will depress the pay of the low-skilled; and some reckonings of wage inequality in America pin part of the blame on trade and migration. GDP growth has been sluggish during the long hangover from the financial crisis. The globalisation of finance provided the kindling for America's subprime crisis and spread its effects around the world. Globalisation is on the run. But might there be another brigand who bears responsibility for its alleged crimes?</p><p>An intriguing line of research identifies an increase in the incidence of economic \"rents\" (profits over and above the levels needed to justify investment or input of work) as a possible villain. A study last year by Jason Furman, of the Council for Economic Advisers (CEA), and Peter Orszag, a former budget director for Barack Obama, found that the top 10% of firms by profit have pulled away sharply from the rest (see chart). Their return on capital invested rose from more than three times that of the median firm in the 1990s to eight times. This is way above any plausible cost of capital and likely to be pure rent. Those high returns are persistent. More than four-fifths of the firms that made a return of 25% or more in 2003 were still doing so ten years later.</p><p>Other research suggests that this increasingly skewed distribution of profits goes a long way to explaining the rise in wage inequality. A paper in 2014 by Erling Bath, Alex Bryson, James Davis and Richard Freeman found that most of the growing dispersion in individual pay since the 1970s is associated with variations in pay between companies, not within them. In other words, the most profitable companies pay handsomely and people who work for them earn more than the rest. </p><p>This finding was confirmed in a more recent study by Nicholas Bloom and David Price, both of Stanford University, with others, which found that virtually all of the rise in income inequality is explained by a growing dispersion in average wages paid by firms. This finding, the authors conclude, holds across all industries, regions and firm sizes. One of the most striking implications is that inequality within firms has not changed much: the relationship between managers' and shop-floor workers' pay in each firm is still roughly the same. But the gap between what the average and the best firms pay their workers at all levels has widened. Alan Krueger, of Princeton University, illustrated this point nicely at a presentation he gave while working at the CEA in 2013. Using data from the decade after 2003, he showed that where managers are well paid, so are janitors (see chart). </p><p>This wider range of profits is likely to be related to increases in market power. Some of this is due to the rise of internet giants, which dominate their respective markets thanks to network effects. But many of America's industries have also become more concentrated by a slow creep of acquisitions. A study by The Economist earlier this year divided the economy into 900-odd sectors covered by the five-yearly economic census and found that two-thirds of them were more concentrated in 2012 than they had been in 1997. The weighted average share of the total held by the leading four firms in each sector rose from 26% to 32%. </p><p>America used to be famous for its workers' willingness to follow the jobs, but they have become far less mobile. A paper by Raven Molloy and Christopher Smith of the Federal Reserve and Abigail Wozniak of the University of Notre Dame finds that over the past three decades migration rates between states have fallen by at least a third for most age groups. For those aged between 20 and 24, the most mobile group, the annual rate of internal migration fell from 5.7% in 1981-89 to 3.3% in 2002-12. </p><p>Many of the reasons put forward for this are not wholly convincing. It cannot be the rise of the two-income family, because the trend to less mobility holds for workers of all ages. Nor is it the housing boom and bust: the decline in mobility started long before that, in the early 1990s, and has continued since. It is certainly not trade unions (membership of which has declined), labour-market regulation or unemployment benefits, claims for which have dropped sharply. </p><p>A few researchers have made an intriguing link between the decline in labour mobility and wider profit dispersion. The argument has several steps. The average age of established businesses has risen steadily because fewer new firms are formed. Startups have a high labour turnover, but in mature firms fewer people join and leave in any given year. The lower the churn rate of jobs, the fewer the opportunities for job-changers to find new work. So it is possible that less dynamism in American business, characterised by industry concentration and lower job turnover, has reduced the incentive for jobseekers to go and look for work in another state. </p><p>Another reason may be rent-seeking within the labour force itself. Another paper from the CEA finds that the share of America's workforce covered by state-licensing laws has risen to 25%, from less than 5% in the 1950s. Much of this red tape is unnecessary. On the most recent estimates, over 1,000 occupations are regulated in at least one state but only 60 are regulated in all states. The scope of the rules vary from state to state. A licensed security guard requires three years of training in Michigan but only around two weeks in most other states, for instance. Licensed workers can command higher pay than the unlicensed kind because entry to the occupation is restricted, so consumers have to pay more. </p><p>For much of the past 40 years economic liberals have argued for the dismantling of barriers to the free flow of commerce, such as state monopolies, trade unions and restrictive practices. Such policies have produced some clear successes. In Britain the privatisation of monopoly utilities, such as British Telecom, and the opening up of other sectors to competition was a spur to productivity and innovation, leading to better and cheaper services for customers. In America the deregulation of airlines brought lower fares and an increase in the number of trips. Labour markets in America and Britain became more flexible, and unemployment has generally been lower than in continental Europe. </p><p>Deregulation is almost always a difficult task. Those whose interests are hurt by such reforms protest noisily. The political costs quickly become apparent, whereas the gains may not become clear before the next polling day. It is even harder to make changes when so many people feel that the cost of liberalising markets in the past was unfairly distributed. Critics of such liberalisation point to a decline in labour income as a share of GDP as evidence that wage earners have the odds stacked against them. They argue that blue-collar workers provide the flexibility, having to accept lower pay and less job security, whereas white-collar workers and bosses are protected. Increased openness to trade and the growing mobility of capital have made it harder for workers to push for pay rises, so they cling to the jobs they have. In an age of insecurity, it is hard to persuade anyone that they should give up such protections for the greater good. </p><p>Market power is supposed to be policed by competition agencies, but they have lost some of their vim, particularly in America, where competition cases are fought out in the courts. A landmark Supreme Court judgment in 2004 said monopoly profits were the just reward for innovation. That has made it harder for trustbusters to root out rent-seeking or block mergers. Most big firms got where they are by being good at what they do, not because of coddling by regulators. But if firms can hold onto their market share for years, they create distortions in the rest of the economy. Incumbent firms are powerful lobbyists. </p><p>Big tech firms also have a penchant for so-called \"shoot-out\" acquisitions, whereby a startup is bought to eliminate a budding rival. For many tech startups and their financiers, a buy-out by one of the big platform companies is a badge of success. But if small firms cannot become independently big, the market power of incumbents is not sufficiently challenged. </p><p>Competition policy faces difficult questions in an age of superstar firms that dominate global markets. But the trickiest political problem for reformers is how to inject some dynamism into the economy without getting people even more worried about their livelihoods. Raising import tariffs or closing borders to people and capital is not the answer. Instead, policymakers should encourage more competition while putting in place adequate protections for those who lose out from it. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-RJ61IVM</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KTT-2SK1-JBKN-B3W6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1588\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Freshman Sen. Josh Hawley's bill, the Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology (SMART) Act, would make it illegal for social media companies such as Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat to use infinite scroll, autoplay video or techniques like Snapchat's \"streaks,\" which reward a user with badges for repeated use. \"Big tech has embraced a business model of addiction,\" Hawley, a Missouri Republican, said in a statement announcing the bill. </p><p>\"Too much of the \u2018innovation' in this space is designed not to create better products, but to capture more attention by using psychological tricks that make it difficult to look away. This legislation will put an end to that and encourage true innovation by tech companies.\" The senator has spent his first year in office taking on Big Tech. He grilled Google executives during hearings on the company's data-collection policies. He wrote a scathing letter to the Federal Trade Commission, rebuking regulators for failing to protect consumers from privacy abuse and overreach by Silicon Valley. He proposed a major bipartisan update to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which would further curb tech companies' ability to monitor the online behavior of kids. At 39, he is a digital native with a deeper understanding of tech than many of his colleagues. Others in the new class to conquer Capitol Hill have used the very social media platforms he rails against to elevate their voices and steer the online conversation. But Hawley has said he chooses to use them sparingly and has even suggested that society would be better off if social media disappeared. He has called social media a \"parasite on productive investment, on meaningful relationships, on a healthy society\" and once asked during an NBC interview, \"should these platforms exist at all?\" The bill doesn't go as far as outright banning social media platforms, but it proposes regulatory measures that would force users to actively choose to engage for prolonged periods rather than being mindlessly sucked into the void. It would require platforms to implement \"natural stopping points,\" or places where a video or post stops and the users are prompted to click or select another piece of content, rather than it appearing or playing automatically. For example, this could affect the way Instagram stories endlessly rotate from one to the next. Hawley's proposal would also require social media companies to create a \"user-friendly interface\" that would allow users to set time limits or boundaries for themselves and actively display how much time they had spent on any platform. In addition, the bill would require the FTC to produce a report at least every three years on the \"issue of Internet addiction\" that would explore the ways \"social media companies, by exploiting human psychology and brain physiology, interfere with free choices of individuals on the Internet.\" The SMART Act would give the FTC and secretary of Health and Human Services authority to enforce regulations and establish new rules as the tech environment continues to evolve and innovate. The Internet Association \u2014 a trade group that represents global Internet companies including Twitter, Facebook and Snap Inc., which owns Snapchat \u2014 said in a statement from President and CEO Michael Beckerman that social media platforms already invest and participate in programs and partnerships that \"promote healthy online experiences.\" Tools to help users regulate their time online already exist, the association added. In his statement, Beckerman said the association backs the Children and Media Research Advancement (CAMRA) Act, which would fund a study by the National Institutes of Health examining the impact of media and technology on children's health. \"Funding for independent scientific research is critical to better understand the impact of screen time and identify more ways to enhance people's well-being on and offline,\" Beckerman's statement said. Previous studies have shown that tech companies use computer design techniques embraced by casinos, such as the idea of \"stickiness\" \u2014 which give \"just enough positive feedback to want to return to the game but deny users enough pleasure so that they don't get satiated,\" Siva Vaidhyanathan told The Washington Post last year. Vaidhyanathan is the author of \"Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy.\" A 2018 Pew Research Center study found that 89 percent of teens surveyed that year said they were online \"almost constantly\" or \"several times a day.\" Forty-five percent said they were online \"almost constantly.\" A different study published in 2019 in the Journal of Behavioral Addictions found that those who reported spending excessive time on Facebook were more likely to take risky gambles, performing on a psychological test with the same impulses as someone addicted to drugs. Hawley's bill does not yet have any co-sponsors, reported the Hill.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Getty Images The Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology (SMART) Act would make it illegal for social media companies such as Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat to use infinite scroll, autoplay video or techniques like Snapchat's \"streaks,\" which reward a user with badges for repeated use.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHDLY-0001086367</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRJ-1KC1-JBRC-V4P7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163823</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"861\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Paddock Publications, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Daily Herald</publicationName><edition>WEB EditionNC1 EditionNC2 EditionMF12 EditionNC3 EditionNM1 EditionNC EditionNC14 EditionMC1 EditionMC3 EditionMD1 EditionML2 EditionNL1 EditionNC14C EditionNC4 EditionCLFM EditioneBlast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 4, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Josh Hawley's bill, the Social Media Addiction Reduction Technology (SMART) Act, would make it illegal for social media companies such as Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat to use infinite scroll, autoplay video or techniques like Snapchat's \"streaks,\" which reward a user with badges for repeated use.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Big tech has embraced a business model of addiction,\" Hawley, a Missouri Republican, said in a statement announcing the bill. \"Too much of the 'innovation' in this space is designed not to create better products, but to capture more attention by using psychological tricks that make it difficult to look away. This legislation will put an end to that and encourage true innovation by tech companies.\"</p><p>The senator has spent his first year in office taking on Big Tech. He grilled Google executives during hearings on the company's data-collection policies. He wrote a scathing letter to the Federal Trade Commission, rebuking regulators for failing to protect consumers from privacy abuse and overreach by Silicon Valley. He proposed a major bipartisan update to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which would further curb tech companies' ability to monitor the online behavior of kids.</p><p>At 39, he is a digital native with a deeper understanding of tech than many of his colleagues. Others in the new class to conquer Capitol Hill have used the very social media platforms he rails against to elevate their voices and steer the online conversation. But Hawley has said he chooses to use them sparingly and has even suggested that society would be better off if social media disappeared.</p><p>He has called social media a \"parasite on productive investment, on meaningful relationships, on a healthy society\" and once asked during an NBC interview, \"should these platforms exist at all?\"</p><p>The bill doesn't go as far as outright banning social media platforms, but it proposes regulatory measures that would force users to actively choose to engage for prolonged periods rather than being mindlessly sucked into the void.</p><p>It would require platforms to implement \"natural stopping points,\" or places where a video or post stops and the users are prompted to click or select another piece of content, rather than it appearing or playing automatically. For example, this could affect the way Instagram stories endlessly rotate from one to the next.</p><p>Hawley's proposal would also require social media companies to create a \"user-friendly interface\" that would allow users to set time limits or boundaries for themselves and actively display how much time they had spent on any platform.</p><p>In addition, the bill would require the FTC to produce a report at least every three years on the \"issue of Internet addiction\" that would explore the ways \"social media companies, by exploiting human psychology and brain physiology, interfere with free choices of individuals on the Internet.\"</p><p>The SMART Act would give the FTC and secretary of Health and Human Services authority to enforce regulations and establish new rules as the tech environment continues to evolve and innovate.</p><p>The Internet Association - a trade group that represents global Internet companies including Twitter, Facebook and Snap Inc., which owns Snapchat - said in a statement from President and Chief Executive Michael Beckerman that social media platforms already invest and participate in programs and partnerships that \"promote healthy online experiences.\" Tools to help users regulate their time online already exist, the association added.</p><p>In his statement, Beckerman said the association backs the Children and Media Research Advancement (CAMRA) Act, which would fund a study by the National Institutes of Health examining the impact of media and technology on children's health.</p><p>\"Funding for independent scientific research is critical to better understand the impact of screen time and identify more ways to enhance people's well-being on and offline,\" Beckerman's statement said.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that tech companies use computer design techniques embraced by casinos, such as the idea of \"stickiness\" - which give \"just enough positive feedback to want to return to the game but deny users enough pleasure so that they don't get satiated,\" Siva Vaidhyanathan told The Washington Post last year. Vaidhyanathan is the author of \"Antisocial Media: How Facebook Disconnects Us and Undermines Democracy.\"</p><p>A 2018 Pew Research Center study found that 89 percent of teens surveyed that year said they were online \"almost constantly\" or \"several times a day.\" Of that 89 percent, 45 percent said they were online \"almost constantly.\"</p><p>A different study published in 2019 in the Journal of Behavioral Addictions found that those who reported spending excessive time on Facebook were more likely to take risky gambles, performing on a psychological test with the same impulses as someone addicted to drugs.</p><p>Hawley's bill does not yet have any co-sponsors, reported the Hill.</p><p>             Read more:           </p><p>             Opinion | Tech addiction is real.

The songwriters say they contributed to a signature line about taking a DNA test. Meanwhile, Lizzo did say she`s sharing writing credit on the song with the actual creator of that line, Mina Lioness. Lizzo said on social media Lioness is the only one who deserves the credit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the CBS MoneyWatch now, new criticism for the FAA, and a Google computer achieves a breakthrough.

Big tech takes center stage today with quarterly results due from Amazon, Twitter, and Intel. Also reporting today are American and Southwest Airlines. Now, stocks closed higher yesterday with help from health care and communications companies. The Dow rose forty-five points. The S&amp;P 500 gained eight. And the NASDAQ added fifteen.</p><p>A new report says the FAA must restore, quote, \"public confidence\" in aircraft certification efforts following two deadly crashes involving Boeing 737 Max. According to Reuters, the report by the transportation department`s inspector general said the FAA faces a, quote, \"significant oversight challenge to ensure that companies conducting those tests maintain high standards and comply with FAA safety regulations.\"</p><p>Now, call it a quantum leap. Google says it has achieved a breakthrough in quantum computing. Scientists say they developed an experimental processor that performed a complicated calculation in two hundred seconds. The same calculation would take about ten thousand years to complete by today`s fastest supercomputer. If they head to the mainstream, quantum computers could perform important work like designing new drugs at the molecular level, optimizing financial investments and speeding up package delivery.</p><p>And Target has unveiled its holiday plans. The retail giant will offer free shipping for items bought between November 1st and December 22nd with no minimum purchase required. Target is also opening Disney shops inside more than two dozen of its stores. Not to be outdone, rival Walmart is kicking off its holiday shopping season with deals starting tomorrow. Walmart says it wants to help consumers get an early start on purchasing gifts with new and expanded services. Those include more exclusive toys and visits from Santa.

Just before game two of the World Series last night between the Nationals and the Astros, the Texas native and Olympic champion did a spinning flip and then she threw the ceremonial first pitch. The Nationals crushed the home team 12-3 to take a commanding 2-0 lead in the series.</p><p>And this morning, Katherine Johnson, a trailblazing reporter for the Associated Press, is being remembered. The award-winning journalist died yesterday morning in Atlanta. Her intrepid coverage of the Civil Rights movement and other important stories led to a string of legendary scoops. She was the only journalist allowed inside Martin Luther King Jr.`s home the day he was assassinated.

The following is an excerpt from her first book, \"Trampled by Unicorns: Big Tech's Empathy Problem and How to Fix It.[1]\" In it, she examines how Big Tech's failure to empathize with customers and workers has led to \"digital era's equivalent of feudalism.\" In her in-depth critique of the world's largest tech corporations \u2014 including Amazon, Uber, and Google \u2014 she crafts an earnest call to action for industry leaders, board members, employees, and consumers to get tech back on track. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[2].Right now the jury is still out on whether the tech economy is ultimately a job creator or a job destroyer. </p><p>As with many of the points in this book, that topic is complex, nuanced, and polarizing.As of today, while tech has upended some businesses, it has helped drive expansion in so many industries that the net effect is likely more jobs, even if there is disagreement over how to quantify it. Whether that will be true as automation driven by artificial intelligence expands throughout the economy is another matter. Either way, it is critical that we look deeper than simple employment numbers.Tech defenders argue that the information revolution is no different from others in history. One can certainly draw parallels to the industrial revolution, for example: Powered by relentless innovation, it, too, created new jobs while killing others.What is different is the degree to which tech companies, and unicorns in particular, have changed the nature and financial underpinnings of work, and the relationship between employers and workers.Whereas the industrial revolution paved the way for a new middle class and lifted overall prosperity, the tech revolution has helped to hollow out the middle class and catalyze a greater level of income inequality than at any time in modern history.And no matter what some tech executives, venture capitalists, and their investors claim, these trade-offs need not be the inevitable consequence of progress. The human impact of tech disruption Understanding how different the current revolution is starts with the underlying ethos of the tech industry, which \u2014 in the name of delivering more efficiency, more capabilities, and at lower cost \u2014 is to disrupt deeply entrenched legacy businesses and processes.And to be clear, if legacy businesses are bloated, delivering poor quality and bad service at high prices, they deserve all the disruption they get.But to compete, tech early on identified the cost of labor as among the biggest inefficiencies of its targets. Thus, tech avoided unions at all cost. Compensation at many startups was a mix of low salaries and stock options that might or might not ever attain significant value. The idea of pensions (at least in the United States) was relegated to the dustbin. And the widespread use of independent contractors and gig workers without any kind of social protection supported the economics of many Big Tech businesses.In the early days of the tech boom, it was easy to be dazzled and distracted by all the new toys we were getting and by all the newly minted millionaires, some of whom were secretaries and cafeteria workers lucky enough to be hired at the right time by the right tech firms.But we are now seeing the bills come due, especially when it comes to the so-called gig economy.Take Uber, a company closely associated with welcomed disruption, Ride-hailing apps are reckoned to account for about 75% of the ground transportation market[3] in the US for business travelers, so it comes as little surprise that the overnight growth and popularity of Uber, Lyft, and similar services have sliced through the livelihoods of many traditional taxi, minicab, and private-hire drivers.To be sure, the old-school taxi business, especially in the major metropolitan centers like New York City and Chicago, was no paragon of virtue. It was notorious for its corruption and poor customer service and in dire need of reinvention.Yet the arrival of disruptive digital technology in the form of smartphone-enabled taxi apps has had a catastrophic effect on the incumbent industry's workers.Indeed, in New York the suicides of at least six drivers over a six-month period in 2018 may be attributable \u2014 at least in part \u2014 to the plunging value of taxi drivers' medallions and plummeting incomes due to the popularity of ride-share apps.[4]In February 2018, a 61-year-old delivery driver shot himself in front of City Hall[5] in lower Manhattan. Hours earlier Doug Schifter had written a Facebook post about his own perilous financial situation and how he was sometimes obliged to work more than 100 hours a week to make ends meet. Schifter blamed politicians for permitting the city's streets to be flooded with Uber's cars, which was also affecting traffic.I will forever remember the reaction of two of my friends working at Uber at the time when, over dinner, I asked them how they felt about these suicides and the working conditions of Uber drivers that were starting to become public knowledge: \"This is very sad but this is the cost of progress. The taxi industry needs to be disrupted and we're not forcing people to drive for us.\"Unfortunately, over the years, I've heard variations of these words abdicating any responsibility and justifying human pain in the name of technological progress so many times and from employees of so many different tech companies that I can't remember them all.There's no doubt that the gig economy has offered new work opportunities, additional revenue sources, and much-needed flexibility to tens of millions. In the developing world it has some additional benefits too, such as in India, where Foreign Policy magazine[6] reported \"higher relative incomes, more jobs, less corruption, and, eventually, a formalization of the labor market.\"But there is also no doubt that, overall, gig work is short-term, insecure, high-pressure, low paid, and precarious, with few worker rights or protections.Indeed, the on-demand/freelance-labor model that companies such as Uber, Lyft, Instacart, Deliveroo, Postmates, and TaskRabbit favor \u2014 which poses as \"flexible\" and worker-friendly \u2014 leaves workers to fend for themselves or shifts the burden for retirement benefits, sick pay, parental leave, and healthcare back onto government in places where there is still a taxpayer-funded safety net.And while this new normal is increasingly being met with protests from workers[7]\u2014 and is being examined by regulators, policymakers, and in courtrooms around the world \u2014 the gig economy, in one form or another, is here to stay.In effect, Big Tech has instituted the digital era's equivalent of feudalism, the hierarchical social system in medieval Europe of overlords, vassals, and serfs, only this time with fortunes built on data rather than land.In Valley terms the nobility and the clergy (founders and venture capitalists) are masters and owners of all they survey and generally mingle only with the royal ministers and powerful merchants (leadership team and top product and engineering employees).The vassals (non-engineering employees) are considered important but not critical and somewhat replaceable. At the bottom of the pyramid are the serfs and the peasants, who in this analogy, rather than working the land, drive for Uber or Lyft, or deliver packages for Amazon or meals for Deliveroo or DoorDash, or worse still work for paltry amounts in sweatshops (See Figure 4.1).In my experience, even when an executive at one of these firms brags that they \"know what it's like\" to drive for a ride-hailing app because they were a driver for a day a few months ago, in reality they have not the faintest clue about what it really means to be dependent on getting enough work on any given day to be sure they can feed their family or pay for next week's gas.The situation has been exacerbated by the spread of COVID-19, with many gig economy workers unable to afford to stop working despite a lack of coverage for sick pay or related benefits. (It should be noted that, as I write, Amazon, Instacart, DoorDash, Uber, and Lyft had all offered their gig workers up to two weeks of sick pay if they can show they have been diagnosed with or quarantined because of COVID-19.)In this new era of relentless insecurity and volatility for tens of millions of people around the world stuck in this new feudalism, it is becoming harder not just to raise a family or buy a home, but simply to get by.Disturbing stories about life as a food delivery driver or next-day delivery courier or warehouse/fulfillment-center worker abound. If anything, the situation for manual workers is worse still.In 2019, the Vox Media-run tech website The Verge obtained documents that revealed that Amazon's automated system tracks fulfillment center employees and \"automatically generates any warnings of terminations regarding quality or productivity[8].\" More worrying still, it even tracks \"time off task,\" known as TOT, where employees can be warned or fired for taking too long between scanning individual packages.Some workers avoid bathroom breaks as a result, reported the site, which also revealed that an attorney representing Amazon admitted that the company had fired \"hundreds[9]\" of employees in a single facility between August 2017 and September 2018 missing productivity targets.It doesn't stop there. A deep dive investigation by Buzzfeed, titled \"The Cost of Next-day Delivery,[10]\"paints a picture of the crushing pressure placed on contracted-out courier services working for Amazon, who are frequently expected \"to deliver hundreds of packages each shift \u2014 for a flat rate of around $160-a-day \u2014 at the direction of dispatchers who often compel them to skip meals, bathroom breaks, and any other form of rest, discouraging them from going home until the very last box is delivered.\"The Buzzfeed feature discovered that drivers often have to deliver at least 250 packages a day, which works out as less than two minutes per package based on an eight-hour shift.\"Amazon goes further than gig economy companies, which insist its drivers are independent contractors with no rights as employees,\" the piece reported. \"By contracting instead with third-party companies, which in turn employ drivers, Amazon divorces itself from the people delivering its packages.\"That allows it to avoid legal liability for accidents, as when one driver hit and killed an 84-year-old woman in Chicago, in the run-up to Christmas 2016. \"The damages, if any, were caused, in whole or in part, by third parties not under the direction or control of Amazon.com,\" its lawyers said in a court filing.[11]The story added that \"public records document hundreds of road wrecks involving vehicles delivering Amazon packages in the past five years, with Amazon itself named as a defendant in at least 100 lawsuits ... including at least six fatalities and numerous serious injuries.\" And that, it noted, is likely to be a significant underestimate because many accidents involving third-party contractors will not be reported in a way which would link them to Amazon.Excerpted with permission of the publisher, Wiley, from \"Trampled by Unicorns,\" by Malle Gavet.

It's entirely reasonable to call those out, and to argue that there should be some significant regulatory oversight of such scams. However, it is also possible to believe that an overreaction to such scams could kill off a nascent attempt to rebuild a truly open and distributed internet. For years now, I've been talking about why we could better fulfill the dream of an open, distributed internet if we were to move to a world of protocols, not platforms[1], and in a more recent post, I've discussed some policy proposals[2] to help the world move in that direction -- with the final one concerning the SEC, and getting it to stop looking at cryptocurrencies solely as a financial instrument nearly identical to a security. </p><p>This is not to avoid all scrutiny of cryptocurrencies. But having a working cryptocurrency system in which the success of a protocol can be driven by its actual usage and development, rather than ads or \"surveillance capitalism\", would benefit massively from more freedom to experiment. While it does not appear that, by itself, it will be that successful, a few years back the social network/messaging app Kik started an experiment in this space, raising $100 million[3] with an ICO and designing it so that its \"Kin\" tokens could be used to reward developers who build services. The company has put some effort into encouraging developers[4] to build within its ecosystem, and for others to use the Kin tokens as currency. However, mostly behind the scenes, Kik and the SEC have been having a bit of a fight over whether or not the ICO was an unregistered securities sale. Back in January, the company revealed[5] that it had been negotiating with the SEC over the whole thing.The SEC isn't accusing Kik of fraud, Mr. Livingston said. Rather, its enforcement division believes Kik failed to register the sale with the SEC and thus didn't give investors the proper information. The agency's enforcement action must be authorized by the SEC's commissioners, and it's unknown whether they have voted to authorize the litigation. [....] The SEC says most digital tokens are covered by a 73-year-old Supreme Court decision that defined which investments are considered securities. Many tokens meet the court's test because they can be traded for profit, and their value is tied to the performance of the startup that sold them, regulators say. In a 39-page rebuttal on Dec. 10 to the SEC, Kik argued the sale terms, in fact, don't constitute an investment contract, and investors weren't led to expect to profit on their purchase of kin. 'Bringing the proposed enforcement action against Kik and the foundation would amount to doubling down on a deeply flawed regulatory and enforcement approach,' the company's lawyers wrote, according to copy of the rebuttal reviewed by the Journal.Since that time, the two sides have continued to negotiate, with Kik basically now admitting it wants a judge to weigh in because it can't get the SEC to see things its way. It has announced that it has set aside $5 million to go to court[6] with the SEC over this matter (and is asking for further donations).Despite the fact that last month over 300,000 people earned and spent Kin as a currency, the SEC is still saying that it might be a security. After months of trying to find a reasonable solution, Kin has been unable to reach a settlement that wouldn't severely impact the Kin project and everyone in the space. So Kin is going to take on the SEC in court to make sure there is a foundation for innovation going forward.As the company notes, the current ambiguity is acting as a real \"innovation tax\" in the space. Many companies are refusing to experiment with these kinds of offerings, or even to work with existing tokens, out of fear of how an SEC might completely upend the space with a decision one way or the other. Indeed, in a recent talk by SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (who is supportive of more experimentation with crypto), she very clearly worries about how ambiguities[7] in the way the SEC has acted over the last couple of years will stifle innovation. The speech notes that the SEC has mostly avoided heavy handed regulation in the space, but that it has not done much to help actually clarify the rules.The SEC staff recently issued a framework to assist issuers with conducting a Howey analysis of potential token offerings. The document is a thorough 14 pages. It points to features of an offering and actions by an issuer that could signal that the offering is likely a securities offering. If this framework helps issuers understand what the different Howey factors might look like in an ICO context, it may be valuable. I am concerned, however, that it could raise more questions and concerns than it answers. While Howey has four factors to consider, the framework lists 38 separate considerations, many of which include several sub-points. A seasoned securities lawyer might be able to infer which of these considerations will likely be controlling and might therefore be able to provide the appropriate weight to each. Whether the framework gives anything new to the seasoned securities lawyer used to operating in the facts and circumstances world of Howey is an open question. I worry that non-lawyers and lawyers not steeped in securities law and its attendant lore will not know what to make of the guidance. Pages worth of factors, many of which seemingly apply to all decentralized networks, might contribute to the feeling that navigating the securities laws in this area is perilous business. Rather than sorting through the factors or hiring an expensive lawyer to do so, a wary company may reasonably decide to forgo certain opportunities or to pursue them in a more crypto-friendly jurisdiction overseas. On the same day the Corporation Finance staff issued the Framework, the staff also issued the first token no-action letter in response to an inquiry from TurnKey Jet, a charter jet company. The company intended to effectively tokenize gift cards. Customer members could purchase tokens that would be redeemable, dollar for dollar, for charter jet services. The tokens could be sold only to other members. This transaction is so clearly not an offer of securities that I worry the staff's issuance of a digital token no-action letter\u2014the first and so far only such letter\u2014may in fact have the effect of broadening the perceived reach of our securities laws. If these tokens were securities, it would be hard to distinguish them from any medium of stored value. Is a Starbucks card a security? If we are going that far, I can only imagine what name the barista will write on my coffee cup. And yet, the staff's letter did not stop at merely stating that the token offering would not qualify as a securities offering, but highlighted specific but non-dispositive factors. In other words, the letter effectively imposed conditions on a non-security. For example, the staff's response prohibits the company from repurchasing the tokens unless it does so at a discount. Further, as I mentioned earlier, the incoming letter precluded a secondary market that includes non-members. Does that mean that a company that chooses to offer to repurchase gift cards at a premium or that allows gift card purchasers to sell or give them to third parties needs to call its securities lawyer to start the registration process?As Peirce notes, there are still so many hugely open questions, and the potential liability for getting any of these wrong is clearly holding back many possible innovations that could be quite important to a more distributed, more open, internet. After listing out a bunch of unanswered questions, she notes:On these points, the SEC has been nearly silent. This silence may ultimately be deadly. An issuer can conduct a private securities offering with no SEC involvement. The rules that distinguish a private from a public offering focus on the offerees and investors. The form that the security is in\u2014whether shares of common stock or interests in orange groves\u2014has no bearing on how the rules operate. The rules that govern broker-dealers, investment advisers, auditors, and trading platforms are different. They govern the ownership, storage, and exchange of securities\u2014exactly the aspects of digital assets that the crypto industry seeks to transform. A broker or adviser cannot custody an asset if it does not know how to show it has possession and control of the asset. An auditor must be able to review and verify the actual transactions. Additionally, while issuers that rely on the private offering exemption do not need SEC permission to issue securities, a platform cannot trade securities unless it is registered with the SEC as an exchange or an alternative trading system. A broker-dealer generally must register with the SEC and FINRA. The SEC has yet to provide guidance to the public or FINRA on any of the core questions. The result is that many would-be brokers and trading platforms are stuck in a frustrating waiting mode; they are unable to get clear answers to questions about how they may proceed in this market.This is why Kik/Kin going to court to force the SEC to make some decisions is so important here. Venture capitalist Fred Wilson put up a blog post explaining[8] why:Sadly, the SEC looks at crypto tokens and sees securities that they want to regulate as such. They cannot seem to understand that not all of these assets are securities, they cannot seem to understand that most are commodities, currencies, or utilities like frequent flyer miles. They cannot understand that crypto tokens are unlike any assets that have come before them and that crypto tokens need new regulatory structures. They cannot understand that their unwillingness to come up with new rules paired with their 'regulate by enforcement' strategy is hurting the crypto sector, pushing it offshore, and is causing most of the new projects to raise capital outside of the US and/or put together legal structures that look like Frankenstein monsters.None of this is an attempt to argue that there shouldn't be any oversight over cryptocurrencies. Clearly, and obviously, there have been many that are little more than ponzi schemes and get rich quick cons. The entire space will benefit from some clear rules that enable greater experimentation with things like helping to fund protocols via such tokenization -- but the SEC's overall approach to date has been one where it seems on the one hand to be afraid to do anything at all other than make scary noises and threats, and on the other to be hinting that any new cryptocurrency offering should have to go through an FDA-like approval process before it might hit the market. This is an untenable position. I have my doubts as to whether the Kik/Kin approach to cryptocurrency will itself work. But its legal fight is an important one, if you'd like to see a better decentralized internet. Dealing with scams is one thing, but if every new platform startup needs to go through the regulatory rigmarole as if it were a company preparing to go public, that would be a massive chill on innovation and experimentation.

Last week, a San Francisco IT software development company, Practice Fusion, Inc., entered into a $145 million deferred prosecution agreement with DOJ, admitting to soliciting and receiving kickbacks in exchange for designing software and clinical decision support (#8216;CDS#8217;) alerts that influenced physicians' decisions to prescribe opioid pain medications.2 A day later, the DOJ announced a #8216;potentially major escalation#8217; of its formal tech probe that could expand into issues concerning privacy and public safety by seeking #8216;an open-ended number#8217; of trial attorneys, 10 paralegals, and five statisticians in its San Francisco and D.C. offices.3 These alerts signal that the healthcare technology industry will be under the microscope for a while.Practice Fusion admitted to violating the Anti-Kickback Statute, 42 U.S.C.  1320a-7b(b)(1), which specifically prohibits referral payments in the context of federal health care programs, as well as conspiring to defraud the government under 18 U.S.C.  371, both in connection with its scheme to receive payments from opioid companies in exchange for the pop-up CDS recommendations.4 The pharmaceutical companies, which were not named in the DPA, were invited to participate in Practice Fusion's software design process, and gave input with respect to timing CDS alerts, setting alert guidelines and criteria, and drafting alert language. </p><p>The goal of the alert system was to increase extended-release opioid sales (paid for in part by federal health care programs) by influencing doctors' decisions at the point of patient diagnosis and treatment determinations. Practice Fusion received nearly $1 million in payments from the pharmaceutical companies, which were characterized as #8216;kickbacks#8217; in the DPA.5Practice Fusion has agreed to pay a criminal fine of $25.4 million and to forfeit $959,700 of criminal proceeds, the largest criminal fine in the history of the Vermont district where the DPA was filed.6 As part of its cooperation and in order to #8216;ensure transparency and public awareness,#8217; Practice Fusion will publicize internal documents evidencing its unlawful conduct, enlist an independent oversight organization to review and approve CDS alerts, and design and implement a comprehensive compliance program.7Also disclosed in the DPA is a settlement of $118.7 million that Practice Fusion will pay in a separate civil settlement agreement for alleged False Claims violations.8 The civil settlement resolves allegations of 13 CDS-based kickback schemes with other pharmaceutical companies, allegations involving fraudulent certification and misrepresentation of software capability relating to patients' access to data, and allegations of knowingly causing healthcare providers to fraudulently obtain incentive payments from Medicare and Medicaid.9In cracking Practice Fusion's software-based fraud, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Vermont called this an example of #8216;pioneering healthcare fraud enforcement.#8217;10 Similar investigations are likely to follow. DOJ is actively recruiting statisticians, paralegals, and trial attorneys for its digital markets team, which was likely responsible for the Practice Fusion investigation.11 Several job postings have opened on the DOJ's online employment platform,12 and at a recent Federal Bar Association event in San Francisco, Manish Kumar, Chief of San Francisco's DOJ Antitrust Division, made a hiring pitch for individuals to join the public procurement strike force, data analytics development efforts, and digital markets team.13 The volume and breadth of help wanted suggests an imminent enforcement boom.In the wake of the Practice Fusion settlement, Shimon Richmond, Assistant Inspector General for Investigations of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, remarked, #8216;As new technologies continue to develop and evolve, so too do new and innovative fraud schemeswe will continue to be vigilant in detecting and investigating these schemes in order to protect the safety of patients in federal health programs and to ensure the appropriate use of electronic health records in providing their care.#8217;14In addition to fraud and false claims issues, evolving privacy laws will impact enforcement of healthcare digital markets. Health information research #8216;often focuses on whether treatments, health technologies or changes in personal behaviors are successful over time#8217; and data analysis in this realm is key to improving health care and reducing health care costs.15 Patient databases, like the one at issue in the Practice Fusion case, rely on aggregating patient data that is at the center of privacy regulation. Thus, as health information researchers grapple with obtaining #8216;deidentified data#8217; under increasingly stringent state privacy laws, like the California Consumer Privacy Act (#8216;CCPA#8217;), and overarching federal privacy laws stemming from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (#8216;HIPAA#8217;), health technology companies could be faced with less information about patient needs. Not to mention, Roger Severino, HIPAA enforcement lead and director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, commented in an interview that cybersecurity protections and proper controls on access to patient records are among the #8216;low hanging fruit#8217; that underscore the need for increased HIPAA enforcement.16 Hackers #8216;have lucrative reasons to target heath care companies, which often store #8216;incredibly valuable' personal information.#8217;17With Uncle Sam's increasing number of eyes on the industry, and, given the myriad ways healthcare technology companies could run afoul of government regulations, companies need to ensure their software systems, business models, and compliance programs are keeping up with the evolving regulatory landscape.1 Dep't of Justice, Press Release, Justice Department Reviewing the Practices of Market-Leading Online Platforms (July 23, 2019), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-reviewing-practices-market-leading-online-platforms\">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-reviewing-practices-market-leading-online-platforms</url>[1]2 Dep't of Justice, Press Release, Electronic Health Records Vendor to Pay $145 Million to Resolve Criminal and Civil Investigations (January 27, 2020),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/electronic-health-records-vendor-pay-145-million-resolve-criminal-and-civil-investigations-0\">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/electronic-health-records-vendor-pay-145-million-resolve-criminal-and-civil-investigations-0</url>[2]3 Bryan Koenig, Help Wanted: DOJ Seeks Attys, Paralegals For Tech Probe, Law360 (January 28, 2020),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.law360.com/compliance/articles/1237812/help-wanted-doj-seeks-attys-paralegals-for-tech-probe?nl_pk=856499e0-f6c2-4c80-b2fe-f979477e8257&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=compliance&amp;read_more=1\">https://www.law360.com/compliance/articles/1237812/help-wanted-doj-seeks-attys-paralegals-for-tech-probe?nl_pk=856499e0-f6c2-4c80-b2fe-f979477e8257&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=compliance&amp;read_more=1</url>[3]4 Deferred Prosecution Agreement, United States v.

This is particularly true in India where public and private institutions have historically struggled to reach the last mile. Start-ups are working towards bridging the gap. Access to high-quality data is enabling them to provide micro-credit to the under-banked, ed-tech solutions to students in the smallest towns, and cheaper forms of medical diagnostics to the most vulnerable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is in this context that India's draft Personal Data Protection Bill should be seen. The Bill is meant to protect Indians' rights over their data, and envisions a Data Protection Authority (DPA) that will enforce good data practices by public and private institutions. This is a timely and welcome move, since it will help minimise data-based harm to Indians.</p><p>However, India has also set itself a goal of a $1-trillion digital economy. This ambitious target will require it to develop a thriving start-up ecosystem. It is therefore important that the privacy bill does not lead to an uneven playing field for them. This is not an unfounded risk, as evidence from other countries shows.</p><p>We know that in Europe, smaller AdTech firms lost market share to \"big tech\" players like Google and Facebook after Europe adopted \"General Data Protection Regulation\" - its privacy law - in 2018. This could be driven by many factors, including big tech's ability to devote more resources to compliance and reduce data access for smaller firms. Investors have responded to these market signals as well. Researchers from the University of Maryland have shown that venture funding into early-stage technology firms in Europe declined 18 per cent by volume and 40 per cent by value after enforcement of GDPR.</p><p>Therefore, India's privacy law should not disproportionately increase the cost of business for start-ups vis-a-vis big tech and other large incumbents. We have four suggestions on how this level playing field can be achieved.</p><p>To start with, the DPA could consider the differential impact on small businesses while formulating regulations under the law. This can be achieved by amending Section 94(1) of the Bill to require that the DPA conduct cost-benefit analysis while making rules, and explicitly consider the impact on small businesses, among other factors. The cost-benefit analysis should be put in the public domain as is mandated in other countries.</p><p>Second, the penalties under law should be revisited. The draft Bill provides for fines of up to 4 per cent of global revenues of a business. Smaller, newer digital businesses are likely to have lower profit margins and perhaps even losses. Fines based only on revenue will affect them disproportionately. This can be mitigated by specifying that the DPA also consider profits or profit margins while imposing fines.</p><p>Third, long legal battles are disproportionately expensive for small businesses. They might also hesitate to go to court against a DPA order for fear of retribution. One way to alleviate these concerns would be to ring-fence the judicial or adjudicatory functions in a separate body rather than having it housed within the DPA, as envisaged in the current draft. The Supreme Court also recommended such a separation in its observations on the case pertaining to the Competition Commission.</p><p>Finally, this is an evolving space where many issues are simply unknown. The DPA would, therefore, benefit from listening to all stakeholders, including start-ups. One way to do this is through board representation. Currently, the board of the DPA consists of five of its senior employees. The board will be more effective if most of its members are independent, and represent civil society, academia, and small businesses.</p><p>Another way to do so is through processes that prioritise consultation, transparency, and predictability. South Korea, for example, has sought to achieve it by mandating a publicly-released impact assessment before any regulation is passed. Indian regulators like TRAI also have a track record of a reasonably robust consultation process.</p><p>Data protection regulation is at a nascent stage around the world. Just as India is seen as a global leader in the design of its \"digital infrastructure\", it has an opportunity to be a global leader in data protection, especially for developing countries facing similar challenges and opportunities. To make this happen, the DPA must prove itself able to safeguard the consumer while also creating space for Start Up India to thrive.</p><p>The writers work at Omidyar Network India, an investment firm</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDEXP-0052201728</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDEXP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YDM-SD11-JB5M-W0FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">364854</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"778\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Indian Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 13, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Depending on whom you ask, it's either a magical world where tedious workday tasks are automated and phones serve up recommendations and information unasked, or it's a terrifying surveillance-state dystopia in which machine learning is deepening inequality, robots are coming to take all the jobs, and privacy and human dignity are things of the past.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Which will it be? In this feature, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PW</emphasis> looks at books that explore the intersection of business, money, and The Future, underscoring the excitement and unease of a fast-changing world.</p><p>The First Law of Robotics</p><p>Excitement and fear vie for the upper hand in discussions about the rise of artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, and algorithms. Some see a rosy future when workers are freed from the tedium of repetitive tasks to focus on creative work; others warn of the day when we'll all feel an articulated metal hand on our shoulder and turn to see the robot that's replacing us.</p><p>Those who aren't even sure what AI stands for will find an accessible primer in Janelle Shane's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">You Look Like a Thing and I Love You </emphasis>(Little, Brown, Nov.). Illustrated with charming cartoons, oddball case studies (self-driving cars in Australia were confused by kangaroos), and wry observations about the often-hilarious failures of artificial intelligences to comprehend human contexts-the title is the result of an AI attempting to generate a successful pickup line-this is \"a skeptic's manual to evaluate AI for yourself,\" says Little, Brown associate editor Nicky Guerreiro, and \"a book that makes you sound smart at a party.\"</p><p>Several authors are urging a cool head, even while presenting views of the future that many will find both shiny and scary. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The AI Advantage</emphasis> (MIT, Oct.), Thomas H. Davenport, IT and management professor at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., proposes that the true potential of AI lies in basic forms of automation, such as chatbots. He urges business leaders to calm the conversation and to focus on reviewing technological innovation through a strategic lens: what can it do for me now, today? \"It's not all about the corporate singularity,\" says Paul Michelman, series editor for MIT Press's Management on the Cutting Edge titles. \"AI is just the next stage in data analytics.\"</p><p>Computer scientist Melanie Mitchell makes a similar case for sobriety from the coding front lines in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans </emphasis>(FSG, Oct.). She aims to provide an antidote to the \"popular schizophrenic relationship to the subject-people tend to be either apocalyptic or triumphalist,\" says FSG editor-in-chief Eric Chinski. Writing from the tech perspective, and speaking with some of the scientists who are knee-deep in this work, Mitchell calls for an examination of ethical issues around AI, such as the expectation of privacy in a world where facial recognition technology is ubiquitous and the morality of allowing drones to make autonomous decisions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Miami Herald</emphasis> reporter Andr\u00e9s Oppenheimer takes a less prescriptive approach in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Robots Are Coming! </emphasis>(Vintage, May), originally published for the Spanish-language market and translated by Ezra E. Fitz. This international view of AI in action follows the author around the world to places where robots are already at work, from a Japanese automated hotel to a high-tech California farm to Oxford University, where scientists are studying the future of robotics. \"Oppenheimer doesn't take a position with the techno-optimists or the techno-pessimists,\" says Vintage Espa\u00f1ol publishing director Crist\u00f3bal Pera. \"This is a field guide on how to navigate the future.\"</p><p>Notably, each of these authors drives home the point that AI is neither as advanced nor as omnipotent as common wisdom would have it, and that panic may be premature when talking about a technology that can't distinguish a pedestrian from a kangaroo.</p><p>In its most quotidian applications, such as personal banking, AI and automation can be a time and stress saver, according to Alexa von Tobel, founder and managing partner of Inspired Capital and former CEO of LearnVest, who tackles automation and personal finance in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Financially Forward</emphasis> (Currency, May). Her first book, 2014's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Financially Fearless</emphasis>, called for a structured, set-it-and-forget-it approach to saving; the new title helps readers capitalize on digital automation and select a single app to more efficiently manage their money.</p><p>\"It's amazing how much effort and investment in the business world is going into this, and how many entrepreneurs and big companies are getting into this game,\" says Currency executive editor Talia Krohn. \"They're banking on the assumption that people aren't going to be freaked out by the idea that fingerprints are passwords and their banks are on their phones.\" Von Tobel narrows down the options for digital non-natives and others who want simple, safe solutions for money management.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">B</emphasis> Is for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bitcoin</emphasis></p><p>A number of new releases address the ways in which cryptocurrency is changing finance and urge readers to look beyond their own wallets. These books provide plenty of fodder for the argument that, though the much-hyped bitcoin is little more than a flash in the pan, the impact of blockchain-the peer-to-peer ledger system that bitcoin uses-is here to stay.</p><p>In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Blockchain for Everyone </emphasis>(Gallery, Aug.), John Hargrave, CEO of blockchain content platform Media Shower, offers a guide to investing in blockchain assets. \"Hargrave persuaded me that blockchain technology could be as paradigm shifting as the internet proved to be,\" says Jeremie Ruby-Strauss, executive editor at Gallery. \"I was surprised to learn that cryptocurrency might prove, eventually, to be the first but ultimately least impactful of blockchain's applications.\"</p><p>This is because a \"totally decentralized market\" is on its way, says Mike Henton, who edited Thomas J. Anderson's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Money Without Boundaries </emphasis>(Wiley, Aug.). \"Now that the dust of the bitcoin craze is settling, we're thinking about the behind-the-scenes implications of blockchain.\"</p><p>Readers looking for an insider view of some key players in cryptocurrency will find it in Ben Mezrich's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bitcoin Billionaires</emphasis> (Flatiron, May). It follows the story of the Winklevoss twins, who famously got shut out of the Facebook fortune-as detailed in Mezrich's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Accidental Billionaires</emphasis>, which was the basis of the 2010 movie <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Social Network</emphasis>. Left scrambling, they became early investors in bitcoin and later, Mezrich writes, were its first billionaires. \"People remain fascinated by the enigma of Facebook,\" says Flatiron editorial director Noah Eaker. \"But when the Winklevosses were on the losing end of their fight with Zuckerberg, they had to hustle. They took risks others didn't. And they got rich.\"</p><p>The Puppeteers</p><p>Silicon Valley risk takers such as the Winklevosses figure into several forthcoming titles, including <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Code</emphasis> (Penguin Press, July), which <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PW</emphasis>'s starred review called \"a must-read for anyone interested in how a one-horse town birthed a revolution that has shifted the course of modern civilization.\" Historian Margaret O'Mara tracks the evolution of the epicenter of American tech innovation through portrayals of the people who created and grew it, lending a human frame to a business that often seems monolithic and faceless.</p><p>\"Adult supervision seems sorely lacking these days,\" says Penguin Press v-p and publisher Scott Moyers. Books such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Code</emphasis>, he says, \"assure readers that there are wise people at the helm whom they can trust.\" Moyers also acquired the recently released <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Coders</emphasis>, in which <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wired </emphasis>columnist Clive Thompson delves into the competencies and blind spots of the programmers who are sitting in cubicle mazes right now. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">PW</emphasis>'s starred review said the book \"shines a much-needed light on a group of people who have exerted a powerful effect on almost every aspect of the modern world.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Financial Times</emphasis> columnist Rana Foroohar, author of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Don't Be Evil: How Big Tech Betrayed Its Founding Principles-and All of Us</emphasis> (Currency, Nov.), is more blunt: \"Evil was baked into Google's business plan,\" she says. \"Larry Page and Sergey Brin saw the potential for surveillance capitalism in their first paper; titans of big tech have since not wanted to talk about the dark side of their inventions.\" (For more from Foroohar, see \"Defanging the Corporate Beast.\")</p><p>Foroohar calls for voters to force politicians to take a good hard look at how digital wealth should be distributed and what regulations should be put on these companies-a question also posed by Microsoft president Brad Smith in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tools and Weapons</emphasis> (Penguin Press, Sept.), coauthored by the company's communications director, Carol Ann Browne. They assert that large tech corporations should be more open to government intervention and need to embrace regulation before they're forced into it.</p><p>\"These are important communities that are monocultures, which have a fantasy that they're a ruthless meritocracy,\" Moyers notes. By examining their influence, Smith, Browne, and other authors have tapped into the public's desire for transparency about business practices and for privacy protections, and its fascination with the people-with their all-too-human foibles and biases-who have the power to make it happen.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Liz Scheier is a writer, editor, and product developer living in Washington, D.C.</emphasis></p><p>Below, more on the subject of business and personal finance books.</p><p>Fight the Power: Business and Personal Finance Books 2019<br/>    These titles propose ways to amplify marginalized voices in the workplace, at client meetings, and with investor dollars.</p><p>Defanging the Corporate Beast: PW talks with Rana Foroohar<br/>    Sparked by her child's $900 worth of in-app purchases in a month, Foroohar's 'Don't Be Evil' (Currency, Nov.) delves into how big tech captures and monetizes personal data.</p><p>Deus Ex Machina: PW talks with David Weinberger<br/>    In 'Everyday Chaos' (Harvard Business Review, May), Weinberger explores modern technology's implications for the business world and the ways in which humans and machines, sometimes uneasily, coexist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PUBWKY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PUBWKY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W1V-RF91-JB5T-5009-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404869</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1686\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 PWxyz, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Publisher's Weekly</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5977\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 266</volume><issueNumber>No. 18</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 3, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp;
