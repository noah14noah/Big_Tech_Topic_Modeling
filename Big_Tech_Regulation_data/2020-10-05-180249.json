Indications from the US<br/> Federal Reserve (Fed) of a softening of stance on monetary policy<br/> normalisation, together with some modest Chinese fiscal stimulus, helped to<br/> underpin sentiment further. Overall, global equity markets ended the first<br/> quarter of 2019 in positive territory amid hopes for progress in US-China trade<br/> talks and optimism that the Fed would remain less aggressive in raising<br/> interest rates. With the US equity market being the strongest performer, global<br/> stocks saw their largest quarterly gains since 2010.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global equity markets remained in positive territory in April, driven by strong<br/> performance from US stocks in particular. The US equity market reached fresh<br/> record highs on the back of better than forecast company earnings. Sentiment<br/> was also boosted by stronger than expected US economic growth for the first<br/> three months of 2019. However, in a reversal of fortune, global equity markets<br/> had their worst month of the year in May as escalating trade tensions once<br/> again left market participants assessing the implications for slower economic<br/> growth. China hit back at Washington with its own retaliatory tariffs. The<br/> escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies drew<br/> investors back to so-called 'safe-haven' assets. Market sentiment soured<br/> further as Donald Trump threatened higher tariffs on Mexican goods.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Portfolio Strategy and Review</p><p>On a total return basis, the Portfolio's net asset value fell by 1.3% over the<br/> 12 months to the end of May 2019, compared to a rise of 5.3% in the MSCI World<br/> Index (in sterling terms, total return, net of withholding tax).</p><p>The Portfolio's disappointing performance against its reference index over the<br/> year was largely due to its underweight exposure to the US (the US equity<br/> market was by far the strongest performer of all the major regions) and its<br/> overweight exposure to the UK and Europe (relatively weak markets versus the<br/> reference index). Our underweight exposure to the US has been longstanding due<br/> in large part to the relatively high valuations we see across a range of<br/> sectors and the low level of dividends available in that region.</p><p>We acknowledge the underperformance of the portfolio in recent years and it is<br/> of deep concern to us in the portfolio management team. We constantly review<br/> and reappraise our approach in view of market conditions and ongoing news<br/> relating to stocks within the portfolio. Prolonged periods in which a valuation<br/> driven approach underperforms is not unknown - the last prolonged period was<br/> from 1998 to 2000. In addition we note that competitors with similar income<br/> objectives have also struggled to perform. We continue to believe our focus on<br/> corporate valuations and free cashflow will deliver outperformance across a<br/> full economic and stock market cycle.</p><p>At the sector level, global equity market leadership has been dominated by a<br/> narrow range of growth orientated stocks concentrated in US 'Big tech'<br/> companies and the Portfolio's lack of exposure to the so-called FAANG stocks<br/> (Facebook, Amazon, APPLE, Netflix, and Alphabet (Google)) detracted from<br/> returns. However, these companies appear expensive to us on many metrics and<br/> they offer zero income, hence the Portfolio's underweight exposure versus the<br/> reference index. Furthermore, we see very strong valuation upside in the<br/> financial sector, in the last few years our holdings have underperformed, with<br/> European financials particularly weak. This is the result of slower than<br/> expected monetary policy normalisation, together with renewed political<br/> instability in Italy and, in our view, excessive regulation. However, we would<br/> highlight the outstanding valuations we see in this sector and significant<br/> dividend yields. Many well capitalised banks are trading at a significant<br/> discount to book value. Whist we believe this to be an anomaly, our<br/> overexposure to the banking sector was a material drag on performance versus<br/> the benchmark in the year.</p><p>Furthermore, our industrials and semiconductor holdings such as Taiwan<br/> Semiconductor Manufacturing and Broadcom have come under pressure more recently<br/> as trade tensions flared between the US and China. Markets have digested the<br/> implications of new US export restrictions placed on Chinese telecom firm<br/>Huawei and many US semiconductor companies, which are heavily exposed to China,<br/> have seen their share prices fall as a result of the ongoing trade dispute. We<br/> remain confident these businesses offer attractive upside and are clear market<br/> leaders in their respective areas of the market.</p><p>The consumer staples sector generally performed well through the year as it<br/> benefitted from its status as a safe haven on the assumption that company<br/> earnings will be sheltered from the economic fallout of the trade war. However,<br/> our underweight exposure, together with negative share price performance from<br/> our holding in the tobacco sector, had a negative impact on relative returns.<br/> We have been longstanding holders of British American Tobacco and continue to<br/> like its strong cash generation and attractive dividend yield. The shares<br/> reacted badly to comments from the US Federal Drug Administration restricting<br/> sales of certain tobacco products, exacerbated by strong competition in the new<br/> 'lower risk' non-combustible products. We believe the market has overreacted<br/> and the company offers solid long term returns.</p><p>Our large energy exposure also detracted from returns and the decline in the<br/> price of oil was a significant factor. The price of oil peaked in October at<br/> around US$85 and then started its rather rapid decline in November, ending that<br/> month down over 20%. The weakness was driven by concerns over the demand risk<br/> outlook as global growth concerns increased. Furthermore, investors fretted<br/> over increases in supply as shale oil production in the US continues to grow<br/> rapidly, and OPEC seems unwilling to cut production further, which had a<br/> negative impact on a number of the energy stocks held within the Portfolio. Our<br/> bullishness on the sector, however, is not around the oil price being extremely<br/> strong, but rather on operating cost reductions and cuts to capital<br/> expenditure, which we believe is leading to extremely strong cash generation<br/> and will enable both rising dividends and some share buybacks over the coming<br/> three years.</p><p>Health care delivered positive performance for the Portfolio over the 12 months<br/> as markets became more defensively positioned, particularly in the fourth<br/> quarter of 2018. The share prices of Pfizer, Novartis and Roche all benefited<br/> as a result.</p><p>Portfolio Changes</p><p>Over the period new positions were established in Rolls-Royce, Carrefour, CRH,<br/> Samsung Electronics, Verizon Communications and Sanofi.</p><p>In our view Rolls-Royce is set to become a highly cash generative business and<br/> it has a good self-help story arising from increased operating efficiencies and<br/> new engine rollouts. The industry is highly regulated, with cutting-edge<br/> engineering giving them strong barriers to entry and has meant they have gained<br/> market share in respect of wide bodied jets. Increased flight hours per engine<br/> also makes the maintenance and spares business increasingly profitable.</p><p>Carrefour is a well-known food retailer in France. We believe that it has a<br/> strong balance sheet and an impressive new management team, who we feel will be<br/> able to bring about change and improve margins in what remains a strong<br/> franchise.</p><p>CRH supplies a broad range of products to the construction industry. It<br/> currently generates lower margins than its peers and is more lowly valued.<br/> However, it has a clear roadmap to improve margins and a management team we<br/> believe to be focussed on returns and capable of delivering on targets. The<br/> business has significant US exposure and thus should benefit from any pick up<br/> in US infrastructure spending.</p><p>Samsung Electronics has an improving corporate governance record which is<br/> important to us. The biggest improvement has been to its shareholder returns<br/> policy. Its stated policy is to improve dividend payout, and to pay out 50% of<br/> free cash flow to shareholders in either buybacks or dividends. It is<br/> attractively valued in our opinion, with a very robust balance sheet.</p><p>Verizon Communications, the US telecoms company, is likely to see growth in its<br/> mobile telecommunications business over the coming years, in our view. The<br/> competitive dynamics in the wireless industry are improving in the US, which<br/> sets the stage for more consistent growth and returns for Verizon in the<br/> near-to-medium term. Verizon offers a dividend yield in excess of 4%, while in<br/> our view the improving company fundamentals should be positive for shareholders<br/> over the next several years.</p><p>Finally, we initiated a new holding in Sanofi, the French multinational<br/> pharmaceutical company, because we believe it looks cheap relative to the rest<br/> of the sector. It appears that no value has been attributed to the new product<br/> pipeline and existing products are being valued at a discount to peers. The<br/> discount to the sector has in large part been due to a perceived weak<br/> management team and disappointing cost management. This we believe is now<br/> changing, with a new management team who we think can unlock the value in this<br/> business. The company has no significant patent expiry issues until 2028. We<br/> see it as a defensive stock offering predictable earnings growth at a<br/> discounted valuation.</p><p>We sold out of three positions (Union Pacific, Hiscox and China Mobile) after<br/> strong share price performance. We also exited our position in Airbus as we<br/> felt the share price had reached a level that reflected the positive outlook<br/> for the company. Lastly, we disposed of Nielsen. The company reported a<br/> surprisingly weak set of results and delivered a very negative outlook. This<br/> would not necessarily have prompted a sale of the position, but the lack of a<br/> credible strategy to improve and signs of structural shifts in one of its key<br/> businesses as well as the departure of members of senior management led us to</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NELECT-5737850874RN</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NELECT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPK-H6Y1-F0CC-S40P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1667\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 London Stock Exchange All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>London Stock Exchange Aggregated Regulatory News Service (ARNS)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"44026\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 31, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

When stocks are priced for perfection, any negative surprise could have significant implications.\u2019</p><p>Although valuations have come off slightly in recent months, Hall said\u00a0this represented just a \u2018small blip\u2019 and he worries that the current valuations \u2018offer investors little protection in the event life gets more difficult for these businesses\u2019.</p><p>Challenges include the prospect of tighter regulations for the technology sector following the Facebook data scandal, while efforts to squeeze more tax could also weigh, he said.</p><p>\u2018The market has tended to de-rate businesses when the regulatory outlook is uncertain.</p><p>\u2018The industry currently pays very low tax, something that governments look increasingly motivated to resolve,' he added.</p><p>\u2018Perhaps more fundamental is the risk that consumer vote with their feet.\u2019</p><p>Should the sector be subjected to a more sustained sell-off, Hall would likely be among those queueing up to buy shares, having held nearly 20% of his fund in the sector amid lower valuations around four years ago.</p><p>\u2018It might be that uncertainty relating to the outlook for the big tech companies gives us an opportunity to buy them once again,\u2019 he said. \u2018For now we see better uses for our clients\u2019 capital elsewhere.\u2019</p><p>Over five years, performance of the fund is solid, with returns of 84.7% beating the Investment Association Global sector average of 61.4%.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYWR-a1114359</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYWR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S6C-RJW1-F0HT-S4BC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">277874</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"343\"/><timeReceived>1:05 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Citywire Financial Publishers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Citywire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 27, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001YM8</classCode><className>INVESCO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>IVZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001561</classCode><className>SHAREHOLDERS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI2QjYxNjkwMTkzNDhFRUExNjlFRjVFRUU3NDhBQkE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDQ3M0RFODczN0I4NDg2RjlFRDNFMUNBODRDQTU0Q0E</classCode><className>Shareholders</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DEFE</classCode><className>INDUSTRY SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000165</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE ASSOCIATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000165</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE ASSOCIATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

The lawmakers are seeking a detailed and broad range of documents related to the companies\u2019 sprawling operations, including top executives\u2019 internal communications.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The move comes as scrutiny of the big tech companies deepens and widens across the federal government and U.S. states and abroad. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are conducting competition investigations of the companies, and state attorneys general from both major political parties have opened antitrust investigations of Google and Facebook. The probe of Google has drawn participation by 50 states and territories.</p><p> \u201cWe have to act if we see that they\u2019re breaking the law,\u201d Rohit Chopra, one of the FTC commissioners, said Friday in an interview on CNBC. Chopra, a Democrat, wouldn\u2019t confirm specifically names of companies that could be under investigation, but he said the agency is consulting closely with the Justice Department and the state attorneys general as their work proceeds.</p><p> Also Friday, the European Union\u2019s powerful competition chief indicated that she\u2019s looking at expanding regulations on personal data, dropping an initial hint about how she plans to use new powers against tech companies. Margrethe Vestager said that while Europeans have control over their own data through the EU\u2019s world-leading data privacy rules, they don\u2019t address problems stemming from the way companies use other people\u2019s data \u201cto draw conclusions about me or to undermine democracy.\u201d</p><p> The bipartisan accord marking the Judiciary antitrust inquiry contrasts with the bitter divide in the panel over the issue of impeachment of President Donald Trump. Republicans denounced the committee Democrats\u2019 approval Thursday of ground rules for hearings, which set the stage to launch an impeachment investigation.</p><p> \u201cDemocrats followed the yellow brick road, and now they\u2019re fully lost in Impeachment Oz,\u201d said Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the committee\u2019s senior Republican.</p><p> The lawmakers set an Oct. 14 deadline for the tech companies to provide the documents.</p><p> Spokesmen for Facebook, Apple and Amazon didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment Friday. Google referred to a recent blog post by its senior vice president for global affairs, Kent Walker, saying the company is anticipating additional questions from investigations and that \u201cWe have always worked constructively with regulators and we will continue to do so.\u201d</p><p> The companies have said they\u2019ll cooperate fully with the congressional investigation.</p><p> Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said the documents will help the committee understand \u201cwhether they are using their market power in ways that have harmed consumers and competition and how Congress should respond.\u201d</p><p> The letters went to the four companies\u2019 CEOs: Larry Page of Google\u2019s parent company Alphabet Inc.; Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook; Jeff Bezos of Amazon; and Tim Cook of Apple. They were signed by Nadler and Collins; Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., who heads the antitrust subcommittee leading the investigation; and Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the subcommittee\u2019s senior Republican.</p><p> Cicilline has said Congress and antitrust regulators wrongly allowed the big tech companies to regulate themselves, enabling them to operate out of control, dominating the internet and choking off online innovation and entrepreneurship. He has suggested legislative changes may be needed, though he has called breaking up the companies a last resort.</p><p> At a hearing of the antitrust panel in July, executives of the four companies pushed back against lawmakers\u2019 accusations that they operate as monopolies, laying out ways in which they say they compete fairly yet vigorously against rivals in the marketplace.</p><p> Cicilline said he was dissatisfied with the answers the executives gave to lawmakers\u2019 questions, calling their testimony \u201cevasive.\u201d</p><p> The letter to Facebook requests a breakdown of company profits since 2016 on its top products \u2014 including Facebook Ads, Instagram and WhatsApp. It also seeks communications from Zuckerberg and other top executives related to a California court case in which plaintiffs accuse the company of deceptively crushing thousands of apps in 2015 whose businesses had relied on their platform. Among other internal communications the letter seeks are those related to six messaging, video- and photo-sharing apps in particular that Facebook cut off.</p><p> The lawmakers are seeking Facebook executives\u2019 emails on the decision to deny any specific apps or categories of apps access to Facebook data about or shared by users. This is a concern because critics say the company intentionally walled itself off from other online apps, enabling it to amass nearly 2.5 billion users with no clear competitor.</p><p> The letter to Alphabet seeks detailed financial information and names of leading competitors for Google\u2019s vast operations, including search, video service YouTube, the Android cellphone operating system and Gmail. Internal communications the lawmakers are seeking include those related to Google\u2019s 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick \u2014 which critics often point to as pivotal to Google\u2019s advertising dominance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONTCH-4434080</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E0FF8CAB62B7C MONTCH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X21-W841-JBCN-40B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313959</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"939\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Monterey County Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Monterey County Herald (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 14, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Article</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Trump administration - through both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) - has launched its own probes of the tech industry, while Congress is scrutinizing a wide array of Silicon Valley practices through parallel inquiries in the House of Representatives and the Senate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Analysts say the sheer number of investigations into a single industry by so many government levels, departments and agencies is unprecedented, making it highly likely the tech industry will eventually face some kind of regulatory action.</p><p>\"The more of them that pile on, the more you might think these companies cannot get out unscathed,\" said Eleanor Fox, a professor of trade regulation at New York University.</p><p>Whether regulators actually force Silicon Valley to fundamentally change how it operates remains far less certain.</p><p>Investigators face several hurdles to building an antitrust case against tech behemoths, and competition-law experts say it will likely be months, if not years, before it becomes clear where regulators are headed.</p><p>For one, with so many government officials jockeying for position, regulators run the risk that their probes will become mired in internecine political squabbles.</p><p>Ideally, regulators combine their efforts, said William Kovacic, a former chair of the FTC who now directs the Competition Law Center at George Washington University in Washington. That doesn't appear to be the case this time, with state, federal and congressional investigations all proceeding on separate tracks.</p><p>While rivalry among government departments and agencies can be good, helping to light a fire under a slow-moving bureaucracy, \"Rivalry can also disintegrate into a clumsy and disorganized effort that values institutional parochial considerations above everything else, including good policies,\" Prof. Kovacic said.</p><p>That risk made itself clear last week during a Senate hearing, when top officials from the FTC and the DOJ - who had previously agreed to share responsibilities to investigate the major tech firms - acknowledged their agreement was breaking down.</p><p>Analysts worry the Department of Justice in particular has become deeply politicized under U.S. President Donald Trump in a way that could ultimately undermine efforts to investigate Big Tech.</p><p>The department went to court in July to block a successful antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC against Qualcomm that would have forced the U.S. mobile chip maker to license its technology to competitors including Chinese tech giant Huawei, a company at the centre of U.S.-China trade tensions.</p><p>\"It's highly unusual, very strange\" for the federal government to go to court to fight an antitrust case brought by another federal agency, said Maurice Stucke, a former prosecutor at the Justice Department who teaches law at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. That alone has likely caused bad blood between the FTC and the DOJ, he said.</p><p>A bigger hurdle is that existing U.S. antitrust laws aren't designed to punish companies solely for being too rich and powerful.</p><p>Even if prosecutors can convince a court that large tech companies have become monopolies, they still need to make the case that those monopolies have harmed competition in a way that's bad for consumers. It's a difficult argument to make against companies that undercut competitors' prices, such as <url normalizedValue=\"http://amazon.com\">http://amazon.com</url>/ Inc., or give away their products and services for free, such as Google and Facebook.</p><p>\"You can't bring an antitrust case on the grounds that Google is too big and growing and we don't see a way to stop it,\" said Stanford University law professor Doug Melamed, a former general counsel for Intel Corp. who previously served as acting U.S. assistant attorney-general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division.</p><p>Even if regulators do prevail in an antitrust case against a tech firm, they may not get the kind of game-changing outcome many of Silicon Valley's most vocal opponents are hoping for, such as an order to break up one or more big tech firms.</p><p>Prosecutors could argue, for instance, that Google unfairly designs its search results to favour its own businesses over third-party competitors - an argument European competition regulators successfully made against Google in 2017.</p><p>But the likely result - that Google has to pay a fine and tweak its search algorithm - would amount to a slap on the wrist for a company that makes the vast majority of revenues through advertising.</p><p>\"That could hurt Google Travel, or Google Maps, but it's not going to fundamentally change their business,\" Prof. Melamed said. \"If you're a populist who wants to see these platforms broken up or brought to heel, I would be very surprised if there was an antitrust case that does that.\"</p><p>An antitrust ruling could potentially have the opposite effect, making some tech firms even more powerful. European regulators slapped Google with a record $6.3-billion fine last year for forcing smartphone makers that license the tech giant's Android operating system to install Google as the default search engine.</p><p>In response, Google has said it plans to force rival search engines to pay to access Android through an auction. \"So it's like Google saying we win either way,\" said John Newman, a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer who now teaches law at the University of Miami. \"I'd be looking at that as a cautionary tale of just trying to slap a behavioural remedy on something and hope it fixes the problem.\"</p><p>Still several analysts believe the threat of an antitrust lawsuit may be enough to slow the growing power of Silicon Valley, making companies more cautious about pursuing practices that could bring more scrutiny from regulators. That alone could open the door to new competitors.</p><p>\"This is a drag on these companies,\" Prof. Kovacic said. \"Their effectiveness, their adroitness, will be limited to some extent, whether or not the government wins a case - or even brings a case.\"</p><p>Your time is valuable.

Additionally, the rupee has sunk nearly 13% against the US dollar causing other difficulties.What should investors be looking at if they want to invest in India?</p><p>The Reserve Bank of India Cracks Down on the BanksOn Sep 19, the Reserve Bank of India asked the founder and CEO of Yes Bank, the 5th largest Indian private sector bank by assets, to step down by Jan 31.This was a shock to shareholders, who had recently voted him in for a another 3-year term.Apparently, the reason for the sudden move was due to growing worries over non-performing loans as banks have grown quickly the last few years.Most of the bank stocks have been hit in 2018 with HDFC Bank and ICICI BankIBN[2] trading down 10% and 11.8%, respectively.Will 'India First' Policies Slow Big Tech Growth?After being shut out of China, which favored home grown technology companies, American social media and technology giants put their focus on India.It is the second largest smart phone market in the world which means there's increasing demand for apps and digital payments.But India's government has become increasingly concerned with the dominance of American technology companies over homegrown entities.Facebook's WhatsApp is the most popular phone app in India with over 200 million users.Recently, there were regulatory proposals which would require technology companies to store user data inside the country, which would impact not just tech but financial service companies like PayPal, Visa and Mastercard.Tougher privacy regulations are also being debated as well as new e-commerce and payment regulations.A Trillion Dollar Market in 5 Years?Digital payments are one of the fastest growing areas for technology companies in India. The biggest player is currently Indian company Paytm with about 10% of the market. It has over 95 million active monthly users.Recently, Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B[3] invested $300-$350 million in the company, valuing it between $10 and $12 billion.AlphabetGOOGL[4] launched Google Tez, now called Google Pay, in Sep 2017 and now has over 22 million active monthly users.And then there's PayPalPYPL[5] which is going neck and neck with Paytm for market share, with 9.8%.Some analysts expect digital payments to rise to a trillion-dollar market by 2023.What else should you know about India right now?Tune into this week's podcast to get the scoop.[In full disclosure, Tracey owns shares of FB and GOOGL in her personal portfolio.]Wall Street's Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Five years later, Gates and Allen were hired to provide the operating system for IBM's first personal computer, followed in 1985 by Microsoft's launch of its now ubiquitous Windows software product.\ufeff\ufeff In 1986, the company raised $61 million in an initial public offering (IPO[3]) that some analysts referred to as \"the deal of the year.\" By the late 1980s, Microsoft became the world's largest personal-computer software company.\ufeff\ufeff The Redmond, Washington-based company's stock rose more than a hundred-fold in the ten years after the IPO, and today it's one of the world's largest companies by market value.\ufeff\ufeff \ufeff\ufeffWith products geared toward both consumers and businesses, Microsoft competes in a broad range of industries against companies including Apple, Inc. (AAPL[4]), Amazon.com Inc.</p><p>(AMZN[5]), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM[6]), and Oracle Corp. (ORCL[7]). Microsoft's Latest Developments Microsoft has recently teamed up with Walmart Inc. (WMT[8]) to make a joint bid to acquire the U.S. operations of the popular video app TikTok from Chinese internet company ByteDance. The only other company to have made a bid is Microsoft competitor Oracle. The bids come after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order mandating that TikTok sell its U.S. operations by mid-September or else the company must cease operations within the country. The Trump administration says that TikTok poses a national security threat to the U.S.\ufeff\ufeffKey TakeawaysMicrosoft sells computing devices, cloud systems and services, software and other products to consumers and businesses.The company's Intelligent Cloud segment is now the largest source of revenue as well as the fastest growing.Cloud services strength drove Q4 FY 2020 results.Microsoft recently teamed up with Walmart to make a joint bid for U.S. operations of video app TikTok. Microsoft's Financials  In fiscal year (FY[9]) 2020 ending June 30, 2020, Microsoft posted year-over-year (YOY[10]) gains in revenue, net income, total assets, and other metrics. Net income grew 12.8% YOY to $44.3 billion while revenue rose 13.6% to $143.0 billion. Operating income for FY 2020 rose 23.3% to $53.0 billion and total assets were up 5.1%.\ufeff\ufeffThe growth in net income was a significant slowdown from the 136.8% YOY growth posted in FY 2019. However, 2019 growth was inflated by abnormally low net income in FY 2018 due to charges related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as a net income benefit in 2019 for the same reason.\ufeff\ufeff Microsoft's Business Segments  Microsoft divides its business into three reportable segments, breaking out results by both revenue and operating income: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.\ufeff\ufeff These segments are categorized according to both product type and customer demographic. Productivity and Business Processes, for instance, includes products across multiple platforms and devices relating to productivity and communication. And More Personal Computing focuses on products designed with end users, developers, and IT professionals in mind.\ufeff\ufeff Productivity and Business Processes  Microsoft's Productivity and Business Processes segment includes a portfolio of products designed to enhance corporate productivity, communication, and information services. One of its major products is Microsoft's Office software suite, including both Commercial and Consumer divisions. The segment also includes business solutions products such as Dynamics as well as the professional networking site, LinkedIn.\ufeff\ufeffIn FY 2020, Productivity and Business Processes generated $46.4 billion in revenue, comprising more than 32% of Microsoft's total revenue. This amounted to an increase of 12.7% YOY, slower than the YOY growth of 14.8% in FY 2019. Operating income for the segment grew 15.4% to $18.7 billion in FY 2020, accounting for just over 35% of the total, making it Microsoft's most profitable segment.\ufeff\ufeff Intelligent Cloud  The Intelligent Cloud segment comprises all of Microsoft's public, private, and hybrid server products as well as cloud services for business. These include Microsoft Azure, SQL Server, Windows Server, GitHub, Enterprise Services, and more.\ufeff\ufeffFor FY 2020, Intelligent Cloud generated $48.4 billion in revenue, accounting for almost 34% of total revenue. The segment's revenue is just slightly above that posted by the More Personal Computing segment, making it Microsoft's largest source of revenue. Up 24.1% YOY, Intelligent Cloud was also the fastest growing revenue segment for the year. It was also the fastest growing segment in terms of operating income, which was up 31.6% to $18.3 billion. Intelligent Cloud operating income accounts for just under 35% of Microsoft's total operating income.\ufeff\ufeff More Personal Computing  Microsoft describes its More Personal Computing segment as consisting of products and services aiming toward \"harmonizing the interests of end users, developers, and IT professionals,\" no matter the device. The Windows operating system, Surface device, and gaming products are all included in this segment.\ufeff\ufeffIn FY 2020, More Personal Computing generated $48.3 billion in revenue, comprising about 34% of total revenue. While revenue grew just 5.6% YOY for the segment, operating income rose 24.1% to $15.9 billion. More Personal Computing accounts for about 30% of the company's total operating income.\ufeff\ufeff Top 3 Individual Insider Shareholders of Microsoft Satya Nadella  Satya Nadella owns 1,337,768 shares of Microsoft stock, representing 0.02% of total shares outstanding.\ufeff\ufeff Nadella has served as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Microsoft since 2014. Nadella joined Microsoft 28 years ago in 1992. He has held leadership roles in Microsoft's enterprise and consumer businesses. Most recently, Nadella was executive vice president of Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise group, where he led the transformation to the cloud infrastructure and services business, which has outperformed the market and took share from competition. Microsoft today is one of the world's biggest cloud services providers. Before joining Microsoft, Nadella was a member of the technology staff at Sun Microsystems.\ufeff\ufeff Bradford L. Smith  Brad Smith owns 845,058 shares of Microsoft stock, representing 0.01% of total shares outstanding.\ufeff\ufeff Smith is President and Chief Legal Officer of the company, having previously served as Microsoft's general counsel. Smith serves as the company's chief legal officer and leads the company's initiatives on public issues such as cybersecurity, privacy, and environmental sustainability. After joining Microsoft in 2003 as general counsel, Smith spent the following decade leading work to resolve the company's antitrust controversies with governments around the world. Previously, he was an associate and then partner at Covington and Burling in Washington, D.C.\ufeff\ufeff Jean-Philippe Courtois  Jean-Philippe Courtois owns 600,510 shares of Microsoft, representing 0.01% of total shares outstanding.\ufeff\ufeff Courtois is Executive Vice President and President, Microsoft Global Sales, Marketing and Operations. He joined Microsoft in 1984 and has held numerous positions since that time, including general manager for Microsoft France, CEO and President of Microsoft EMEA, and President of Microsoft International.\ufeff\ufeff Top 3 Institutional Shareholders of Microsoft  Institutional investors[11] hold the majority of Microsoft's shares at about 70.7% of total shares outstanding.\ufeff\ufeff Vanguard Group Inc.  Vanguard Group owns 640.2 million shares of Microsoft, representing 8.4% of total shares outstanding, according to the company's 13F filing for the period ending March 31, 2020.\ufeff\ufeff Vanguard is primarily a mutual fund and ETF management company with about $6.2 trillion in global assets under management (AUM[12]).\ufeff\ufeff The Vanguard S&amp;#38;P 500 ETF (VOO[13]) is among the company's largest exchange-traded funds (ETFs[14]) with about $151 billion in AUM. Microsoft is the largest holding in this ETF, representing 5.5% of VOO's portfolio.\ufeff\ufeff BlackRock Inc.BlackRock owns 517.6 million shares of Microsoft, representing 6.8% of total shares outstanding, according to the company's 13F filing as of March 31, 2020.\ufeff\ufeff BlackRock is primarily a mutual fund and ETF management company with approximately $6.47 trillion in AUM.\ufeff\ufeff The iShares Core S&amp;#38;P 500 ETF (IVV[15]) is among BlackRock's largest ETFs with approximately $198.7 billion in AUM. Microsoft is the largest holding in this ETF, representing 6.2% of IVV's portfolio.\ufeff\ufeff State Street Corp.  State Street owns 314.8 million shares of Microsoft, representing 4.2% of total shares outstanding, according to the company's 13F filing as of March 31, 2020.\ufeff\ufeff State Street manages mutual funds, ETFs and other investments with $3.1 trillion in AUM.\ufeff\ufeff The SPDR S&amp;#38;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY[16]) is among State Street's largest ETFs with approximately $276 billion in AUM. Microsoft is the largest holding in this ETF, representing 6.2% of SPY's portfolio.\ufeff\ufeff Companies Owned by Microsoft  While Microsoft began as a software company, it has expanded its reach into broad areas of the tech industry. Along with software, the company now sells[17] personal computing devices, cloud-computing infrastructure and services, artificial intelligence, and more. Much of Microsoft's expansion has come through a string of small and large acquisitions totaling tens of billions of dollars in value.\ufeff\ufeffNot all of those acquisitions have worked out, however. As part of its attempt to develop a Windows Phone to compete with Apple's iPhones and Google's Android smartphone operating system, Microsoft acquired Nokia for $7.2 billion in 2014.\ufeff\ufeff But the deal was a major failure. In the summer of 2015, Microsoft had to write off $7.6 billion related to the acquisition and sold the brand in 2016 for $350 million to HMD Global, a subsidiary of Taiwanese firm Foxconn Technology Co. Ltd.\ufeff\ufeff \ufeff\ufeff The Windows Phone has been discontinued.\ufeff\ufeffMicrosoft's expansion, both internally and via acquisition, has also brought it under the scrutiny of regulators. In 2000, the company was ordered to break up into two parts after losing a U.S. antitrust lawsuit. While the ruling was overturned, Microsoft was ordered in 2002 to comply with key rules to ensure a more level tech playing field.\ufeff\ufeff The criticism of Microsoft and other mega tech companies over their size and market dominance continues to this day. Amid critics' calls for the breakup of big tech companies such as Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN[18]), in early 2020 the Federal Trade Commission (FTC[19]) ordered Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL[20]), and Facebook Inc. (FB[21]), to provide information on every acquisition they've done between Jan. 1, 2010 and Dec. 31, 2019.\ufeff\ufeffBelow, we look in detail at five of Microsoft's key acquisitions, which largely illustrate the company's strategy of moving into new areas such as social networking, video games, telecommunications, and online advertising. The list also includes a software deal, adding to their legacy business. Four of these deals took place since 2010, the focus of the FTC inquiry, while one took place in 2007. In most cases, Microsoft does not break out the revenue or profit for these companies. LinkedIn Corp. Type of Business: Professional Social Network SiteAcquisition Price: $27.0 billion\ufeff\ufeffAcquisition Date: December 8, 2016 (completed)\ufeff\ufeffAnnual Revenue (FY 2019): $6.8 billion\ufeff\ufeff LinkedIn, the business-focused social media website focused on helping people cultivate their professional networks, was founded in 2002. It became profitable within five years. Between 2007 and 2011, the year it went public, the company grew from 15 million members to more than 100 million. In 2016, LinkedIn was acquired by Microsoft, and the following year reported more than 500 million members in about 200 countries.\ufeff\ufeff Microsoft has taken a fairly hands-off approach with the acquisition, allowing LinkedIn to retain its core brand and culture, and even its CEO[22] Jeff Weiner.\ufeff\ufeff LinkedIn mainly provides Microsoft with a valuable social media platform that earns revenue through premium memberships. But it also generates commercial cloud revenue to Microsoft through LinkedIn's commercial business.\ufeff\ufeff Skype Technologies S.A.R.L. Type of Business: Telecommunications ApplicationAcquisition Price: $8.5 billion\ufeff\ufeffAcquisition Date: May 10, 2011 (announced)\ufeff\ufeff Skype Technologies, which is currently headquartered in Luxembourg, was founded in 2003 by Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m of Sweden and Janus Friis of Denmark. Skype became an early success story in the area of voice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP[23]), a communications technology that allows users to interact by audio through an Internet connection, rather than through an analog one. Between 2005 and 2010, the company's registered users soared from 50 million to more than 600 million.\ufeff\ufeff Since Microsoft acquired Skype in 2011, the parent has integrated its capabilities with technologies like Xbox and Windows devices, and with online platforms like Outlook and Xbox Live.\ufeff\ufeff GitHub Type of Business: Software Development PlatformAcquisition Price: $7.5 billion\ufeff\ufeffAcquisition Date: October 25, 2018 (completed)\ufeff\ufeff GitHub was founded in 2007 when Chris Wanstrath created the first \"commit\", a term used to describe the action of storing a file's hierarchy and content in a digital repository. GitHub has since become a popular open-source coding-repository and development tool for software developers and large companies. By the time Microsoft acquired it in 2018, GitHub had reached 30 million developers and was hosting more than 100 million repositories.\ufeff\ufeff The acquisition demonstrates Microsoft's focus on open-source development as well as aims to accelerate developer use of the platform and provisioning of more tools and services to new audiences.\ufeff\ufeff Mojang Type of Business: Video Game StudioAcquisition Price: $2.5 billion\ufeff\ufeffAcquisition Date: September 15, 2014 (announced) Mojang, the Sweden-based video game studio best known for producing the popular game Minecraft, was founded in 2009 by Markus \"Notch\" Persson. As of May 2019, Minecraft had sold more than 176 million copies, making it one of the best-selling games of all time.\ufeff\ufeff The company was bought by Microsoft in 2014. Today, Mojang's games are played on the Windows and Xbox platforms, iOS, Playstation, and more.\ufeff\ufeff Microsoft has put the game studio to multiple uses, including designing an educational version of Minecraft for classrooms.\ufeff\ufeff aQuantive Type of Business: Online Advertising PlatformAcquisition Price: $6.3 billion\ufeff\ufeffAcquisition Date: August 13, 2007(completed)\ufeff\ufeff Founded in 1997, aQuantive encompassed a family of brands focused on providing digital marketing services, including advertising tool sets, consultation services, media planning and buying, and more. Microsoft acquired the company in 2007 in an attempt to compete with Google in the market for online advertising. But like the Nokia deal mentioned above, the acquisition was a financial failure. In 2012, Microsoft wrote down the value of the ad business by $6.2 billion, indicating that it had drastically overpaid for aQuantive.\ufeff\ufeff Microsoft still operates an ad business, but it is focused on search advertising as opposed to aQuantive's specialty in display advertising.\ufeff\ufeff And its 6.5% share of U.S. search-ad revenue is certainly no match for Google's 73.1% share.\ufeff\ufeff If You'd Invested in Microsoft at its IPO  Microsoft went public on March 13, 1986 at a price of $21.00 per share, or slightly more than $0.07 when adjusted for stock splits[24].\ufeff\ufeff Microsoft's stock closed at $200.39 on Sept. 18, 2020. If you'd bought $10,000 in Microsoft stock at the end of its first day of trading on March 13, 1986, it would be worth $32.3 million dollars as of Sept. 18. If you'd invested $10,000 in the broader U.S. stock market through the Vanguard 500 Index fund (VFINX) over the same time period, it would now be worth $294,290. That's a 322,600% return for Microsoft versus a 2,840% total return for VFINX. It's also a 26.4% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for Microsoft versus 10.3% for the broader market as represented by VFINX.Source: YCharts. Microsoft stayed private for more than a decade after it was founded in 1975. Because it made significant profits, especially after being hired by IBM to develop an operating system for its first PC in 1980, it didn't require substantial additional capital. This allowed it to stay private, which CEO Bill Gates preferred, as he could maintain much more control over the company if it was privately held.

Prior to the IFC, Wale led venture capital early-stage investments in disruptive start-ups across various technology sectors for Orange Digital Ventures in Silicon Valley. In this interview with African Banker, he explains how tech is being used in Africa and how the space will grow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WALE AYENI, HEAD OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS, IFC VENTURE CAPITAL</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The IFC invests around \uf65319bn a year through a number of different instruments and in a number of different regions. What proportion of this goes to Africa?</p><p>The IFC has been around for eight years and we've deployed around $450m right now and that's across Africa, China, India, Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa.</p><p>Our goal is to be aggressive in the major sectors such as health, education, transport and anything that is tech or tech enabled. The size of the investments is generally between $3m to $10m per deal, up to $25m.</p><p>Which sectors are you seeing growth in at the moment?</p><p>Consumer internet. I think that the initial wave of ecommerce is starting to slow down. Now we see a lot of people better understanding their local supply chains and understanding how to use digital technology to disrupt them.</p><p>In long-haul logistics, we see a lot of people focusing on ways to use digital tech to enable more effective supply chains, and in general, build more effective transportation in Africa. That's a sector we've seen more activity in.</p><p>How is technology being used to improve transport in Africa?</p><p>Transportation is driven by hard assets such as lorries, cars and bikes. Where tech comes in useful is that, if there's a limited number of hard assets, you can apply it to increase the utilisation. For example, the asset might belong to one person, but that person can actually share it using technology. That's true for bikes, for trucks, for taxis.</p><p>Ride-sharing, for example, is just about increasing the utilisation of these assets. In Africa these assets are more costly than other parts of the world and the impact is huge. If you go to Kenya and Nigeria and see a truck with loads of people on top of it, it's because the driver has no visibility about when he will get the next load, so he overloads it, which ultimately destroys his truck.</p><p>But when you bring technology you can have price visibility, you can have demand visibility. And it's true for consumers for small businesses and for large businesses. Logistics is a functioning core to any economy, so that's important.</p><p>And health and education?</p><p>Education tech is also important, simply because according to the stats, 60% of Africans are under the age of 25. However, in a lot of these countries the government is behind the curve. Education is not changing quickly enough to give the students core technical skills or digital skills that will make them significant in the global environment.</p><p>We've seen a lot of players in this space; companies which focus on giving people real digital experience so they can work for large-scale tech companies in the future.</p><p>How do you use tech to make a better and more efficient healthcare system in Africa?</p><p>There are a lot of young start- ups looking at it. You can increase access to healthcare and practitioners via your phone.</p><p>So we are bullish about Africa, and quite optimistic about all the sectors.</p><p>Jumia in Kenya is the best-known unicorn in Africa. Where will the next unicorn come from?</p><p>That's not the objective. People use the word 'unicorn' because you can be a unicorn on paper but in reality you don't exist as a unicorn. Focussing on unicorns is the wrong yardstick and we try not to use it.</p><p>The yardstick that we like to use is: one, are you addressing a large enough problem where technology can aid that problem, and can you scale it properly. If you can do that it means you are actually creating value in the marketplace.</p><p>Two, it's about how large can you get, and then do you have the right team around you to actually scale it, or execute it? This is important because sometimes people say it's hard to execute in Africa on the ground.</p><p>Three, can you build a product which solves a big value problem? If you do that, whether you exist as a unicorn or whatever else, you have created value. A unicorn has been a great thing for people to focus on but it's fleeting. We like to focus on things that are core. Basic things like, are you creating value in the large market and making a great product.</p><p>What do you need to do to be a successful venture capitalist?</p><p>If you approach entrepreneurship properly \u2013 venture capital entrepreneurship or digital entrepreneurship \u2013 it's a high- risk endeavour, especially for the founder. But if you are successful then you are really successful.</p><p>The most interesting thing about VC is that you are finding or changing something that people have not thought about and when you do something that is contrary and you are right then you can scale it and do well.</p><p>From an investor's perspective, to make money in a venture asset class you have to be contrarian and We you have to be right. If you invest in the things that are not contrarian then you cannot make an outsized outcome financially.</p><p>From a founder's perspective, I always tell founders that you have to be personally passionate about what you are creating as you have to dedicate 50 years of your life to it. If you are not successful and you are working on something you are passionate about then you are still a winner; yes, it didn't turn into a unicorn but you've done something meaningful.</p><p>I like venture capital because it's not like any other asset class. This might be very arrogant to say but we are creating the future. But in creating the future you can never really tell if you are right or wrong. You can have a sense of it, you can have a framework to analyse it, but you are never really 100% guaranteed. So it has to be an interesting enough problem that you want to spend a lot of time on it, whether you are the investor or the founder.</p><p>As a branch of the World Bank, what is the IFC's developmental role in Africa?</p><p>Obviously we're investors, we're market practitioners and we focus on the private sector. Everything we structure and everything we do is market driven. Our developmental aspect is that we're all about creating markets: our whole mantra is to create them. How you create markets is to use equity.</p><p>IFC has been here in telecos, in banks, in agriculture for around 50 years. We have put billions and billions into Africa. When most other capital would not enter Africa, we were here. Fast-forward and Africa is slowly becoming digital and there's a wave of digital VC coming in.</p><p>Although it's still very nascent, we are leading the way and putting money in and investing on commercial terms. The idea is that you can build big tech firms in Africa and once that is shown to be true, other companies will come in and help develop the space.</p><p>From a developmental angle, Africa is the youngest continent, the fastest growing, and the idea is that tech transformation in Africa should be at the forefront of this growth. We are providing capital to make sure that those people focused on tech can get investments in order to prove their mettle so they can actually do big business in tech from a developmental angle.</p><p>Regarding the future of Africa, if you invest in tech you're investing in the youth and the future of Africa is the youth, so we think that it is highly developmental.</p><p>What problems do young founders face aside from capital?</p><p>Things like getting the right mentors; it's very challenging. Also, legal frameworks and finding lawyers who understand the asset class, as well as getting support from functional groups and corporate governance.</p><p>Indeed, there are a lot of things that go into building a large sustainable tech company. While money is important, it shouldn't be the most important thing, it's the value we can provide on top of the money. We have a lot of relationships with banks. When it comes to policy and regulation we can engage governments to make them more start-up friendly. In various ways we add a lot of value.</p><p>What conditions enabled Lagos to become the most tech-friendly city?</p><p>I like this brotherly rivalry between Lagos, Nairobi and Cape Town. It's actually good to see and each one will overtake the other as time goes on.</p><p>But what I'm most impressed about is other ecosystems helping each other out, like a Kenyan company going to Nigeria, a Nigerian company going to South Africa. It's good to share insights. When people fail, they share the mistakes they make, which is the way to build a truly pan-African ecosystem. n</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREN-114900552</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S59-X3Y1-JDJN-6330-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1451\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 IC Publications Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Crucially, I wonder if this is not the turning point in terms of regulation for many big tech companies, an industry that has thus far thrived with minimal oversight. Are digital disruptors about to be more regulated?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First up, I disposed of all of my Facebook shares and a quarter of my holdings in DIP Corp.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I made a big investment in DIP, double the typical amount I would invest per stock and it has paid off. Its shares have performed well, rising as high as \u00c2\u00a53,550 just prior to the global market selldown. Therefore, I have decided to gradually normalise my investment in the stock and also to lock in some profits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The company reported a good set of earnings results for the latest quarter ended November 2017. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) for the quarter were up an outsized 27% y-o-y compared with the 14% revenue growth on the back of improving margins.</p><p>In fact, this underlines the basis for my upbeat outlook for tech companies \u00e2 \" the benefits of the network effect, limited supply constraints for those with digital-focused businesses and long-term marginal cost that approaches zero.</p><p>What could upset this apple cart? Regulatory challenges.</p><p>Government scrutiny in the US and EU \u00e2 \" especially as it pertains to the collection and protection of a vast trove of personal information \u00e2 \" has been on the rise, but never more intense as the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election unfolds.</p><p>In particular, lawmakers are examining the role of social media platforms in the dissemination of fake news and, this week, the revelation of how a British-based data analytics company misused the personal data of up to 50 million Facebook users to influence the election.</p><p>Facebook is at the forefront of this regulatory backlash \u00e2 \" and may well be the first to feel the real impact of any legislative fallout. The stock was heavily sold down after news of the data misuse came to light. I believe this selldown is justified. The impact of the resulting regulations will have a significant impact on Facebook\u00e2  s revenue and profits.</p><p>For those of you who remember, it was the US government that forced the break-up of AT&amp;T (affectionately known as Ma Bell) in 1984, then the world\u00e2  s largest telco monopoly. It, too, was benefiting from the network effect and appeared then to be in an insurmountable position.</p><p>I bought Facebook shares because they offered the best value and the company has the best business model among the big tech companies. Revenue growth is strong and margins are holding up. Marginal costs are minimal, unlike for Amazon.com and Alphabet, which are spending heavily on new investments, including physical assets that will drive down returns on equity.</p><p>All these are still true. But given the rising regulatory and legal risks, I have decided to cut my losses. Nevertheless, I still believe that tech companies are reasonably valued relative to their prospective growth. Hence, I am reinvesting proceeds from the sale of Facebook into shares in Amazon and Alphabet, both of which are household names that require little introduction.</p><p>Amazon is the largest e-commerce player in the US, though most of its profits currently come from the cloud computing business. The company is also investing big in physical stores, warehouses and distribution logistics. I think their biggest promise is in creating a new home ecosystem. I will explain more on this in the future.</p><p>Alphabet, meanwhile, derives most of its revenue and earnings from advertising. It has numerous platforms with a huge user base, including YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps, Chrome and Android, plus big side bets on AI and autonomous cars.</p><p>I also acquired about US$50,000 ($65,623) worth of shares in G8 Education, which is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and is the country\u00e2  s second-largest operator of day care and education centres for children aged below five. Most of its 495 centres are located in New South Wales and Victoria, with another 21 in Singapore.</p><p>G8 has grown its Ebitda at an impressive annual pace of 37% up until 2017 on improving margins. Last year, growth stalled, owing to increased competition, and its share price fell sharply in response.</p><p>I believe G8\u00e2  s outlook will improve this year, underpinned by mature contributions from the 58 centres acquired in 2016 and 2017. The company also undertook refurbishment and improvement works at many of its centres last year as well as staff upskilling to meet more stringent regulatory requirements. G8 benefits from economies of scale, including from procurement, staff training and placements.</p><p>In addition, the government\u00e2  s new Child Care Subsidy (that will come into effect in July 2018) will raise subsidies for low-middle income families, which should in turn boost demand for childcare services.</p><p>The company generates positive free cash flow and distributes 75% of its annual profits as dividends. At current prices, that will give shareholders an estimated yield of over 6%. Its shares are trading at only nine times trailing EV/Ebitda and 15 times price-to-earnings ratio (see Charts 1 and 2).</p><p>After taking into account all the above transactions, cash in the Global Portfolio was reduced to about 16% of total portfolio value.</p><p>The Global Portfolio is now up 7.3% since inception and continues to outperform the benchmark index, which is up 0.6% over the same period.</p><p>Meanwhile, I continued to reduce my exposure for the Malaysian Portfolio. My cash holdings have now increased to RM91,477 ($30,722), or about 28% of total portfolio value.</p><p>As I have said previously, my recent disposals were driven by macro considerations and not stock-specific ones. The aim is to be prudent and raise some cash that will give us more room to manoeuvre once the global markets stabilise.</p><p>Table 1 shows select emerging market index and currency movements since the global selloff. Notably, countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia, China and Mexico have suffered more than their fair share of pain in the equity selloff, while most emerging market currencies too have depreciated against the US dollar over this period.</p><p>Increased market volatility usually results in investors turning more risk-averse and pulling money out of perceived riskier emerging markets. In addition, many emerging economies are still heavily dependent on exports and are therefore weighed down by rising concerns of a brewing trade war.</p><p>I disposed of two-thirds of my holdings in Willow as well as all the shares in MBL. The sale netted proceeds and gains totalling RM40,995 and RM4,055, respectively.</p><p>Total Malaysian portfolio returns now stand at 65.3% since inception. Despite recent price weakness, this portfolio continues to outperform the benchmark index\u00e2  s 2.6% gain by a long, long distance.</p><p>Disclaimer: This is a personal portfolio for information purposes only and does not constitute a recommendation or solicitation or expression of views to influence readers to buy/sell stocks.

Think Facebook, Apple, Amazon.com, Google (owned by Alphabet), Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings, all of which have cemented near-monopolistic positions in their respective businesses and generated hundreds of billions in value for shareholders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The textbook definition of a network effect is a scenario where each new user added to the platform enhances the experience for all existing users and gets value back in return. Hence, users beget more users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is no different from the network effect of the telephone \u00e2 \" if no one else owns a phone, your phone and the system is of little value, but the value will increase exponentially with each additional phone user to the network. Naturally, it leads to monopolies. The long-term consequences were that these entities were dismantled by rules and regulations that promote competition.</p><p>In the initial stage, a start-up platform would have to spend heavily \u00e2 \" whether through discounts, incentivised referrals or word of mouth and so on \u00e2 \" to attract users. But the cost of acquisition would fall as the user base grows since users themselves are increasingly motivated to join, owing to the network effect. Decreasing marginal costs would then translate into rising profitability for the platforms once they start to monetise. This is the playbook for most tech companies operating digital platforms.</p><p>It is also the reason venture capitalists are willing to funnel massive amounts of money to start-ups to drive rapid user growth, and investors buy stocks in loss-making companies \u00e2 \" in the belief that the network effect will snowball into user critical mass, unassailable moats and the inevitable pot of gold.</p><p>Many of today\u00e2  s technology companies \u00e2 \" including Uber, Airbnb, Netflix, Spotify, Meituan Dianping and Didi Chuxing \u00e2 \" use the term \u00e2  network effect\u00e2  liberally to justify their lofty valuations.</p><p>Ride-sharing company Lyft, whose IPO was one of this year\u00e2  s biggest and most-talked-about, stressed: \u00e2  Network effects among the drivers and riders on our platform are important to our success.\u00e2 </p><p>But do all tech start-ups deserve such confidence from investors? Most of these companies are capitalising on opportunities arising from the sharing and subscription economy. While this may be the way of the future, investors should evaluate the financial viability of each business model carefully.</p><p>Not all tech companies benefit from the network effect and certainly not all to the same extent. It is one thing to spend heavily on initial customer acquisition and another to be able to retain these customers as well as continue to attract new users once the monetisation phase begins.</p><p>Facebook and WeChat are the best examples of platforms with strong network effects. Recent privacy issues notwithstanding, their values are derived from high switching costs.</p><p>You are on Facebook, WhatsApp and WeChat because all your friends and family are using these same apps to communicate and share updates. To switch to another social media app would require all your friends and family to do the same. One would also have huge amounts of personal data already tied into these platforms.</p><p>Such large and loyal user bases, in turn, make it easier to monetise and further expand into other services as well as attract quality content. And, in the process, further strengthen the network effect.</p><p>By contrast, companies such as Lyft, Uber, Netflix, Didi and Meituan are all still burning cash and racking up huge losses. Yes, more customer sign-ups will attract more drivers/restaurants and, therefore, more customers to the ecosystem. However, the network effect is far weaker \u00e2 \" and switching costs are far lower.</p><p>For instance, it is hard to see how my user experience is enhanced if another person uses Uber ride sharing or orders food delivery. The ride would not be more enjoyable nor would the food be tastier. In fact, it could be a negative network effect if congestion results in longer wait times.</p><p>Instead, these platforms are spending huge amounts on customer acquisition. They are capturing market share, but only through heavy subsidies. If they cut back on subsidies and raise prices, would they still get the same amount of sales? I think not.</p><p>Raising prices will also attract competitors. Barriers to entry are low. New entrants can cherry-pick and focus on localisation, in a single city or state. Most customers and drivers/restaurants use multiple ride sharing and food delivery apps. You choose the one that gives the most competitive price.</p><p>I suspect they are partly relying on the old \u00e2  economies of scale\u00e2  model. As a larger customer base results in increasing demand, which in turn draws in more suppliers, their size may enable cost per unit supplied to fall. After all, the sharing economy\u00e2  s value proposition is predicated on increasing assets utilisation.</p><p>Clearly, however, there is a limit if physical logistics are involved \u00e2 \" unlike pure digital deliveries such as Facebook, Google and WeChat, where marginal cost can literally fall to zero.</p><p>To resolve the above dilemma, their longer-term goal must be to drive logistics costs to almost zero or at least much lower from current levels. This is where the technology of autonomous vehicles comes into play.</p><p>Another way is to be a universal app, where you bundle a vast array of services, including payments options. While each service may not itself be sticky, the combination or offer of a bundle may be stickier \u00e2 \" and could perhaps create the necessary network effect where one service attracts users to another and so on and so forth. It is old-school \u00e2  horizontal integration\u00e2  \u00e2 \" and the reason conglomerates were formed in the past.</p><p>The best example of early success in employing and monetising this strategy is \u00c2\u00adWeChat, which new-generation tech players such as Meituan and Go-Jek are attempting to emulate. It remains to be seen whether they too can eventually find a path to profitability.</p><p>Positively, Amazon and Alibaba have very successfully bridged multiple businesses \u00e2 \" from e-commerce to physical retail, financial services, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment, and consumer electronics \u00e2 \" and have done so profitably. This may well be down to the timing in being the first disruptors \u00e2 \" they were able to grow very quickly, capitalising on digitalisation and economies of scale to disrupt traditional business models.</p><p>That said, these companies may, one day, also be disrupted by new entrants. In a future where frictional cost has been whittled to zero, smaller and more nimble players may regain the upper hand. That is, if the tightening noose of government regulations has not already broken up big tech.</p><p>Similarly, subscription services such as Netflix and Spotify are powerful disruptors, exploiting changing consumer preference in how entertainment is consumed and delivering it more efficiently through digital distribution. But like ride sharing-food delivery platforms, switching costs are low. It makes little difference to me which subscription service my friends are on. My decision will be based solely on content and price.</p><p>With so many traditional media companies now getting into the game \u00e2 \" including The Walt Disney Co, AT&amp;T\u00e2  s WarnerMedia and Comcast\u00e2  s NBCUniversal \u00e2 \" not to mention Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+ services \u00e2 \" first-mover advantage in these cases may be fleeting.</p><p>Scale alone provides a weak network effect when there are few reasons for customer loyalty, which makes it an unsustainable competitive advantage. Remember, the media companies are, at the same time, also pulling licensed content from Netflix in favour of their own streaming services.</p><p>Defending market share, therefore, depends on continuous evolution in the platform\u00e2  s value proposition and ways to strengthen the network effect through differentiating features, branding, trust and reputation, value-added services and others.</p><p>This is why Netflix is outspending all of its competitors, to the tune of billions of dollars each year to create original content. Instead of reaping the benefits of strong subscriber and revenue growth, its negative free cash flow has been growing larger each year \u00e2 \" totalling US$2.9 billion ($3.9 billion) in 2018 and estimated to rise to US$3.5 billion this year.</p><p>Many believe that Netflix can maintain its leading position in streaming services. The real question is whether it can reduce content cost and/or raise prices sufficiently to reverse this cash burn and still maintain market share.</p><p>It is for this reason we have the old saying, \u00e2  content is king\u00e2 . The quality of content is what customers want and will pay for. The way it is delivered will be commoditised.</p><p>The Global Portfolio ended higher for the week, led by gains for Ausnutria Dairy as well as a majority of our US stocks. The US market outperformed the rest of the world, with both the Standard &amp; Poor\u00e2  s 500 and Nasdaq indices now just a hair\u00e2  s breadth from all-time record highs.</p><p>Last week\u00e2  s gains lifted total portfolio returns to 2.1% since inception. By comparison, the benchmark MSCI World Net Return Index is up 5.8% over the same period.</p><p>Sentiment on the Bursa Malaysia improved for the week ended Thursday, likely boosted by mild bargain hunting after the recent selloff. The Malaysian Portfolio closed marginally higher, lifting total returns to 50.8% since inception. This portfolio continues to outperform the benchmark index, FBM KLCI, which is still down 10.6% over the same period, by a long way.</p><p>Disclaimer: This is a personal portfolio for information purposes only and does not constitute a recommendation or solicitation or expression of views to influence readers to buy/sell stocks.

The answer from most investors would be the industry where there is guaranteed growth. That would take you straight to the huge technology companies listed in the US. They have been fabulous stock market performers: shares in Amazon have risen 30 per cent this year alone and one share will now set you back nearly $1,000.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They have fast-growing free cash flows and earnings per share growth estimated by MSCI at 18 per cent this year. They dominate their markets. Amazon manages over 40 per cent of book sales in the US and has a 74 per cent share of the US ebook market. It's getting more: overall sales were up 23 per cent in the first quarter of the year.</p><p>Facebook has 1.5bn users who spend an average of 50 minutes on the site a day. With its subsidiaries, it takes 70 per cent of US social media traffic. Google is your default browser and controls 88 per cent of search advertising.</p><p>Finally, they are impressively innovative: name a technology trend that will define the future (cloud computing, home digitalisation or artificial intelligence, perhaps) and you know who is on it.</p><p>It will be one of the five largest companies in the US by market cap: Apple, Alphabet (Google's parent), Microsoft, Amazon or Facebook.</p><p>Given that, who wouldn't want to buy and hold this lot for a decade?</p><p>Me. I wouldn't.</p><p>They are too expensive \u2013 and getting more expensive too fast. A report just out from Bank of America Merrill Lynch notes US growth stocks have just passed their 2000 \"tech bubble\" highs against global value stocks.</p><p>Google, it says, is worth more than the gross domestic product of Chicago; the combined market cap of Google and Amazon is more than that of all financials listed in Europe and Japan.</p><p>You should enjoy that kind of statistic for its general ridiculousness.</p><p>But it's also worth noting analysts always come out with this kind of stuff just as booms turn into bubbles. Remember how we used to laugh about the land around the Imperial Palace in Tokyo being worth more than all of California in the late 1980s? Quite. And the Nasdaq Internet index? It's now on an average price/earnings ratio of 61 times. That's nothing on the dotcom bubble (the Nasdaq 100 average was 205 times) but it isn't far off the levels of the Nikkei in the California vs Imperial Palace era (67 times).</p><p>This would be just about OK if there were no risk in the business models of big tech. But there is, and most of it is regulatory. Governments like to control things but right now they have very little control over Google, Facebook Amazon or Twitter. These are all effectively monopolies (there are huge barriers to entry \u2013 owning the network is all \u2013 and there are very low marginal costs once you are in). They have long been able to pay the tax they want, treat content providers as they want and take little responsibility for content on their sites. That doesn't work for the state.</p><p>Consider Theresa May's manifesto. She would like to \"ensure there is a sustainable business model for high-quality media online to create a level playing field for our media and creative industries\". She intends to \"work with industry to introduce new protections for minors, from images of pornography, violence, and other age-inappropriate content\". And she wants the UK to be \"the global leader in the regulation of the use of personal data and the internet\".</p><p>The first bit hints at protection for traditional media and regulation for new media. The second shifts the responsibility for policing content from the police and the public directly to the social media companies.</p><p>If Mrs May was alone in this it would be of little interest. She isn't. There is a cross-party consensus in the UK that social media is not doing enough to root out fake news and terror content \u2013 and that for those who don't get a grip on it, very high financial penalties are the answer.</p><p>There is also a consensus that corporate tax rules need tweaking so fines aren't the only thing paid by companies operating in the UK. The rest of the world is with the programme: last week the G7 issued a statement calling on social media companies to do more to combat online extremism; Germany has legislation on the go with fines up to \u20ac50m for this.</p><p>There is also much talk in the US and Europe about the reform of what is known as \"safe harbour\" for internet companies. Effectively part of legislation in both regions, this limits the liability of operators for anything nasty on their sites. Removing it, as Mrs May would like, would shift policing to the middleman. That could be expensive.</p><p>However there is even worse than this on the way. It has been a few years since we started hearing claims that several of the big tech firms are monopolies and should be regulated or split up under competition law. Now the idea of Roosevelt-style trustbusting of tech in the US is gaining traction (President Trump sometimes seems all for it).</p><p>Maybe Amazon should be split by product line or Facebook forced to sell off Instagram. The tech firms will put up a huge fight against all this. But they are unlikely to get much sympathy from the general public or the politicians that represent them. After all, given the way all the money in the world seems to be heading towards the owners of tech firms, there is every chance that the next round of populism will be against the \"concentrated wealth of Silicon Valley\", as Michael Hartnett of BoAML says. Invest in big tech now and you take a bet on the political battle to come rather than on the state of the sector. That's not something I want to do.</p><p>So the question remains: what you would buy if you had to hold it for a decade?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TDASTA-93396987</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TDASTA2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NPS-M851-JDJN-63T9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335154</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"956\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Daily Star - The Daily Star FZ LLC.

Indeed, our 2014 crop of legends runs the gamut in terms of outlook.  Peter Schiff - a.k.a. Doctor Doom, the guy who called the housing market crisis, is bracing for an even more catastrophic collapse of the U.S. economy than we saw in 2008.  Meanwhile, famed Wharton School professor Jeremy Siegel, author of the \"buy and hold bible\" Stocks for the Long Run, is counting on the Dow to gain as much as 15% in the coming year.  The one thing they all agree on: Think long-term.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> ************** </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Donald Yacktman </p><p> Value investor Donald Yacktman, 72, has returned an annual average of close to 10% over the past 15 years in his two flagship funds - double the S&amp;P 500 Index. </p><p> What is the biggest risk that investors face right now?</p><p> The stock market is not cheap. </p><p> Is that why you've been holding a lot of cash lately? </p><p> Yacktman Asset Management manages close to $30 billion. In 2007 and today, we've had a fair bit of cash. We were at about 20% at the end of the third quarter of 2013. Usually, as the market goes up, our cash tends to build. Because we're investing from the bottom up, not the top down, the cash is a residual. That's telling you how hard it is to find stocks to buy. </p><p> What about the argument that investors hire  a manager to pick stocks, not to hold cash? </p><p> Our primary goal is to protect our clients' money, and there are two sides to that. One is protecting it against bad decisions - buying things that are overpriced. The other is to protect against inflation. You have a tough period now, because cash doesn't earn anything. If it earned something, our cash position would probably be even higher. </p><p> Your holdings aren't little-known stocks. Are you just buying at the right price? </p><p> Yeah, price is critical. But the second thing is time horizon. We view every stock as if it were a long-term bond. And we're looking at risk-adjusted forward returns. The Cokes, Pepsis and P&amp;Gs become our triple-A bonds.</p><p> So how do you identify a bargain? </p><p> Companies that tend to have consistently high returns usually have low fixed assets and low cyclicality. You will rarely see things like airlines, automobiles or steel companies or, for that matter, banks in our holdings. </p><p> Your staff is very small, right? </p><p> We have about a dozen full-time people. Five are what I would call analytical staff. We aren't into body count. When I organized the company, I had the goal of trying to farm out everything except for the judgment part. Basically, the only thing we do is make purchases and make analytical decisions. There are a few critical variables, and most of them can be figured out on the back of an envelope. </p><p> How do you decide when to buy? </p><p> The easiest is when the market comes down. By the end of 2008, we had all our money invested. I'd said, \"If you can't find bargains in this environment, there's a disconnect.\" Then the market went down another 20%. In this business, you're wrong almost all the time. It's just a matter of degree, because nobody buys at the bottom or sells at the top. </p><p> What are other good times to buy? </p><p> Another one is an industry thing. For instance, you have a lot of health care issues in the United States. Everybody gets nervous, and they knock down the price of companies in that industry.</p><p> Have you bought any health care stocks recently? </p><p> Things in that area were disruptive in 2012. We now have big positions in C.R. Bard, Stryker and Johnson &amp; Johnson. So three of our top 12 are in the medical device area. </p><p> What about BlackBerry? You were a prominent  investor recently. </p><p> That's an example of something company-specific. We've had back-and-forth positions in BlackBerry within the last year or two. When it got creamed, we bought it. We ran the share price up into the teens and we eliminated probably 90% it. We should have got rid of all of it. </p><p> And you made money on it? </p><p> Mmmm hmmmm. </p><p> So how do you get out of a dog like BlackBerry? </p><p> I think the secret is to be incredibly objective and patient. First of all, don't buy more. Also, stocks tend to fluctuate about 50%, from low to high, over 12 months. You'll usually have opportunities to re-evaluate and exit.  /John Daly </p><p> BlackBerry (five-year close) </p><p> Jan. 2, 2009, to Dec. 2, 2013 </p><p> $80 </p><p> ************* </p><p> Peter Schiff </p><p> Schiff is chief executive officer and chief global strategist at Connecticut-based Euro Pacific Capital. He has authored many books, including Crash Proof: How to Profit from the Coming Economic Collapse, and The Real Crash: America's Coming Bankruptcy. His nickname is, not surprisingly, Dr. Doom. </p><p> Where do you see opportunities? </p><p> The U.S. economy is a bubble that will burst. In contrast to prior monetary excesses, this time the U.S. Federal Reserve has inflated simultaneous bubbles in stocks, bonds and real estate. As the Fed prints more and more dollars to keep those bubbles from popping, the dollar will lose value and eventually precipitate a financial crisis larger than the one we experienced in 2008. The U.S. dollar is being propped up by foreign central banks. But when our creditors finally understand the box we are in, they will not be willing to hold as many dollars. You don't want to own U.S.-dollar-denominated assets, and you certainly don't want to own U.S. treasuries or corporate bonds. You're better off owning equities outside the U.S. I like resource stocks like Franco-Nevada, Goldcorp, Yamana Gold, Agnico-Eagle Mines and Endeavour Silver. Many people don't understand how much inflation is being created, and how that benefits gold. Gold is going to be several thousand dollars an ounce before the bull market ends. </p><p> What would you do with a $100,000 windfall? </p><p> I am a 50-year-old guy with a family, but I would go with all equities, precious metals and little bonds. I'd buy more gold stocks and bullion because of how cheap they are. Also, buy dividend-paying foreign equities and get into emerging markets. </p><p> What are your best and worst investments? </p><p> Shorting subprime mortgages in 2006 was both my best and worst investment. There was a book written on it, called The Greatest Trade Ever. But it was also my worst trade, because I didn't have it on big enough for me or my clients. At the time, I had a lot of money in gold stocks, which I didn't want to sell because of a significant tax liability. I expected that the monetary policy that would result from the bursting of the housing bubble would send gold prices much higher. As well, my brokerage account was already highly leveraged, as I had just borrowed against it to settle a divorce. Of course, those gold stocks imploded in 2008, and I could have sold them, paid the taxes, and then bought them back for much less with the profits I would have made shorting subprime. I was also under-invested because I thought the performance fees from my hedge fund [which returned just over 1,000% after fees over one year] would provide me with ample upside. As it turned out, very few clients actually invested in the fund, so my fees were much smaller than anticipated. Sure, I made a few million dollars, but it wasn't a lot of money compared to what others made. I just didn't put enough money where my mouth was.</p><p> What keeps you awake at night? </p><p> I worry it's going to be a long time before the economic collapse happens. The longer it takes, the worse it is going to be. I want the world to stop financing the growth of the U.S. government - that is, to stop buying treasuries so that our economy can restructure in a healthy way. </p><p> What was the best investment advice you ever received?</p><p> I have been given lots of advice over the years - most of it bad. That is why I try to invest for the long term. </p><p> What advice would you give average investors now? </p><p> Be skeptical of mainstream Wall Street firms. Analysts who have buys on stocks are often trying to get investment banking deals from those companies, or to help favoured institutional clients sell their shares at higher prices. They will be reluctant to tell you to sell those stocks, even if they see problems. Also, be skeptical of government numbers.

But he's getting increasingly worried about the environment, which bodes ill for Alberta. And don't get him started on the Fed... </p><p> What's your feeling about the state of  the world? </p><p> In the short term, we're jogging along okay. In the longer term, I worry about the inability of many countries to come to terms with environmental issues. There is little sign that anyone gets the point that we can't afford to go on burning coal unless we want to end up with a miserable, dystopian future.</p><p> Environmentalism crops up quite a bit in your thinking these days. To what extent are you arguing as an environmentalist versus an investor? </p><p> It's very hard for me to separate them. It leads to some clear conclusions: Coal and tar sands will be stranded assets, in that they won't get their money back. The coal industry is seen increasingly as dangerously polluting and contributing to global warming. The pollution in Chinese cities may be the single-biggest driving factor on that.</p><p> You've been critical of Canada's oil sands in particular. Why? </p><p> The tar sands is a particularly dirty and expensive form of fossil fuel. It doesn't bubble out of the ground like it does in Saudi Arabia. If we burn an appreciable chunk of your tar sands, we're toast. We're in this boat together, and the boat is leaking. </p><p> You've been warning of a potential stock bubble, followed by the third bust since 2000. How do you play this sort of environment? </p><p> There is no easy answer, and anyone who thinks there is one is either ignorant or a crook. If you get out too soon, you'll be victimized as an old fuddy-duddy. If you stay in too long, you'll be just another trend-follower. But we know what the Fed does, and we know what [incoming Fed chair] Janet Yellen thinks. She says the market is not badly overpriced, which means she's not going to get disturbed if it were 20% or 30% higher. Consequently, I don't think that is unlikely.</p><p> Is this bubble-and-bust cycle one that can and should be avoided? </p><p> Of course it can and should be avoided. But by appointing Janet Yellen, you know there is no inclination on the part of officialdom to change the game. Bernanke and Yellen are guaranteed extensions of what I think of as the Greenspan experiment in stimulus and relatively lax regulation. It is a totally failed experiment, with enormous pain. Will  they never learn? </p><p> You're a big-picture strategist. How important is stock-picking when you get the central ideas right? </p><p> I would say that the big picture utterly overwhelms stock-picking if you get the big picture right. And if you only get it modestly right, it really would be a good idea to have some stock-picking skills up your sleeve. </p><p> Why has timber persisted year-in and year-out as a good investment? </p><p> When we first picked it up in the late 1990s, it was a totally mispriced asset. It was unacceptable to most institutional investors, except for a handful of mavericks, and it was notoriously illiquid. That resulted in a ludicrous mismatch with the rest of the market - and it provides wonderful diversification and has a long horizon suitable for pension funds.</p><p> What's your favourite long-term resource? </p><p> Forestry and farmland, if you can find those properties that have the least overpricing. They would tend to be overseas, in reasonably stable countries.

Then he became Facebook's first backer. He is also the chairman of Palantir, the data security firm that helps the CIA track the movements of miscreants (and the rest of us) on the Internet.</p><p> \"We wanted flying cars - instead we got 140 characters.\" Explain the motto of your investment company, Founders Fund. </p><p> We've lived through a period of relative technical stagnation. You can debate whether flying cars would be a great improvement, but if people wanted to make them work, it could be done. We are not trying as hard, not reaching as high. </p><p> As an investor, how do you  choose which dreamers to back? </p><p> How many leaps are required for your solution to work? Having to invent one or two major things, that's doable. More? Doubtful. Also, we look for founders who are good at co-ordinating large teams and convincing them that something that seems impossible is doable. It's been a decade-long effort for Elon Musk to start SpaceX to reconstruct the American space program - which seemed impossible at the outset. </p><p> You've invested in three of  the biggest successes in the Internet's short history. How do you decide which start-ups have legs? </p><p> Each great company is geared to capitalize on a particular moment in history. PayPal and Facebook each began by providing a big benefit to a small market. There are only 10,000 people at Harvard, but Facebook had a 60% market share in 10 days. PayPal's initial market was eBay's \"power-sellers\" - maybe 20,000 people. But within four months of launch, we had 25% of the market. </p><p> Is tech investing different from other sorts of investing? </p><p> It's incredibly hard to get people to adopt new tech solutions, and you only get adoption of something if it's 10 times as good as the next best thing. Amazon had 10 times as many books. PayPal was at least 10 times  as fast as cashing a cheque. </p><p> What metric do you most rely on? </p><p> I've found a single question to be predictive of a start-up's success: What is the CEO's salary? If it's less than $120,000, with equity a big component of the compensation, there's alignment between the CEO and the investors. If it's $150,000 or more, it almost never works.</p><p> How do your years of competitive chess-playing help you invest? </p><p> Chess champion Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca said, \"In order to improve your game, you must study the endgame before everything else.\" Successful businesses have a very long arc. In 2001, we concluded that three-quarters of PayPal's value would come from 2011 and beyond. The same thing applies to all the big tech companies currently - LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter. Most of their value comes from the 2020s, 2030s and beyond. And so one of the critical questions is, what does the endgame look like, not how they will do in the next month. </p><p> What are your thoughts on the Canadian start-up scene? </p><p> We've been looking at Canada very carefully - a scene that is shockingly underfunded. </p><p> What's your advice for investors? </p><p> We should never underestimate the degree to which investors act in herd-like ways. This leads to all these bubble-like phenomena. It's difficult to time these things precisely, but understanding extreme irrationality is a good starting point.

Like Warren Buffett, the San Diego billionaire counts Ben Graham as his mentor. The author of the widely read Value Investing Today, first published in 1989, regards investing as a long-term proposition. Anything else is just speculating. </p><p> What's the best investment you've made? </p><p> The most recent example, believe it or not, is Microsoft. As deep-value guys, we generally don't buy these high-flying technology companies when they're trading at very high price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. But over the last three or four years, some of the premier technology companies had gotten to a value price. The feeling about Microsoft was that the PC era was over. But enterprise-wise, everybody around the world had Windows on their PCs, and we didn't think that was going to go away immediately. Thinking long-term and of the basic fundamentals  of the company, it was a very good bargain. </p><p> What's the worst? </p><p> We bought stock in a brokerage firm in Japan called Yamaichi Securities, in 1997. It was the third-largest in Japan at the time. The stock price looked to be pretty cheap, compared to their earnings or cash flow, their dividend and that sort of thing. This was one of the rare cases of outright fraud. Yamaichi's reporting was  fraudulent. It went to zero. So that result was not satisfactory. </p><p> You say individual investors  have a big advantage over  institutions. How so? </p><p> The conventional wisdom is that the institutions always have an advantage over the little guy, and you can't fight Wall Street. That is wrong. The institutions have the same behaviourial handicaps as individuals. However, they can't overcome them, because there is so much pressure in the short term for institutions to perform.</p><p> What are the biggest risks facing the average investor? </p><p> I don't know if your readers would believe this, but if you have a period of time for your investments shorter than three to five years, you're not an investor. You're a speculator.</p><p> What risks should the long-term investor be paying attention to? </p><p> Obviously, one of those would be technological change in the business that you're invested in. And technological change has speeded up a whole lot. That is such a fundamental potential risk that you have to be aware of it. An example would be Kodak and its film business. Digital just wiped them out. </p><p> Other risks to watch out for? </p><p> Potentially, balance-sheet risk, credit risk. Of course, we saw that big-time in the credit crisis of 2008. But historically, you always have to be careful with a company that is getting too much debt on its balance sheet to survive properly in a recessionary environment. </p><p> What keeps you up at night? </p><p> Nothing, really. However, after 2008-'09, investors were scared about investing in equities - and it's still going that way. The institutions used to have 60% in equities, 30% in bonds and 10% somewhere else. Now, they're down to about 40% in equities. When you look at the long-term rates of return, equities are absolutely the superior place to be. If you're a fundamental long-term investor, you just keep with equities because they always recover to new highs.  /Brian Milner </p><p>Kodak's share price </p><p> $80 </p><p> At its peak, in February, 1999 </p><p> 31 cents</p><p> Jan. 12, 2012, the day Eastman Kodak filed for bankruptcy protection and was delisted  by the NYSE after 107 years </p><p> ************ </p><p> James O'Shaughnessy </p><p> O'Shaughnessy, 53, is the author of the 1997 bestseller What Works on Wall Street and one of the most formidable crunchers of historical market data in the business.

Are they getting too expensive?</p><p> Stocks in the U.S. are about 150% higher than they were in 2009. At that time, we did a calculation based on 20-year averages: What would the market have to go through by 2019 to match the worst 20-year period ever? If memory serves me, it was 6% average annual gain after inflation. If we look back in 2019, I'm not saying that stocks will be giving huge double-digit returns, but I do think they will end up being one of the best-performing asset classes. </p><p> What are the biggest risks investors face right now? </p><p> Extrapolating the bond market's fantastic performance since 1981 into the future. We think long-term bonds will be going into a multidecade bear market, and we're urging investors to invest only in short-term bonds. My entire adult life has been lived in a bull market for bonds. But bonds can be very risky, especially over long periods. If you'd started investing in 20-year bonds in 1940, by 1981, you would have had about a 63% real total loss on the portfolio. I'm not saying don't buy bonds; I'm saying be careful which bonds you buy.</p><p> What one piece of general advice would you give to investors right now? </p><p> Establish an asset allocation and then rebalance it when it gets 15% out of whack. Really, if investors could just do that, they could substantially improve their overall performance.</p><p> What about picking individual stocks? What numbers or ratios work best? </p><p> Our value composite consists of five elements: price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, EBITDA-to-enterprise value, free cash flow-to-enterprise value and shareholder yield.

I was trading on my own account, and I was doing a lot of work with the Black-Scholes formula for options pricing. The puts tend to go up in price if the market goes down, and they were really acting up, so I thought the market knew something I didn't. I slowly began acquiring puts. But then the market had a great day just a few days before the crash. I lost my nerve and I emotionally sold the puts at a loss. I don't even want to tell you what I would have made if I had held on through the crash. Shoulda, woulda, coulda. </p><p> Who is your investing hero? </p><p> Definitely Ben Graham.

His fundamental indexing approach weights stocks on factors such as book value and cash flow, rather than stock prices. And, just as index investing beats most stock picking, fundamental indexing is beating them both. </p><p> Fundamental indexing has been attracting a lot of attention for outperforming traditional indexes. Is it also attracting more criticism? </p><p> Actually, I think it has been silencing the critics. The idea has been live for close to nine years, and it has worked. It has added 1.5% to 2% per year, compounded annually, across a whole array of markets. The simple fact is, fundamental indexing wins because of contra trading against the market's most extreme bets. Whatever the market is chasing most aggressively as a fad, that's what we're trading against. Whatever the market is shunning, that's what we're buying. </p><p> Is fundamental indexing supposed to replace traditional indexing? </p><p> They are highly complementary. I can't imagine ever investing in a cap-weighted strategy again, but there are times when growth is in favour and fundamental indexing will struggle. So for most investors, having a bit of both probably does make sense. </p><p> As an indexer, do you have views of the year ahead? </p><p> Absolutely. We think value in emerging markets, perhaps best illustrated by fundamental indexing, is really, really cheap. So to the extent that investors want equity investments, we think this is a wonderful time  to fade their exposure in the U.S. and developed economies, and to rebalance into the deeply  out-of-favour and unloved emerging markets. Emerging market debt has also fallen out of favour and is priced way out of proportion to the default risks. And we think that high-yield bonds still represent a modest opportunity.</p><p> Where do you stand on whether U.S. equities are heading into a bubble? </p><p> I think the word \"bubble\" is overused. I would characterize the U.S. stock market as expensive. Could it become a bubble? Yes, but buyers today are basically betting on two things. One, that it goes from expensive to bubble; and two, that they'll recognize the difference and will sell after the bubble has matured. Those are two very aggressive assumptions. I'd much rather sell out of an expensive market and buy into attractively priced markets, rather than playing  the game of picking up nickels  in front of a steamroller. /D.B. </p><p> ************** </p><p> Satish Rai </p><p> Rai, 50, joined TD as a management trainee in 1986 and began applying more analytical discipline to the bank's investment decisions. He is now in charge of investments at TD's $217-billion asset management division and runs the bank's own pension plan.</p><p> What would you do with a $100,000 windfall? </p><p> The same thing today as I did five or 10 years ago: Buy shares in great companies, Canadian or foreign, with strong balance sheets. Some people say those companies should pay dividends. I don't necessarily agree, so long as they are allocating capital properly - the ones that are consistently growing their businesses. Think about two questions: \"Will a company find this or discover that, and therefore make a lot of money?\" and \"Is this company going to grow at 5% or 10% a year?\" There's a big difference between the two. </p><p> What was your best investment? </p><p> My 25 years of investing in TD Bank shares. </p><p> What was your worst investment? </p><p> Early in my career, with my personal portfolio, I bought speculative stocks with a short-term time horizon. I don't have a name, but it was always a company that was rolling the dice on finding a product. I perceived those speculative stocks as a 50/50 bet that they would go up. In fact, it's more like a 99% probability that they will go down. </p><p> What's the biggest risk that investors face today? </p><p> People haven't figured out that they need to take on a different risk profile. They believe that, as you get closer to retirement, you should shift money from equities to fixed income. That's all based on the 30-year bull market in bonds we've been through, not looking forward. In this environment - in which interest rates are low - fixed income is going to give you 0% capital appreciation.</p><p> What about corporate bonds? Isn't the market strong  for them? </p><p> Spreads between the rates on government bonds and the traditionally higher rates on corporate bonds are thin, and they are going to stay thin. That's why our team thinks that 2014 is going to be a strong year for mergers and acquisitions, because if you're a good corporation, you can borrow large amounts at rates virtually flat to inflation. There will be a point in the cycle soon where people have confidence in economic activity. Once that happens, you will see an enormous amount of corporate development. The first stage will be for companies to acquire business using their easy access to capital. </p><p> So, should individuals invest in those bonds? </p><p> No. They should be buying equities in strong companies. </p><p> Will interest rates go up any time soon? </p><p> Our view is that it will be surprising how long rates stay low - short-term rates controlled by central banks, that is. The reason is not what people think: slow economic activity. It's that governments can't afford to pay higher interest costs on their debt. The U.S. has $12 trillion in debt. If rates go up 1%, that's $120 billion a year in added interest. </p><p> Won't those low rates prolong the crisis in traditional defined-benefit pension plans? </p><p> Pension plans can't get higher returns without taking on more risk, and most are not willing or not allowed to do that. So the individual or the corporation, or other plan sponsor, has to make higher contributions - that's it. But if you're living paycheque to paycheque, what right do I have to tell you that you need to save 12%, 13%, 14% of your income? Society needs to find tools. </p><p> What can a boomer approaching retirement do? </p><p> I have a simple piece of advice for boomers: Live off the dividend income, not capital gains from stocks or bonds. If you need the capital gains, you have to try to time the market when you buy and sell. But if you're able to sustain your lifestyle with dividend income - plus OAS, CPP and your pension plan - you won't have to worry about fluctuations in the value of your portfolio. You'll have a very good retirement, because there's enormous opportunity around this.  /J.D. </p><p> $74,331 </p><p> That's how much your money would be worth if you'd invested $10,000 in Rai's TD Canadian Bond Fund at inception, in June, 1988 </p><p> **************** </p><p> Jeremy Siegel </p><p> Siegel teaches finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and is an investment strategy adviser with WisdomTree Investments. He's also the author of Stocks for the Long Run. </p><p> What's your outlook on the U.S. market, and where do you see opportunities? </p><p> I am still very bullish. I think the Dow Jones will pass 17,000 points in 2014, a gain of 10% to 15%. In a low interest rate environment, stocks often trade at 18 to 20 times earnings. But they are now trading at about 15 to 16 times, and I think earnings are going to continue to rise in 2014. Internationally, I think emerging markets are the most undervalued and represent good opportunities. </p><p> What would you do with a $100,000 windfall?</p><p> I don't see another asset class that is going to beat stocks over three to five years. I would buy a broadly diversified global index fund with a higher weight toward emerging markets. While I think the U.S. market will do better than Europe in 2014, I think all stock markets will rise. </p><p> What keeps you up at night? </p><p> I sleep pretty well. However, there is always a possibility of a terrorist attack. Such an event, involving nuclear materials or something of that nature, is very unlikely, but would have a devastating impact on the market. I don't think that a financial crisis like the one we had in 2008 is going to happen for many, many years.</p><p> What's the best investing advice you ever got? </p><p> The late Paul Samuelson, who was my PhD thesis adviser at MIT, talked about low-cost indexed investments. That stuck with me, and I was one of the very first people in the Vanguard  S&amp;P 500 Index Fund. Low-cost investing is still the way to go, but I now prefer fundamental indexing, which weights stocks by earnings or dividends instead of by market capitalization. The bulk of my equity holdings are in funds that are fundamentally indexed, covering different regions of the world.</p><p> What advice would you give to investors now? </p><p> I would advise investors to move toward fundamentally weighted index investments, and have a generous allocation to stocks. I think equities are going to do very well over the next three to five years. I know a lot of people are afraid of stocks because of memories of the 2008 market crash. But people who think they have missed the whole bull market, haven't.

How have things changed? </p><p> The Dow has changed a bit: In the 1970s and '80s, it used to travel between yield extremes, where 3% was overvalued and 6% was undervalued. Now, it seems to travel between yield extremes where 2% is overvalued and 4% is undervalued. I think it has changed because of the tech stocks that have entered the index. </p><p> What about the way investors approach dividend stocks?</p><p> I look at dividends not necessarily as an income factor, but as the only true measure of value in the stock market. Anything that doesn't pay a dividend or some kind of return is a speculation - so dividends will always be a big factor in the stock market. </p><p> Has there been any change in the way companies  approach dividends? </p><p> Blue-chip stocks have always paid dividends, and they should - they should share their good fortune with their stockholders. And income is really the main reason why an investor would go into the stock market - to get a return on his investment dollar. We all hope for capital gains, but the only thing we can really count on is the dividend.</p><p> So what is the Dow Jones industrial average signalling in terms of its dividend yield? </p><p> When the Dow reaches a point where the yield is 2.1%, then it is considered overvalued. But I don't advocate buying the Dow. There are many good-quality individual stocks that are not overvalued. </p><p> What do you think about Apple's decision to pay a dividend? </p><p> A company that has been around as long as Apple and has been as innovative as Apple is a selfish company if it doesn't want to share some of its good fortune with its stockholders.</p><p> You're a competitive bridge player.

One of four areas of opportunity is housing. The U.S. housing market went through a five-year slump and has just come out of it. I expect housing stocks like PulteGroup and Lennar to do very well. Another area is financials, in part because many of them are related to housing through issuing mortgages. That would be everything from JPMorgan Chase to Genworth Financial. The airline industry has been dramatically restructured and significantly consolidated. I think the airlines have a long way to go, and our favourite is United Continental Holdings. Lastly, stocks in the technology sector, especially larger names, are very cheap by historic standards and have very high free cash-flow yields. We like Apple and Microsoft. </p><p> What would you do with a $100,000 windfall? </p><p> I would put it in a diversified portfolio of U.S. or global stocks. Part of the reason why the stock market has done so well is because it got too cheap after the 2008 financial crisis. The market has gone up, but it is still nowhere near where it is likely to go in the next several years. </p><p> What was your worst investment? </p><p> The worst among individual stocks is an investment we made in Eastman Kodak in 1999-2000. At the time, it was trading very cheaply, with a good dividend yield. Our mistake was staying with it year after year, despite the fact it continued to miss its own targets, and the business continued to deteriorate. For a broader category, we lost more total money in financials in 2008, mainly from misreading the credit crisis. </p><p> What keeps you awake at night? </p><p> A repeat of our mistake in 2008. We did not recognize soon enough the seriousness of a change in the macro environment. </p><p> What's the best advice you ever received? </p><p> The late American stock trader Jesse Livermore once said that the big money is made in the big moves in prices. There were big moves in the stock market from March, 2009, to now, and from 1982 to 2000. It's the same with bonds for the past 30 years. Most people are obsessed with the short term. Is the market going to correct? What is the stock going to do in the next quarter? All of that is pretty much irrelevant for most people.</p><p> What advice would you give investors now? </p><p> Think long-term, be patient and ignore the day-to-day news. In this kind of environment, people should have a maximum of 75% of their assets in stocks. People are too underinvested in equities because of the 2008 crisis, and that is because they are looking backward, not forward. </p><p> What is the most important investment metric? </p><p> We tend to first look at free cash-flow yield. A high cash-flow yield tells you that you're getting a high current cash return on your investment. There is good evidence that that metric gets you into companies that are going to do well. </p><p> Do you have a favourite investment motto? </p><p> \"Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.\" That comes from Warren Buffett. You are not going to make money doing what everybody else does at the same time.  / S.W. </p><p> $12.2 billion </p><p> Loss in assets of Miller's Legg Mason Value Trust Fund in 2008. From 1991 to 2005, the fund outperformed the broad market each year, a feat no other manager has achieved. It has still returned 12.08% over 10 years </p><p> ********** </p><p> Gerry Schwartz </p><p> The 72-year-old founder and chairman of Onex Corp. has long been one of Canada's most successful investors. While building the country's most influential buyout firm, the billionaire has stuck resolutely to the long-term view, ignoring quarterly numbers, market fluctuations and economic data to focus on the essential health and prospects of businesses he likes. </p><p> What's your assessment of  the current state of North American markets? </p><p> I have said many times that it's a mistake to bet against the long-term health of the U.S. equity markets, because it's a mistake to bet against the long-term health of the U.S. economy. It will have ups and downs, some of them big downs, like  2008-'09. But if you look at it over  a long period of time, it is a very strong economy.</p><p> So do you ignore the economic news, quarterly earnings and day-to-day market gyrations? </p><p> Totally. I have almost no interest in quarterly reports. Running a business or investing in a business based on quarterly earnings doesn't make any sense at all to me. There are many, many things that can happen  during the course of a year. Good decisions can have bad short-term outcomes but be great for the business long-term. </p><p> What's your worst investing  decision? </p><p> A lot of what I do is running businesses, rather than buying stocks. My worst decision is probably when I know I have the wrong chief executive running the business and I keep on waiting to make the difficult decision of replacing him. First of all, I'm probably friends with the person, so I don't want to fire him. I made the decision to have him as chief executive, so I don't want to admit that I was wrong. And above all, there's the human dimension. It's tough on the person. It's tough on his family. It's tough on the organization that he's leaving. So I have too many times delayed, delayed, delayed. </p><p> And lots of damage has been  done by waiting too long. </p><p> Is there anything about the economy, the markets or  business conditions that keeps you up at night? </p><p> The answer is no. But I believe that in running any business, you fundamentally need a very strong balance sheet. Fortunately, we've been able to create a fortress balance sheet at Onex. We have no debt whatsoever and a billion and a half in cash on hand. So I don't lose any sleep at night. </p><p> Were there times in the past when you did lose sleep? </p><p> Sure, in 2008, when the markets all turned desperately bad. We had roughly a couple hundred million in cash on hand and worried that wasn't enough, and made some decisions to sell some businesses to get a stronger balance sheet. In retrospect, I wish we hadn't done that. </p><p> Why is that? </p><p> It was the right thing to strengthen the balance sheet. But I'm sorry that we sold some very good businesses. </p><p> What would you do with a windfall? </p><p> Buy Onex shares. /B.M. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20140131ROBMAGFEB2014P262728293031323334353637</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BDF-RVD1-JCRP-C264-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7012\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Ignore value and balance sheets and let your computer do the hard work for you.No, that's not a joke. Founded by mathematics professor Jim Simons in 1982,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/pro/portfolio/renaissance-technologies/\">Renaissance Technologies</url>boasts one of the best track records in investment history. In the 1990s, the flagship Medallion fund earned record-breaking cumulative returns of 2,478%. And more recently, the firm's 2009 performance gave it the top ranking for large fund performance.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-warren-buffett-buying-2013.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying</url>RenTec is a quant shop, which means that the firm uses computer models to figure out which stocks it should add to its massive $38 billion equity portfolio. Rather than looking for value stories, the firm's models hone in on trends in price action and statistical relationships between securities. That quantitative bent requires a serious brain trust, and Renaissance has it.Of the firm's 150 people, around half hold PhDs in scientific fields -- physicists and statisticians aren't exactly the demographics you'd find at most Wall Street firms. But that focus on hiring the smartest unconventional thinkers has helped fuel some of the biggest gains in the industry.By looking at RenTec's 13F filing with the SEC, we can get a partial peek at some of the big relationships that the firm is putting to work for its institutional and internal investors -- without paying the 5% management fee and 44% profit participation that the firm charges its clients.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-under-10-hedge-funds-love.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Under $10 Hedge Funds Love</url>With that, here's a glimpse at      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/rhinostocks/portfolio/renaissance-technologies-new-buys-q2-2013/\">five of the new names</url>that <person><nameText>Renaissance Technologies </nameText></person>added to its portfolio in the second quarter.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>The biggest buy by far in the second quarter was<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/AAPL/\">AAPL</url>). Renaissance picked up 714,490 shares of the technology giant, building a $283 million stake in the firm at current price levels. RenTec isn't the only big institutional name that's been picking up shares of Apple lately. Last week,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/pro/portfolio/Carl-Icahn/\">Carl Icahn</url>announced that he'd taken on a massive billion-dollar stake in the Cupertino, California-based company. Icahn and Renaissance bought for very different reasons, but the end result is the same: they're both bullish on Apple this summer.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/4-big-tech-stocks-traders-radars.html-1\">&gt;&gt;4 Big Tech Stocks on Traders' Radars</url>Apple sports a bargain valuation right now thanks to a major decline from the highs that the firm set last fall. Apple sports a price-to-earnings ratio of just 12 -- a modest multiple that reflects investors' belief that the firm can't continue the breakneck growth it's achieved in recent years. But back Apple's mammoth cash position out of the equation, and Apple's P/E drops flat to 7. There's a lot of attention on Apple's media event scheduled for Sept. 10. The potential for two new iPhone models as well as more speculative offers such as an Apple television and watch could provide a major catalyst for upside in Apple's sales. Meanwhile, the firm's Macintosh computer sales continue to crush the rest of the industry in terms of profitability and market share growth. With shares above $500 for the first time since January, the second half looks strong for this $458 billion tech stock.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Citigroup</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>Big bank<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Citigroup</emphasis>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/C/\">C</url>) is another name that Renaissance newly initiated in the most recent quarter. Simons and company added 3.7 million shares of Citi to thier portfolio, building a position worth $177 million. Citi is one of the biggest banks in the world, with 1.9 trillion in assets and more than a quarter of a million employees. And it's one of the biggest beneficiaries from the equity rally that's propelled the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">S&amp;P 500</emphasis>more than 16% higher this year.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-poised-breakouts.html-37\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Poised for Breakouts</url>Like its peers, Citi has made a big about-face in recent years, changing its focus back to conventional banking. As a result, Citi's shareholders are seeing profitability again. Scale matters in the banking business -- that's why Citigroup's $1.87 trillion in assets are worth paying attention to. Despite its size, hefty exposure to emerging markets means that the firm has the ability to tap undersaturated loan markets with burgeoning middle class populations. While those growth opportunities don't come without risks, the relatively vanilla nature of the rest of the financial sector makes it look a whole lot more attractive.But that doesn't mean that Citi's shares are attractive. Granted, they're not      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-toxic-stocks-you-should-sell.html\">toxic</url>, but then again, an abundance of regulatory restrictions and the possibility for more skeletons in Citi's closet makes it look less appealing. If you're looking for exposure to banking stocks, think regional names instead.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ConAgra Foods</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>2013 is panning out to be a strong year for<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ConAgra Foods</emphasis>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/CAG/\">CAG</url>). Shares of the $15 billion food processor have rallied more than 19% since the calendar flipped over to January, besting the S&amp;P's impressive run by a small margin. ConAgra is one of the largest major food companies in the world, with a broad stable of retail brands that includes Chef Boyardee, Healthy Choice and Banquet as well as a commercial business that supplies restaurants and food service clients.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-stocks-poised-pop-bullish-earnings.html-15\">&gt;&gt;5 Stocks Poised to Pop on Bullish earnings</url>ConAgra's household name brands aren't the only ones you'll find on grocery shelves. Thanks to the acquisition of Ralcorp at the beginning of the year, ConAgra greatly expanded its presence as a private label food manufacturer, a business that's in high demand as grocery firms try to boost their margins by introducing store brands. While the Ralcorp acquisition does risk some cannibalization, CAG should make up for it from cost savings and exposure to channels where the firm's conventional brands don't compete.The decision to move away from commodity processing is a good one for ConAgra; it helps to insulate the firm from commodity risks that it's already exposed to as a food processor, and it also increases the portion of sales that it's able to convert into profits. Even if CAG isn't the most exciting name on the list, investors could do a lot worse after the transformational year this stock is having. <person><nameText>Renaissance Technologies </nameText></person>picked up a 2.89 million share position in the stock this past quarter.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ConocoPhillips</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ConocoPhillips</emphasis>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/COP/\">COP</url>) is another stock that's been undergoing a transformation. That's because the $81 billion oil and gas company spun off its downstream operations into<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Phillips 66</emphasis>(      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/PSX/\">PSX</url>) last May, a move that made ConocoPhillips a pure play oil and gas producer with proven reserves sitting at 8.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent and a much more attractive balance sheet.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/5-rocket-stocks-buy-now.html\">&gt;&gt;5 Rocket Stocks to Buy Now</url>Around half of ConocoPhillips' reserves come from natural gas. That's an attractive mix, especially given how the firm's supermajor peers have been falling all over themselves to boost exposure to nagtas by acquiring big producers in recent years. With oil prices holding onto the high end of their historic range, natgas prices are starting to see some buoyancy as consumers substitute one fuel for the other. By shedding its downstream assets, COP is able to focus on the most profitable side of the energy sector right now.<person><nameText>Renaissance Technologies </nameText></person>picked up a 1.39 million share position in the firm in the most recent quarter, adding more than $84 million worth of exposure in COP to the firm's portfolio.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comcast</emphasis>=\"Scripts/swfobject_modified.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;</p><h>Content on this page requires a newer version of Adobe Flash Player.</h><p>Being a virtual monopoly has its advantages - just ask<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comcast</emphasis>(<url normalizedValue=\"http://stockpickr.com/symbol/CMCSA/\">CMCSA</url>). Comcast benefits by being the only game in town over much of its coverage area, a benefit of owning the costly cable infrastructure that connects 53 million households and makes Comcast the largest cable utility in the U.S. Around half of those 53 million homes are paying TV, internet, or phone subscribers.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.stockpickr.com/4-stocks-profit-bounce.html\">&gt;&gt;4 Stocks to Profit From the Bounce</url>That \"network effect\" is one of Comcast's biggest advantages in 2013. Even as new rivals offer competing services over other mediums, Comcast's modern network has the benefit of the hefty bandwidth and expandability that cable provides. From an operations standpoint, the firm's acquisition of 51% of NBC Universal has a similar effect of ratcheting margins wider. Since it's now able to greatly reduce its licensing costs for content it owns, it can earn a bigger profit for its efforts. Top-line growth opportunities exist as Comcast consolidates its customer base with \"triple play\" deals that package complementary services together and hammer down customer acquisition costs.Being a monopoly has some downsides. For one, the firm is subject to more regulatory scrutiny than most. For another, Comcast has a horrific customer service reputation and a large number of customers who would likely leave given a decent substitute. That's a pretty good reason to be wary of CMCSA as new tech enables more competition from other utilities. But Renaissance is a fan of Comcast nonetheless. The hedge fund bought a 1.39 million share position in the cable utility this past quarter. That's good for an $81 million chunk of RenTec's portfolio.

As the Chinese economy expands, we seize opportunities.

The big tech titans, who are now fostering new industries and platforms, are long-term clients of BOCI -Wang Zhongze, BOCI </p><p>Take the case of technology and fintech deals as an example.Daniel Ng, head of investment banking and executive head of global client coverage at BOCI, acknowledges that there has been some resurgence of western banks in those two sectors, where they have more comparable companies and have built up sector knowledge.

Bank of Chinais still a highly leverageable name, however.\"<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Up and down: BOCI's ECM volume track record</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Source: Dealogic</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>BOCI worked on 10 IPOs last year, worth a total of $5.2 billion, data from Dealogic shows. Except for the $118 million Hong Kong listing of Wisdom Education International Holdings, for which BOCI was a global coordinator along with four other firms, and the $74 million flotation of Precision Tsugami (China) Corp where it was the sole global coordinator, the bank held joint bookrunning roles in all the other IPOs.Bank of China's Singapore branch was a joint bookrunner and underwriter on Dasin Retail Trust's Singapore IPO.In comparison, BOCI worked on 11 listings in Hong Kong in 2016, worth around $15 billion, while Bank of China's Singapore unit ran two IPOs worth just under $1 billion collectively.The build-out of BOCI's ECM business began about a decade ago. In 2007, BOCI, through various units, had league table credits for 18 ECM transactions and $8.9 billion in deals, according to Dealogic. This rose to $15.9 billion via 30 trades in 2010 before falling back over the next three years.In 2014, the numbers rebounded to a peak of $22.1 billion and 20 deals, but have since declined.Bankers at the firm admit the numbers don't look good, and acknowledge losing out on a number of prominent technology-related listings last year. They cite gaming firm Razer's IPO of around $530 million, and the $867 million listing of online car retailer Yixin Group \"\" both in Hong Kong \"\" as examples.But they say this is more down to BOCI wanting to fully understand new businesses before getting involved.\"In 2017, there were lots of small IPOs that we didn't get involved in as we were not familiar with their risk and profile,\" says the senior investment banker at BOCI. \"Many were unicorn and new economy companies. Clearly, when the deals were happening, we were troubled by the fact that we don't understand all these businesses.But with the benefit of hindsight, they all dropped in secondary markets. We're not involved and now investors are complaining.\"BOCI bankers can certainly feel vindicated. Razer, for instance, priced its listing at HK$3.88 ($0.49) a share in November last year. The stock was down 42.5% by early June. Yixin, meanwhile, was down by nearly half to HK$3.91 a share by early June, from its November IPO price of HK$7.70.Tech pipelineCFO Wang says he's positive about BOCI's ECM market share this year, especially in the Hong Kong IPO market, thanks in part to the many big technology-related deals in the pipeline.That doesn't mean the bank will jump in with its eyes closed. Its cautious approach so far has saved it from the fate of a number of international banks who have been penalized by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) for sponsor failures or have had IPO applications returned for lack of full disclosure.Citi, the most recent to be rapped, was fined HK$57 million in May for its work as a sponsor in 2009 on the IPO of China-based Real Gold Mining.Standard Chartered has also been penalized, while UBS is appealing against having its IPO sponsorship licence suspended. And in the middle of 2016, the Hong Kong bourse returned an IPO application from Shenhua Health Holdings, which had JPMorgan Securities (Far East) \"\" JPMorgan's local arm \"\" as the sole sponsor. Going global is a trend no one can reverse. Through our own network and collaboration with strategic partners, we are present in all major financial centres -Liew Shan Hock, BOCI \"We take our compliance track record very seriously, which can ensure the sustainability of our businesses and reputation,\" adds BOCI's Ng. There are challenges, however, as many new entrants are coming into the market aggressively and fees for IPO deals are declining rapidly, he says.BOCI did not sponsor a single IPO last year. But as of early June this year, it had executed two IPOs as sponsor in Hong Kong, worth a total of $944 million, according to Dealogic: it was a joint sponsor on Bank of Gansu's Hong Kong listing in January and on Tsit Wing International Holdings' IPO in May.\"We maintain a very strong sponsorship track record,\" says Ng. \"We have an excellent reputation in the industry for our expediency, rigour and professionalism in execution, demonstrated by zero compliance breaches and no return or rejection of our IPO applications.\" One thing that helps BOCI navigate such hurdles is the branch network of Bank of China(Hong Kong) Ltd (BOCHK), which has a big retail investor base in Hong Kong.In addition to its global institutional reach, BOCI also provides margin finance to investors in IPOs, while also helping with renminbi remittances when investors need to sign up to IPO shares. The fact that BOCHK is a clearing bank for Hong Kong dollars and renminbi also serves as an advantage, say bankers.Working closelyWhat makes BOCI stand apart from many of its peers is its strategy of following not only its companies closely, but also the people running those companies.<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Tong Li, BOCI</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>\"Our all-round business strategy is to provide comprehensive product and service lines,\" says chief executive Li. \"We were the adviser on the China side for ChemChina's acquisition of Syngenta. With that, we made use of BOCI's strengths \"\" the combination of balance sheet of BOC and network by providing advisory services and funding.\"It was one of the largest deals at $43 billion. The deal showed that we closely follow our clients as well, as the ChemChina CFO was previously the CFO of Cofco,\" a state-owned food processing company.ChemChina's acquisition of Swiss seed-maker Syngenta was a landmark deal, tapping into many parts of the capital markets. The purchase was funded by loans syndicated into Asia and Europe, eventually taken out by a loan-plus-bond combination.Ng says that for BOCI's leveraged and structured finance business, the bank follows its clients in their \"~going global' expansion by targeting those with M&amp;A financing needs. He also acknowledges the collaborative mind-set within the business.\"Besides traditional lending business, we also built up our own distribution network and credentials in the area of arranger/ facilitator in some of the projects,\" he says. \"In addition, we have been working closely with other group companies to provide innovative financing solutions to clients.\"The balance-sheet strength of its parent, Bank of China, has been on show time and again. It was number one in the Asia ex-Japan dollar bookrunner syndicated loans league table in 2017, with credits for $8.2 billion of deals and an 8.2% market share. In 2016, in comparison, it ranked ninth with $3.4 billion in credits and a 3.1% market share, while the year before that it was top with an 8.1% share and $8.1 billion in credits, according to Dealogic.Its roster of clients last year included Cosco Shipping Holdings Co, where Bank of Chinaarranged a chunky $4.3 billion loan to support the company's purchase of Orient Overseas, as well as the likes of tech names JD.com and Xiaomi, and Petron Corp of the Philippines. It is also a lender to India's Reliance Industries and a handful of Chinese property credits.RelianceOne thing is clear though, no matter the asset class: BOCI is, unsurprisingly, extremely reliant on Chinese and Hong Kong clients.Samson Lee, BOCI's head of financial products, says mainland China and Hong Kong remain the bank's core contributors, accounting for 90% or more of revenues. Chinese borrowers are the biggest dollar bond issuers in Asia.Wang Lixin, head of private equity, says his division operates in both Hong Kong and China. Apart from principal investment, the PE division manages three funds: the China Culture Industrial Investment Fund and Bohai Industrial Investment Fund, both of which are domestic renminbi funds; and China Infrastructure Fund, which is a dollar fund that focuses on China's infrastructure-related industries.Alvin Chua, head of sales, trading and research, says the business spends more than 90% of its time on Chinese corporate credit, although it does occasionally try to reach beyond that.Chua adds that the biggest test for the division is to diversify from a single product \"\" Chinese credit \"\" into global products.BOCI's management realizes that, and the bank is starting to expand beyond China. Lee says the financial products business's target is to expand in the Asean (Association of southeast Asian nations) market by building its team in Singapore, where it has a debt desk that is bringing in business and adding to the group's league table positioning. The bank is also building its M&amp;A capabilities in Singapore and southeast Asia.Bank of Chinaseparately launched a new DCM centre in Singapore in June last year to promote the Chinese bond market in the region. The Singapore branch is already active in ECM and has executed a few IPOs there.BOCI also signed a strategic agreement with US bank Jefferies in January this year to jointly provide investment banking advisory and capital markets services to clients globally.\"The tie-up with Jefferies is mutually complementary to both as we can provide integrated services to clients,\" says Liew Shan Hock, head of financial institutions and executive head of the investment banking division.\"Going global is a trend no one can reverse,\" Hock adds. \"Through our own network and collaboration with strategic partners, we are present in all major financial centres. In addition to identifying or evaluating targets, we can advise on funding, assist with internal and regulatory approvals, assist with valuations, and support any liaison with Sasac and the ministry of finance. That gives us a unique position.\"<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Wang Zhongze, BOCI</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Sasac is the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, a special commission of China's state council that supervises and manages state-owned assets of enterprises under the purview of the central government.</p><p>And then there's the much-talked-about Belt and Road Initiative, a pet project of China's president Xi Jinping to promote economic cooperation among countries along what was the old Silk Road and beyond \"\" linking Asia, the Middle East, Europe, Russia and eastern Africa.</p><p>The initiative is expected to provide abundant investment banking opportunities \"\" which BOCI is keen to capture \"\" across project finance, M&amp;A, bonds and IPOs, and should give a further impetus to the internationalization of the renminbi.</p><p>Wang, BOCI's CFO, says the investment needs across BRI regions is estimated to be around $1.5 trillion by 2030, presenting immense opportunities for BOCI. With many Chinese companies setting up operations in BRI areas, BOCI's strategy is to follow these Chinese clients and provide them with investment banking services, he says.Cutting words</p><p>How do rivals regard BOCI? Perhaps not surprisingly in the competitive arena of investment banking, many will readily disparage a rival from the safety of an anonymous quote.</p><p>\"BOCI's investment banking business has become completely marginalized in the last few years,\" sighs the former BOCI senior investment banker, who is based in Hong Kong. \"The glory days are long gone and won't be repeated.\"</p><p>Those are cutting words. The head of DCM at another Chinese investment bank, who has worked at both international and mainland firms, says BOCI's DCM business, in particular, is \"going downhill\", which he attributes to intense competition internally among various Bank of Chinasubsidiaries \"\" although data from league table providers belies this accusation.</p><p>A senior ECM banker away from the bank points out that BOCI has missed out on a lot of IPO mandates in the last year. A loan syndications banker suggests the firm is less visible now in the market than it was before.</p><p>How much veracity do these bankers' remarks have? Has BOCI actually lost ground in investment banking in Asia?</p><p>One factor blurring the picture is the existence of numerous Bank of Chinaarms offering similar capital markets services; this confuses many bankers and, some argue, may be undermining its long-term success.</p><p>Even bankers at the Bank of Chinagroup can get confused about the various branches, subsidiaries and offices within the firm, and which entities provide what service.</p><p>To give an example, BOCI is incorporated and based in Hong Kong and is effectively the holding company of the whole BOCI group.

Perhaps the biggest impact of this kind of organization is felt in BOCI's debt franchise.</p><p>\"What is well known in the market, but will be difficult for outsiders to see, is that BOCHK and Bank of China's Hong Kong branch and Singapore branch, as well as BOCI, all want to underwrite debt offerings internationally, leading to a lot of internal competition,\" says the head of DCM at a Chinese investment bank. \"The question then arises about who will be the closest to the head office. It's not an issue just with BOCI, but other Chinese investment banks also have similar problems.\"</p><p>The former BOCI senior investment banker adds: \"Bank of Chinalooks good in the league tables because all the businesses are banded together, but there is a lot of internal fighting on the fixed income side. There is no doubt this is destructive to building the business correctly.\"</p><p>Bankers at BOCI, however, take a more measured stance. The senior investment banker who works for the firm admits there is some rivalry within the fixed income teams. But he insists it's not a bad thing.</p><p>For starters, he too points to league tables from the likes of Dealogic and Bloomberg, which group all the transactions by various Bank of Chinaentities into one. If these numbers are dissected, he reckons BOCI typically accounts for 60% or 70% of all the DCM business.</p><p>He offers a simple explanation for the eagerness of various Bank of Chinaentities to get in on the international debt underwriting business \"\" because it can be easily done.</p><p>\"The DCM business is a low-hanging fruit, which is why so many Bank of Chinaunits want to do this,\" he says. \"We have too many clients with deposits wanting to buy bonds that are issued by BOCI or other banks. And we have some bankers that say: \"~Hey, we have just hired two bankers to do DCM'. They don't need to know the GICs or the Pimcos of the world. They just need to know the private banking arm within the bank or the high net-worth branch of the bank \"\" these are natural investors that can be leveraged on.\"</p><p>But in addition, \"BOCI has a full-fledged investment banking desk: we do credit ratings and have access to the Pimcos of the world,\" he says. \"If the Bank of Chinagroup is not directly involved in deals, then we can also tap into their investor base. This can be seen as a positive advantage to the whole BOC group.\"</p><p>He also points to the fact that BOCI has a M&amp;A unit that provides cross-border advisory services. The Bank of Chinahead office is now trying to create a similar function.</p><p>\"Again, it's low hanging,\" says the senior banker at BOCI. \"There are clients asking for such opportunities and for funding. Our client base is big and the bank is big. And depending on the nature of the deal, it can get dropped to different parts of the organization.\"</p><p>Bank of Chinagroup's increasing presence in international debt markets is reflected in the numbers. In Dealogic's Asia ex-Japan offshore DCM bookrunners league table last year, Bank of Chinaplaced fourth with credits for $18.2 billion through 156 transactions versus fifth place in 2016 for $11.6 billion of trades, through a 87 deals. In 2015, it held the ninth spot for $7.7 billion in credits and a total of 70 deals.</p><p>The numbers look less attractive when it comes to revenues, however. In Dealogic's Asia ex-Japan ex-onshore China DCM revenues table last year, Bank of Chinaplaced 23rd with $9 million and a 1.1% market share. In 2016, it ranked 27th with $6 million of revenues; in 2015, it earned just $1 million, which put it in 77th place.</p><p>Figures from Dealogic are generally good, but they sometimes don't capture the full picture. BOCI does not directly release details of its financial performance. But CFO Wang says the bank's profits grew 30% year on year in 2017.</p><p>\"The average return on equity of the top eight western banks is around 5% \"\" ours is over 10%,\" Wang tells Asiamoney. \"In 2017, our brokerage, DCM, asset management and trading desks provided large contributions to profits. M&amp;A was also a big contributor to the bottom line.\"</p><p>Lee, the head of financial products, says his business maintains a very high risk-adjusted return on capital, which he reckons is much better than the market average.</p><p>Lixin, head of BOCI's private equity operations that support the bank's investment banking business, adds that his team has collectively achieved an internal rate of return above the average performance of some well-known names in the private equity industry.</p><p>\"In recent years, many Chinese giant companies have raised capital,\" says chief executive Li. \"We have found opportunities as we know the market, the culture and know how to deal with China.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-3817866</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXM-6FF1-JD1P-T08B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3642\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0009H0C</classCode><className>BANK OF CHINA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC6021 NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>BKC (ASX)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>3988 (HKSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000919</classCode><className>INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLBG</classCode><className>CORPORATE FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000475</classCode><className>DEPOSITORY SERVICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

In recent regulatory filings, Elliott said it purchased more than 5 percent of BMC and proposed a slate of five directors - half of the company's board.</p><p>BMC's management responded the way so many managements do: It adopted a poison pill to thwart a takeover attempt and said shareholders are better off if the company remains independent.</p><p>During the past couple of weeks, the two sides have been bickering through a corporate he-said-she-said of regulatory filings.</p><p>BMC has struggled to move from making software for big mainframe computers into more lucrative markets for information technology and services, such as cloud computing.</p><p>\"The transition has become more challenging in recent years, as BMC has suffered from sluggish growth, substantial execution challenges and underperformance on its business plan, and new competitive pressures,\" Jesse Cohn, Elliott's portfolio manager, wrote in a letter to BMC's board.</p><p>As a result, the market values BMC as a growth-impaired company, and Elliott believes its value will continue to erode if it remains independent.</p><p>Not surprisingly, BMC disagrees, pointing out that revenue grew 5 percent to a record in its last fiscal year, which ended March 31.</p><p>Profit, however, fell 12 percent and license bookings - a measure of future growth - fell 5 percent.</p><p>\"We cannot imagine that the board truly believes that the results in 2012 were 'strong,' and, if it does, stockholders should be alarmed,\" Elliott said in the letter.</p><p>$12.7 million</p><p>Yet the board apparently felt the results were strong enough to make BMC's chief executive, Robert Beauchamp, one of the city's highest-paid executives, showering him with almost $12.7 million in total compensation.</p><p>Representatives of both BMC and Elliott declined to comment beyond the filings.</p><p>Elliott knows how to shake things up in the tech sector, having taken an activist role at several companies that led to sales, including a $2 billion bid for software maker Novell in 2010 that drove it into the arms of Attachmate.</p><p>BMC would be attractive to \"multiple strategic acquirers,\" especially companies looking to capitalize on its customer base and technology or to private equity funds that would generate a premium for the company's shareholders, Cohn wrote.</p><p>Blurring lines</p><p>For years, the lines between hardware companies and software companies have been blurring. Platforms have been changing rapidly, and many of the tech giants have been caught flat-footed. Dell, for example, has said it wants to buy a software company to attract more high- dollar business customers looking to buy systems and services from a single provider.</p><p>For years, Dell has struggled to move beyond its PC business. Just this week, its shares tumbled after the company said revenue for its current quarter would be less than analysts forecast.</p><p>Cisco Systems is in a similar situation. The company once made network gear and has moved to information services where the profits are fatter. A software company like BMC would only enhance its market position.</p><p>A big tech company like Dell or Cisco - or for that matter, other software markers like Oracle or SAP - might have little interest in BMC's plodding mainframe business, which might be sold separately to private equity investors. Hewlett-Packard might be interested, but the company remains in turmoil after repeated management shake-ups, announcing earlier this week plans to cut 27,000 jobs.</p><p>Falling stock price</p><p>Regardless, shareholders have little incentive to be patient. The company's stock fell 24 percent in the year before Elliott announced its intentions, wiping out about $2 billion in market value.</p><p>It's not clear if investors will recover all of that through a sale, but Elliott's move already is drawing others to the stock. Convex Management, an activist hedge fund with ties to Carl Icahn, recently bought a 1 percent stake in the company as well, according to regulatory filings.</p><p>Meanwhile, BMC's shares have climbed 6 percent since Elliott's letter was filed.</p><p>In other words, BMC is now in play. It's a wake-up call that needs to be answered with more than the same old responses from management.</p><p>Loren Steffy, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:loren.steffy@chron.com\">loren.steffy@chron.com</email>, is the Chronicle's business columnist.

'You are not on track to meet your retirement goal,' replies Amazon.com's voice-activated digital assistant, with not a bit of sugarcoating. Then she suggests turning over $76 a month to Fidelity Investments and its advisers.This won't actually happen if you try it on your Amazon Alexa device at home. </p><p>It's a demonstration put on by EMoney Advisor, a company owned by Fidelity, in its offices in Radnor, Pennsylvania. Amazon provides software for third-party developers to experiment with new functions. Fidelity is trying to find ways to apply artificial intelligence, computer algorithms and voice-\u00adrecognition software to the hidebound world of money management and investing. There's some urgency to the task. These days, investing firms figure they'll either master the digital world or become yet another of Silicon Valley's victims. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]Each year, Fidelity gathers scores of technologists and executives to confront threats to the 71-year-old business, which manages $2.4 trillion and is one of the world's biggest mutual-fund companies and retirement-plan administrators. Like generals and soldiers in a war game, they sketch out what they would do in all kinds of scenarios, such as a market crash or a merger that created a super rival. Just as ominous, perhaps, they ask: What if Amazon distributed financial products or offered its own financial advice? What if Google bought its own money manager? Those tech companies could then do to the investment industry what they've done to businesses from publishing to electronics, squeezing already-shrinking profit margins and driving out established players. Even now, the soaring popularity of \u00admarket-tracking index funds is pushing investment-management fees ever closer to nil.'We're working to innovate so we don't get caught flat-footed,' says Bill Doyle, head of research for Fidelity Labs, which oversees the company's experiments in financial technology. For now there's one big thing keeping the tech predators at bay: Getting into finance would pull Amazon and its ilk into closely regulated businesses in the U.S. But Fidelity and others see no guarantees this will deter tech companies forever. And beyond U.S. borders, where many financial companies look for growth, tech is already breaking through. In 2013, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding started selling a money-market fund. It is now the world's largest, with 1.56 trillion renminbi ($235.6 billion).Customers in the U.S., too, are ready to trust tech companies with their savings. More than half of investors with assets of at least $1\u2009million would consider using one of the top tech companies to manage their wealth, according to a survey by consulting firm Capgemini. Three-quarters of millennials would take a flyer on an offering from Google, Amazon, Apple or payments companies PayPal and Square over one from their own banks, according to a study by media company Viacom.'If Google comes out tomorrow and asks if I want to invest, I probably would,' says Marcus Storr, who heads hedge-fund investing at Germany-based Feri Family Trust. The search-engine giant, a unit of Alphabet, has data on billions of its users and millions of dollars to splurge on the best coders from around the world, who could automate the search for lucrative trades.U.S. technology firms have already entered finance. Apple customers pay with their phones. Amazon lets customers use its system to buy products on other sites. It offers loans to merchants. 'Alexa and Siri could one day become your financial assistant, cutting even deeper into commissions' for advisers, says Lex Sokolin, who directs financial-technology strategy at consultancy Autonomous Research. Amazon, Apple and Google \u2014 big players in digital assistants \u2014 had no comment.To head off the threat, investment companies are forming partnerships with technology firms. Earlier this year, Boston-based Acadian Asset Management struck a deal so its portfolio managers could use Microsoft's Bing Predicts, which makes forecasts using search and social-media data, to help pick stocks; that agreement later ended. Barry Benjamin, a PricewaterhouseCoopers partner who oversees money-management consulting, says tech companies may prefer joint ventures to avoid the legal risks of investing. Otherwise, 'they really have to bite the bullet and subject themselves to the scrutiny of financial regulation,' Benjamin says. He expects U.S. tech firms might be more likely to focus on Asia and other developing markets.Money managers are also developing and acquiring technology to keep the loyalty of investment advisers trying to compete in an increasingly automated world. BlackRock, led by Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink, in recent years has been buying stakes in other companies, particularly technology firms. Through these purchases, the company is pushing into new lines of business. In 2013, BlackRock helped seed a startup called Personal Capital, which sells financial software that lets customers budget and track investments. Two years later, BlackRock bought FutureAdvisor, which creates automated investment software. Rob Kapito, president of BlackRock, said that while his firm views the big tech giants as a potential threat, it is unlikely those companies will offer funds because their reputation would take a hit when they lose money. 'If they have superior technology, we may want to utilize it and bring it into our ecosystem,' says Kapito. Fidelity bought EMoney in 2015. It sells software to investment advisers that's designed to make it easier to interact with their customers on budgeting for weddings, college or retirement. It employs 600 people in an office that looks more like a Silicon Valley startup than a unit of a fund company, with the standard-issue beanbag chairs, huddle rooms, and Segway scooter. 'All of us in this industry need to be sort of eyes wide open around disruption,' says EMoney CEO Ed O'Brien.

If history is a guide, the tech barons will learn nothing from the experience. They will continue to grab all they can until policy makers, as happened under Teddy Roosevelt, finally say \"enough.\"</p><p> And the tech barons will have their feelings hurt, just as J.P. Morgan couldn't believe he was being persecuted before Congress after effectively having bailed out the U.S. government in the midst of a financial crisis.</p><p> Yesterday and today, market manipulation was and is a common occurrence; Facebook is famous for buying up any company that it perceives as a threat to its business, and Apple has built some of its riches on the backs of individual app developers.</p><p> For deviousness though, they would be hard-pressed to match Jay Gould and James Fisk, who in 1869 cooked up a scheme to drive up the price of gold to entice Western farmers to sell more grain \u2014 which would then need to be shipped on their railroads.</p><p> Today, it's the search giant Google that stands accused of manipulating not currency but information, which today is about one and the same. The enormous power of a search engine can be visualized by considering the worth, if you are a dry cleaner, of having your website come up first in a search instead of on page two.</p><p> Members of Congress, some of whom pretty clearly have a hair-thin grasp of technology themselves, are primed to throw their regulatory lasso around the mammoth tech firms on antitrust grounds. Whether that is necessary is hard to say. It might be a better use of Congress' time to recoup the billions of dollars in taxes that big tech avoids by sheltering profits overseas.</p><p> What tycoons never seem to realize though, is that it is possible to avoid regulation simply by doing good work. If the public is happy, Congress is loath to intervene.</p><p> But we're seeing tech start to go down some of the same roads that robber barons traveled in the Industrial Revolution, putting their own personal riches ahead of the customer and the worker. When the people get mad, Congress feels more empowered to regulate.</p><p> And people are mad that Facebook is cultivating Russian interference in our elections. They're mad that Apple has been pumping out junk keyboards and venturing off into forays in finance which, if early returns are an indication, it clearly knows nothing about. People are mad that Amazon, awash in money, treats employees as if we had returned to sweatshop days.</p><p> Needless to say, these problems could be addressed and all it would cost the guys at the top would be a little couch change off of their net worth. But perhaps the same brain wiring that makes them wizards in the world of commerce renders them incapable of seeing how a little more investment in product and people \u2014 and humanity \u2014 would shield them from unwanted congressional attacks.</p><p> From railroaders to financiers to oil companies to telecom, all have been taken down a peg through the years by antitrust salvos that but for just a little bit of generosity could have been avoided. Many a tycoon has learned the hard way that it costs just as much to be bad as it does to be good.</p><p> Tim Rowland is a Herald-Mail columnist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMD-1d9dec92f736bc4982e94727ed921585fd5a05d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C5FFB38D3AE NWBKMD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GY-Y251-JBCN-4515-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409144</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"779\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Herald-Mail.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

More than ever before, investment professionals are prepared to back lossmaking, highly valued companies in the belief that future growth will more than compensate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fund managers are not usually slow to spot a marketing opportunity, but for once their own response to this trend has been muted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Technology and Telecoms sector remains the fourth smallest in the Investment Association universe: just a handful of funds have been launched in the space over the past three years, and 70 per cent of its funds have been around for eight years or more.</p><p>One reason for this is the perception that investors have a limited interest in thematic funds - even if the theme in question has helped propel the bull market higher in recent years.</p><p>While that may be the case for advisers, data from Asset Allocator, a sister publication to Money Management, shows a reasonable amount of interest in dedicated technology funds from discretionary fund managers. Polar Capital's open-ended offering is by far the most popular strategy among this group, although funds such as Fidelity Global Technology and Gam Star Technology have also attracted interest.</p><p>Retail investors have tended to prefer the Scottish Mortgage investment trust as their dedicated technology play of choice. The Baillie Gifford-managed vehicle does not qualify for our analysis because it sits in the Global sector rather than the tech universe - and because Baillie Gifford does not classify the strategy as solely a tech product. Were it included, its performance would rank it eighth in Table 1 over five years, and second over 10 years.</p><p>Relatively speaking, advisers' interest in Scottish Mortgage has been less voracious - though this is because of their reticence to buy investment trusts rather than a preference for dedicated technology funds. Instead, they remain content to tap into the tech story via a mainstream US equity fund.</p><p>In keeping with this, net sales of technology funds look fairly muted at first glance. Average monthly retail sales for the sector over the past year stand at just \u00a336m: hardly a sign of considerable interest.</p><p>But there are signs that more are being swayed by the option of dedicated exposure. While total sales of tech funds may be limited, they remained in the black during the fourth quarter of last year - despite that being a period in which tech stocks suffered a notable derailment. And the past two months for which data is available, April and May, show a renewed uptick in interest from investors.</p><p>Add to this the fact there are just 16 funds in the sector, and sales suddenly look very healthy. To put that another way, the typical tech fund has sold better than the average fund in any other equity sector (barring Global) over the past 12 months.</p><p>Sentiment That is very much in keeping with global trends. Technology stocks' latest surge in performance - the average tech fund is second only to the US Smaller Companies sector when it comes to returns in the first half of 2019 - has led to renewed concerns over herd behaviour. Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch's monthly fund manager survey saw 25 per cent of investors rank US technology shares as the world's most crowded trade in June.</p><p>If nothing else, this percentage did represent a marked fall from the 35 per cent who said the same in May. That is perhaps because many are growing more nervous of the sector: the investment bank's survey also reported that global managers' allocations to technology shares fell 13 percentage points to a sixmonth low in June.</p><p>That low still constitutes a net overweight of 21 per cent, admittedly. But there are other reasons to be cautious.</p><p>Estimates from data provider FactSet predict that the US technology sector will see earnings fall by 7 per cent year on year in the second quarter - a drop matched only by firms operating in the materials sector.</p><p>FactSet predicts that US earnings as a whole will contract by 2.8 per cent, an outcome that would mark the first \"earnings recession\" - two or more quarters of contraction - since 2016.</p><p>There is a significant caveat to this data, too. A rejig of benchmark indices earlier this year means that some of the largest US technology companies, specifically social media businesses like Facebook and Google parent Alphabet, are no longer counted as part of the technology sector.</p><p>These companies face problems of their own. The Financial Times reported in early June that regulators in the US were considering antitrust investigations into Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple. Details remain scarce, and the precise targets of any would-be investigations are unclear, but US politicians are also becoming more forthright on the matter.</p><p>Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has pledged to break up the big tech firms if elected, while Republicans are also making more critical noises.</p><p>This increased scrutiny has arguably been inevitable ever since Big Tech became such a defining part of everyday existence. From investors' point of view, however, it's only really in the past few years that the sector's performance has decoupled from other sectors.</p><p>Chart 1 (overleaf) records the performance of several sub-sectors of the FTSE World index, from technology to oil and gas. It indicates that tech's outperformance began in earnest in mid-2016, and hasn't looked back since - barring the notable drawdown recorded at the end of last year. The past six months have proven a case in point: gains for global technology stocks have far outstripped those recorded elsewhere this year.</p><p>Standouts Table 1 outlines all the tech-focused funds and trusts currently found in the relevant IA and Association of Investment Companies sectors, ranked by their fiveyear performance. Only those without the necessary track records have been excluded.</p><p>Topping the pile over both five and 10 years is Allianz Technology trust, a closedended fund run by Walter Price. Its medium-term figures are largely down to the significant gains produced in both 2016-17 and 2017-18, and have more than compensated for 2015-16 performance that was well below the IA sector average.</p><p>As with all funds in the sector, the Allianz trust is heavily weighted towards the US: the country accounts for 85 per cent of its assets. Top holdings include the likes of Facebook, Alphabet and Microsoft, but the latter, at 3.1 per cent of the fund, is a sizeable underweight compared with benchmarks' typical position of around 14-15 per cent.</p><p>Microsoft's resurgence in recent years is a sign that the technology story is not as simple as 'new tech' versus 'old tech': the company has managed to reposition itself via a push into areas such as cloud networks.</p><p>But the company's return to the top of benchmark weightings also speaks to a growing problem for active managers: big tech firms' dominance of the indices makes it hard for specialised funds to be anything other than underweight these companies.</p><p>For now, plenty of funds have been able to best the index. One passive fund, the L&amp;G offering, has been included in Table 1 as a reference point. Its performance suggests some investors would have been better off tracking an index during the past half decade. But the outsized gains delivered by other strategies makes the case for active management.</p><p>The funds and trusts run by Allianz, Polar Capital, Axa Investment Managers and Fidelity have, by and large, posted consistent doubledigit returns in each of the five discrete annual periods covered by Table 1. Their top holdings all tend to focus on the most recognisable tech names, but each strategy does have its own distinct characteristics. Axa IM's fund has an even greater underweight to Microsoft than the Allianz Trust, Fidelity has a notable overweight in Samsung, and none of the funds in question has materially backed Apple relative to the benchmark.</p><p>In performance terms, it's notable that Polar's openended fund has beaten its investment trust over five years and short-term time periods. But across 10 years it is the trust that has won out. Its one-year return is well below that of the sector, but there are reasons to think the closed-ended version is best placed to flourish if tech continues to outperform: as of mid-July it was trading on a discount to net asset value of more than 9 per cent, its widest level for three years.</p><p>Looking ahead, it seems unlikely that the next five years will be able to replicate the past half-decade. In total, 47 of the 60 discrete oneyear performance periods for the 12 funds and trusts featured in the table produced double-digit gains.

Global Healthcare AI to Reach $51.3 Billion by 2027 A report published by Meticulous Research finds that the global Healthcare AI market is expected to reach $51.3 billion by 2027 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 41.4 percent in the forecast period 2020-2027. An excerpt from the report's description looks at the increased funding for the AI in Healthcare market:Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are playing a very important role in the healthcare industry. AI is predominantly used in clinical research, robotic personal assistant, and big data analytics. Classic venture capitalists and corporate strategic investors are both investing generously in this space. According to the report from CB Insights, artificial intelligence-focused health care companies raised nearly $1 billion in funding in the first quarter of 2020. Also, healthcare analytics firm, Tricog Health India Pvt. (India), has raised $10.5 million in a series B round of funding. The start-up helps in the wellness, screening, and diagnosis of acute as well as chronic heart diseases using AI &amp; Machine Learning. The start-up has helped 3 million patients. As of 2020, the private sector continues to play a significant role, with venture capital (VC) funding for the top 50 firms in healthcare-related AI reaching $8.5 billion, and big tech firms, startups, pharmaceutical and medical-devices firms and health insurers, all engaging with the nascent AI healthcare ecosystem. Thus, the rising fund in the healthcare artificial intelligence is expected to fuel the growth in the AI market for healthcare during the forecast period.Sam Mowers, Investorideas.com Read and hear other editions of the AI Eye For a list of artificial intelligence stocks on Investorideas.com visit here or become an Investor Ideas member About Investorideas.com - News that Inspires Big Investing Ideas Investorideas.com is a recognized news source publishing third party news, research and original financial content.

Listen to the podcast https://www.investorideas.com/Audio/Podcasts/2019/103119-CEO-OTCQXWEYL.mp3<br/>Investorideas.com talks to CEO of Weyland Tech, Inc (OTCQX: $WEYL) about Fintech in Indonesia<br/>\"For 2018 we had top line revenues of $22.6 million,\" he said. \"This year, in the first nine months of operations ... based on our preliminary announcement ... we're already exceeding last year's entire full-year numbers in the first nine months of this year. </p><p>That is due to distribution partners, or what we call white label partnerships, who are seeing considerably higher growth from the additional functionality that we added in over this past nine months.\"Weyland, a developer and global provider of mobile business software applications, operates its CreateApp\u2122 platform-as-a-service (PaaS) across three continents and 10 countries, including some of the fastest-growing emerging markets in Southeast Asia. Suen indicated that a top priority of the company is an uplisting, which would enhance the company's profile and opportunities.\"The biggest one is the uplisting to Nasdaq, and that's key to expanding a much higher level of visibility which in turn would enable, or certainly imply, a higher market cap,\" he said. \"And subsequently the ability to fund a more exponential expansion plan.\"\"We believe that, upon gaining shareholder approval for management's discretion on a reverse split, we will be able to exercise a modest reverse split and immediately qualify for Nasdaq,\" he continued. \"We expect that to happen before the end of the year. And we're also, alongside that, evaluating merger and acquisition opportunities that would not only increase our scale, but would also increase the pipeline for products and services and also geographic expansion.\"Weyland typically enters markets with its CreateApp\u2122 platform-as-a-service (PaaS) application, which allows micro and small businesses to design apps themselves, and market and promote their goods and services to their end customers much more affordably than having a third party designer.\"Our app, CreateApp\u2122, enables the business owner to do a number of things, but the four primary ones are: a) to market and promote their goods and services, b) to enable them to sell online through the phone, c) to pay for them through the phone, and then d) have them delivered through logistics delivery or courier if it's nearby.What's interesting about ours is that it can be created by our customer within one to two hours at a maximum, and that's with zero technical skills,\" he said. \"It's extremely important because most micro to small business owners ... typically wouldn't have the time, expertise or resources available to build their own app. So what we provide is a very simple and streamlined toolkit to do so. Further, [for] the app itself, what we price to our clients at an average of $20 to $25 per month. And that compared to having a native app custom built by a professional services firm is actually quite inexpensive.\"The company is taking a different approach to the Indonesian market, where roughly 70 percent of the population is unbanked, according to Suen, and therefore rely on alternatives such as e-wallets. Because of this, Weyland has entered the Indonesian market via its subsidiary, Weyland Indonesia Perkasa (WIP), and its ewallet Atozpay.\"When you don't have bank accounts or credit cards ... trying to sell things through the phone - e-commerce and m-commerce - is extraordinarily difficult to do in that type of environment,\" he said. \"So what has ended up happening is that the prevalence of mobile payments or e-wallets, of which Atozpay is, has gained tremendous traction in Indonesia.\"On the subject of Indonesia, with it being the fourth-most populous country in the world and boasting a growing confluence of big tech players and equity funds, Suen posits that it holds tremendous potential for investors.\"What I've found in the past two years of being back [in the U.S.], when I talk to potential investors ... about Indonesia, most of the response, very naturally is, 'that's an entire world away',\" he said.\"There are currently over 15 tech companies based in Indonesia that have what are called unicorn valuations,\" he said. \"So, anything valued at a billion dollars or more would imply that it's a Unicorn valuation. Several are actually higher than ten billion and this is notable because every major global tech giant has investments in these 15.\"\"Not only are the big strategic tech companies making investments in these 15, we are also seeing the world's leading private equity funds investing as well,\" he added. \"What you have is a landscape that's a who's who of global tech companies, a who's who of private equity funds and venture capital funds, and what we're going to see very soon is an impending wave of IPOs here in the US.\"Suen said that the company's activities in Indonesia, coupled with its other developments, position it favorably for strategic investments or possibly acquisition.\"It puts us on the path for potential strategic investment in or an acquisition of, our Indonesian subsidiary by one of these larger companies,\" he said. \"What we believe will happen, is someone likeGrab- which is currently a $16 billion valued company operating in Southeast Asia in its entirety - we believe that they will be a strategic investor in Weyland Indonesia Perkasa, or potentially acquire us.\" The Investorideas.com podcasts are also available on iTunes, Spotify, Tunein, Stitcher, Spreaker.com, iHeartRadio and Google Play Music.

Ebullient investors, enthused by the synchronised global economic recovery, pushed the US sharemarket to an all-time high in late January.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But then the optimism started to evaporate as investors fretted that stronger global growth would likely kindle inflationary pressures, triggering a faster pace of monetary tightening by the US Federal Reserve. The market's mood was darkened further by fears that <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/news/politics/tired-of-the-wait-game-donald-trump-is-calling-his-own-shots-20180331-h0y763\">US President Donald Trumps' move</url> to slap steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports could prove a prelude to a global trade war.</p><p>This caused the US share market to end the first quarter slightly lower, bringing an end to its impressive nine-quarter winning streak. In a cruel twist, this stumble occurred at a time when the US sharemarket was celebrating the ninth anniversary of its recovery from its financial crisis low of March 2009.</p><p>There were other, subtler signs that more difficult times could lie ahead. Market volatility has flared up, with the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, climbing to near 20, almost double ultra-low levels that prevailed at the beginning of the year.</p><p>More worrying still was the growing disenchantment with the technology sector, and particularly the former market darling FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google).</p><p> Spurred worries </p><p>Facebook has been at the top of the list, shedding some $US75 billion ($98 billion) in stock market value since it was revealed that data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica had accessed personal information about potentially tens of millions of the social network's members.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/business/retail/amazon-threat-exaggerated-qic-boss-says-20180329-h0y5cu\">Amazon's share price</url> has also come under pressure as Trump's tweets blasting the company for not paying its fair share of taxes and for putting retailers out of business have spurred worries that the online retail giant could face possible antitrust action.</p><p>Worries that Big Tech stocks could be vulnerable to a fresh round of regulations or taxes have rippled through the market in the past fortnight, wiping off $US61 billion off the market value of Amazon, $US62 billion off that of Alphabet (the parent of Google), and $US54 billion from Apple's market capitalisation.</p><p>This wobble by many of the high-flying FAANG stocks has only underscored the US share market's reliance on the tech sector to power its rise. At the end of February, tech stocks accounted for more than 25 per cent of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.</p><p>Possibly scenting blood in the water, Wall Street's short sellers - investors who sell shares they do not own in the hope of making a profit when prices fall - are now targeting the FAANG stocks. Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google are now among the top 10 most-shorted US stocks, measured by market value.</p><p> Escalating trade tensions </p><p>Investor disillusion has also spread to Tesla, whose share price has slumped 23 per cent since mid-March. Last week, Moody's added to the woes of Tesla investors by downgrading the electric-car maker's credit rating to reflect the company's \"liquidity pressures due to its large negative free cash flow and the pending maturities\" of other debt.</p><p>Meanwhile, investors are keeping a wary watch on escalating trade tensions as Trump moves to implement his \"America First\" trade policy by introducing steep tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. In retaliation, China has unveiled plans to immediately impose tariffs on 128 US products, such as pork, fruit, nuts and wine.</p><p>A far greater cause for concern, however, is the Trump administration's threat to impose hefty tariffs on $US60 billion of annual imports from China and to limit China's ability to invest in the US technology sector. Trump has long argued that Beijing puts unfair pressure on US firms to transfer their technology in order to get access to the Chinese market.</p><p>In coming days, the White House is expected to release a list of potentially targeted products, which is expected to include high-tech areas such as semiconductors, communications and aerospace. Investors fear that Beijing is likely to adopt a much more adversarial stance if Washington pushes ahead with this new round of tariffs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1029521140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S11-X6T1-JBJ7-N0SG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"717\"/><timeReceived>04:41 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

But investors are getting queasy and antitrust police are waiting in the wings</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NO ONE ON Wall Street puts it quite like Carl Icahn. \"There are far too many boards\", the veteran activist investor opined on June 24th, that \"believe...that stockholders are the peasants who represent a necessary evil that must be tolerated, possibly patronised, but certainly ignored.\" Mr Icahn's target was Occidental, an oil firm whose directors are pursuing an unpopular $55bn takeover of Anadarko, a rival. But his outburst reflects a broader change in mood on mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A). Dealmaking always reflects a power struggle between empire-building executives and bankers, and more cautious investors and regulators. After years of waving through deals, shareholders and trustbusters are now getting testier again.</p><p>Since 2000 a big trend in American business has been domestic consolidation. Firms have sought to grow at home in order to reap economies of scale and to dampen competition. Some industries, for example telecoms and airlines, have become far more concentrated. The result has been higher corporate profits, which is why investors have cheered the dealmaking on. A long-standing rule of thumb is that takeovers usually destroy value for the acquiring company, which overpays. But over the past decade that has not held true in North America. Since 2008 the share prices of acquirers have outperformed the stockmarket by a median of 1.1% in the quarter when the deal was announced, according to Willis Towers Watson, a financial firm.</p><p>At first glance it has been business as usual this year. About $1.8trn of deals have been announced globally and 53% of them by value have been in North America, according to Mergermarket, an analysis firm. Rather than expanding abroad in an unstable geopolitical environment, American firms have focused on growing at home. Consider some of the biggest deals. United Technologies' (UTC) $90bn merger with Raytheon will create a new defence giant. AbbVie is spending $84bn on Allergan, another big drugs firm. Occidental's purchase of Anadarko will create an energy behemoth. And by buying Caesars, Eldorado Resorts will become a huge player in Las Vegas. Together these firms generate 71% of their revenues within America's borders.</p><p>Rather than cheering activity on, however, investors are in revolt. As Tara Lachapelle, a commentator at Bloomberg, put it, deals are being \"panned instantly\". On the two days after their acquisitions were announced, UTC's shares fell by 7%, AbbVie's by 13%, Occidental's by 9% and Eldorado's by 14%. This fits a broader pattern of underperformance. Over the past 12 months North American buyers have had a median share-price drop of 4.2 percentage points relative to the stockmarket, Willis Towers Watson reckons. </p><p>What has changed? Part of the explanation is that the fashion among investors has shifted away from giant but stodgy firms intent on raising their margins through cost-cutting, towards smaller, loss-making ones with fast revenue growth\u2014hence the current boom in initial public offerings by tech firms. Some big deals have already soured: AT&amp;T's share price has dropped by 12% since it announced the takeover of Time Warner in 2016. There is also a sense that after years of consolidation the deals that are left may be scraping the bottom of the barrel. Occidental is paying top dollar for Anadarko after winning a bidding war with Chevron. AbbVie and Allergan are both mature companies with poor drug pipelines. Eldorado is taking on more debt to buy Caesars.</p><p>As the economics of mega-deals have got worse, shareholders have got more unhappy. UTC faces attack from two activist investors: Daniel Loeb, who called the deal \"baffling\", and William Ackman, who says it \"makes no sense\". Some firms seem to have structured their deals to avoid having to get shareholder approval, which is normally required when new shares issued exceed 20% of the number outstanding. AbbVie is issuing 19.2% of its shares to buy Allergan. Occidental issued $10bn of preference stock to Warren Buffett in order to avoid having to issue so much common stock that it would need to have a shareholder vote. Even so, activist investors can find other ways to cause problems. Mr Icahn has said that he will launch a proxy fight to oust four of Occidental's directors in order to block the takeover. On July 2nd Occidental urged its shareholders to spurn Mr Icahn's advances.</p><p>If investors are one impediment to big deals, antitrust regulators are the other. Over the past two decades they have been a walkover, but there are signs this is changing. The merger of Sprint and T-Mobile, two mobile-network operators, still awaits approval after a long delay. Even if the Department of Justice gives it the green light, a coalition of state attorneys-general has pledged to fight the deal, which they say will reduce choice for consumers. </p><p>The mood has also shifted against big tech firms. An emerging consensus among antitrust types is that these should be blocked from scooping up smaller firms because of the worry that it would eliminate potential rivals. Past deals that sailed through, such as Facebook's $18bn takeover of WhatsApp in 2014, or Microsoft's $24bn purchase of LinkedIn in 2016, would probably face a rougher ride from the antitrust police now. A de facto ban on tech firms doing big takeovers could depress deal activity for years, given that they are now the biggest firms in America by market value and are blessed with cash-rich balance-sheets.</p><p>Mergers and acquisitions have come in waves ever since the first frenzy of consolidation in the late 19th century. The past two decades have seen one of the greatest waves ever as executives have sought to build corporate giants with market power over consumers, applauded by investors and enabled by trustbusters. The dealmaking in 2019 suggests that this long swell is finally subsiding. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-QE82D8S</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGR-P8R1-DY2R-20PF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"994\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

More t...</p><p>CNBC polled dozens of Wall Street investors and strategists about where they stood on the upcoming quarter for stocks and the potential election impact.  Nearly half of the survey's respondents said the S&amp;P 500 will rise in the final quarter of 2020. More than 60% of respondents said a second Covid-19 wave is their biggest concern for stocks right now.  Wall Street investors are bullish on stocks heading into the fourth quarter, but they concerns about a second coronavirus wave, according to a new CNBC survey.    As a part of CNBC's Quarterly Report, CNBC polled dozens of investors, traders and strategists about where they stood on the upcoming quarter for stocks and the potential election impact.    Nearly half (46%) of the survey's respondents said the S&amp;P 500 will rise in the final quarter of 2020. This follows the fastest bear market and subsequent rebound in history, with the 500-stock average notching an all-time high in less than six months after its March low.    A third of the polled investors see increased volatility ahead, but only 9% expect the S&amp;P 500 to fall into year end.    Amid an uptick in coronavirus cases in places like New York, more than 60% of respondents said a second Covid-19 wave is their biggest concern for stocks right now. About 30% said a slow economic recovery and just 12% said election uncertainty was their biggest fear.   Markets and the election  Investors are focusing on the outcome of the 2020 election between incumbent Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. Nearly 70% of survey respondents said President Trump will be better for the stock market, while 33% said a Biden victory would boost equities.    Wall Street generally sees President Trump as more pro-business; however, they don't like his volatile relationship with China. Some investors take issue with Biden's plan to raise corporate taxes and tighten regulation.   Heading into the election, more than half of the Wall Street pros said they are rotating into cyclicals, stocks that would benefit most from an economic comeback.  A quarter of respondents are sticking with the technology winners, 13% are taking profits and 9% are loading up on cash.    But Wall Street overall is still bullish on Big Tech with 63% of respondents saying the FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Alphabet, Netflix and Google) leaders will continue to lead in the coming months. More than half of the respondents said they are buying technology stocks after the September 2 drop. 37% see technology stocks losing their leadership spot in the fourth quarter and 44% said the technology weakness is not over.    Heading into 2021, the majority of the group said technology, industrials and consumer discretionary will be the biggest winners. Energy, utilities and real estate were the most popular laggards in the group. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43208910777</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YW-6581-F07F-81XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"513\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNBC</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 1, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Interview</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

She has attacked Wall Street for being corrupt. Some of the things she has written about private equity have been astounding.\u00a0There are all kinds of reasons why people have been a bit freaked out by Warren.</p><p>\"Wall Street does not like being villainised and I think it is most concerned that Trump's deregulatory agenda will be eroded fairly quickly and her tax agenda.\"</p><p>Should Warren win, observers believe she will put allies in place in key positions, such as the Federal Reserve.</p><p>How quickly she could implement the rest of her agenda depends on whether the Democrats are able to take control of the Senate. Should the Republicans retain control, Mitch McConnell could mire Warren in a legislative morass.</p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/08/05/global-business-should-start-worrying-elizabeth-warren/\">Massachusetts senator</url> forged her political reputation in the wake of the 2008 financial crash.\u00a0An expert on bankruptcy, she\u00a0helped establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, designed to safeguard middle class families from what she regarded as the predatory practices of Wall Street.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/08/05/global-business-should-start-worrying-elizabeth-warren/\">Profile | Sen. Elizabeth Warren</url></p><p>Brandon Barford, a\u00a0partner at Washington-based Beacon Policy Advisors, believes she will go much further than just targeting banks and payday lenders.</p><p>\"Investors primarily think her focus is financial services. That is not the case at all, even though there will be greater scrutiny of the industry that will make the Obama-era rules look tame,\" he says.\u00a0</p><p>\"If she becomes President, she will mimic Trump with a lot of aggressive executive orders early on.\u00a0What we are talking about here is a fundamental reworking of the system.\u00a0</p><p>\"Take the ruthlessness of the Trump administration and mix it with far more consistent politics - that is what you get with Elizabeth Warren. She will advance her agenda in a far more skilful and disciplined way.\"</p><p>Dec Mullarkey of\u00a0SLC Management, which has assets worth $168bn, believes a Warren administration would deliver a jolt to the markets: \"Under Warren's progressive agenda, the equity market would go through a significant correction as most of her favoured policies would significantly constrain existing business models in major sectors.\u00a0She has pledged to roll back Trump's corporate tax breaks and favours a heavy hand in regulating a broad range of US sectors.\"</p><p>Tim Anderson, managing director of TJM Investments, is more blunt in his assessment:\u00a0\"I think her policies would be very destructive for the US economy.\"</p><p>\"Whether you want to talk about the banking system, the health system or any part of the capitalist policies which have been the building block of our economy for the last 200 years, it would be a real concern,\" he says.</p><p>\"I think you have seen her trying to avoid going full-on socialist like some of the other candidates have been.\u00a0She knows if she is nominated, she will have to pivot back towards a centrist position.\u00a0</p><p>\"If she is nominated she is going to have major problems raising money from corporate interests who want to maintain the free market economy.\"</p><p>Her ultra-progressive agenda will present a challenge for her party's many friends on Wall Street who might find themselves having to choose between their wallets and their social consciences.</p><p>According to the Centre for Responsive Politics, the securities and investment industry has been generous to the Democrats, donating almost $100m\u00a0to the party last year - about $10m more than the Republicans raked in.</p><p>\"There are more closet supporters for Elizabeth Warren on Wall Street than people realise,\" says Charles Myers, chairman of Signum Global Advisors, which numbers financial institutions and multi-national firms among its clients.</p><p>In any case, he says, there may be less to fear from Warren - who on the campaign has insisted she was a \"capitalist to my bones\" - than self-proclaimed socialist Bernie Sanders.</p><p>With the Democrats facing a tough battle to win control of the Senate, Warren's freedom of manoeuvre could be restricted.\u00a0</p><p>\"She will have to govern as a centrist. She won't get Medicare for All, the Green New Deal and the wealth tax through the Senate,\" Myers says.</p><p>\"Legislatively she won't get much through, but with executive orders she will snap back much of Trump's deregulatory agenda.\u00a0I think the market is already starting to price in some of the risk of a Warren administration.\u00a0Everyone assumes the big risk is to financial services, but the energy sector could be vulnerable to new environmental regulations.\"</p><p>Big Tech could also be at risk from her pledge to break the industry up, Myers adds.</p><p>Others on Wall Street have been more sanguine about what 2020 might bring.\u00a0\"We are politically agnostic -\u00a0we will deal with whatever the electorate gives us,\" says John Davis of Royce Funds, a boutique investment house in New York.</p><p>\"People in the past were nervous about Clinton and Obama but Wall Street did fine under their administrations.\u00a0There is always some volatility ahead of an election. But it settles as people get used to what has happened.\"</p><p>But underpinning the election is the overall political direction of travel in the US, according to Charles Gabriel.</p><p>For the Republicans, the sweeping deregulation introduced by the Trump administration reinvigorated an investment market that had been made sclerotic by the Obama curbs imposed in the wake of the financial crash.</p><p>Democrats saw the Obama measures as vital in curbing the excesses of a casino economy in which the ultra-rich prospered at the expense of the American middle-class.\u00a0</p><p>A Warren win would demonstrate that the country has moved irrevocably to the left, Gabriel adds:\u00a0\"It would mean that Trump was just a detour.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-56565568</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5M-R6M1-JCJY-G2Y7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1265\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 1, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The market has been down for the whole session but don't be too alarmed.  The losses are actually quite small.  Barely triple digits.  And in the last hour or so, there is something of a rally being attempted.  It looks about day, but let's see what's been moving the markets.  Blink and you miss it, the U.S. economy is barely clinging on to the streak of job growth.  We need to analyze the numbers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A slump in Shanghai, as China's trade numbers turn nasty and Norway sent the oil sector spinning with a multibillion dollars sell-off.  We'll explain.  It's Friday.  It is the 8th of March.  I am Richard Quest in London tonight, where of course, I mean business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.  Tonight, investors are reacting with alarm as the world's two largest economies are flashing warning signs.  In the United States, new numbers show hiring slowed to a crawl in February and in China, exports fell more than 20% and in both cases, the experts and economists are wondering if these are blips and something deep and serious, or is it just a little bit of froth off the top.</p><p>In other words, temporary or the start of a lengthy slowdown?  We start in the United States with the U.S. jobs report where the number of jobs added in February is the worst since September of 2017, a fraction of what economists expected - 20,000.  It's a miserable number.  Unemployment at 3.8%.  So that's holding steady and wage growth at 3.4% is considered to be good.  However, as fewer unemployed people look for work and wages rose, the growth was constrained and concentrated in certain industries.  The president said the numbers were surprising for different reasons.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The unemployment rate just went lower.  We are down now to 3.8%, so we have very good news in that.  I think the big news really was that wages went up and that's great for the American worker.  That's something for people -- I don't know if they ever expected to see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm, Grant Thornton, she joins us now from Chicago.  Diane, if we look at these numbers and which is the more seriously -- serious number, the fact that growth was down -- I'm sorry, job growth was constrained or that wage growth actually is ticking up?</p><p>DIANE SWONK, CHIEF ECONOMIST, GRANT THORNTON:  Well, they're both from the same survey, so they're both distorted a bit.  The slowdown in job growth was largely in part to really unseasonably bad, even unusually bad winter weather, big loss in construction employment that we do expect to come back a little bit.</p><p>Also, we had some losses because some of those government workers had taken on a second job to make up for their lost pay.  They got off that second job, so that came out of the numbers and we had some teacher strikes as well.  That's one side of it.</p><p>The wage gains were -- are picking up.  That's a good news.  They're up a tenth from the high we had hit in December, but they're also distorted by the composition of jobs created during the month, only 20,000 net jobs dominated by high paying jobs and professional services that helped to buoy those wage gains from a year ago.</p><p>QUEST:  So if you had to give this an interpretation on this report, bearing in mind that the revisions on the previous months were very small, which suggest that the trend of the slowdown is taking its toll.</p><p>SWONK:  The slowdown is taking its toll.  I look at this on sort of on a moving average basis.  The three-month moving average is about what we had seen in 2018.  The first two months of the year are slower and I expect that to continue because the economy is slowing.  The first quarter is going to be a lousy quarter.  We're going to bounce back a bit in the second quarter.</p><p>But overall growth in 2019 will be slower than 2018 and with that, we'll see a slower pace of job growth as well.  A much slower pace over the course of the year.</p><p>QUEST:  Stay with me because at the moment, as you'll be aware, Wall Street is marking ten years of the bull-run.  So 10 years ago, I was sitting in this very spot when with hindsight, what we now understand, stocks hit bottom.  Listen to that and I'll come back to you in a second, Diane.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Good evening to you.  I'm Richard Quest.  This is \"Quest Means Business.\"  We are starting a new week and I'm afraid it's a new week but the same old story.</p><p>[15:05:10]</p><p>QUEST:  Susan, they are so mixed at the New York Stock exchange, Susan, when I just looked a second or two ago, it looked like we were best part of a turn down on the market, has it come back a bit?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Well, we know the market did come back, look at how it has improved.  The S&amp;P, by the way, Diane Swonk, you have 300% gain over that period.  So how much, Diane Swonk is because cheap money from the central banks made the bull market inevitable?</p><p>SWONK:  Well, it certainly was a major factor.  There was also a major announcement right about we're going to see on 60 minutes, Chairman Powell, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, former Chair, Janet Yellen come together and talk about what happened ten years ago.</p><p>Ten years ago, at this time, it was when the Fed first did their quantitative easing.  They announced that they would buy in the mortgage-backed security market and just that announcement alone started to turned things around.  Before they ever bought one mortgage backed security, the market started to come back, and I think that's very important.</p><p>It's not just the fact that the Fed, fed financial markets.  Financial markets took down the economy.  The only cure was to fix financial markets and that gave an uneven kind of growth and then we missed the fiscal stimulus later in the expansion and that was taken away.</p><p>QUEST:  So on the basis of the economic scenario, the landscape that you see now, are we good for a few more years of the bull market?</p><p>SWONK:  I'm very concerned.  My biggest concern is China.  We have seen more bad data come out of China and it's not just contingent on a trade agreement with China.  The weakness in China hit before the tariff hits in China.  They've got a structural problem, second largest economy in the world.  They've been a major push on growth of the global economy.  You're seeing weakness in Europe.  You've seen the ECB react to it this week.  These are thing that concern me that tell me we're losing some of our stamina.</p><p>QUEST:  Diane, thank you and we will continue with on the thought that you've raised for us, the issue of China because of the soft U.S. numbers weren't enough to shake investors; there more warning signals in the world's number two economy.</p><p>Chinese stocks fell by more than 4% on Friday after Beijing revealed that exports had fallen to their lowest levels in three years.  The 21% slide coincides with the Chinese New Year holiday.  It was driven by the trade war with the U.S. and slowing global economies.</p><p>David Dollar was the Treasury's Economic Emissary to China, joins me now.  This very sharp falloff in exports, at the same time as the U.S. of course had some very bad trade numbers, too.  But what do you believe is driving the China's numbers?</p><p>DAVID DOLLAR, FORMER TREASURY EMISSARY TO CHINA:  Well, February is always a weak month in China.  It's either the New Year festival or sometimes it comes right after the New Year festival.  So February numbers, we have to be a little bit careful about.  But this really caught most observers by surprise as you said, Richard.  Exports were down 21%, and that's February on February.  So you're comparing two Februarys.  That's a lot more than anybody expected.</p><p>I was also disturbed that their imports fell by 5%.  That's usually a pretty good indication of what's happening with domestic demand.  That's important for a lot of countries around the world that are selling to China.  So those are bad trade numbers, and as you said, Shanghai market fell 4.4%.  It also didn't help, there was an interview with the U.S. Ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, and he pointed out the obvious that the two sides are still pretty far apart for a trade agreement.  There's no concrete planning for a summit meeting at Mar-A-Lago and that I think also affected the market.</p><p>QUEST:  Is it your gut that China is in deep trouble?  The government has already, a couple of months ago, it played around with bank reserve limits.  It's now done some other financial finagling to try and give a stimulus to the economy.  Is China in trouble?</p><p>DOLLAR:  My gut is that they're not in trouble in the sense of the proverbial hard landing.  They've rolled out some modest stimulus measures.  They're going to increase their fiscal deficit a little bit, a little bit additional borrowing by local governments, but it's all rather modest, and I think they have pretty good information about what's happening.  If they were alarmed, they would be coming in much more strongly with measures, but they're coming in with modest stimulus.</p><p>So, I think they're probably going to be okay and if I'm wrong about that and things slide more in the next couple of months, they'll come in with further stimulus.  So pretty safe bet they're going to get to their 6% target for the year.</p><p>[15:10:09]</p><p>QUEST:  You heard Diane Swonk just a moment ago, if you take the U.S. situation on the trade numbers, the U.S. having the worst deficit in some years when it should have been getting better, the U.S. dollar remains extremely strong which of course is a negative on the imports and if you look at that trading relationship between the U.S. and China, there's no evidence that it's improving.</p><p>DOLLAR:  Right.  I mean, you're absolutely right about that.  Last year, U.S. imports from China went up $34 billion despite the trade war.  Our exports to China actually went down for the first time in many years.  Now, I would say you wouldn't normally expect a trade war to improve the U.S. trade balance because what the U.S. is doing reduces imports, but it also reduces exports and so no presumption that it's going help the trade balance.</p><p>QUEST:  Have a good weekend, sir.  Lots to talk about and we'll talk more about it in the future.  Thank you.</p><p>DOLLAR:  Thanks a lot.</p><p>QUEST:  We go to the White House now where the week is ending with a surprise shakeup.  The Deputy Chief of Staff and Communications Director, Bill Shine has resigned.  It was very unexpected.  He is the fifth person to serve as Communications Director under President Trump.  A statement from the White House says Shine will serve as a senior adviser to President Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.</p><p>Sarah Westwood is at the White House, so Sarah, was he pushed or was about to be pushed?</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, CNN:  Well, Richard, we've been looking into this and it appears a combination of those things.  Sources tell CNN that the President had started to sour on Bill Shine's performance.  Bill Shine, the former executive at Fox News was brought on board in large part to help improve the press coverage of this White House.  That did not happen over the eight months that Shine worked here and the President started to grow dissatisfied with that.</p><p>Aides said that they couldn't discern what Shine really did here at the White House beyond just the lighting and focused the cameras at White House events.  At the same time, though, it's really unclear what Shine will be doing on the re-election campaign.  Sources affiliated with the campaign say they were notified this morning that Shine would be joining them as a senior adviser.  They haven't really been informed what exactly it is he will be doing.  This was all hastily announced today as you mentioned, a very unexpected departure coming after a tough week for President Trump, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  Some will claim this is more evidence of confusion in the White House.</p><p>WESTWOOD:  Well, certainly you don't have to look far to find plenty of evidence of that.  This particular position in the White House, the Communications Director position, has been done by five people, six people have been named White House Communications Director, one of them resigned before actually taking the position.</p><p>So this has been a notoriously difficult job for this administration to fill in part because President Trump likes to act so much as his own chief spokesman, and so it's difficult for someone to come in and try to direct his communications and Shine also, like his predecessors, struggled with that.</p><p>So, Richard, it will be interesting to see who the White House selects, if anyone, to hold this position moving forward.</p><p>QUEST:  We'll watch it.  Have a good weekend.  Thank you.</p><p>WESTWOOD:  You, too.</p><p>QUEST:  Sarah at the White House.  Coming up next, breaking up big tech, in the words of Neil Sedaka, it may be hard to do, but presidential hopeful, Elizabeth Warren is game to have a go.  Big tech on the block in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:15:00]</p><p>QUEST:  Five years ago tonight, Malaysia Airlines flight MH-370 disappeared and nothing has been heard of it since except some debris that washed up some months later.  Family members of the Chinese nationals on board are now calling on their government to continue the search, a search that was called off in January 2017, after two years.</p><p>The plane disappeared with 239 passengers and crew on board.  It was going between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing.  Now, that is pretty much all we know about what happened to MH-370.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  It is the aviation the mystery that transfixed the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, ANCHOR, CNN:  Air traffic controllers in Southeast Asia have lost contact with a jumbo jet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  The Boeing 777 was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it vanished.  Two hundred and thirty nine people on board missing.  Five years later, and aviation experts believe it's still possible to lose a passenger plane somewhere over the world's oceans.</p><p>Currently, air traffic controllers track planes through a patch work of radar, ground radio and satellite communications.  The satellites have limited range.  Now, a new system coming on line next month will for the first time allow the planes to be tracked in real-time anywhere they fly.</p><p>Also airlines will be able to subscribe to live tracking services that share location and other data.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARY SCHIAVO, AVIATION ANALYST, CNN:  Not only will these tracking systems save the world from losing another plane and the heartbreak of five years out still not knowing where the people are, but every month it will save a state, a country, another jurisdiction from having to search for small planes that go missing all the time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Also, under development, a new generation of black boxes.  Airbus is introducing a flight data recorder that ejects itself during a crash.  While Honeywell is working on a cockpit voice and recorder that constantly streams data via satellite.  None of this technology is currently mandated by regulators.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID SOUCIE, AVIATION SAFETY ANALYST, CNN:  It's up to the airlines, it's up to the states themselves, the countries that fly aircraft to pay the extra dollars that it takes.  And it's not a lot of extra dollars, maybe ten cents a ticket or so.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  What hasn't changed of course is how families are treated during the most difficult experience of their lives.  There are no uniform worldwide standards for immediate assistance and families are given no mandated access to the crash investigations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHIAVO:  They are intentionally kept out and what does that do?  That makes the entire investigation suspect in the eyes of the families.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  Incidents like the disappearance of MH-370 involve families, investigators and regulators across many different jurisdictions.  Bringing them all together is and direct common framework is what the authorities are trying to do.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOUCIE:  There's no body that says you can't fly and charge for tickets and expect people to fly and fly on your airlines without a standard of safety that is worldwide.  It can't just be state to state.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:20:06]</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  As to the whereabouts and discovery of the final resting place of that 777, it may be many years when more sophisticated searching methods are devised that we'll ever find the wreckage, recover the remains and finally find out what happened to MH-370.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  After the official search for MH-370 was called off, there was a second search led by the U.S. exploration firm, Ocean Infinity.  The company says it's ready to launch a new effort.  Ocean Infinity's Chief Executive, Oliver Plunkett joins me now.</p><p>Thank you, Oliver for being with us.  What is stopping you from just saying, \"I'm going to put the ships out.  We've got the technology.  We've got the ships.  It's a find or no fee.  I'm going out tomorrow.\"</p><p>OLIVER PLUNKETT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, OCEAN INFINITY:  We want to make sure firstly that we've properly analyzed all of the theories and know that we're looking exactly the right place.  Minister Loke from Malaysia actually makes a very serious point when he says that the government doesn't want to engage unless there's a credible reason to do so.  The other way of thinking about that is he says, \"I don't want to expose the families to the emotions of hope on a wild goose chase.\"  And we feel that that's very important because ultimately, it's the families who are at the center of all of this.</p><p>QUEST:  Right.  The first principle's report which identified the most likely area which you then took as the basis, I'm simplifying, obviously, but you then took as the basis for the most likely area to search, well, did you complete that area in that last search?  Are you comfortable that you searched the most likely area, and if so, then, yes, where do you go next?</p><p>PLUNKETT:  I think with any ocean search, the idea that there is a pinpoint location can be nothing more than a starting point from which you go north, south, east and west based on the evidence which draws you in one of those four directions.</p><p>We started in the point where the original search finished and traveled north because that was most consistent with what was in the first principal's report.  Inevitably, the southern Indian Ocean is an enormous body of water and whether it's near there or somewhere else requires some additional thought.</p><p>QUEST:  So are you saying that we don't know where the plane went down?  I mean, because at the end of the day, quite a lot of the ocean -- quite a lot of the area where the plane is believed to have gone down was searched very thoroughly in the first part.  Your organization did an extremely thorough search using newer technologies of the most likely area.  But do -- does the evidence still seem to together it is off the western coast of Australia?</p><p>PLUNKETT:  When you look at the combination of the satellite data analysis and the ocean drift analysis that's been reviewed and carried out by various organizations from around the world, the preponderance of the evidence points you to the southern Indian Ocean off the west coast of Australia.</p><p>But it's a large area.  And as I say, the idea that there's a pinpoint in this particular search just doesn't make any sense.  There might be other searches where there is that evidence that it's very, very -- and you find the thing you're looking for exactly where the evidence suggests it should be.  This isn't one of those.</p><p>QUEST:  So I expect much of the day answering the questions to my colleagues about would they ever find it?  And my answer has always been, yes, it will be found one day when the sophistication or sophisticated search tools are able to do that, and we're not there yet.  Do you subscribe to that?</p><p>PLUNKETT:  I also believe that it will be find one day.  At the moment -- and this was the point I made to the families last weekend, I think we have got the tools to find it.  What for me has made me feel that since we left the site of the Indian Ocean in June of last year, is that we found the Argentinian submarine, San Juan, and we found the Korean boat carrier, Stella Daisy.</p><p>The San Juan in particular, was an object of a similar size to MH-370, except it was designed not to be identified by sonar.</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>PLUNKETT:  So the fact we can find that tells me that if we look in the right place, we can find MH-370.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, and finally, in a sentence, so what do you need - who's permission do you now need to go back out and search?</p><p>PLUNKETT:  The Government of Malaysia.  I think it's important to remember that it isn't -- this is a -- it's an airplane that is subject to police investigations and it matters to the families, I think it's important to not just go out and do things without having that buy-in of all the stakeholders.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you sir.  Thank you very much for joining us.  Much appreciated.</p><p>PLUNKETT:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  And of course in future programs, we will be asking the government of Malaysia exactly when and why they will allow some people like Ocean Infinity to go back out.</p><p>Coming up next, breaking up big tech.  The big names are huge, but Senator Warren takes on the three most valuable companies in the world.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There is more \"Quest Means Business\" in a moment when you'll hear from Elizabeth Warren who thinks breaking up big tech will help her get to the White House, or at least promising to do it, and big oil companies have taken a big hit after one of their biggest investors says it is having a rethink on fossil fuels.  As we continue tonight, this is CNN and on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people turned out again on Friday demonstrating across Algeria.  Protestors are demanding that the 82-year-old President, Bouteflika, withdraw from next month's election.  Despite suffering a stroke in 2013 and having rarely been seen in public since, the current President is moving ahead with his candidacy.</p><p>[15:30:10]</p><p>The lawyer for the so-called ISIS bride Shamima Begum says he believes her new born son has died.  Begum is being held at a camp in Syria and gave birth to a baby boy last month.</p><p>She left the U.K. to join ISIS four years ago.  She recently said she wanted to come back to Britain.  But British officials say they would strip her of her citizenship because she supports a terrorist organization.</p><p>British lawmakers are getting ready to vote again on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal on Tuesday.  Brexit is only 21 days away, Theresa May said a short while ago that if parliament rejects her deal, in her words, no one knows what will happen and that the U.K. might not leave the EU at all.</p><p>Parts of Venezuela has been without electricity since Thursday.  There was a widespread power outrage that led officials to close schools and suspend other  public services.  President Maduro's government says it's due to sabotage of the country's main hydro electric power station.  Critics say crumbling infrastructure and corruption are to blame.</p><p>So to SpaceX now celebrating the return of the Dragon.  It's Crew Dragon capsule, that is, it came back to earth early on Friday and it capped off a historic test flight.  SpaceX is developing commercial spacecraft to carry American astronauts to the International Space Station.</p><p>It's time to break up big tech according to U.S. presidential hopeful Senator  Elizabeth Warren.  She wants to take a saw to Amazon, Google and Facebook.  It's all part of the bid to promote competition in the sector, she says.  Now, of course, the senator's campaigning like a trust buster of yester-year.</p><p>When we think of Amazon with its vast holdings across many industries, its tentacle remind you of images such as those of the early 1900s.  Now, back then, the idea was that of an octopus and it was the perfect metaphor for monopolies of oil and railroad companies and how they extended their reach, strong arming their way to the U.S.</p><p>And the analogy of the octopus -- as you can see Capitol Hill over there, you can see Wall Street over there, the analogy of the octopus and the company by the way of course, they talk about is Standard Oil which was broken up into SO as we now know today.</p><p>Now, it works just as well today of the analogy -- look at --</p><p>(BELL RINGS)</p><p>Amazon, there's Amazon web services and the amazon.com.  All the tentacles going deep into the economy.  With groceries at Whole Foods and shoes at Zappos, or as any book you can think of is audible or a candle.  Amazon is now of course in the world, it's vast and it's strong and Elizabeth Warren wants to break  it up piece by piece.</p><p>MJ Lee is in New York and joins me.  Now, the idea of what -- I mean, it's not a  new idea, but she's backing herself.  This is turning into one of her touch-stone policies.</p><p>MJ LEE, CNN U.S. POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely.  And Richard, I'm actually just returning from Harlem where Elizabeth Warren had a campaign event and we got some time to talk to her about this new proposal to break up the big tech companies like Amazon, like Google, like Facebook.</p><p>So, let's actually listen to what she had to say.  She was talking about this in the context of Amazon's failed bid to start a new headquarters in Long Island City and then we can talk on the other side.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  I want to make clear, I cheered when New York City said we're pushing back just a little bit on everything that Amazon is asking for.  Because here's the problem, these giant tech companies have so much power, so much economic power and so much  political power that they go all around the country saying, bribe me to come be where you are.</p><p>And it's like a giant hunger games of some kind.  What I believe is for it to have more competition in the marketplace and to level the playing field a little bit for  small businesses and entrepreneurs and start-ups.  What we've got to do is take  those platforms, you know, how you order on Amazon or you do a search on Google, and break them off from the additional businesses that they're running  and those additional businesses are where they're getting a comparative advantage on their information because of the information they get from their  platforms.</p><p>The way to think about this right now is Amazon is like the umpire in the baseball game.  It runs the marketplace, and it also has a lot of teams on the field  because it's actually competing with the other businesses on that platform and giving special advantage, putting them on page 1 and somebody they don't like back on page 6.</p><p>[15:35:00]  So my notion is, you can be an umpire or you can own a team, but you can't do both at the same time.  And that's how we should break up Amazon, it's how we should break up Google, customers, both like you and me, we can still do our searches, we can still do what we want to do, but we want to break these up and get more competition in the industry.</p><p>LEE:  Would you have been OK with it being in Boston, the second headquarters?</p><p>WARREN:  So what I'm not OK with is the fact that cities are put into this competition against each other, and that they're asked to give up tax revenues to build special goodies.  Because you know, here's the deal.  A small business that's just getting started, no city is saying to them, hey, we're going to give you the same deal that Amazon is getting.</p><p>You're going to get a big lop off your taxes or we're going to hand out some  special goodies to you.  Every time the giant goes around the country and says give me something special, they help increase the concentration of the American economy.  That's bad for our economy, it's bad for workers, it's bad for competition, it's bad for small businesses, and ultimately, it's bad for our  democracy.</p><p>Just over the past few years, a handful of the top giants have already gotten $10 billion in special breaks from towns, counties and states.  You know, that's a special break that gives them a leg up in competition.  It's just not fair for small  businesses and that's not right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  MJ, is this going to be a central plank of the senator's manifesto if you like.  Is she going to run hard on this because it's perceived to be popular.</p><p>LEE:  Oh, absolutely, and when you think about Elizabeth Warren and sort of what her campaign stands for so far, this goes to the root of it, right? She is running on getting money out of politics, weakening special interests and wealthy interests in politics, and this is really just the sort of core of her message.</p><p>And if you think back to what her actually first policy proposal of the campaign  was, it was to tax the wealthy, the wealthiest Americans and she said that other proposals that she puts out will actually --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>LEE:  Be paid for by those taxes.  So all of these policy proposals come together, and I think what is going to be really fascinating to watch is how her competitors, the other Democratic candidates feel like they have to respond to this, right? Now that Elizabeth Warren has put out this proposal, you can be sure that the other  Democratic candidates in the field are also going to be asked about this and asked do you support this or do you have another --</p><p>QUEST:  Yes --</p><p>LEE:  Or better idea to deal with this?</p><p>QUEST:  She has put the issue into play, good to see you, thank you, MJ, thank you for getting --</p><p>LEE:  Thanks --</p><p>QUEST:  And thank you for getting that interview back to us so promptly, I appreciate it that it's just taken place.  As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, over three decades, oil money has funded Norway's trillion dollar sovereign well fund; the largest in the world.  Now also, wants to turn away from energy to secure the country's financial future.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Norway wants to hedge its financial future no longer being quite so tied up with energy and energy stocks.  The company -- of course, the Norwegian government's trillion dollar sovereign wealth fund has revealed it's cashing out of  most of its oil and gas investments.  Now, the idea is -- or the worry is, bearing in mind that most of Norway's sovereign wealthy and most of the country's economy comes from oil and gas exports.</p><p>But they want to hedge against a permanent oil price decline because what's the point of having all your money in a hedge fund, and the hedge fund owning oil and gas companies, in other words, eggs in one basket.  You see what I mean there, $7.5 billion is already in exploration and production, and those parts of the economy, $7.5 billion.</p><p>Now, the fund is going to keep investing in big oil companies that works on renewables.  So, those that are high on renewables can still expect to receive investments from the fund.  Look what happened to the oil market in terms of the price, not the crudes.</p><p>BP down at 1 percent, ExxonMobil up one-three quarters, for good reason, for good reason, one of main investors or large investors I should say is about to withdraw.  And the news, Norway sent shockwaves through the market.  Matt Egan is in New York, joins me now.  It's somewhat inevitable that the prices were going to fall, but does the market or is the general view that the policy is the right one?</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER:  You know, Richard, that's a good question.  I think you really nailed it, Norway is really concerned that it is overexposed to oil.  It is worried about what will happen if there is some sort of a permanent decline in oil prices.  And so you noted that the energy sector was down broadly today.</p><p>But what I think is really interesting is some of the EMP companies that Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund owns, they're down even more.  We saw a Apache and Adaco, Chesapeake, EOG Resources, Occidental Petroleum, they're all down more than twice the amount that oil prices are today, and that's because they are worried that one of their biggest investors is going to gradually cash out.</p><p>But you know, it is important to note that Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund is not getting out entirely.  They are still going to hold on to their investments in some of these oil majors.  The likes of Exxon and Shell and BP, and they're all hoping that some of these oil majors would start investing even more in renewable energy in the future.</p><p>QUEST:  Now, Matt, I don't know too much about the Norwegian Sovereign Fund, although one, it's hard to look at the various points over the years, but I do know it is widely regarded as amongst the most respected in the world.</p><p>EGAN:  Right, we're talking about a trillion dollar fund, it's the biggest of its kind and it is looked at as ahead of the curve and forward-looking.  And so, you'll recall that in 2015, Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund actually divested from coal.  It did that ahead of other large institutional investors.</p><p>And so if you talk to, you know, some of the climate activists, they're still really chalking this up as a win and they say that it's a clear sign that slowly, but steadily, some of these large institutions are trying to back away from fossil fuels.  Now, there's a bit of irony here because as you mentioned, Norway got its $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund by of course producing oil.</p><p>It is still the largest oil producer in western Europe, and it's going to continue to  produce more oil.</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>EGAN:  The hope is that it just won't be quite as exposed to oil prices going  forward.</p><p>QUEST:  Fascinating, sorry, good to see you, have a lovely weekend.</p><p>EGAN:  You too.</p><p>[15:45:00]  European stocks closed out with the week with another day of losses.

The Senator Sarah Hanson Young tweeted, \"men who are threatened or worried of women achieving equality is the problem.\"  Morrison's party service on gender imbalance, only 22 percent of liberal party members in parliament are women.</p><p>Now, Mr. Morrison's predecessor Julia Gillard was on a panel with Meghan Markle this morning.  She also published a column in \"The Guardian\" newspaper, saying \"gender equality isn't a women's issue, it's good for men too.\"  Julia Gillard established the Global Institute for Women's Leadership at King's College last year.</p><p>[15:50:00]  Back in September, she told me more progress must be made.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA GILLARD, FORMER PRIME MINISTER, AUSTRALIA:  We're just putting a simple case that we want to strive for a world of gender equality.  That merit is equally distributed between the sexes, that we live in a world where whether it's politics or leading corporations or the law or news media or technology, less than 30 percent of leadership positions in all of those fields are held by women and we can do better than that.</p><p>And we can do better in how we evaluate women's leadership which shouldn't include streams of horrible stuff on social media.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Get out your phones, your tablets, your devices and join our  conversations, and go to cnn.com-slash-join.  The question tonight is are quotas the answer for equality in corporate leadership? In other words a specific number, for example, 30 percent perhaps.</p><p>Brenda Trenowden is the global chair of the 30 Percent Club and the head of the Financial Institutions Group at ANZ Bank.  She's also an adviser to an independent review into upping the number of women in senior positions at FTSE companies.  She's with me now, good to see you.</p><p>The -- we can deal quickly with the Australian Prime Minister's -- was it -- what was it that he said that was so objectionable? Because most women in professions would agree, yes, we got here our own way, but not just on the back of pushing  somebody else down.</p><p>BRENDA TRENOWDEN, GLOBAL CHAIR, 30 PERCENT CLUB &amp; HEAD, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS GROUP, ANZ BANK:  Right, I think all the women that I know and work with would certainly say the same thing and we certainly think it's not a zero-sum game.  You know, I didn't hear his whole speech, so I think when you take one  sentence out of context, sometimes, you know, things are misinterpreted.</p><p>So, I would agree that we don't want to be pushing other people down to bring people up, we want everybody to be rising up.  We want everyone to benefit from greater inclusion actually.</p><p>QUEST:  And what is the -- what is the biggest issue bedeviling now women in senior positions, do you believe?</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  Well, I wish there was just one issue, Richard, that it would be easier to solve, but it's a multi-variety problem and therefore requires a multi-variety solution.  But there are lots of things, there are definitely unconscious biases.  You know, there are stereotypes and norms that everyone has in their heads about what leadership looks like, that I think holds women back.</p><p>You've certainly got lack of sponsorship.  You know, you've got culture.  I think the big thing that the 30 Percent Club is focusing on this year is really looking at the  inclusion side of the DNI equation.  So we've spent a lot of time trying to create a lot more diversity, hire more women or under represented candidates.</p><p>But we haven't spent enough time thinking about how to make culture more inconclusive for everyone.  And so I think that is part of the biggest issue is one type of dominant culture --</p><p>QUEST:  And yet in the workplace, most companies have a veritable forest of  policies, you know, pages on the website, mission statements galore about it and are still seeing to somehow fumble in the final hurdle.</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  So policies are great, and words on a website are fantastic.  But what we see is that, first of all, the leadership of the company, the CEO has to take this seriously because it's good for their business, and they have to communicate that authentically.</p><p>They then have to do a diagnostic of where the challenges are in their own company because every company is different.  But I think one of the biggest  challenges we see is that all of this has to be implemented by managers.</p><p>QUEST:  Yes --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  You know, a lot of the problem comes into that middle management layer.  And certainly in my experience, companies don't value management the way they used to, they don't train managers as much.  And if you think about it, when people have bad experiences -- nearly if companies, they tend to leave managers, they don't leave companies.</p><p>QUEST:  If we take the United States, surely, the biggest example of just the difficulty that the -- of gender issue is taking the idea of maternity leave in the United States which you'll be aware of course, is -- you know, you're lucky if you get a few weeks pay and back to work or you're in trouble.</p><p>If you have a society that doesn't recognize that only half the population is genetically capable of having the next generation, then it's going to be very difficult to introduce other policies that will facilitate that.</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  So I think a lot of people think that, you know, maternity leave and having babies is one of the big issues, it's one part of the problem, but it's not the whole problem.  And I think --</p><p>QUEST:  But I guess what I'm saying is, if you don't deal with something as big as that, then you're --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  It's a critical piece --</p><p>QUEST:  Starting, you know, it's much more difficult to start to deal with the other areas.</p><p>[15:55:00]  TRENOWDEN:  So you're right, the U.S., I think is far behind in that space, and happily in the U.K., a lot of companies are now introducing equal, you know, parent leave for both women and men.  And so, I think you're right.  I think once we see, you know, men taking leave as well --</p><p>QUEST:  Yes --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  And sharing with their wives or with their partners, then, you know, we'll start to see more equality definitely.</p><p>QUEST:  Looking at the result of our poll tonight, it's a very -- it's a -- you know, 75 percent say quotas are not the answer.  Would you agree?</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  We would, the 30 Percent Club is against quotas.  We believe that, you know, voluntary business-led targets have a better result.  So I'll give you an example.  For those of us --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  With children, if you force your children to do things, you don't get the same sustainable result that you do if you talk to them and you  convince them to do it because they want to do it.</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you for coming in and on a Friday night, good to see you --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  Thank you very much --</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much.  Few moments left on Wall Street, we'll have a great look at the numbers, the Dow is well off the lows of the day, despite worrying news on the trade -- look at that, that is what you call a serious rally.  Even though Chinese officials are no longer planning for President Xi to visit Mar-a-Lago for a trade and signing summit, it doesn't matter, the markets is only off 22 points now.  We'll take our profitable moment after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, five years ago tonight, MH-370 went missing.  For some inexplicable reason, the Malaysian  government will not authorize a new search even one by Ocean Infinity that is privately funded on a no find, no fee basis.  It is inexplicable.</p><p>It's no, you're simply saying, well, we will do it if there's a credible reason, we don't want to get people's hopes up.  I tell you, those relatives of those who perished, they don't mind, they'd rather you're out there searching on the off chance and the possibility than sitting at home and thinking well, is it credible enough?</p><p>The reality is the Malaysia, China, Australia, the politics of MH-370 have been dreadful at most throughout the time.  And now there's still an opportunity to go back out and search in the areas most likely at somebody else's cost.  I cannot see why you wouldn't get that search underway again on the 5th anniversary is a good  opportunity to do it.</p><p>And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable.  The weekend is upon us, the Dow barely down, the bell is ringing, the day is done.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>[16:00:00]</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2189810359</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMD-VTC1-DY0W-41D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7366\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc.

The market has been down for the whole session but don't be too alarmed. The losses are actually quite small. Barely triple digits. And in the last hour or so, there is something of a rally being attempted. It looks about day, but let's see what's been moving the markets. Blink and you miss it, the U.S. economy is barely clinging on to the streak of job growth. We need to analyze the numbers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A slump in Shanghai, as China's trade numbers turn nasty and Norway sent the oil sector spinning with a multibillion dollars sell-off. We'll explain. It's Friday. It is the 8th of March. I am Richard Quest in London tonight, where of course, I mean business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening. Tonight, investors are reacting with alarm as the world's two largest economies are flashing warning signs. In the United States, new numbers show hiring slowed to a crawl in February and in China, exports fell more than 20% and in both cases, the experts and economists are wondering if these are blips and something deep and serious, or is it just a little bit of froth off the top.</p><p>In other words, temporary or the start of a lengthy slowdown? We start in the United States with the U.S. jobs report where the number of jobs added in February is the worst since September of 2017, a fraction of what economists expected - 20,000. It's a miserable number. Unemployment at 3.8%. So that's holding steady and wage growth at 3.4% is considered to be good. However, as fewer unemployed people look for work and wages rose, the growth was constrained and concentrated in certain industries. The president said the numbers were surprising for different reasons.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The unemployment rate just went lower. We are down now to 3.8%, so we have very good news in that. I think the big news really was that wages went up and that's great for the American worker. That's something for people -- I don't know if they ever expected to see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm, Grant Thornton, she joins us now from Chicago. Diane, if we look at these numbers and which is the more seriously -- serious number, the fact that growth was down -- I'm sorry, job growth was constrained or that wage growth actually is ticking up?</p><p>DIANE SWONK, CHIEF ECONOMIST, GRANT THORNTON: Well, they're both from the same survey, so they're both distorted a bit. The slowdown in job growth was largely in part to really unseasonably bad, even unusually bad winter weather, big loss in construction employment that we do expect to come back a little bit.</p><p>Also, we had some losses because some of those government workers had taken on a second job to make up for their lost pay. They got off that second job, so that came out of the numbers and we had some teacher strikes as well. That's one side of it.</p><p>The wage gains were -- are picking up. That's a good news. They're up a tenth from the high we had hit in December, but they're also distorted by the composition of jobs created during the month, only 20,000 net jobs dominated by high paying jobs and professional services that helped to buoy those wage gains from a year ago.</p><p>QUEST: So if you had to give this an interpretation on this report, bearing in mind that the revisions on the previous months were very small, which suggest that the trend of the slowdown is taking its toll.</p><p>SWONK: The slowdown is taking its toll. I look at this on sort of on a moving average basis. The three-month moving average is about what we had seen in 2018. The first two months of the year are slower and I expect that to continue because the economy is slowing. The first quarter is going to be a lousy quarter. We're going to bounce back a bit in the second quarter.</p><p>But overall growth in 2019 will be slower than 2018 and with that, we'll see a slower pace of job growth as well. A much slower pace over the course of the year.</p><p>QUEST: Stay with me because at the moment, as you'll be aware, Wall Street is marking ten years of the bull-run. So 10 years ago, I was sitting in this very spot when with hindsight, what we now understand, stocks hit bottom. Listen to that and I'll come back to you in a second, Diane.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Good evening to you. I'm Richard Quest. This is \"Quest Means Business.\" We are starting a new week and I'm afraid it's a new week but the same old story.</p><p>[15:05:10]</p><p>QUEST: Susan, they are so mixed at the New York Stock exchange, Susan, when I just looked a second or two ago, it looked like we were best part of a turn down on the market, has it come back a bit?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Well, we know the market did come back, look at how it has improved. The S&amp;P, by the way, Diane Swonk, you have 300% gain over that period. So how much, Diane Swonk is because cheap money from the central banks made the bull market inevitable?</p><p>SWONK: Well, it certainly was a major factor. There was also a major announcement right about we're going to see on 60 minutes, Chairman Powell, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, former Chair, Janet Yellen come together and talk about what happened ten years ago.</p><p>Ten years ago, at this time, it was when the Fed first did their quantitative easing. They announced that they would buy in the mortgage- backed security market and just that announcement alone started to turned things around. Before they ever bought one mortgage backed security, the market started to come back, and I think that's very important.</p><p>It's not just the fact that the Fed, fed financial markets. Financial markets took down the economy. The only cure was to fix financial markets and that gave an uneven kind of growth and then we missed the fiscal stimulus later in the expansion and that was taken away.</p><p>QUEST: So on the basis of the economic scenario, the landscape that you see now, are we good for a few more years of the bull market?</p><p>SWONK: I'm very concerned. My biggest concern is China. We have seen more bad data come out of China and it's not just contingent on a trade agreement with China. The weakness in China hit before the tariff hits in China. They've got a structural problem, second largest economy in the world. They've been a major push on growth of the global economy. You're seeing weakness in Europe. You've seen the ECB react to it this week. These are thing that concern me that tell me we're losing some of our stamina.</p><p>QUEST: Diane, thank you and we will continue with on the thought that you've raised for us, the issue of China because of the soft U.S. numbers weren't enough to shake investors; there more warning signals in the world's number two economy.</p><p>Chinese stocks fell by more than 4% on Friday after Beijing revealed that exports had fallen to their lowest levels in three years. The 21% slide coincides with the Chinese New Year holiday. It was driven by the trade war with the U.S. and slowing global economies.</p><p>David Dollar was the Treasury's Economic Emissary to China, joins me now. This very sharp falloff in exports, at the same time as the U.S. of course had some very bad trade numbers, too. But what do you believe is driving the China's numbers?</p><p>DAVID DOLLAR, FORMER TREASURY EMISSARY TO CHINA: Well, February is always a weak month in China. It's either the New Year festival or sometimes it comes right after the New Year festival. So February numbers, we have to be a little bit careful about. But this really caught most observers by surprise as you said, Richard. Exports were down 21%, and that's February on February. So you're comparing two Februarys. That's a lot more than anybody expected.</p><p>I was also disturbed that their imports fell by 5%. That's usually a pretty good indication of what's happening with domestic demand. That's important for a lot of countries around the world that are selling to China. So those are bad trade numbers, and as you said, Shanghai market fell 4.4%. It also didn't help, there was an interview with the U.S. Ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, and he pointed out the obvious that the two sides are still pretty far apart for a trade agreement. There's no concrete planning for a summit meeting at Mar-A-Lago and that I think also affected the market.</p><p>QUEST: Is it your gut that China is in deep trouble? The government has already, a couple of months ago, it played around with bank reserve limits. It's now done some other financial finagling to try and give a stimulus to the economy. Is China in trouble?</p><p>DOLLAR: My gut is that they're not in trouble in the sense of the proverbial hard landing. They've rolled out some modest stimulus measures. They're going to increase their fiscal deficit a little bit, a little bit additional borrowing by local governments, but it's all rather modest, and I think they have pretty good information about what's happening. If they were alarmed, they would be coming in much more strongly with measures, but they're coming in with modest stimulus.</p><p>So, I think they're probably going to be okay and if I'm wrong about that and things slide more in the next couple of months, they'll come in with further stimulus. So pretty safe bet they're going to get to their 6% target for the year.</p><p>[15:10:09]</p><p>QUEST: You heard Diane Swonk just a moment ago, if you take the U.S. situation on the trade numbers, the U.S. having the worst deficit in some years when it should have been getting better, the U.S. dollar remains extremely strong which of course is a negative on the imports and if you look at that trading relationship between the U.S. and China, there's no evidence that it's improving.</p><p>DOLLAR: Right. I mean, you're absolutely right about that. Last year, U.S. imports from China went up $34 billion despite the trade war. Our exports to China actually went down for the first time in many years. Now, I would say you wouldn't normally expect a trade war to improve the U.S. trade balance because what the U.S. is doing reduces imports, but it also reduces exports and so no presumption that it's going help the trade balance.</p><p>QUEST: Have a good weekend, sir. Lots to talk about and we'll talk more about it in the future. Thank you.</p><p>DOLLAR: Thanks a lot.</p><p>QUEST: We go to the White House now where the week is ending with a surprise shakeup. The Deputy Chief of Staff and Communications Director, Bill Shine has resigned. It was very unexpected. He is the fifth person to serve as Communications Director under President Trump. A statement from the White House says Shine will serve as a senior adviser to President Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.</p><p>Sarah Westwood is at the White House, so Sarah, was he pushed or was about to be pushed?</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, CNN: Well, Richard, we've been looking into this and it appears a combination of those things. Sources tell CNN that the President had started to sour on Bill Shine's performance. Bill Shine, the former executive at Fox News was brought on board in large part to help improve the press coverage of this White House. That did not happen over the eight months that Shine worked here and the President started to grow dissatisfied with that.</p><p>Aides said that they couldn't discern what Shine really did here at the White House beyond just the lighting and focused the cameras at White House events. At the same time, though, it's really unclear what Shine will be doing on the re-election campaign. Sources affiliated with the campaign say they were notified this morning that Shine would be joining them as a senior adviser. They haven't really been informed what exactly it is he will be doing. This was all hastily announced today as you mentioned, a very unexpected departure coming after a tough week for President Trump, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Some will claim this is more evidence of confusion in the White House.</p><p>WESTWOOD: Well, certainly you don't have to look far to find plenty of evidence of that. This particular position in the White House, the Communications Director position, has been done by five people, six people have been named White House Communications Director, one of them resigned before actually taking the position.</p><p>So this has been a notoriously difficult job for this administration to fill in part because President Trump likes to act so much as his own chief spokesman, and so it's difficult for someone to come in and try to direct his communications and Shine also, like his predecessors, struggled with that.</p><p>So, Richard, it will be interesting to see who the White House selects, if anyone, to hold this position moving forward.</p><p>QUEST: We'll watch it. Have a good weekend. Thank you.</p><p>WESTWOOD: You, too.</p><p>QUEST: Sarah at the White House. Coming up next, breaking up big tech, in the words of Neil Sedaka, it may be hard to do, but presidential hopeful, Elizabeth Warren is game to have a go. Big tech on the block in a moment.</p><p>[15:15:00]</p><p>QUEST: Five years ago tonight, Malaysia Airlines flight MH-370 disappeared and nothing has been heard of it since except some debris that washed up some months later. Family members of the Chinese nationals on board are now calling on their government to continue the search, a search that was called off in January 2017, after two years.</p><p>The plane disappeared with 239 passengers and crew on board. It was going between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing. Now, that is pretty much all we know about what happened to MH-370.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST (voice over): It is the aviation the mystery that transfixed the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, ANCHOR, CNN: Air traffic controllers in Southeast Asia have lost contact with a jumbo jet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over): The Boeing 777 was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it vanished. Two hundred and thirty nine people on board missing. Five years later, and aviation experts believe it's still possible to lose a passenger plane somewhere over the world's oceans.</p><p>Currently, air traffic controllers track planes through a patch work of radar, ground radio and satellite communications. The satellites have limited range. Now, a new system coming on line next month will for the first time allow the planes to be tracked in real-time anywhere they fly.</p><p>Also airlines will be able to subscribe to live tracking services that share location and other data.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARY SCHIAVO, AVIATION ANALYST, CNN: Not only will these tracking systems save the world from losing another plane and the heartbreak of five years out still not knowing where the people are, but every month it will save a state, a country, another jurisdiction from having to search for small planes that go missing all the time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Also, under development, a new generation of black boxes. Airbus is introducing a flight data recorder that ejects itself during a crash. While Honeywell is working on a cockpit voice and recorder that constantly streams data via satellite. None of this technology is currently mandated by regulators.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID SOUCIE, AVIATION SAFETY ANALYST, CNN: It's up to the airlines, it's up to the states themselves, the countries that fly aircraft to pay the extra dollars that it takes. And it's not a lot of extra dollars, maybe ten cents a ticket or so.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over): What hasn't changed of course is how families are treated during the most difficult experience of their lives. There are no uniform worldwide standards for immediate assistance and families are given no mandated access to the crash investigations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHIAVO: They are intentionally kept out and what does that do? That makes the entire investigation suspect in the eyes of the families.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over): Incidents like the disappearance of MH-370 involve families, investigators and regulators across many different jurisdictions. Bringing them all together is and direct common framework is what the authorities are trying to do.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOUCIE: There's no body that says you can't fly and charge for tickets and expect people to fly and fly on your airlines without a standard of safety that is worldwide. It can't just be state to state.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:20:06]</p><p>QUEST (voice over): As to the whereabouts and discovery of the final resting place of that 777, it may be many years when more sophisticated searching methods are devised that we'll ever find the wreckage, recover the remains and finally find out what happened to MH-370.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST: After the official search for MH-370 was called off, there was a second search led by the U.S. exploration firm, Ocean Infinity. The company says it's ready to launch a new effort. Ocean Infinity's Chief Executive, Oliver Plunkett joins me now.</p><p>Thank you, Oliver for being with us. What is stopping you from just saying, \"I'm going to put the ships out. We've got the technology. We've got the ships. It's a find or no fee. I'm going out tomorrow.\"</p><p>OLIVER PLUNKETT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, OCEAN INFINITY: We want to make sure firstly that we've properly analyzed all of the theories and know that we're looking exactly the right place. Minister Loke from Malaysia actually makes a very serious point when he says that the government doesn't want to engage unless there's a credible reason to do so. The other way of thinking about that is he says, \"I don't want to expose the families to the emotions of hope on a wild goose chase.\" And we feel that that's very important because ultimately, it's the families who are at the center of all of this.</p><p>QUEST: Right. The first principle's report which identified the most likely area which you then took as the basis, I'm simplifying, obviously, but you then took as the basis for the most likely area to search, well, did you complete that area in that last search? Are you comfortable that you searched the most likely area, and if so, then, yes, where do you go next?</p><p>PLUNKETT: I think with any ocean search, the idea that there is a pinpoint location can be nothing more than a starting point from which you go north, south, east and west based on the evidence which draws you in one of those four directions.</p><p>We started in the point where the original search finished and traveled north because that was most consistent with what was in the first principal's report. Inevitably, the southern Indian Ocean is an enormous body of water and whether it's near there or somewhere else requires some additional thought.</p><p>QUEST: So are you saying that we don't know where the plane went down? I mean, because at the end of the day, quite a lot of the ocean -- quite a lot of the area where the plane is believed to have gone down was searched very thoroughly in the first part. Your organization did an extremely thorough search using newer technologies of the most likely area. But do - - does the evidence still seem to together it is off the western coast of Australia?</p><p>PLUNKETT: When you look at the combination of the satellite data analysis and the ocean drift analysis that's been reviewed and carried out by various organizations from around the world, the preponderance of the evidence points you to the southern Indian Ocean off the west coast of Australia.</p><p>But it's a large area. And as I say, the idea that there's a pinpoint in this particular search just doesn't make any sense. There might be other searches where there is that evidence that it's very, very -- and you find the thing you're looking for exactly where the evidence suggests it should be. This isn't one of those.</p><p>QUEST: So I expect much of the day answering the questions to my colleagues about would they ever find it? And my answer has always been, yes, it will be found one day when the sophistication or sophisticated search tools are able to do that, and we're not there yet. Do you subscribe to that?</p><p>PLUNKETT: I also believe that it will be find one day. At the moment -- and this was the point I made to the families last weekend, I think we have got the tools to find it. What for me has made me feel that since we left the site of the Indian Ocean in June of last year, is that we found the Argentinian submarine, San Juan, and we found the Korean boat carrier, Stella Daisy.</p><p>The San Juan in particular, was an object of a similar size to MH-370, except it was designed not to be identified by sonar.</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>PLUNKETT: So the fact we can find that tells me that if we look in the right place, we can find MH-370.</p><p>QUEST: Right, and finally, in a sentence, so what do you need - who's permission do you now need to go back out and search?</p><p>PLUNKETT: The Government of Malaysia. I think it's important to remember that it isn't -- this is a -- it's an airplane that is subject to police investigations and it matters to the families, I think it's important to not just go out and do things without having that buy-in of all the stakeholders.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you sir. Thank you very much for joining us. Much appreciated.</p><p>PLUNKETT: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: And of course in future programs, we will be asking the government of Malaysia exactly when and why they will allow some people like Ocean Infinity to go back out.</p><p>Coming up next, breaking up big tech. The big names are huge, but Senator Warren takes on the three most valuable companies in the world.</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There is more \"Quest Means Business\" in a moment when you'll hear from Elizabeth Warren who thinks breaking up big tech will help her get to the White House, or at least promising to do it, and big oil companies have taken a big hit after one of their biggest investors says it is having a rethink on fossil fuels. As we continue tonight, this is CNN and on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people turned out again on Friday demonstrating across Algeria. Protestors are demanding that the 82-year-old President, Bouteflika, withdraw from next month's election. Despite suffering a stroke in 2013 and having rarely been seen in public since, the current President is moving ahead with his candidacy.</p><p>[15:30:10]</p><p>The lawyer for the so-called ISIS bride Shamima Begum says he believes her new born son has died. Begum is being held at a camp in Syria and gave birth to a baby boy last month.</p><p>She left the U.K. to join ISIS four years ago. She recently said she wanted to come back to Britain. But British officials say they would strip her of her citizenship because she supports a terrorist organization.</p><p>British lawmakers are getting ready to vote again on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal on Tuesday. Brexit is only 21 days away, Theresa May said a short while ago that if parliament rejects her deal, in her words, no one knows what will happen and that the U.K. might not leave the EU at all.</p><p>Parts of Venezuela has been without electricity since Thursday. There was a widespread power outrage that led officials to close schools and suspend other public services. President Maduro's government says it's due to sabotage of the country's main hydro electric power station. Critics say crumbling infrastructure and corruption are to blame.</p><p>So to SpaceX now celebrating the return of the Dragon. It's Crew Dragon capsule, that is, it came back to earth early on Friday and it capped off a historic test flight. SpaceX is developing commercial spacecraft to carry American astronauts to the International Space Station.</p><p>It's time to break up big tech according to U.S. presidential hopeful Senator Elizabeth Warren. She wants to take a saw to Amazon, Google and Facebook. It's all part of the bid to promote competition in the sector, she says. Now, of course, the senator's campaigning like a trust buster of yester-year.</p><p>When we think of Amazon with its vast holdings across many industries, its tentacle remind you of images such as those of the early 1900s. Now, back then, the idea was that of an octopus and it was the perfect metaphor for monopolies of oil and railroad companies and how they extended their reach, strong arming their way to the U.S.</p><p>And the analogy of the octopus -- as you can see Capitol Hill over there, you can see Wall Street over there, the analogy of the octopus and the company by the way of course, they talk about is Standard Oil which was broken up into SO as we now know today.</p><p>Now, it works just as well today of the analogy -- look at --</p><p>(BELL RINGS)</p><p>Amazon, there's Amazon web services and the amazon.com. All the tentacles going deep into the economy. With groceries at Whole Foods and shoes at Zappos, or as any book you can think of is audible or a candle. Amazon is now of course in the world, it's vast and it's strong and Elizabeth Warren wants to break it up piece by piece.</p><p>MJ Lee is in New York and joins me. Now, the idea of what -- I mean, it's not a new idea, but she's backing herself. This is turning into one of her touch-stone policies.</p><p>MJ LEE, CNN U.S. POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. And Richard, I'm actually just returning from Harlem where Elizabeth Warren had a campaign event and we got some time to talk to her about this new proposal to break up the big tech companies like Amazon, like Google, like Facebook.</p><p>So, let's actually listen to what she had to say. She was talking about this in the context of Amazon's failed bid to start a new headquarters in Long Island City and then we can talk on the other side.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS: I want to make clear, I cheered when New York City said we're pushing back just a little bit on everything that Amazon is asking for. Because here's the problem, these giant tech companies have so much power, so much economic power and so much political power that they go all around the country saying, bribe me to come be where you are.</p><p>And it's like a giant hunger games of some kind. What I believe is for it to have more competition in the marketplace and to level the playing field a little bit for small businesses and entrepreneurs and start-ups. What we've got to do is take those platforms, you know, how you order on Amazon or you do a search on Google, and break them off from the additional businesses that they're running and those additional businesses are where they're getting a comparative advantage on their information because of the information they get from their platforms.</p><p>The way to think about this right now is Amazon is like the umpire in the baseball game. It runs the marketplace, and it also has a lot of teams on the field because it's actually competing with the other businesses on that platform and giving special advantage, putting them on page 1 and somebody they don't like back on page 6.</p><p>[15:35:00] So my notion is, you can be an umpire or you can own a team, but you can't do both at the same time. And that's how we should break up Amazon, it's how we should break up Google, customers, both like you and me, we can still do our searches, we can still do what we want to do, but we want to break these up and get more competition in the industry.</p><p>LEE: Would you have been OK with it being in Boston, the second headquarters?</p><p>WARREN: So what I'm not OK with is the fact that cities are put into this competition against each other, and that they're asked to give up tax revenues to build special goodies. Because you know, here's the deal. A small business that's just getting started, no city is saying to them, hey, we're going to give you the same deal that Amazon is getting.</p><p>You're going to get a big lop off your taxes or we're going to hand out some special goodies to you. Every time the giant goes around the country and says give me something special, they help increase the concentration of the American economy. That's bad for our economy, it's bad for workers, it's bad for competition, it's bad for small businesses, and ultimately, it's bad for our democracy.</p><p>Just over the past few years, a handful of the top giants have already gotten $10 billion in special breaks from towns, counties and states. You know, that's a special break that gives them a leg up in competition. It's just not fair for small businesses and that's not right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: MJ, is this going to be a central plank of the senator's manifesto if you like. Is she going to run hard on this because it's perceived to be popular.</p><p>LEE: Oh, absolutely, and when you think about Elizabeth Warren and sort of what her campaign stands for so far, this goes to the root of it, right? She is running on getting money out of politics, weakening special interests and wealthy interests in politics, and this is really just the sort of core of her message.</p><p>And if you think back to what her actually first policy proposal of the campaign was, it was to tax the wealthy, the wealthiest Americans and she said that other proposals that she puts out will actually --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>LEE: Be paid for by those taxes. So all of these policy proposals come together, and I think what is going to be really fascinating to watch is how her competitors, the other Democratic candidates feel like they have to respond to this, right? Now that Elizabeth Warren has put out this proposal, you can be sure that the other Democratic candidates in the field are also going to be asked about this and asked do you support this or do you have another --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>LEE: Or better idea to deal with this?</p><p>QUEST: She has put the issue into play, good to see you, thank you, MJ, thank you for getting --</p><p>LEE: Thanks --</p><p>QUEST: And thank you for getting that interview back to us so promptly, I appreciate it that it's just taken place. As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, over three decades, oil money has funded Norway's trillion dollar sovereign well fund; the largest in the world. Now also, wants to turn away from energy to secure the country's financial future.</p><p>[15:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Norway wants to hedge its financial future no longer being quite so tied up with energy and energy stocks. The company -- of course, the Norwegian government's trillion dollar sovereign wealth fund has revealed it's cashing out of most of its oil and gas investments. Now, the idea is -- or the worry is, bearing in mind that most of Norway's sovereign wealthy and most of the country's economy comes from oil and gas exports.</p><p>But they want to hedge against a permanent oil price decline because what's the point of having all your money in a hedge fund, and the hedge fund owning oil and gas companies, in other words, eggs in one basket. You see what I mean there, $7.5 billion is already in exploration and production, and those parts of the economy, $7.5 billion.</p><p>Now, the fund is going to keep investing in big oil companies that works on renewables. So, those that are high on renewables can still expect to receive investments from the fund. Look what happened to the oil market in terms of the price, not the crudes.</p><p>BP down at 1 percent, ExxonMobil up one-three quarters, for good reason, for good reason, one of main investors or large investors I should say is about to withdraw. And the news, Norway sent shockwaves through the market. Matt Egan is in New York, joins me now. It's somewhat inevitable that the prices were going to fall, but does the market or is the general view that the policy is the right one?</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: You know, Richard, that's a good question. I think you really nailed it, Norway is really concerned that it is overexposed to oil. It is worried about what will happen if there is some sort of a permanent decline in oil prices. And so you noted that the energy sector was down broadly today.</p><p>But what I think is really interesting is some of the EMP companies that Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund owns, they're down even more. We saw a Apache and Adaco, Chesapeake, EOG Resources, Occidental Petroleum, they're all down more than twice the amount that oil prices are today, and that's because they are worried that one of their biggest investors is going to gradually cash out.</p><p>But you know, it is important to note that Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund is not getting out entirely. They are still going to hold on to their investments in some of these oil majors. The likes of Exxon and Shell and BP, and they're all hoping that some of these oil majors would start investing even more in renewable energy in the future.</p><p>QUEST: Now, Matt, I don't know too much about the Norwegian Sovereign Fund, although one, it's hard to look at the various points over the years, but I do know it is widely regarded as amongst the most respected in the world.</p><p>EGAN: Right, we're talking about a trillion dollar fund, it's the biggest of its kind and it is looked at as ahead of the curve and forward-looking. And so, you'll recall that in 2015, Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund actually divested from coal. It did that ahead of other large institutional investors.</p><p>And so if you talk to, you know, some of the climate activists, they're still really chalking this up as a win and they say that it's a clear sign that slowly, but steadily, some of these large institutions are trying to back away from fossil fuels. Now, there's a bit of irony here because as you mentioned, Norway got its $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund by of course producing oil.</p><p>It is still the largest oil producer in western Europe, and it's going to continue to produce more oil.</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>EGAN: The hope is that it just won't be quite as exposed to oil prices going forward.</p><p>QUEST: Fascinating, sorry, good to see you, have a lovely weekend.</p><p>EGAN: You too.</p><p>[15:45:00] European stocks closed out with the week with another day of losses. Stocks were dragged down by continued concerns over slowing global economy. Look at the numbers, they tell their own story, the FTSE closed lower as the Brexit stalemate drags on, Theresa May is warning Britain's EU exit may not happen at all if her deal is rejected on Tuesday.</p><p>We continue now. It's International Women's Day, one reporter put the Prime Minister to the test.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Prime Minister, only one question from a woman reporter on International Women's Day, it's pretty for a show, isn't it?</p><p>THERESA MAY, PRIME MINISTER, UNITED KINGDOM: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: If you weren't able to hear the answer, well, the answers came from a woman Prime Minister, she said that every Prime Minister has been applauded for their comments on this International Women's Day. We'll explain next.</p><p>QUEST: Friday marked the celebration of International Women's Day, and all across the globe, we were taken to the streets to champion gender equality. In Spain, many women are hosting a feminist strike ahead of the upcoming parliamentary election.</p><p>More than 500 street demonstrations are planned according to the newspaper \"El Pais\". In France, demonstrators marched to call attention to the gender pay gap and discrimination. At the same time, the Australian Prime Minister is telling women your empowerment shouldn't come at a cost to men.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT MORRISON, PRIME MINISTER, AUSTRALIA: Gender equality isn't about putting girls against boys. See, we're not about setting Australians against each other, trying to push some down to lift others up. That's not in our values. That is an absolute liberal value that you don't push some people down to lift some people up.</p><p>And that is true about gender equality too. We want to see women rise, but we don't want to see women rise only on the basis of others doing worse. We want everybody to do better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Scott Morrison's comments sparked a backlash on social media. The Senator Sarah Hanson Young tweeted, \"men who are threatened or worried of women achieving equality is the problem.\" Morrison's party service on gender imbalance, only 22 percent of liberal party members in parliament are women.</p><p>Now, Mr. Morrison's predecessor Julia Gillard was on a panel with Meghan Markle this morning. She also published a column in \"The Guardian\" newspaper, saying \"gender equality isn't a women's issue, it's good for men too.\" Julia Gillard established the Global Institute for Women's Leadership at King's College last year.</p><p>[15:50:00] Back in September, she told me more progress must be made.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA GILLARD, FORMER PRIME MINISTER, AUSTRALIA: We're just putting a simple case that we want to strive for a world of gender equality. That merit is equally distributed between the sexes, that we live in a world where whether it's politics or leading corporations or the law or news media or technology, less than 30 percent of leadership positions in all of those fields are held by women and we can do better than that.</p><p>And we can do better in how we evaluate women's leadership which shouldn't include streams of horrible stuff on social media.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Get out your phones, your tablets, your devices and join our conversations, and go to cnn.com-slash-join. The question tonight is are quotas the answer for equality in corporate leadership? In other words a specific number, for example, 30 percent perhaps.</p><p>Brenda Trenowden is the global chair of the 30 Percent Club and the head of the Financial Institutions Group at ANZ Bank. She's also an adviser to an independent review into upping the number of women in senior positions at FTSE companies. She's with me now, good to see you.</p><p>The -- we can deal quickly with the Australian Prime Minister's -- was it - - what was it that he said that was so objectionable? Because most women in professions would agree, yes, we got here our own way, but not just on the back of pushing somebody else down.</p><p>BRENDA TRENOWDEN, GLOBAL CHAIR, 30 PERCENT CLUB &amp; HEAD, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS GROUP, ANZ BANK: Right, I think all the women that I know and work with would certainly say the same thing and we certainly think it's not a zero-sum game. You know, I didn't hear his whole speech, so I think when you take one sentence out of context, sometimes, you know, things are misinterpreted.</p><p>So, I would agree that we don't want to be pushing other people down to bring people up, we want everybody to be rising up. We want everyone to benefit from greater inclusion actually.</p><p>QUEST: And what is the -- what is the biggest issue bedeviling now women in senior positions, do you believe?</p><p>TRENOWDEN: Well, I wish there was just one issue, Richard, that it would be easier to solve, but it's a multi-variety problem and therefore requires a multi-variety solution. But there are lots of things, there are definitely unconscious biases. You know, there are stereotypes and norms that everyone has in their heads about what leadership looks like, that I think holds women back.</p><p>You've certainly got lack of sponsorship. You know, you've got culture. I think the big thing that the 30 Percent Club is focusing on this year is really looking at the inclusion side of the DNI equation. So we've spent a lot of time trying to create a lot more diversity, hire more women or under represented candidates.</p><p>But we haven't spent enough time thinking about how to make culture more inconclusive for everyone. And so I think that is part of the biggest issue is one type of dominant culture --</p><p>QUEST: And yet in the workplace, most companies have a veritable forest of policies, you know, pages on the website, mission statements galore about it and are still seeing to somehow fumble in the final hurdle.</p><p>TRENOWDEN: So policies are great, and words on a website are fantastic. But what we see is that, first of all, the leadership of the company, the CEO has to take this seriously because it's good for their business, and they have to communicate that authentically.</p><p>They then have to do a diagnostic of where the challenges are in their own company because every company is different. But I think one of the biggest challenges we see is that all of this has to be implemented by managers.</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>TRENOWDEN: You know, a lot of the problem comes into that middle management layer. And certainly in my experience, companies don't value management the way they used to, they don't train managers as much. And if you think about it, when people have bad experiences -- nearly if companies, they tend to leave managers, they don't leave companies.</p><p>QUEST: If we take the United States, surely, the biggest example of just the difficulty that the -- of gender issue is taking the idea of maternity leave in the United States which you'll be aware of course, is -- you know, you're lucky if you get a few weeks pay and back to work or you're in trouble.</p><p>If you have a society that doesn't recognize that only half the population is genetically capable of having the next generation, then it's going to be very difficult to introduce other policies that will facilitate that.</p><p>TRENOWDEN: So I think a lot of people think that, you know, maternity leave and having babies is one of the big issues, it's one part of the problem, but it's not the whole problem. And I think --</p><p>QUEST: But I guess what I'm saying is, if you don't deal with something as big as that, then you're --</p><p>TRENOWDEN: It's a critical piece --</p><p>QUEST: Starting, you know, it's much more difficult to start to deal with the other areas.</p><p>[15:55:00] TRENOWDEN: So you're right, the U.S., I think is far behind in that space, and happily in the U.K., a lot of companies are now introducing equal, you know, parent leave for both women and men. And so, I think you're right. I think once we see, you know, men taking leave as well --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>TRENOWDEN: And sharing with their wives or with their partners, then, you know, we'll start to see more equality definitely.</p><p>QUEST: Looking at the result of our poll tonight, it's a very -- it's a -- you know, 75 percent say quotas are not the answer. Would you agree?</p><p>TRENOWDEN: We would, the 30 Percent Club is against quotas. We believe that, you know, voluntary business-led targets have a better result. So I'll give you an example. For those of us --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>TRENOWDEN: With children, if you force your children to do things, you don't get the same sustainable result that you do if you talk to them and you convince them to do it because they want to do it.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you for coming in and on a Friday night, good to see you --</p><p>TRENOWDEN: Thank you very much --</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much. Few moments left on Wall Street, we'll have a great look at the numbers, the Dow is well off the lows of the day, despite worrying news on the trade -- look at that, that is what you call a serious rally. Even though Chinese officials are no longer planning for President Xi to visit Mar-a-Lago for a trade and signing summit, it doesn't matter, the markets is only off 22 points now. We'll take our profitable moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment, five years ago tonight, MH-370 went missing. For some inexplicable reason, the Malaysian government will not authorize a new search even one by Ocean Infinity that is privately funded on a no find, no fee basis. It is inexplicable.</p><p>It's no, you're simply saying, well, we will do it if there's a credible reason, we don't want to get people's hopes up. I tell you, those relatives of those who perished, they don't mind, they'd rather you're out there searching on the off chance and the possibility than sitting at home and thinking well, is it credible enough?</p><p>The reality is the Malaysia, China, Australia, the politics of MH-370 have been dreadful at most throughout the time. And now there's still an opportunity to go back out and search in the areas most likely at somebody else's cost. I cannot see why you wouldn't get that search underway again on the 5th anniversary is a good opportunity to do it.</p><p>And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable. The weekend is upon us, the Dow barely down, the bell is ringing, the day is done.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>[16:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019030801cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKS-6D71-DXH2-60CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7288\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 8, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00027IW</classCode><className>MALAYSIA AIRLINE SYSTEM BDH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002N03</classCode><className>GRANT THORNTON INTERNATIONAL LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS541611 ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT &amp;

The market has been down for the whole session but don't be too alarmed.  The losses are actually quite small.  Barely triple digits.  And in the last hour or so, there is something of a rally being attempted.  It looks about day, but let's see what's been moving the markets.  Blink and you miss it, the U.S. economy is barely clinging on to the streak of job growth.  We need to analyze the numbers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A slump in Shanghai, as China's trade numbers turn nasty and Norway sent the oil sector spinning with a multibillion dollars sell-off.  We'll explain.  It's Friday.  It is the 8th of March.  I am Richard Quest in London tonight, where of course, I mean business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.  Tonight, investors are reacting with alarm as the world's two largest economies are flashing warning signs.  In the United States, new numbers show hiring slowed to a crawl in February and in China, exports fell more than 20% and in both cases, the experts and economists are wondering if these are blips and something deep and serious, or is it just a little bit of froth off the top.</p><p>In other words, temporary or the start of a lengthy slowdown?  We start in the United States with the U.S. jobs report where the number of jobs added in February is the worst since September of 2017, a fraction of what economists expected - 20,000.  It's a miserable number.  Unemployment at 3.8%.  So that's holding steady and wage growth at 3.4% is considered to be good.  However, as fewer unemployed people look for work and wages rose, the growth was constrained and concentrated in certain industries.  The president said the numbers were surprising for different reasons.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The unemployment rate just went lower.  We are down now to 3.8%, so we have very good news in that.  I think the big news really was that wages went up and that's great for the American worker.  That's something for people -- I don't know if they ever expected to see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm, Grant Thornton, she joins us now from Chicago.  Diane, if we look at these numbers and which is the more seriously -- serious number, the fact that growth was down -- I'm sorry, job growth was constrained or that wage growth actually is ticking up?</p><p>DIANE SWONK, CHIEF ECONOMIST, GRANT THORNTON:  Well, they're both from the same survey, so they're both distorted a bit.  The slowdown in job growth was largely in part to really unseasonably bad, even unusually bad winter weather, big loss in construction employment that we do expect to come back a little bit.</p><p>Also, we had some losses because some of those government workers had taken on a second job to make up for their lost pay.  They got off that second job, so that came out of the numbers and we had some teacher strikes as well.  That's one side of it.</p><p>The wage gains were -- are picking up.  That's a good news.  They're up a tenth from the high we had hit in December, but they're also distorted by the composition of jobs created during the month, only 20,000 net jobs dominated by high paying jobs and professional services that helped to buoy those wage gains from a year ago.</p><p>QUEST:  So if you had to give this an interpretation on this report, bearing in mind that the revisions on the previous months were very small, which suggest that the trend of the slowdown is taking its toll.</p><p>SWONK:  The slowdown is taking its toll.  I look at this on sort of on a moving average basis.  The three-month moving average is about what we had seen in 2018.  The first two months of the year are slower and I expect that to continue because the economy is slowing.  The first quarter is going to be a lousy quarter.  We're going to bounce back a bit in the second quarter.</p><p>But overall growth in 2019 will be slower than 2018 and with that, we'll see a slower pace of job growth as well.  A much slower pace over the course of the year.</p><p>QUEST:  Stay with me because at the moment, as you'll be aware, Wall Street is marking ten years of the bull-run.  So 10 years ago, I was sitting in this very spot when with hindsight, what we now understand, stocks hit bottom.  Listen to that and I'll come back to you in a second, Diane.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Good evening to you.  I'm Richard Quest.  This is \"Quest Means Business.\"  We are starting a new week and I'm afraid it's a new week but the same old story.</p><p>[15:05:10]</p><p>QUEST:  Susan, they are so mixed at the New York Stock exchange, Susan, when I just looked a second or two ago, it looked like we were best part of a turn down on the market, has it come back a bit?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Well, we know the market did come back, look at how it has improved.  The S&amp;P, by the way, Diane Swonk, you have 300% gain over that period.  So how much, Diane Swonk is because cheap money from the central banks made the bull market inevitable?</p><p>SWONK:  Well, it certainly was a major factor.  There was also a major announcement right about we're going to see on 60 minutes, Chairman Powell, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, former Chair, Janet Yellen come together and talk about what happened ten years ago.</p><p>Ten years ago, at this time, it was when the Fed first did their quantitative easing.  They announced that they would buy in the mortgage-backed security market and just that announcement alone started to turned things around.  Before they ever bought one mortgage backed security, the market started to come back, and I think that's very important.</p><p>It's not just the fact that the Fed, fed financial markets.  Financial markets took down the economy.  The only cure was to fix financial markets and that gave an uneven kind of growth and then we missed the fiscal stimulus later in the expansion and that was taken away.</p><p>QUEST:  So on the basis of the economic scenario, the landscape that you see now, are we good for a few more years of the bull market?</p><p>SWONK:  I'm very concerned.  My biggest concern is China.  We have seen more bad data come out of China and it's not just contingent on a trade agreement with China.  The weakness in China hit before the tariff hits in China.  They've got a structural problem, second largest economy in the world.  They've been a major push on growth of the global economy.  You're seeing weakness in Europe.  You've seen the ECB react to it this week.  These are thing that concern me that tell me we're losing some of our stamina.</p><p>QUEST:  Diane, thank you and we will continue with on the thought that you've raised for us, the issue of China because of the soft U.S. numbers weren't enough to shake investors; there more warning signals in the world's number two economy.</p><p>Chinese stocks fell by more than 4% on Friday after Beijing revealed that exports had fallen to their lowest levels in three years.  The 21% slide coincides with the Chinese New Year holiday.  It was driven by the trade war with the U.S. and slowing global economies.</p><p>David Dollar was the Treasury's Economic Emissary to China, joins me now.  This very sharp falloff in exports, at the same time as the U.S. of course had some very bad trade numbers, too.  But what do you believe is driving the China's numbers?</p><p>DAVID DOLLAR, FORMER TREASURY EMISSARY TO CHINA:  Well, February is always a weak month in China.  It's either the New Year festival or sometimes it comes right after the New Year festival.  So February numbers, we have to be a little bit careful about.  But this really caught most observers by surprise as you said, Richard.  Exports were down 21%, and that's February on February.  So you're comparing two Februarys.  That's a lot more than anybody expected.</p><p>I was also disturbed that their imports fell by 5%.  That's usually a pretty good indication of what's happening with domestic demand.  That's important for a lot of countries around the world that are selling to China.  So those are bad trade numbers, and as you said, Shanghai market fell 4.4%.  It also didn't help, there was an interview with the U.S. Ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, and he pointed out the obvious that the two sides are still pretty far apart for a trade agreement.  There's no concrete planning for a summit meeting at Mar-A-Lago and that I think also affected the market.</p><p>QUEST:  Is it your gut that China is in deep trouble?  The government has already, a couple of months ago, it played around with bank reserve limits.  It's now done some other financial finagling to try and give a stimulus to the economy.  Is China in trouble?</p><p>DOLLAR:  My gut is that they're not in trouble in the sense of the proverbial hard landing.  They've rolled out some modest stimulus measures.  They're going to increase their fiscal deficit a little bit, a little bit additional borrowing by local governments, but it's all rather modest, and I think they have pretty good information about what's happening.  If they were alarmed, they would be coming in much more strongly with measures, but they're coming in with modest stimulus.</p><p>So, I think they're probably going to be okay and if I'm wrong about that and things slide more in the next couple of months, they'll come in with further stimulus.  So pretty safe bet they're going to get to their 6% target for the year.</p><p>[15:10:09]</p><p>QUEST:  You heard Diane Swonk just a moment ago, if you take the U.S. situation on the trade numbers, the U.S. having the worst deficit in some years when it should have been getting better, the U.S. dollar remains extremely strong which of course is a negative on the imports and if you look at that trading relationship between the U.S. and China, there's no evidence that it's improving.</p><p>DOLLAR:  Right.  I mean, you're absolutely right about that.  Last year, U.S. imports from China went up $34 billion despite the trade war.  Our exports to China actually went down for the first time in many years.  Now, I would say you wouldn't normally expect a trade war to improve the U.S. trade balance because what the U.S. is doing reduces imports, but it also reduces exports and so no presumption that it's going help the trade balance.</p><p>QUEST:  Have a good weekend, sir.  Lots to talk about and we'll talk more about it in the future.  Thank you.</p><p>DOLLAR:  Thanks a lot.</p><p>QUEST:  We go to the White House now where the week is ending with a surprise shakeup.  The Deputy Chief of Staff and Communications Director, Bill Shine has resigned.  It was very unexpected.  He is the fifth person to serve as Communications Director under President Trump.  A statement from the White House says Shine will serve as a senior adviser to President Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.</p><p>Sarah Westwood is at the White House, so Sarah, was he pushed or was about to be pushed?</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, CNN:  Well, Richard, we've been looking into this and it appears a combination of those things.  Sources tell CNN that the President had started to sour on Bill Shine's performance.  Bill Shine, the former executive at Fox News was brought on board in large part to help improve the press coverage of this White House.  That did not happen over the eight months that Shine worked here and the President started to grow dissatisfied with that.</p><p>Aides said that they couldn't discern what Shine really did here at the White House beyond just the lighting and focused the cameras at White House events.  At the same time, though, it's really unclear what Shine will be doing on the re-election campaign.  Sources affiliated with the campaign say they were notified this morning that Shine would be joining them as a senior adviser.  They haven't really been informed what exactly it is he will be doing.  This was all hastily announced today as you mentioned, a very unexpected departure coming after a tough week for President Trump, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  Some will claim this is more evidence of confusion in the White House.</p><p>WESTWOOD:  Well, certainly you don't have to look far to find plenty of evidence of that.  This particular position in the White House, the Communications Director position, has been done by five people, six people have been named White House Communications Director, one of them resigned before actually taking the position.</p><p>So this has been a notoriously difficult job for this administration to fill in part because President Trump likes to act so much as his own chief spokesman, and so it's difficult for someone to come in and try to direct his communications and Shine also, like his predecessors, struggled with that.</p><p>So, Richard, it will be interesting to see who the White House selects, if anyone, to hold this position moving forward.</p><p>QUEST:  We'll watch it.  Have a good weekend.  Thank you.</p><p>WESTWOOD:  You, too.</p><p>QUEST:  Sarah at the White House.  Coming up next, breaking up big tech, in the words of Neil Sedaka, it may be hard to do, but presidential hopeful, Elizabeth Warren is game to have a go.  Big tech on the block in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:15:00]</p><p>QUEST:  Five years ago tonight, Malaysia Airlines flight MH-370 disappeared and nothing has been heard of it since except some debris that washed up some months later.  Family members of the Chinese nationals on board are now calling on their government to continue the search, a search that was called off in January 2017, after two years.</p><p>The plane disappeared with 239 passengers and crew on board.  It was going between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing.  Now, that is pretty much all we know about what happened to MH-370.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  It is the aviation the mystery that transfixed the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, ANCHOR, CNN:  Air traffic controllers in Southeast Asia have lost contact with a jumbo jet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  The Boeing 777 was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it vanished.  Two hundred and thirty nine people on board missing.  Five years later, and aviation experts believe it's still possible to lose a passenger plane somewhere over the world's oceans.</p><p>Currently, air traffic controllers track planes through a patch work of radar, ground radio and satellite communications.  The satellites have limited range.  Now, a new system coming on line next month will for the first time allow the planes to be tracked in real-time anywhere they fly.</p><p>Also airlines will be able to subscribe to live tracking services that share location and other data.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARY SCHIAVO, AVIATION ANALYST, CNN:  Not only will these tracking systems save the world from losing another plane and the heartbreak of five years out still not knowing where the people are, but every month it will save a state, a country, another jurisdiction from having to search for small planes that go missing all the time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Also, under development, a new generation of black boxes.  Airbus is introducing a flight data recorder that ejects itself during a crash.  While Honeywell is working on a cockpit voice and recorder that constantly streams data via satellite.  None of this technology is currently mandated by regulators.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID SOUCIE, AVIATION SAFETY ANALYST, CNN:  It's up to the airlines, it's up to the states themselves, the countries that fly aircraft to pay the extra dollars that it takes.  And it's not a lot of extra dollars, maybe ten cents a ticket or so.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  What hasn't changed of course is how families are treated during the most difficult experience of their lives.  There are no uniform worldwide standards for immediate assistance and families are given no mandated access to the crash investigations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHIAVO:  They are intentionally kept out and what does that do?  That makes the entire investigation suspect in the eyes of the families.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  Incidents like the disappearance of MH-370 involve families, investigators and regulators across many different jurisdictions.  Bringing them all together is and direct common framework is what the authorities are trying to do.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOUCIE:  There's no body that says you can't fly and charge for tickets and expect people to fly and fly on your airlines without a standard of safety that is worldwide.  It can't just be state to state.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:20:06]</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  As to the whereabouts and discovery of the final resting place of that 777, it may be many years when more sophisticated searching methods are devised that we'll ever find the wreckage, recover the remains and finally find out what happened to MH-370.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  After the official search for MH-370 was called off, there was a second search led by the U.S. exploration firm, Ocean Infinity.  The company says it's ready to launch a new effort.  Ocean Infinity's Chief Executive, Oliver Plunkett joins me now.</p><p>Thank you, Oliver for being with us.  What is stopping you from just saying, \"I'm going to put the ships out.  We've got the technology.  We've got the ships.  It's a find or no fee.  I'm going out tomorrow.\"</p><p>OLIVER PLUNKETT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, OCEAN INFINITY:  We want to make sure firstly that we've properly analyzed all of the theories and know that we're looking exactly the right place.  Minister Loke from Malaysia actually makes a very serious point when he says that the government doesn't want to engage unless there's a credible reason to do so.  The other way of thinking about that is he says, \"I don't want to expose the families to the emotions of hope on a wild goose chase.\"  And we feel that that's very important because ultimately, it's the families who are at the center of all of this.</p><p>QUEST:  Right.  The first principle's report which identified the most likely area which you then took as the basis, I'm simplifying, obviously, but you then took as the basis for the most likely area to search, well, did you complete that area in that last search?  Are you comfortable that you searched the most likely area, and if so, then, yes, where do you go next?</p><p>PLUNKETT:  I think with any ocean search, the idea that there is a pinpoint location can be nothing more than a starting point from which you go north, south, east and west based on the evidence which draws you in one of those four directions.</p><p>We started in the point where the original search finished and traveled north because that was most consistent with what was in the first principal's report.  Inevitably, the southern Indian Ocean is an enormous body of water and whether it's near there or somewhere else requires some additional thought.</p><p>QUEST:  So are you saying that we don't know where the plane went down?  I mean, because at the end of the day, quite a lot of the ocean -- quite a lot of the area where the plane is believed to have gone down was searched very thoroughly in the first part.  Your organization did an extremely thorough search using newer technologies of the most likely area.  But do -- does the evidence still seem to together it is off the western coast of Australia?</p><p>PLUNKETT:  When you look at the combination of the satellite data analysis and the ocean drift analysis that's been reviewed and carried out by various organizations from around the world, the preponderance of the evidence points you to the southern Indian Ocean off the west coast of Australia.</p><p>But it's a large area.  And as I say, the idea that there's a pinpoint in this particular search just doesn't make any sense.  There might be other searches where there is that evidence that it's very, very -- and you find the thing you're looking for exactly where the evidence suggests it should be.  This isn't one of those.</p><p>QUEST:  So I expect much of the day answering the questions to my colleagues about would they ever find it?  And my answer has always been, yes, it will be found one day when the sophistication or sophisticated search tools are able to do that, and we're not there yet.  Do you subscribe to that?</p><p>PLUNKETT:  I also believe that it will be find one day.  At the moment -- and this was the point I made to the families last weekend, I think we have got the tools to find it.  What for me has made me feel that since we left the site of the Indian Ocean in June of last year, is that we found the Argentinian submarine, San Juan, and we found the Korean boat carrier, Stella Daisy.</p><p>The San Juan in particular, was an object of a similar size to MH-370, except it was designed not to be identified by sonar.</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>PLUNKETT:  So the fact we can find that tells me that if we look in the right place, we can find MH-370.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, and finally, in a sentence, so what do you need - who's permission do you now need to go back out and search?</p><p>PLUNKETT:  The Government of Malaysia.  I think it's important to remember that it isn't -- this is a -- it's an airplane that is subject to police investigations and it matters to the families, I think it's important to not just go out and do things without having that buy-in of all the stakeholders.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you sir.  Thank you very much for joining us.  Much appreciated.</p><p>PLUNKETT:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  And of course in future programs, we will be asking the government of Malaysia exactly when and why they will allow some people like Ocean Infinity to go back out.</p><p>Coming up next, breaking up big tech.  The big names are huge, but Senator Warren takes on the three most valuable companies in the world.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There is more \"Quest Means Business\" in a moment when you'll hear from Elizabeth Warren who thinks breaking up big tech will help her get to the White House, or at least promising to do it, and big oil companies have taken a big hit after one of their biggest investors says it is having a rethink on fossil fuels.  As we continue tonight, this is CNN and on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people turned out again on Friday demonstrating across Algeria.  Protestors are demanding that the 82-year-old President, Bouteflika, withdraw from next month's election.  Despite suffering a stroke in 2013 and having rarely been seen in public since, the current President is moving ahead with his candidacy.</p><p>[15:30:10]</p><p>The lawyer for the so-called ISIS bride Shamima Begum says he believes her new born son has died.  Begum is being held at a camp in Syria and gave birth to a baby boy last month.</p><p>She left the U.K. to join ISIS four years ago.  She recently said she wanted to come back to Britain.  But British officials say they would strip her of her citizenship because she supports a terrorist organization.</p><p>British lawmakers are getting ready to vote again on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal on Tuesday.  Brexit is only 21 days away, Theresa May said a short while ago that if parliament rejects her deal, in her words, no one knows what will happen and that the U.K. might not leave the EU at all.</p><p>Parts of Venezuela has been without electricity since Thursday.  There was a widespread power outrage that led officials to close schools and suspend other  public services.  President Maduro's government says it's due to sabotage of the country's main hydro electric power station.  Critics say crumbling infrastructure and corruption are to blame.</p><p>So to SpaceX now celebrating the return of the Dragon.  It's Crew Dragon capsule, that is, it came back to earth early on Friday and it capped off a historic test flight.  SpaceX is developing commercial spacecraft to carry American astronauts to the International Space Station.</p><p>It's time to break up big tech according to U.S. presidential hopeful Senator  Elizabeth Warren.  She wants to take a saw to Amazon, Google and Facebook.  It's all part of the bid to promote competition in the sector, she says.  Now, of course, the senator's campaigning like a trust buster of yester-year.</p><p>When we think of Amazon with its vast holdings across many industries, its tentacle remind you of images such as those of the early 1900s.  Now, back then, the idea was that of an octopus and it was the perfect metaphor for monopolies of oil and railroad companies and how they extended their reach, strong arming their way to the U.S.</p><p>And the analogy of the octopus -- as you can see Capitol Hill over there, you can see Wall Street over there, the analogy of the octopus and the company by the way of course, they talk about is Standard Oil which was broken up into SO as we now know today.</p><p>Now, it works just as well today of the analogy -- look at --</p><p>(BELL RINGS)</p><p>Amazon, there's Amazon web services and the amazon.com.  All the tentacles going deep into the economy.  With groceries at Whole Foods and shoes at Zappos, or as any book you can think of is audible or a candle.  Amazon is now of course in the world, it's vast and it's strong and Elizabeth Warren wants to break  it up piece by piece.</p><p>MJ Lee is in New York and joins me.  Now, the idea of what -- I mean, it's not a  new idea, but she's backing herself.  This is turning into one of her touch-stone policies.</p><p>MJ LEE, CNN U.S. POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely.  And Richard, I'm actually just returning from Harlem where Elizabeth Warren had a campaign event and we got some time to talk to her about this new proposal to break up the big tech companies like Amazon, like Google, like Facebook.</p><p>So, let's actually listen to what she had to say.  She was talking about this in the context of Amazon's failed bid to start a new headquarters in Long Island City and then we can talk on the other side.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  I want to make clear, I cheered when New York City said we're pushing back just a little bit on everything that Amazon is asking for.  Because here's the problem, these giant tech companies have so much power, so much economic power and so much  political power that they go all around the country saying, bribe me to come be where you are.</p><p>And it's like a giant hunger games of some kind.  What I believe is for it to have more competition in the marketplace and to level the playing field a little bit for  small businesses and entrepreneurs and start-ups.  What we've got to do is take  those platforms, you know, how you order on Amazon or you do a search on Google, and break them off from the additional businesses that they're running  and those additional businesses are where they're getting a comparative advantage on their information because of the information they get from their  platforms.</p><p>The way to think about this right now is Amazon is like the umpire in the baseball game.  It runs the marketplace, and it also has a lot of teams on the field  because it's actually competing with the other businesses on that platform and giving special advantage, putting them on page 1 and somebody they don't like back on page 6.</p><p>[15:35:00]  So my notion is, you can be an umpire or you can own a team, but you can't do both at the same time.  And that's how we should break up Amazon, it's how we should break up Google, customers, both like you and me, we can still do our searches, we can still do what we want to do, but we want to break these up and get more competition in the industry.</p><p>LEE:  Would you have been OK with it being in Boston, the second headquarters?</p><p>WARREN:  So what I'm not OK with is the fact that cities are put into this competition against each other, and that they're asked to give up tax revenues to build special goodies.  Because you know, here's the deal.  A small business that's just getting started, no city is saying to them, hey, we're going to give you the same deal that Amazon is getting.</p><p>You're going to get a big lop off your taxes or we're going to hand out some  special goodies to you.  Every time the giant goes around the country and says give me something special, they help increase the concentration of the American economy.  That's bad for our economy, it's bad for workers, it's bad for competition, it's bad for small businesses, and ultimately, it's bad for our  democracy.</p><p>Just over the past few years, a handful of the top giants have already gotten $10 billion in special breaks from towns, counties and states.  You know, that's a special break that gives them a leg up in competition.  It's just not fair for small  businesses and that's not right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  MJ, is this going to be a central plank of the senator's manifesto if you like.  Is she going to run hard on this because it's perceived to be popular.</p><p>LEE:  Oh, absolutely, and when you think about Elizabeth Warren and sort of what her campaign stands for so far, this goes to the root of it, right? She is running on getting money out of politics, weakening special interests and wealthy interests in politics, and this is really just the sort of core of her message.</p><p>And if you think back to what her actually first policy proposal of the campaign  was, it was to tax the wealthy, the wealthiest Americans and she said that other proposals that she puts out will actually --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>LEE:  Be paid for by those taxes.  So all of these policy proposals come together, and I think what is going to be really fascinating to watch is how her competitors, the other Democratic candidates feel like they have to respond to this, right? Now that Elizabeth Warren has put out this proposal, you can be sure that the other  Democratic candidates in the field are also going to be asked about this and asked do you support this or do you have another --</p><p>QUEST:  Yes --</p><p>LEE:  Or better idea to deal with this?</p><p>QUEST:  She has put the issue into play, good to see you, thank you, MJ, thank you for getting --</p><p>LEE:  Thanks --</p><p>QUEST:  And thank you for getting that interview back to us so promptly, I appreciate it that it's just taken place.  As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, over three decades, oil money has funded Norway's trillion dollar sovereign well fund; the largest in the world.  Now also, wants to turn away from energy to secure the country's financial future.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Norway wants to hedge its financial future no longer being quite so tied up with energy and energy stocks.  The company -- of course, the Norwegian government's trillion dollar sovereign wealth fund has revealed it's cashing out of  most of its oil and gas investments.  Now, the idea is -- or the worry is, bearing in mind that most of Norway's sovereign wealthy and most of the country's economy comes from oil and gas exports.</p><p>But they want to hedge against a permanent oil price decline because what's the point of having all your money in a hedge fund, and the hedge fund owning oil and gas companies, in other words, eggs in one basket.  You see what I mean there, $7.5 billion is already in exploration and production, and those parts of the economy, $7.5 billion.</p><p>Now, the fund is going to keep investing in big oil companies that works on renewables.  So, those that are high on renewables can still expect to receive investments from the fund.  Look what happened to the oil market in terms of the price, not the crudes.</p><p>BP down at 1 percent, ExxonMobil up one-three quarters, for good reason, for good reason, one of main investors or large investors I should say is about to withdraw.  And the news, Norway sent shockwaves through the market.  Matt Egan is in New York, joins me now.  It's somewhat inevitable that the prices were going to fall, but does the market or is the general view that the policy is the right one?</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER:  You know, Richard, that's a good question.  I think you really nailed it, Norway is really concerned that it is overexposed to oil.  It is worried about what will happen if there is some sort of a permanent decline in oil prices.  And so you noted that the energy sector was down broadly today.</p><p>But what I think is really interesting is some of the EMP companies that Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund owns, they're down even more.  We saw a Apache and Adaco, Chesapeake, EOG Resources, Occidental Petroleum, they're all down more than twice the amount that oil prices are today, and that's because they are worried that one of their biggest investors is going to gradually cash out.</p><p>But you know, it is important to note that Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund is not getting out entirely.  They are still going to hold on to their investments in some of these oil majors.  The likes of Exxon and Shell and BP, and they're all hoping that some of these oil majors would start investing even more in renewable energy in the future.</p><p>QUEST:  Now, Matt, I don't know too much about the Norwegian Sovereign Fund, although one, it's hard to look at the various points over the years, but I do know it is widely regarded as amongst the most respected in the world.</p><p>EGAN:  Right, we're talking about a trillion dollar fund, it's the biggest of its kind and it is looked at as ahead of the curve and forward-looking.  And so, you'll recall that in 2015, Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund actually divested from coal.  It did that ahead of other large institutional investors.</p><p>And so if you talk to, you know, some of the climate activists, they're still really chalking this up as a win and they say that it's a clear sign that slowly, but steadily, some of these large institutions are trying to back away from fossil fuels.  Now, there's a bit of irony here because as you mentioned, Norway got its $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund by of course producing oil.</p><p>It is still the largest oil producer in western Europe, and it's going to continue to  produce more oil.</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>EGAN:  The hope is that it just won't be quite as exposed to oil prices going  forward.</p><p>QUEST:  Fascinating, sorry, good to see you, have a lovely weekend.</p><p>EGAN:  You too.</p><p>[15:45:00]  European stocks closed out with the week with another day of losses.  Stocks were dragged down by continued concerns over slowing global economy.  Look at the numbers, they tell their own story, the FTSE closed lower as the Brexit stalemate drags on, Theresa May is warning Britain's EU exit may not happen at all if her deal is rejected on Tuesday.</p><p>We continue now.  It's International Women's Day, one reporter put the Prime  Minister to the test.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Prime Minister, only one question from a woman reporter on International Women's Day, it's pretty for a show, isn't it?</p><p>THERESA MAY, PRIME MINISTER, UNITED KINGDOM:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  If you weren't able to hear the answer, well, the answers came from a woman Prime Minister, she said that every Prime Minister has been applauded for their comments on this International Women's Day.  We'll explain next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Friday marked the celebration of International Women's Day, and all across the globe, we were taken to the streets to champion gender equality.  In Spain, many women are hosting a feminist strike ahead of the upcoming parliamentary election.</p><p>More than 500 street demonstrations are planned according to the newspaper \"El Pais\".  In France, demonstrators marched to call attention to the gender pay gap and discrimination.  At the same time, the Australian Prime Minister is telling women your empowerment shouldn't come at a cost to men.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT MORRISON, PRIME MINISTER, AUSTRALIA:  Gender equality isn't about putting girls against boys.  See, we're not about setting Australians against each other, trying to push some down to lift others up.  That's not in our values.  That is an absolute liberal value that you don't push some people down to lift some people up.</p><p>And that is true about gender equality too.  We want to see women rise, but we don't want to see women rise only on the basis of others doing worse.  We want everybody to do better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Scott Morrison's comments sparked a backlash on social media.  The Senator Sarah Hanson Young tweeted, \"men who are threatened or worried of women achieving equality is the problem.\"  Morrison's party service on gender imbalance, only 22 percent of liberal party members in parliament are women.</p><p>Now, Mr. Morrison's predecessor Julia Gillard was on a panel with Meghan Markle this morning.  She also published a column in \"The Guardian\" newspaper, saying \"gender equality isn't a women's issue, it's good for men too.\"  Julia Gillard established the Global Institute for Women's Leadership at King's College last year.</p><p>[15:50:00]  Back in September, she told me more progress must be made.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA GILLARD, FORMER PRIME MINISTER, AUSTRALIA:  We're just putting a simple case that we want to strive for a world of gender equality.  That merit is equally distributed between the sexes, that we live in a world where whether it's politics or leading corporations or the law or news media or technology, less than 30 percent of leadership positions in all of those fields are held by women and we can do better than that.</p><p>And we can do better in how we evaluate women's leadership which shouldn't include streams of horrible stuff on social media.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Get out your phones, your tablets, your devices and join our  conversations, and go to cnn.com-slash-join.  The question tonight is are quotas the answer for equality in corporate leadership? In other words a specific number, for example, 30 percent perhaps.</p><p>Brenda Trenowden is the global chair of the 30 Percent Club and the head of the Financial Institutions Group at ANZ Bank.  She's also an adviser to an independent review into upping the number of women in senior positions at FTSE companies.  She's with me now, good to see you.</p><p>The -- we can deal quickly with the Australian Prime Minister's -- was it -- what was it that he said that was so objectionable? Because most women in professions would agree, yes, we got here our own way, but not just on the back of pushing  somebody else down.</p><p>BRENDA TRENOWDEN, GLOBAL CHAIR, 30 PERCENT CLUB &amp; HEAD, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS GROUP, ANZ BANK:  Right, I think all the women that I know and work with would certainly say the same thing and we certainly think it's not a zero-sum game.  You know, I didn't hear his whole speech, so I think when you take one  sentence out of context, sometimes, you know, things are misinterpreted.</p><p>So, I would agree that we don't want to be pushing other people down to bring people up, we want everybody to be rising up.  We want everyone to benefit from greater inclusion actually.</p><p>QUEST:  And what is the -- what is the biggest issue bedeviling now women in senior positions, do you believe?</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  Well, I wish there was just one issue, Richard, that it would be easier to solve, but it's a multi-variety problem and therefore requires a multi-variety solution.  But there are lots of things, there are definitely unconscious biases.  You know, there are stereotypes and norms that everyone has in their heads about what leadership looks like, that I think holds women back.</p><p>You've certainly got lack of sponsorship.  You know, you've got culture.  I think the big thing that the 30 Percent Club is focusing on this year is really looking at the  inclusion side of the DNI equation.  So we've spent a lot of time trying to create a lot more diversity, hire more women or under represented candidates.</p><p>But we haven't spent enough time thinking about how to make culture more inconclusive for everyone.  And so I think that is part of the biggest issue is one type of dominant culture --</p><p>QUEST:  And yet in the workplace, most companies have a veritable forest of  policies, you know, pages on the website, mission statements galore about it and are still seeing to somehow fumble in the final hurdle.</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  So policies are great, and words on a website are fantastic.  But what we see is that, first of all, the leadership of the company, the CEO has to take this seriously because it's good for their business, and they have to communicate that authentically.</p><p>They then have to do a diagnostic of where the challenges are in their own company because every company is different.  But I think one of the biggest  challenges we see is that all of this has to be implemented by managers.</p><p>QUEST:  Yes --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  You know, a lot of the problem comes into that middle management layer.  And certainly in my experience, companies don't value management the way they used to, they don't train managers as much.  And if you think about it, when people have bad experiences -- nearly if companies, they tend to leave managers, they don't leave companies.</p><p>QUEST:  If we take the United States, surely, the biggest example of just the difficulty that the -- of gender issue is taking the idea of maternity leave in the United States which you'll be aware of course, is -- you know, you're lucky if you get a few weeks pay and back to work or you're in trouble.</p><p>If you have a society that doesn't recognize that only half the population is genetically capable of having the next generation, then it's going to be very difficult to introduce other policies that will facilitate that.</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  So I think a lot of people think that, you know, maternity leave and having babies is one of the big issues, it's one part of the problem, but it's not the whole problem.  And I think --</p><p>QUEST:  But I guess what I'm saying is, if you don't deal with something as big as that, then you're --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  It's a critical piece --</p><p>QUEST:  Starting, you know, it's much more difficult to start to deal with the other areas.</p><p>[15:55:00]  TRENOWDEN:  So you're right, the U.S., I think is far behind in that space, and happily in the U.K., a lot of companies are now introducing equal, you know, parent leave for both women and men.  And so, I think you're right.  I think once we see, you know, men taking leave as well --</p><p>QUEST:  Yes --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  And sharing with their wives or with their partners, then, you know, we'll start to see more equality definitely.</p><p>QUEST:  Looking at the result of our poll tonight, it's a very -- it's a -- you know, 75 percent say quotas are not the answer.  Would you agree?</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  We would, the 30 Percent Club is against quotas.  We believe that, you know, voluntary business-led targets have a better result.  So I'll give you an example.  For those of us --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  With children, if you force your children to do things, you don't get the same sustainable result that you do if you talk to them and you  convince them to do it because they want to do it.</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you for coming in and on a Friday night, good to see you --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  Thank you very much --</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much.  Few moments left on Wall Street, we'll have a great look at the numbers, the Dow is well off the lows of the day, despite worrying news on the trade -- look at that, that is what you call a serious rally.  Even though Chinese officials are no longer planning for President Xi to visit Mar-a-Lago for a trade and signing summit, it doesn't matter, the markets is only off 22 points now.  We'll take our profitable moment after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, five years ago tonight, MH-370 went missing.  For some inexplicable reason, the Malaysian  government will not authorize a new search even one by Ocean Infinity that is privately funded on a no find, no fee basis.  It is inexplicable.</p><p>It's no, you're simply saying, well, we will do it if there's a credible reason, we don't want to get people's hopes up.  I tell you, those relatives of those who perished, they don't mind, they'd rather you're out there searching on the off chance and the possibility than sitting at home and thinking well, is it credible enough?</p><p>The reality is the Malaysia, China, Australia, the politics of MH-370 have been dreadful at most throughout the time.  And now there's still an opportunity to go back out and search in the areas most likely at somebody else's cost.  I cannot see why you wouldn't get that search underway again on the 5th anniversary is a good  opportunity to do it.</p><p>And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable.  The weekend is upon us, the Dow barely down, the bell is ringing, the day is done.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>[16:00:00]</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2189810359</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WB8-DDC1-DY0W-42DR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7366\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc.

The market has been down for the whole session but don't be too alarmed.  The losses are actually quite small.  Barely triple digits.  And in the last hour or so, there is something of a rally being attempted.  It looks about day, but let's see what's been moving the markets.  Blink and you miss it, the U.S. economy is barely clinging on to the streak of job growth.  We need to analyze the numbers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A slump in Shanghai, as China's trade numbers turn nasty and Norway sent the oil sector spinning with a multibillion dollars sell-off.  We'll explain.  It's Friday.  It is the 8th of March.  I am Richard Quest in London tonight, where of course, I mean business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.  Tonight, investors are reacting with alarm as the world's two largest economies are flashing warning signs.  In the United States, new numbers show hiring slowed to a crawl in February and in China, exports fell more than 20% and in both cases, the experts and economists are wondering if these are blips and something deep and serious, or is it just a little bit of froth off the top.</p><p>In other words, temporary or the start of a lengthy slowdown?  We start in the United States with the U.S. jobs report where the number of jobs added in February is the worst since September of 2017, a fraction of what economists expected - 20,000.  It's a miserable number.  Unemployment at 3.8%.  So that's holding steady and wage growth at 3.4% is considered to be good.  However, as fewer unemployed people look for work and wages rose, the growth was constrained and concentrated in certain industries.  The president said the numbers were surprising for different reasons.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The unemployment rate just went lower.  We are down now to 3.8%, so we have very good news in that.  I think the big news really was that wages went up and that's great for the American worker.  That's something for people -- I don't know if they ever expected to see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm, Grant Thornton, she joins us now from Chicago.  Diane, if we look at these numbers and which is the more seriously -- serious number, the fact that growth was down -- I'm sorry, job growth was constrained or that wage growth actually is ticking up?</p><p>DIANE SWONK, CHIEF ECONOMIST, GRANT THORNTON:  Well, they're both from the same survey, so they're both distorted a bit.  The slowdown in job growth was largely in part to really unseasonably bad, even unusually bad winter weather, big loss in construction employment that we do expect to come back a little bit.</p><p>Also, we had some losses because some of those government workers had taken on a second job to make up for their lost pay.  They got off that second job, so that came out of the numbers and we had some teacher strikes as well.  That's one side of it.</p><p>The wage gains were -- are picking up.  That's a good news.  They're up a tenth from the high we had hit in December, but they're also distorted by the composition of jobs created during the month, only 20,000 net jobs dominated by high paying jobs and professional services that helped to buoy those wage gains from a year ago.</p><p>QUEST:  So if you had to give this an interpretation on this report, bearing in mind that the revisions on the previous months were very small, which suggest that the trend of the slowdown is taking its toll.</p><p>SWONK:  The slowdown is taking its toll.  I look at this on sort of on a moving average basis.  The three-month moving average is about what we had seen in 2018.  The first two months of the year are slower and I expect that to continue because the economy is slowing.  The first quarter is going to be a lousy quarter.  We're going to bounce back a bit in the second quarter.</p><p>But overall growth in 2019 will be slower than 2018 and with that, we'll see a slower pace of job growth as well.  A much slower pace over the course of the year.</p><p>QUEST:  Stay with me because at the moment, as you'll be aware, Wall Street is marking ten years of the bull-run.  So 10 years ago, I was sitting in this very spot when with hindsight, what we now understand, stocks hit bottom.  Listen to that and I'll come back to you in a second, Diane.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Good evening to you.  I'm Richard Quest.  This is \"Quest Means Business.\"  We are starting a new week and I'm afraid it's a new week but the same old story.</p><p>[15:05:10]</p><p>QUEST:  Susan, they are so mixed at the New York Stock exchange, Susan, when I just looked a second or two ago, it looked like we were best part of a turn down on the market, has it come back a bit?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Well, we know the market did come back, look at how it has improved.  The S&amp;P, by the way, Diane Swonk, you have 300% gain over that period.  So how much, Diane Swonk is because cheap money from the central banks made the bull market inevitable?</p><p>SWONK:  Well, it certainly was a major factor.  There was also a major announcement right about we're going to see on 60 minutes, Chairman Powell, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, former Chair, Janet Yellen come together and talk about what happened ten years ago.</p><p>Ten years ago, at this time, it was when the Fed first did their quantitative easing.  They announced that they would buy in the mortgage-backed security market and just that announcement alone started to turned things around.  Before they ever bought one mortgage backed security, the market started to come back, and I think that's very important.</p><p>It's not just the fact that the Fed, fed financial markets.  Financial markets took down the economy.  The only cure was to fix financial markets and that gave an uneven kind of growth and then we missed the fiscal stimulus later in the expansion and that was taken away.</p><p>QUEST:  So on the basis of the economic scenario, the landscape that you see now, are we good for a few more years of the bull market?</p><p>SWONK:  I'm very concerned.  My biggest concern is China.  We have seen more bad data come out of China and it's not just contingent on a trade agreement with China.  The weakness in China hit before the tariff hits in China.  They've got a structural problem, second largest economy in the world.  They've been a major push on growth of the global economy.  You're seeing weakness in Europe.  You've seen the ECB react to it this week.  These are thing that concern me that tell me we're losing some of our stamina.</p><p>QUEST:  Diane, thank you and we will continue with on the thought that you've raised for us, the issue of China because of the soft U.S. numbers weren't enough to shake investors; there more warning signals in the world's number two economy.</p><p>Chinese stocks fell by more than 4% on Friday after Beijing revealed that exports had fallen to their lowest levels in three years.  The 21% slide coincides with the Chinese New Year holiday.  It was driven by the trade war with the U.S. and slowing global economies.</p><p>David Dollar was the Treasury's Economic Emissary to China, joins me now.  This very sharp falloff in exports, at the same time as the U.S. of course had some very bad trade numbers, too.  But what do you believe is driving the China's numbers?</p><p>DAVID DOLLAR, FORMER TREASURY EMISSARY TO CHINA:  Well, February is always a weak month in China.  It's either the New Year festival or sometimes it comes right after the New Year festival.  So February numbers, we have to be a little bit careful about.  But this really caught most observers by surprise as you said, Richard.  Exports were down 21%, and that's February on February.  So you're comparing two Februarys.  That's a lot more than anybody expected.</p><p>I was also disturbed that their imports fell by 5%.  That's usually a pretty good indication of what's happening with domestic demand.  That's important for a lot of countries around the world that are selling to China.  So those are bad trade numbers, and as you said, Shanghai market fell 4.4%.  It also didn't help, there was an interview with the U.S. Ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, and he pointed out the obvious that the two sides are still pretty far apart for a trade agreement.  There's no concrete planning for a summit meeting at Mar-A-Lago and that I think also affected the market.</p><p>QUEST:  Is it your gut that China is in deep trouble?  The government has already, a couple of months ago, it played around with bank reserve limits.  It's now done some other financial finagling to try and give a stimulus to the economy.  Is China in trouble?</p><p>DOLLAR:  My gut is that they're not in trouble in the sense of the proverbial hard landing.  They've rolled out some modest stimulus measures.  They're going to increase their fiscal deficit a little bit, a little bit additional borrowing by local governments, but it's all rather modest, and I think they have pretty good information about what's happening.  If they were alarmed, they would be coming in much more strongly with measures, but they're coming in with modest stimulus.</p><p>So, I think they're probably going to be okay and if I'm wrong about that and things slide more in the next couple of months, they'll come in with further stimulus.  So pretty safe bet they're going to get to their 6% target for the year.</p><p>[15:10:09]</p><p>QUEST:  You heard Diane Swonk just a moment ago, if you take the U.S. situation on the trade numbers, the U.S. having the worst deficit in some years when it should have been getting better, the U.S. dollar remains extremely strong which of course is a negative on the imports and if you look at that trading relationship between the U.S. and China, there's no evidence that it's improving.</p><p>DOLLAR:  Right.  I mean, you're absolutely right about that.  Last year, U.S. imports from China went up $34 billion despite the trade war.  Our exports to China actually went down for the first time in many years.  Now, I would say you wouldn't normally expect a trade war to improve the U.S. trade balance because what the U.S. is doing reduces imports, but it also reduces exports and so no presumption that it's going help the trade balance.</p><p>QUEST:  Have a good weekend, sir.  Lots to talk about and we'll talk more about it in the future.  Thank you.</p><p>DOLLAR:  Thanks a lot.</p><p>QUEST:  We go to the White House now where the week is ending with a surprise shakeup.  The Deputy Chief of Staff and Communications Director, Bill Shine has resigned.  It was very unexpected.  He is the fifth person to serve as Communications Director under President Trump.  A statement from the White House says Shine will serve as a senior adviser to President Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.</p><p>Sarah Westwood is at the White House, so Sarah, was he pushed or was about to be pushed?</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, CNN:  Well, Richard, we've been looking into this and it appears a combination of those things.  Sources tell CNN that the President had started to sour on Bill Shine's performance.  Bill Shine, the former executive at Fox News was brought on board in large part to help improve the press coverage of this White House.  That did not happen over the eight months that Shine worked here and the President started to grow dissatisfied with that.</p><p>Aides said that they couldn't discern what Shine really did here at the White House beyond just the lighting and focused the cameras at White House events.  At the same time, though, it's really unclear what Shine will be doing on the re-election campaign.  Sources affiliated with the campaign say they were notified this morning that Shine would be joining them as a senior adviser.  They haven't really been informed what exactly it is he will be doing.  This was all hastily announced today as you mentioned, a very unexpected departure coming after a tough week for President Trump, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  Some will claim this is more evidence of confusion in the White House.</p><p>WESTWOOD:  Well, certainly you don't have to look far to find plenty of evidence of that.  This particular position in the White House, the Communications Director position, has been done by five people, six people have been named White House Communications Director, one of them resigned before actually taking the position.</p><p>So this has been a notoriously difficult job for this administration to fill in part because President Trump likes to act so much as his own chief spokesman, and so it's difficult for someone to come in and try to direct his communications and Shine also, like his predecessors, struggled with that.</p><p>So, Richard, it will be interesting to see who the White House selects, if anyone, to hold this position moving forward.</p><p>QUEST:  We'll watch it.  Have a good weekend.  Thank you.</p><p>WESTWOOD:  You, too.</p><p>QUEST:  Sarah at the White House.  Coming up next, breaking up big tech, in the words of Neil Sedaka, it may be hard to do, but presidential hopeful, Elizabeth Warren is game to have a go.  Big tech on the block in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:15:00]</p><p>QUEST:  Five years ago tonight, Malaysia Airlines flight MH-370 disappeared and nothing has been heard of it since except some debris that washed up some months later.  Family members of the Chinese nationals on board are now calling on their government to continue the search, a search that was called off in January 2017, after two years.</p><p>The plane disappeared with 239 passengers and crew on board.  It was going between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing.  Now, that is pretty much all we know about what happened to MH-370.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  It is the aviation the mystery that transfixed the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, ANCHOR, CNN:  Air traffic controllers in Southeast Asia have lost contact with a jumbo jet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  The Boeing 777 was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it vanished.  Two hundred and thirty nine people on board missing.  Five years later, and aviation experts believe it's still possible to lose a passenger plane somewhere over the world's oceans.</p><p>Currently, air traffic controllers track planes through a patch work of radar, ground radio and satellite communications.  The satellites have limited range.  Now, a new system coming on line next month will for the first time allow the planes to be tracked in real-time anywhere they fly.</p><p>Also airlines will be able to subscribe to live tracking services that share location and other data.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARY SCHIAVO, AVIATION ANALYST, CNN:  Not only will these tracking systems save the world from losing another plane and the heartbreak of five years out still not knowing where the people are, but every month it will save a state, a country, another jurisdiction from having to search for small planes that go missing all the time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Also, under development, a new generation of black boxes.  Airbus is introducing a flight data recorder that ejects itself during a crash.  While Honeywell is working on a cockpit voice and recorder that constantly streams data via satellite.  None of this technology is currently mandated by regulators.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID SOUCIE, AVIATION SAFETY ANALYST, CNN:  It's up to the airlines, it's up to the states themselves, the countries that fly aircraft to pay the extra dollars that it takes.  And it's not a lot of extra dollars, maybe ten cents a ticket or so.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  What hasn't changed of course is how families are treated during the most difficult experience of their lives.  There are no uniform worldwide standards for immediate assistance and families are given no mandated access to the crash investigations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHIAVO:  They are intentionally kept out and what does that do?  That makes the entire investigation suspect in the eyes of the families.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  Incidents like the disappearance of MH-370 involve families, investigators and regulators across many different jurisdictions.  Bringing them all together is and direct common framework is what the authorities are trying to do.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOUCIE:  There's no body that says you can't fly and charge for tickets and expect people to fly and fly on your airlines without a standard of safety that is worldwide.  It can't just be state to state.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:20:06]</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  As to the whereabouts and discovery of the final resting place of that 777, it may be many years when more sophisticated searching methods are devised that we'll ever find the wreckage, recover the remains and finally find out what happened to MH-370.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  After the official search for MH-370 was called off, there was a second search led by the U.S. exploration firm, Ocean Infinity.  The company says it's ready to launch a new effort.  Ocean Infinity's Chief Executive, Oliver Plunkett joins me now.</p><p>Thank you, Oliver for being with us.  What is stopping you from just saying, \"I'm going to put the ships out.  We've got the technology.  We've got the ships.  It's a find or no fee.  I'm going out tomorrow.\"</p><p>OLIVER PLUNKETT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, OCEAN INFINITY:  We want to make sure firstly that we've properly analyzed all of the theories and know that we're looking exactly the right place.  Minister Loke from Malaysia actually makes a very serious point when he says that the government doesn't want to engage unless there's a credible reason to do so.  The other way of thinking about that is he says, \"I don't want to expose the families to the emotions of hope on a wild goose chase.\"  And we feel that that's very important because ultimately, it's the families who are at the center of all of this.</p><p>QUEST:  Right.  The first principle's report which identified the most likely area which you then took as the basis, I'm simplifying, obviously, but you then took as the basis for the most likely area to search, well, did you complete that area in that last search?  Are you comfortable that you searched the most likely area, and if so, then, yes, where do you go next?</p><p>PLUNKETT:  I think with any ocean search, the idea that there is a pinpoint location can be nothing more than a starting point from which you go north, south, east and west based on the evidence which draws you in one of those four directions.</p><p>We started in the point where the original search finished and traveled north because that was most consistent with what was in the first principal's report.  Inevitably, the southern Indian Ocean is an enormous body of water and whether it's near there or somewhere else requires some additional thought.</p><p>QUEST:  So are you saying that we don't know where the plane went down?  I mean, because at the end of the day, quite a lot of the ocean -- quite a lot of the area where the plane is believed to have gone down was searched very thoroughly in the first part.  Your organization did an extremely thorough search using newer technologies of the most likely area.  But do -- does the evidence still seem to together it is off the western coast of Australia?</p><p>PLUNKETT:  When you look at the combination of the satellite data analysis and the ocean drift analysis that's been reviewed and carried out by various organizations from around the world, the preponderance of the evidence points you to the southern Indian Ocean off the west coast of Australia.</p><p>But it's a large area.  And as I say, the idea that there's a pinpoint in this particular search just doesn't make any sense.  There might be other searches where there is that evidence that it's very, very -- and you find the thing you're looking for exactly where the evidence suggests it should be.  This isn't one of those.</p><p>QUEST:  So I expect much of the day answering the questions to my colleagues about would they ever find it?  And my answer has always been, yes, it will be found one day when the sophistication or sophisticated search tools are able to do that, and we're not there yet.  Do you subscribe to that?</p><p>PLUNKETT:  I also believe that it will be find one day.  At the moment -- and this was the point I made to the families last weekend, I think we have got the tools to find it.  What for me has made me feel that since we left the site of the Indian Ocean in June of last year, is that we found the Argentinian submarine, San Juan, and we found the Korean boat carrier, Stella Daisy.</p><p>The San Juan in particular, was an object of a similar size to MH-370, except it was designed not to be identified by sonar.</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>PLUNKETT:  So the fact we can find that tells me that if we look in the right place, we can find MH-370.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, and finally, in a sentence, so what do you need - who's permission do you now need to go back out and search?</p><p>PLUNKETT:  The Government of Malaysia.  I think it's important to remember that it isn't -- this is a -- it's an airplane that is subject to police investigations and it matters to the families, I think it's important to not just go out and do things without having that buy-in of all the stakeholders.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you sir.  Thank you very much for joining us.  Much appreciated.</p><p>PLUNKETT:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  And of course in future programs, we will be asking the government of Malaysia exactly when and why they will allow some people like Ocean Infinity to go back out.</p><p>Coming up next, breaking up big tech.  The big names are huge, but Senator Warren takes on the three most valuable companies in the world.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There is more \"Quest Means Business\" in a moment when you'll hear from Elizabeth Warren who thinks breaking up big tech will help her get to the White House, or at least promising to do it, and big oil companies have taken a big hit after one of their biggest investors says it is having a rethink on fossil fuels.  As we continue tonight, this is CNN and on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people turned out again on Friday demonstrating across Algeria.  Protestors are demanding that the 82-year-old President, Bouteflika, withdraw from next month's election.  Despite suffering a stroke in 2013 and having rarely been seen in public since, the current President is moving ahead with his candidacy.</p><p>[15:30:10]</p><p>The lawyer for the so-called ISIS bride Shamima Begum says he believes her new born son has died.  Begum is being held at a camp in Syria and gave birth to a baby boy last month.</p><p>She left the U.K. to join ISIS four years ago.  She recently said she wanted to come back to Britain.  But British officials say they would strip her of her citizenship because she supports a terrorist organization.</p><p>British lawmakers are getting ready to vote again on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal on Tuesday.  Brexit is only 21 days away, Theresa May said a short while ago that if parliament rejects her deal, in her words, no one knows what will happen and that the U.K. might not leave the EU at all.</p><p>Parts of Venezuela has been without electricity since Thursday.  There was a widespread power outrage that led officials to close schools and suspend other  public services.  President Maduro's government says it's due to sabotage of the country's main hydro electric power station.  Critics say crumbling infrastructure and corruption are to blame.</p><p>So to SpaceX now celebrating the return of the Dragon.  It's Crew Dragon capsule, that is, it came back to earth early on Friday and it capped off a historic test flight.  SpaceX is developing commercial spacecraft to carry American astronauts to the International Space Station.</p><p>It's time to break up big tech according to U.S. presidential hopeful Senator  Elizabeth Warren.  She wants to take a saw to Amazon, Google and Facebook.  It's all part of the bid to promote competition in the sector, she says.  Now, of course, the senator's campaigning like a trust buster of yester-year.</p><p>When we think of Amazon with its vast holdings across many industries, its tentacle remind you of images such as those of the early 1900s.  Now, back then, the idea was that of an octopus and it was the perfect metaphor for monopolies of oil and railroad companies and how they extended their reach, strong arming their way to the U.S.</p><p>And the analogy of the octopus -- as you can see Capitol Hill over there, you can see Wall Street over there, the analogy of the octopus and the company by the way of course, they talk about is Standard Oil which was broken up into SO as we now know today.</p><p>Now, it works just as well today of the analogy -- look at --</p><p>(BELL RINGS)</p><p>Amazon, there's Amazon web services and the amazon.com.  All the tentacles going deep into the economy.  With groceries at Whole Foods and shoes at Zappos, or as any book you can think of is audible or a candle.  Amazon is now of course in the world, it's vast and it's strong and Elizabeth Warren wants to break  it up piece by piece.</p><p>MJ Lee is in New York and joins me.  Now, the idea of what -- I mean, it's not a  new idea, but she's backing herself.  This is turning into one of her touch-stone policies.</p><p>MJ LEE, CNN U.S. POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely.  And Richard, I'm actually just returning from Harlem where Elizabeth Warren had a campaign event and we got some time to talk to her about this new proposal to break up the big tech companies like Amazon, like Google, like Facebook.</p><p>So, let's actually listen to what she had to say.  She was talking about this in the context of Amazon's failed bid to start a new headquarters in Long Island City and then we can talk on the other side.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  I want to make clear, I cheered when New York City said we're pushing back just a little bit on everything that Amazon is asking for.  Because here's the problem, these giant tech companies have so much power, so much economic power and so much  political power that they go all around the country saying, bribe me to come be where you are.</p><p>And it's like a giant hunger games of some kind.  What I believe is for it to have more competition in the marketplace and to level the playing field a little bit for  small businesses and entrepreneurs and start-ups.  What we've got to do is take  those platforms, you know, how you order on Amazon or you do a search on Google, and break them off from the additional businesses that they're running  and those additional businesses are where they're getting a comparative advantage on their information because of the information they get from their  platforms.</p><p>The way to think about this right now is Amazon is like the umpire in the baseball game.  It runs the marketplace, and it also has a lot of teams on the field  because it's actually competing with the other businesses on that platform and giving special advantage, putting them on page 1 and somebody they don't like back on page 6.</p><p>[15:35:00]  So my notion is, you can be an umpire or you can own a team, but you can't do both at the same time.  And that's how we should break up Amazon, it's how we should break up Google, customers, both like you and me, we can still do our searches, we can still do what we want to do, but we want to break these up and get more competition in the industry.</p><p>LEE:  Would you have been OK with it being in Boston, the second headquarters?</p><p>WARREN:  So what I'm not OK with is the fact that cities are put into this competition against each other, and that they're asked to give up tax revenues to build special goodies.  Because you know, here's the deal.  A small business that's just getting started, no city is saying to them, hey, we're going to give you the same deal that Amazon is getting.</p><p>You're going to get a big lop off your taxes or we're going to hand out some  special goodies to you.  Every time the giant goes around the country and says give me something special, they help increase the concentration of the American economy.  That's bad for our economy, it's bad for workers, it's bad for competition, it's bad for small businesses, and ultimately, it's bad for our  democracy.</p><p>Just over the past few years, a handful of the top giants have already gotten $10 billion in special breaks from towns, counties and states.  You know, that's a special break that gives them a leg up in competition.  It's just not fair for small  businesses and that's not right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  MJ, is this going to be a central plank of the senator's manifesto if you like.  Is she going to run hard on this because it's perceived to be popular.</p><p>LEE:  Oh, absolutely, and when you think about Elizabeth Warren and sort of what her campaign stands for so far, this goes to the root of it, right? She is running on getting money out of politics, weakening special interests and wealthy interests in politics, and this is really just the sort of core of her message.</p><p>And if you think back to what her actually first policy proposal of the campaign  was, it was to tax the wealthy, the wealthiest Americans and she said that other proposals that she puts out will actually --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>LEE:  Be paid for by those taxes.  So all of these policy proposals come together, and I think what is going to be really fascinating to watch is how her competitors, the other Democratic candidates feel like they have to respond to this, right? Now that Elizabeth Warren has put out this proposal, you can be sure that the other  Democratic candidates in the field are also going to be asked about this and asked do you support this or do you have another --</p><p>QUEST:  Yes --</p><p>LEE:  Or better idea to deal with this?</p><p>QUEST:  She has put the issue into play, good to see you, thank you, MJ, thank you for getting --</p><p>LEE:  Thanks --</p><p>QUEST:  And thank you for getting that interview back to us so promptly, I appreciate it that it's just taken place.  As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, over three decades, oil money has funded Norway's trillion dollar sovereign well fund; the largest in the world.  Now also, wants to turn away from energy to secure the country's financial future.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Norway wants to hedge its financial future no longer being quite so tied up with energy and energy stocks.  The company -- of course, the Norwegian government's trillion dollar sovereign wealth fund has revealed it's cashing out of  most of its oil and gas investments.  Now, the idea is -- or the worry is, bearing in mind that most of Norway's sovereign wealthy and most of the country's economy comes from oil and gas exports.</p><p>But they want to hedge against a permanent oil price decline because what's the point of having all your money in a hedge fund, and the hedge fund owning oil and gas companies, in other words, eggs in one basket.  You see what I mean there, $7.5 billion is already in exploration and production, and those parts of the economy, $7.5 billion.</p><p>Now, the fund is going to keep investing in big oil companies that works on renewables.  So, those that are high on renewables can still expect to receive investments from the fund.  Look what happened to the oil market in terms of the price, not the crudes.</p><p>BP down at 1 percent, ExxonMobil up one-three quarters, for good reason, for good reason, one of main investors or large investors I should say is about to withdraw.  And the news, Norway sent shockwaves through the market.  Matt Egan is in New York, joins me now.  It's somewhat inevitable that the prices were going to fall, but does the market or is the general view that the policy is the right one?</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER:  You know, Richard, that's a good question.  I think you really nailed it, Norway is really concerned that it is overexposed to oil.  It is worried about what will happen if there is some sort of a permanent decline in oil prices.  And so you noted that the energy sector was down broadly today.</p><p>But what I think is really interesting is some of the EMP companies that Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund owns, they're down even more.  We saw a Apache and Adaco, Chesapeake, EOG Resources, Occidental Petroleum, they're all down more than twice the amount that oil prices are today, and that's because they are worried that one of their biggest investors is going to gradually cash out.</p><p>But you know, it is important to note that Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund is not getting out entirely.  They are still going to hold on to their investments in some of these oil majors.  The likes of Exxon and Shell and BP, and they're all hoping that some of these oil majors would start investing even more in renewable energy in the future.</p><p>QUEST:  Now, Matt, I don't know too much about the Norwegian Sovereign Fund, although one, it's hard to look at the various points over the years, but I do know it is widely regarded as amongst the most respected in the world.</p><p>EGAN:  Right, we're talking about a trillion dollar fund, it's the biggest of its kind and it is looked at as ahead of the curve and forward-looking.  And so, you'll recall that in 2015, Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund actually divested from coal.  It did that ahead of other large institutional investors.</p><p>And so if you talk to, you know, some of the climate activists, they're still really chalking this up as a win and they say that it's a clear sign that slowly, but steadily, some of these large institutions are trying to back away from fossil fuels.  Now, there's a bit of irony here because as you mentioned, Norway got its $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund by of course producing oil.</p><p>It is still the largest oil producer in western Europe, and it's going to continue to  produce more oil.</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>EGAN:  The hope is that it just won't be quite as exposed to oil prices going  forward.</p><p>QUEST:  Fascinating, sorry, good to see you, have a lovely weekend.</p><p>EGAN:  You too.</p><p>[15:45:00]  European stocks closed out with the week with another day of losses.  Stocks were dragged down by continued concerns over slowing global economy.  Look at the numbers, they tell their own story, the FTSE closed lower as the Brexit stalemate drags on, Theresa May is warning Britain's EU exit may not happen at all if her deal is rejected on Tuesday.</p><p>We continue now.  It's International Women's Day, one reporter put the Prime  Minister to the test.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Prime Minister, only one question from a woman reporter on International Women's Day, it's pretty for a show, isn't it?</p><p>THERESA MAY, PRIME MINISTER, UNITED KINGDOM:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  If you weren't able to hear the answer, well, the answers came from a woman Prime Minister, she said that every Prime Minister has been applauded for their comments on this International Women's Day.  We'll explain next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Friday marked the celebration of International Women's Day, and all across the globe, we were taken to the streets to champion gender equality.  In Spain, many women are hosting a feminist strike ahead of the upcoming parliamentary election.</p><p>More than 500 street demonstrations are planned according to the newspaper \"El Pais\".  In France, demonstrators marched to call attention to the gender pay gap and discrimination.  At the same time, the Australian Prime Minister is telling women your empowerment shouldn't come at a cost to men.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT MORRISON, PRIME MINISTER, AUSTRALIA:  Gender equality isn't about putting girls against boys.  See, we're not about setting Australians against each other, trying to push some down to lift others up.  That's not in our values.  That is an absolute liberal value that you don't push some people down to lift some people up.</p><p>And that is true about gender equality too.  We want to see women rise, but we don't want to see women rise only on the basis of others doing worse.  We want everybody to do better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Scott Morrison's comments sparked a backlash on social media.  The Senator Sarah Hanson Young tweeted, \"men who are threatened or worried of women achieving equality is the problem.\"  Morrison's party service on gender imbalance, only 22 percent of liberal party members in parliament are women.</p><p>Now, Mr. Morrison's predecessor Julia Gillard was on a panel with Meghan Markle this morning.  She also published a column in \"The Guardian\" newspaper, saying \"gender equality isn't a women's issue, it's good for men too.\"  Julia Gillard established the Global Institute for Women's Leadership at King's College last year.</p><p>[15:50:00]  Back in September, she told me more progress must be made.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA GILLARD, FORMER PRIME MINISTER, AUSTRALIA:  We're just putting a simple case that we want to strive for a world of gender equality.  That merit is equally distributed between the sexes, that we live in a world where whether it's politics or leading corporations or the law or news media or technology, less than 30 percent of leadership positions in all of those fields are held by women and we can do better than that.</p><p>And we can do better in how we evaluate women's leadership which shouldn't include streams of horrible stuff on social media.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Get out your phones, your tablets, your devices and join our  conversations, and go to cnn.com-slash-join.  The question tonight is are quotas the answer for equality in corporate leadership? In other words a specific number, for example, 30 percent perhaps.</p><p>Brenda Trenowden is the global chair of the 30 Percent Club and the head of the Financial Institutions Group at ANZ Bank.  She's also an adviser to an independent review into upping the number of women in senior positions at FTSE companies.  She's with me now, good to see you.</p><p>The -- we can deal quickly with the Australian Prime Minister's -- was it -- what was it that he said that was so objectionable? Because most women in professions would agree, yes, we got here our own way, but not just on the back of pushing  somebody else down.</p><p>BRENDA TRENOWDEN, GLOBAL CHAIR, 30 PERCENT CLUB &amp; HEAD, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS GROUP, ANZ BANK:  Right, I think all the women that I know and work with would certainly say the same thing and we certainly think it's not a zero-sum game.  You know, I didn't hear his whole speech, so I think when you take one  sentence out of context, sometimes, you know, things are misinterpreted.</p><p>So, I would agree that we don't want to be pushing other people down to bring people up, we want everybody to be rising up.  We want everyone to benefit from greater inclusion actually.</p><p>QUEST:  And what is the -- what is the biggest issue bedeviling now women in senior positions, do you believe?</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  Well, I wish there was just one issue, Richard, that it would be easier to solve, but it's a multi-variety problem and therefore requires a multi-variety solution.  But there are lots of things, there are definitely unconscious biases.  You know, there are stereotypes and norms that everyone has in their heads about what leadership looks like, that I think holds women back.</p><p>You've certainly got lack of sponsorship.  You know, you've got culture.  I think the big thing that the 30 Percent Club is focusing on this year is really looking at the  inclusion side of the DNI equation.  So we've spent a lot of time trying to create a lot more diversity, hire more women or under represented candidates.</p><p>But we haven't spent enough time thinking about how to make culture more inconclusive for everyone.  And so I think that is part of the biggest issue is one type of dominant culture --</p><p>QUEST:  And yet in the workplace, most companies have a veritable forest of  policies, you know, pages on the website, mission statements galore about it and are still seeing to somehow fumble in the final hurdle.</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  So policies are great, and words on a website are fantastic.  But what we see is that, first of all, the leadership of the company, the CEO has to take this seriously because it's good for their business, and they have to communicate that authentically.</p><p>They then have to do a diagnostic of where the challenges are in their own company because every company is different.  But I think one of the biggest  challenges we see is that all of this has to be implemented by managers.</p><p>QUEST:  Yes --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  You know, a lot of the problem comes into that middle management layer.  And certainly in my experience, companies don't value management the way they used to, they don't train managers as much.  And if you think about it, when people have bad experiences -- nearly if companies, they tend to leave managers, they don't leave companies.</p><p>QUEST:  If we take the United States, surely, the biggest example of just the difficulty that the -- of gender issue is taking the idea of maternity leave in the United States which you'll be aware of course, is -- you know, you're lucky if you get a few weeks pay and back to work or you're in trouble.</p><p>If you have a society that doesn't recognize that only half the population is genetically capable of having the next generation, then it's going to be very difficult to introduce other policies that will facilitate that.</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  So I think a lot of people think that, you know, maternity leave and having babies is one of the big issues, it's one part of the problem, but it's not the whole problem.  And I think --</p><p>QUEST:  But I guess what I'm saying is, if you don't deal with something as big as that, then you're --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  It's a critical piece --</p><p>QUEST:  Starting, you know, it's much more difficult to start to deal with the other areas.</p><p>[15:55:00]  TRENOWDEN:  So you're right, the U.S., I think is far behind in that space, and happily in the U.K., a lot of companies are now introducing equal, you know, parent leave for both women and men.  And so, I think you're right.  I think once we see, you know, men taking leave as well --</p><p>QUEST:  Yes --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  And sharing with their wives or with their partners, then, you know, we'll start to see more equality definitely.</p><p>QUEST:  Looking at the result of our poll tonight, it's a very -- it's a -- you know, 75 percent say quotas are not the answer.  Would you agree?</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  We would, the 30 Percent Club is against quotas.  We believe that, you know, voluntary business-led targets have a better result.  So I'll give you an example.  For those of us --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  With children, if you force your children to do things, you don't get the same sustainable result that you do if you talk to them and you  convince them to do it because they want to do it.</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you for coming in and on a Friday night, good to see you --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  Thank you very much --</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much.  Few moments left on Wall Street, we'll have a great look at the numbers, the Dow is well off the lows of the day, despite worrying news on the trade -- look at that, that is what you call a serious rally.  Even though Chinese officials are no longer planning for President Xi to visit Mar-a-Lago for a trade and signing summit, it doesn't matter, the markets is only off 22 points now.  We'll take our profitable moment after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, five years ago tonight, MH-370 went missing.  For some inexplicable reason, the Malaysian  government will not authorize a new search even one by Ocean Infinity that is privately funded on a no find, no fee basis.  It is inexplicable.</p><p>It's no, you're simply saying, well, we will do it if there's a credible reason, we don't want to get people's hopes up.  I tell you, those relatives of those who perished, they don't mind, they'd rather you're out there searching on the off chance and the possibility than sitting at home and thinking well, is it credible enough?</p><p>The reality is the Malaysia, China, Australia, the politics of MH-370 have been dreadful at most throughout the time.  And now there's still an opportunity to go back out and search in the areas most likely at somebody else's cost.  I cannot see why you wouldn't get that search underway again on the 5th anniversary is a good  opportunity to do it.</p><p>And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable.  The weekend is upon us, the Dow barely down, the bell is ringing, the day is done.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>[16:00:00]</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2189810359</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W46-K6N1-JBHT-D2CK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7366\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc.

The market has been down for the whole session but don't be too alarmed.  The losses are actually quite small.  Barely triple digits.  And in the last hour or so, there is something of a rally being attempted.  It looks about day, but let's see what's been moving the markets.  Blink and you miss it, the U.S. economy is barely clinging on to the streak of job growth.  We need to analyze the numbers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A slump in Shanghai, as China's trade numbers turn nasty and Norway sent the oil sector spinning with a multibillion dollars sell-off.  We'll explain.  It's Friday.  It is the 8th of March.  I am Richard Quest in London tonight, where of course, I mean business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening.  Tonight, investors are reacting with alarm as the world's two largest economies are flashing warning signs.  In the United States, new numbers show hiring slowed to a crawl in February and in China, exports fell more than 20% and in both cases, the experts and economists are wondering if these are blips and something deep and serious, or is it just a little bit of froth off the top.</p><p>In other words, temporary or the start of a lengthy slowdown?  We start in the United States with the U.S. jobs report where the number of jobs added in February is the worst since September of 2017, a fraction of what economists expected - 20,000.  It's a miserable number.  Unemployment at 3.8%.  So that's holding steady and wage growth at 3.4% is considered to be good.  However, as fewer unemployed people look for work and wages rose, the growth was constrained and concentrated in certain industries.  The president said the numbers were surprising for different reasons.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The unemployment rate just went lower.  We are down now to 3.8%, so we have very good news in that.  I think the big news really was that wages went up and that's great for the American worker.  That's something for people -- I don't know if they ever expected to see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm, Grant Thornton, she joins us now from Chicago.  Diane, if we look at these numbers and which is the more seriously -- serious number, the fact that growth was down -- I'm sorry, job growth was constrained or that wage growth actually is ticking up?</p><p>DIANE SWONK, CHIEF ECONOMIST, GRANT THORNTON:  Well, they're both from the same survey, so they're both distorted a bit.  The slowdown in job growth was largely in part to really unseasonably bad, even unusually bad winter weather, big loss in construction employment that we do expect to come back a little bit.</p><p>Also, we had some losses because some of those government workers had taken on a second job to make up for their lost pay.  They got off that second job, so that came out of the numbers and we had some teacher strikes as well.  That's one side of it.</p><p>The wage gains were -- are picking up.  That's a good news.  They're up a tenth from the high we had hit in December, but they're also distorted by the composition of jobs created during the month, only 20,000 net jobs dominated by high paying jobs and professional services that helped to buoy those wage gains from a year ago.</p><p>QUEST:  So if you had to give this an interpretation on this report, bearing in mind that the revisions on the previous months were very small, which suggest that the trend of the slowdown is taking its toll.</p><p>SWONK:  The slowdown is taking its toll.  I look at this on sort of on a moving average basis.  The three-month moving average is about what we had seen in 2018.  The first two months of the year are slower and I expect that to continue because the economy is slowing.  The first quarter is going to be a lousy quarter.  We're going to bounce back a bit in the second quarter.</p><p>But overall growth in 2019 will be slower than 2018 and with that, we'll see a slower pace of job growth as well.  A much slower pace over the course of the year.</p><p>QUEST:  Stay with me because at the moment, as you'll be aware, Wall Street is marking ten years of the bull-run.  So 10 years ago, I was sitting in this very spot when with hindsight, what we now understand, stocks hit bottom.  Listen to that and I'll come back to you in a second, Diane.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Good evening to you.  I'm Richard Quest.  This is \"Quest Means Business.\"  We are starting a new week and I'm afraid it's a new week but the same old story.</p><p>[15:05:10]</p><p>QUEST:  Susan, they are so mixed at the New York Stock exchange, Susan, when I just looked a second or two ago, it looked like we were best part of a turn down on the market, has it come back a bit?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Well, we know the market did come back, look at how it has improved.  The S&amp;P, by the way, Diane Swonk, you have 300% gain over that period.  So how much, Diane Swonk is because cheap money from the central banks made the bull market inevitable?</p><p>SWONK:  Well, it certainly was a major factor.  There was also a major announcement right about we're going to see on 60 minutes, Chairman Powell, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, former Chair, Janet Yellen come together and talk about what happened ten years ago.</p><p>Ten years ago, at this time, it was when the Fed first did their quantitative easing.  They announced that they would buy in the mortgage-backed security market and just that announcement alone started to turned things around.  Before they ever bought one mortgage backed security, the market started to come back, and I think that's very important.</p><p>It's not just the fact that the Fed, fed financial markets.  Financial markets took down the economy.  The only cure was to fix financial markets and that gave an uneven kind of growth and then we missed the fiscal stimulus later in the expansion and that was taken away.</p><p>QUEST:  So on the basis of the economic scenario, the landscape that you see now, are we good for a few more years of the bull market?</p><p>SWONK:  I'm very concerned.  My biggest concern is China.  We have seen more bad data come out of China and it's not just contingent on a trade agreement with China.  The weakness in China hit before the tariff hits in China.  They've got a structural problem, second largest economy in the world.  They've been a major push on growth of the global economy.  You're seeing weakness in Europe.  You've seen the ECB react to it this week.  These are thing that concern me that tell me we're losing some of our stamina.</p><p>QUEST:  Diane, thank you and we will continue with on the thought that you've raised for us, the issue of China because of the soft U.S. numbers weren't enough to shake investors; there more warning signals in the world's number two economy.</p><p>Chinese stocks fell by more than 4% on Friday after Beijing revealed that exports had fallen to their lowest levels in three years.  The 21% slide coincides with the Chinese New Year holiday.  It was driven by the trade war with the U.S. and slowing global economies.</p><p>David Dollar was the Treasury's Economic Emissary to China, joins me now.  This very sharp falloff in exports, at the same time as the U.S. of course had some very bad trade numbers, too.  But what do you believe is driving the China's numbers?</p><p>DAVID DOLLAR, FORMER TREASURY EMISSARY TO CHINA:  Well, February is always a weak month in China.  It's either the New Year festival or sometimes it comes right after the New Year festival.  So February numbers, we have to be a little bit careful about.  But this really caught most observers by surprise as you said, Richard.  Exports were down 21%, and that's February on February.  So you're comparing two Februarys.  That's a lot more than anybody expected.</p><p>I was also disturbed that their imports fell by 5%.  That's usually a pretty good indication of what's happening with domestic demand.  That's important for a lot of countries around the world that are selling to China.  So those are bad trade numbers, and as you said, Shanghai market fell 4.4%.  It also didn't help, there was an interview with the U.S. Ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, and he pointed out the obvious that the two sides are still pretty far apart for a trade agreement.  There's no concrete planning for a summit meeting at Mar-A-Lago and that I think also affected the market.</p><p>QUEST:  Is it your gut that China is in deep trouble?  The government has already, a couple of months ago, it played around with bank reserve limits.  It's now done some other financial finagling to try and give a stimulus to the economy.  Is China in trouble?</p><p>DOLLAR:  My gut is that they're not in trouble in the sense of the proverbial hard landing.  They've rolled out some modest stimulus measures.  They're going to increase their fiscal deficit a little bit, a little bit additional borrowing by local governments, but it's all rather modest, and I think they have pretty good information about what's happening.  If they were alarmed, they would be coming in much more strongly with measures, but they're coming in with modest stimulus.</p><p>So, I think they're probably going to be okay and if I'm wrong about that and things slide more in the next couple of months, they'll come in with further stimulus.  So pretty safe bet they're going to get to their 6% target for the year.</p><p>[15:10:09]</p><p>QUEST:  You heard Diane Swonk just a moment ago, if you take the U.S. situation on the trade numbers, the U.S. having the worst deficit in some years when it should have been getting better, the U.S. dollar remains extremely strong which of course is a negative on the imports and if you look at that trading relationship between the U.S. and China, there's no evidence that it's improving.</p><p>DOLLAR:  Right.  I mean, you're absolutely right about that.  Last year, U.S. imports from China went up $34 billion despite the trade war.  Our exports to China actually went down for the first time in many years.  Now, I would say you wouldn't normally expect a trade war to improve the U.S. trade balance because what the U.S. is doing reduces imports, but it also reduces exports and so no presumption that it's going help the trade balance.</p><p>QUEST:  Have a good weekend, sir.  Lots to talk about and we'll talk more about it in the future.  Thank you.</p><p>DOLLAR:  Thanks a lot.</p><p>QUEST:  We go to the White House now where the week is ending with a surprise shakeup.  The Deputy Chief of Staff and Communications Director, Bill Shine has resigned.  It was very unexpected.  He is the fifth person to serve as Communications Director under President Trump.  A statement from the White House says Shine will serve as a senior adviser to President Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.</p><p>Sarah Westwood is at the White House, so Sarah, was he pushed or was about to be pushed?</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, CNN:  Well, Richard, we've been looking into this and it appears a combination of those things.  Sources tell CNN that the President had started to sour on Bill Shine's performance.  Bill Shine, the former executive at Fox News was brought on board in large part to help improve the press coverage of this White House.  That did not happen over the eight months that Shine worked here and the President started to grow dissatisfied with that.</p><p>Aides said that they couldn't discern what Shine really did here at the White House beyond just the lighting and focused the cameras at White House events.  At the same time, though, it's really unclear what Shine will be doing on the re-election campaign.  Sources affiliated with the campaign say they were notified this morning that Shine would be joining them as a senior adviser.  They haven't really been informed what exactly it is he will be doing.  This was all hastily announced today as you mentioned, a very unexpected departure coming after a tough week for President Trump, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  Some will claim this is more evidence of confusion in the White House.</p><p>WESTWOOD:  Well, certainly you don't have to look far to find plenty of evidence of that.  This particular position in the White House, the Communications Director position, has been done by five people, six people have been named White House Communications Director, one of them resigned before actually taking the position.</p><p>So this has been a notoriously difficult job for this administration to fill in part because President Trump likes to act so much as his own chief spokesman, and so it's difficult for someone to come in and try to direct his communications and Shine also, like his predecessors, struggled with that.</p><p>So, Richard, it will be interesting to see who the White House selects, if anyone, to hold this position moving forward.</p><p>QUEST:  We'll watch it.  Have a good weekend.  Thank you.</p><p>WESTWOOD:  You, too.</p><p>QUEST:  Sarah at the White House.  Coming up next, breaking up big tech, in the words of Neil Sedaka, it may be hard to do, but presidential hopeful, Elizabeth Warren is game to have a go.  Big tech on the block in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:15:00]</p><p>QUEST:  Five years ago tonight, Malaysia Airlines flight MH-370 disappeared and nothing has been heard of it since except some debris that washed up some months later.  Family members of the Chinese nationals on board are now calling on their government to continue the search, a search that was called off in January 2017, after two years.</p><p>The plane disappeared with 239 passengers and crew on board.  It was going between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing.  Now, that is pretty much all we know about what happened to MH-370.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  It is the aviation the mystery that transfixed the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, ANCHOR, CNN:  Air traffic controllers in Southeast Asia have lost contact with a jumbo jet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  The Boeing 777 was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it vanished.  Two hundred and thirty nine people on board missing.  Five years later, and aviation experts believe it's still possible to lose a passenger plane somewhere over the world's oceans.</p><p>Currently, air traffic controllers track planes through a patch work of radar, ground radio and satellite communications.  The satellites have limited range.  Now, a new system coming on line next month will for the first time allow the planes to be tracked in real-time anywhere they fly.</p><p>Also airlines will be able to subscribe to live tracking services that share location and other data.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARY SCHIAVO, AVIATION ANALYST, CNN:  Not only will these tracking systems save the world from losing another plane and the heartbreak of five years out still not knowing where the people are, but every month it will save a state, a country, another jurisdiction from having to search for small planes that go missing all the time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Also, under development, a new generation of black boxes.  Airbus is introducing a flight data recorder that ejects itself during a crash.  While Honeywell is working on a cockpit voice and recorder that constantly streams data via satellite.  None of this technology is currently mandated by regulators.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID SOUCIE, AVIATION SAFETY ANALYST, CNN:  It's up to the airlines, it's up to the states themselves, the countries that fly aircraft to pay the extra dollars that it takes.  And it's not a lot of extra dollars, maybe ten cents a ticket or so.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  What hasn't changed of course is how families are treated during the most difficult experience of their lives.  There are no uniform worldwide standards for immediate assistance and families are given no mandated access to the crash investigations.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHIAVO:  They are intentionally kept out and what does that do?  That makes the entire investigation suspect in the eyes of the families.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  Incidents like the disappearance of MH-370 involve families, investigators and regulators across many different jurisdictions.  Bringing them all together is and direct common framework is what the authorities are trying to do.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SOUCIE:  There's no body that says you can't fly and charge for tickets and expect people to fly and fly on your airlines without a standard of safety that is worldwide.  It can't just be state to state.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:20:06]</p><p>QUEST (voice over):  As to the whereabouts and discovery of the final resting place of that 777, it may be many years when more sophisticated searching methods are devised that we'll ever find the wreckage, recover the remains and finally find out what happened to MH-370.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  After the official search for MH-370 was called off, there was a second search led by the U.S. exploration firm, Ocean Infinity.  The company says it's ready to launch a new effort.  Ocean Infinity's Chief Executive, Oliver Plunkett joins me now.</p><p>Thank you, Oliver for being with us.  What is stopping you from just saying, \"I'm going to put the ships out.  We've got the technology.  We've got the ships.  It's a find or no fee.  I'm going out tomorrow.\"</p><p>OLIVER PLUNKETT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, OCEAN INFINITY:  We want to make sure firstly that we've properly analyzed all of the theories and know that we're looking exactly the right place.  Minister Loke from Malaysia actually makes a very serious point when he says that the government doesn't want to engage unless there's a credible reason to do so.  The other way of thinking about that is he says, \"I don't want to expose the families to the emotions of hope on a wild goose chase.\"  And we feel that that's very important because ultimately, it's the families who are at the center of all of this.</p><p>QUEST:  Right.  The first principle's report which identified the most likely area which you then took as the basis, I'm simplifying, obviously, but you then took as the basis for the most likely area to search, well, did you complete that area in that last search?  Are you comfortable that you searched the most likely area, and if so, then, yes, where do you go next?</p><p>PLUNKETT:  I think with any ocean search, the idea that there is a pinpoint location can be nothing more than a starting point from which you go north, south, east and west based on the evidence which draws you in one of those four directions.</p><p>We started in the point where the original search finished and traveled north because that was most consistent with what was in the first principal's report.  Inevitably, the southern Indian Ocean is an enormous body of water and whether it's near there or somewhere else requires some additional thought.</p><p>QUEST:  So are you saying that we don't know where the plane went down?  I mean, because at the end of the day, quite a lot of the ocean -- quite a lot of the area where the plane is believed to have gone down was searched very thoroughly in the first part.  Your organization did an extremely thorough search using newer technologies of the most likely area.  But do -- does the evidence still seem to together it is off the western coast of Australia?</p><p>PLUNKETT:  When you look at the combination of the satellite data analysis and the ocean drift analysis that's been reviewed and carried out by various organizations from around the world, the preponderance of the evidence points you to the southern Indian Ocean off the west coast of Australia.</p><p>But it's a large area.  And as I say, the idea that there's a pinpoint in this particular search just doesn't make any sense.  There might be other searches where there is that evidence that it's very, very -- and you find the thing you're looking for exactly where the evidence suggests it should be.  This isn't one of those.</p><p>QUEST:  So I expect much of the day answering the questions to my colleagues about would they ever find it?  And my answer has always been, yes, it will be found one day when the sophistication or sophisticated search tools are able to do that, and we're not there yet.  Do you subscribe to that?</p><p>PLUNKETT:  I also believe that it will be find one day.  At the moment -- and this was the point I made to the families last weekend, I think we have got the tools to find it.  What for me has made me feel that since we left the site of the Indian Ocean in June of last year, is that we found the Argentinian submarine, San Juan, and we found the Korean boat carrier, Stella Daisy.</p><p>The San Juan in particular, was an object of a similar size to MH-370, except it was designed not to be identified by sonar.</p><p>[15:25:10]</p><p>PLUNKETT:  So the fact we can find that tells me that if we look in the right place, we can find MH-370.</p><p>QUEST:  Right, and finally, in a sentence, so what do you need - who's permission do you now need to go back out and search?</p><p>PLUNKETT:  The Government of Malaysia.  I think it's important to remember that it isn't -- this is a -- it's an airplane that is subject to police investigations and it matters to the families, I think it's important to not just go out and do things without having that buy-in of all the stakeholders.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you sir.  Thank you very much for joining us.  Much appreciated.</p><p>PLUNKETT:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  And of course in future programs, we will be asking the government of Malaysia exactly when and why they will allow some people like Ocean Infinity to go back out.</p><p>Coming up next, breaking up big tech.  The big names are huge, but Senator Warren takes on the three most valuable companies in the world.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Hello, I'm Richard Quest.  There is more \"Quest Means Business\" in a moment when you'll hear from Elizabeth Warren who thinks breaking up big tech will help her get to the White House, or at least promising to do it, and big oil companies have taken a big hit after one of their biggest investors says it is having a rethink on fossil fuels.  As we continue tonight, this is CNN and on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>Tens of thousands of people turned out again on Friday demonstrating across Algeria.  Protestors are demanding that the 82-year-old President, Bouteflika, withdraw from next month's election.  Despite suffering a stroke in 2013 and having rarely been seen in public since, the current President is moving ahead with his candidacy.</p><p>[15:30:10]</p><p>The lawyer for the so-called ISIS bride Shamima Begum says he believes her new born son has died.  Begum is being held at a camp in Syria and gave birth to a baby boy last month.</p><p>She left the U.K. to join ISIS four years ago.  She recently said she wanted to come back to Britain.  But British officials say they would strip her of her citizenship because she supports a terrorist organization.</p><p>British lawmakers are getting ready to vote again on Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal on Tuesday.  Brexit is only 21 days away, Theresa May said a short while ago that if parliament rejects her deal, in her words, no one knows what will happen and that the U.K. might not leave the EU at all.</p><p>Parts of Venezuela has been without electricity since Thursday.  There was a widespread power outrage that led officials to close schools and suspend other  public services.  President Maduro's government says it's due to sabotage of the country's main hydro electric power station.  Critics say crumbling infrastructure and corruption are to blame.</p><p>So to SpaceX now celebrating the return of the Dragon.  It's Crew Dragon capsule, that is, it came back to earth early on Friday and it capped off a historic test flight.  SpaceX is developing commercial spacecraft to carry American astronauts to the International Space Station.</p><p>It's time to break up big tech according to U.S. presidential hopeful Senator  Elizabeth Warren.  She wants to take a saw to Amazon, Google and Facebook.  It's all part of the bid to promote competition in the sector, she says.  Now, of course, the senator's campaigning like a trust buster of yester-year.</p><p>When we think of Amazon with its vast holdings across many industries, its tentacle remind you of images such as those of the early 1900s.  Now, back then, the idea was that of an octopus and it was the perfect metaphor for monopolies of oil and railroad companies and how they extended their reach, strong arming their way to the U.S.</p><p>And the analogy of the octopus -- as you can see Capitol Hill over there, you can see Wall Street over there, the analogy of the octopus and the company by the way of course, they talk about is Standard Oil which was broken up into SO as we now know today.</p><p>Now, it works just as well today of the analogy -- look at --</p><p>(BELL RINGS)</p><p>Amazon, there's Amazon web services and the amazon.com.  All the tentacles going deep into the economy.  With groceries at Whole Foods and shoes at Zappos, or as any book you can think of is audible or a candle.  Amazon is now of course in the world, it's vast and it's strong and Elizabeth Warren wants to break  it up piece by piece.</p><p>MJ Lee is in New York and joins me.  Now, the idea of what -- I mean, it's not a  new idea, but she's backing herself.  This is turning into one of her touch-stone policies.</p><p>MJ LEE, CNN U.S. POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely.  And Richard, I'm actually just returning from Harlem where Elizabeth Warren had a campaign event and we got some time to talk to her about this new proposal to break up the big tech companies like Amazon, like Google, like Facebook.</p><p>So, let's actually listen to what she had to say.  She was talking about this in the context of Amazon's failed bid to start a new headquarters in Long Island City and then we can talk on the other side.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  I want to make clear, I cheered when New York City said we're pushing back just a little bit on everything that Amazon is asking for.  Because here's the problem, these giant tech companies have so much power, so much economic power and so much  political power that they go all around the country saying, bribe me to come be where you are.</p><p>And it's like a giant hunger games of some kind.  What I believe is for it to have more competition in the marketplace and to level the playing field a little bit for  small businesses and entrepreneurs and start-ups.  What we've got to do is take  those platforms, you know, how you order on Amazon or you do a search on Google, and break them off from the additional businesses that they're running  and those additional businesses are where they're getting a comparative advantage on their information because of the information they get from their  platforms.</p><p>The way to think about this right now is Amazon is like the umpire in the baseball game.  It runs the marketplace, and it also has a lot of teams on the field  because it's actually competing with the other businesses on that platform and giving special advantage, putting them on page 1 and somebody they don't like back on page 6.</p><p>[15:35:00]  So my notion is, you can be an umpire or you can own a team, but you can't do both at the same time.  And that's how we should break up Amazon, it's how we should break up Google, customers, both like you and me, we can still do our searches, we can still do what we want to do, but we want to break these up and get more competition in the industry.</p><p>LEE:  Would you have been OK with it being in Boston, the second headquarters?</p><p>WARREN:  So what I'm not OK with is the fact that cities are put into this competition against each other, and that they're asked to give up tax revenues to build special goodies.  Because you know, here's the deal.  A small business that's just getting started, no city is saying to them, hey, we're going to give you the same deal that Amazon is getting.</p><p>You're going to get a big lop off your taxes or we're going to hand out some  special goodies to you.  Every time the giant goes around the country and says give me something special, they help increase the concentration of the American economy.  That's bad for our economy, it's bad for workers, it's bad for competition, it's bad for small businesses, and ultimately, it's bad for our  democracy.</p><p>Just over the past few years, a handful of the top giants have already gotten $10 billion in special breaks from towns, counties and states.  You know, that's a special break that gives them a leg up in competition.  It's just not fair for small  businesses and that's not right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  MJ, is this going to be a central plank of the senator's manifesto if you like.  Is she going to run hard on this because it's perceived to be popular.</p><p>LEE:  Oh, absolutely, and when you think about Elizabeth Warren and sort of what her campaign stands for so far, this goes to the root of it, right? She is running on getting money out of politics, weakening special interests and wealthy interests in politics, and this is really just the sort of core of her message.</p><p>And if you think back to what her actually first policy proposal of the campaign  was, it was to tax the wealthy, the wealthiest Americans and she said that other proposals that she puts out will actually --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>LEE:  Be paid for by those taxes.  So all of these policy proposals come together, and I think what is going to be really fascinating to watch is how her competitors, the other Democratic candidates feel like they have to respond to this, right? Now that Elizabeth Warren has put out this proposal, you can be sure that the other  Democratic candidates in the field are also going to be asked about this and asked do you support this or do you have another --</p><p>QUEST:  Yes --</p><p>LEE:  Or better idea to deal with this?</p><p>QUEST:  She has put the issue into play, good to see you, thank you, MJ, thank you for getting --</p><p>LEE:  Thanks --</p><p>QUEST:  And thank you for getting that interview back to us so promptly, I appreciate it that it's just taken place.  As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, over three decades, oil money has funded Norway's trillion dollar sovereign well fund; the largest in the world.  Now also, wants to turn away from energy to secure the country's financial future.</p><p>[15:40:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Norway wants to hedge its financial future no longer being quite so tied up with energy and energy stocks.  The company -- of course, the Norwegian government's trillion dollar sovereign wealth fund has revealed it's cashing out of  most of its oil and gas investments.  Now, the idea is -- or the worry is, bearing in mind that most of Norway's sovereign wealthy and most of the country's economy comes from oil and gas exports.</p><p>But they want to hedge against a permanent oil price decline because what's the point of having all your money in a hedge fund, and the hedge fund owning oil and gas companies, in other words, eggs in one basket.  You see what I mean there, $7.5 billion is already in exploration and production, and those parts of the economy, $7.5 billion.</p><p>Now, the fund is going to keep investing in big oil companies that works on renewables.  So, those that are high on renewables can still expect to receive investments from the fund.  Look what happened to the oil market in terms of the price, not the crudes.</p><p>BP down at 1 percent, ExxonMobil up one-three quarters, for good reason, for good reason, one of main investors or large investors I should say is about to withdraw.  And the news, Norway sent shockwaves through the market.  Matt Egan is in New York, joins me now.  It's somewhat inevitable that the prices were going to fall, but does the market or is the general view that the policy is the right one?</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER:  You know, Richard, that's a good question.  I think you really nailed it, Norway is really concerned that it is overexposed to oil.  It is worried about what will happen if there is some sort of a permanent decline in oil prices.  And so you noted that the energy sector was down broadly today.</p><p>But what I think is really interesting is some of the EMP companies that Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund owns, they're down even more.  We saw a Apache and Adaco, Chesapeake, EOG Resources, Occidental Petroleum, they're all down more than twice the amount that oil prices are today, and that's because they are worried that one of their biggest investors is going to gradually cash out.</p><p>But you know, it is important to note that Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund is not getting out entirely.  They are still going to hold on to their investments in some of these oil majors.  The likes of Exxon and Shell and BP, and they're all hoping that some of these oil majors would start investing even more in renewable energy in the future.</p><p>QUEST:  Now, Matt, I don't know too much about the Norwegian Sovereign Fund, although one, it's hard to look at the various points over the years, but I do know it is widely regarded as amongst the most respected in the world.</p><p>EGAN:  Right, we're talking about a trillion dollar fund, it's the biggest of its kind and it is looked at as ahead of the curve and forward-looking.  And so, you'll recall that in 2015, Norway Sovereign Wealth Fund actually divested from coal.  It did that ahead of other large institutional investors.</p><p>And so if you talk to, you know, some of the climate activists, they're still really chalking this up as a win and they say that it's a clear sign that slowly, but steadily, some of these large institutions are trying to back away from fossil fuels.  Now, there's a bit of irony here because as you mentioned, Norway got its $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund by of course producing oil.</p><p>It is still the largest oil producer in western Europe, and it's going to continue to  produce more oil.</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>EGAN:  The hope is that it just won't be quite as exposed to oil prices going  forward.</p><p>QUEST:  Fascinating, sorry, good to see you, have a lovely weekend.</p><p>EGAN:  You too.</p><p>[15:45:00]  European stocks closed out with the week with another day of losses.  Stocks were dragged down by continued concerns over slowing global economy.  Look at the numbers, they tell their own story, the FTSE closed lower as the Brexit stalemate drags on, Theresa May is warning Britain's EU exit may not happen at all if her deal is rejected on Tuesday.</p><p>We continue now.  It's International Women's Day, one reporter put the Prime  Minister to the test.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Prime Minister, only one question from a woman reporter on International Women's Day, it's pretty for a show, isn't it?</p><p>THERESA MAY, PRIME MINISTER, UNITED KINGDOM:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  If you weren't able to hear the answer, well, the answers came from a woman Prime Minister, she said that every Prime Minister has been applauded for their comments on this International Women's Day.  We'll explain next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Friday marked the celebration of International Women's Day, and all across the globe, we were taken to the streets to champion gender equality.  In Spain, many women are hosting a feminist strike ahead of the upcoming parliamentary election.</p><p>More than 500 street demonstrations are planned according to the newspaper \"El Pais\".  In France, demonstrators marched to call attention to the gender pay gap and discrimination.  At the same time, the Australian Prime Minister is telling women your empowerment shouldn't come at a cost to men.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCOTT MORRISON, PRIME MINISTER, AUSTRALIA:  Gender equality isn't about putting girls against boys.  See, we're not about setting Australians against each other, trying to push some down to lift others up.  That's not in our values.  That is an absolute liberal value that you don't push some people down to lift some people up.</p><p>And that is true about gender equality too.  We want to see women rise, but we don't want to see women rise only on the basis of others doing worse.  We want everybody to do better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Scott Morrison's comments sparked a backlash on social media.  The Senator Sarah Hanson Young tweeted, \"men who are threatened or worried of women achieving equality is the problem.\"  Morrison's party service on gender imbalance, only 22 percent of liberal party members in parliament are women.</p><p>Now, Mr. Morrison's predecessor Julia Gillard was on a panel with Meghan Markle this morning.  She also published a column in \"The Guardian\" newspaper, saying \"gender equality isn't a women's issue, it's good for men too.\"  Julia Gillard established the Global Institute for Women's Leadership at King's College last year.</p><p>[15:50:00]  Back in September, she told me more progress must be made.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIA GILLARD, FORMER PRIME MINISTER, AUSTRALIA:  We're just putting a simple case that we want to strive for a world of gender equality.  That merit is equally distributed between the sexes, that we live in a world where whether it's politics or leading corporations or the law or news media or technology, less than 30 percent of leadership positions in all of those fields are held by women and we can do better than that.</p><p>And we can do better in how we evaluate women's leadership which shouldn't include streams of horrible stuff on social media.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Get out your phones, your tablets, your devices and join our  conversations, and go to cnn.com-slash-join.  The question tonight is are quotas the answer for equality in corporate leadership? In other words a specific number, for example, 30 percent perhaps.</p><p>Brenda Trenowden is the global chair of the 30 Percent Club and the head of the Financial Institutions Group at ANZ Bank.  She's also an adviser to an independent review into upping the number of women in senior positions at FTSE companies.  She's with me now, good to see you.</p><p>The -- we can deal quickly with the Australian Prime Minister's -- was it -- what was it that he said that was so objectionable? Because most women in professions would agree, yes, we got here our own way, but not just on the back of pushing  somebody else down.</p><p>BRENDA TRENOWDEN, GLOBAL CHAIR, 30 PERCENT CLUB &amp; HEAD, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS GROUP, ANZ BANK:  Right, I think all the women that I know and work with would certainly say the same thing and we certainly think it's not a zero-sum game.  You know, I didn't hear his whole speech, so I think when you take one  sentence out of context, sometimes, you know, things are misinterpreted.</p><p>So, I would agree that we don't want to be pushing other people down to bring people up, we want everybody to be rising up.  We want everyone to benefit from greater inclusion actually.</p><p>QUEST:  And what is the -- what is the biggest issue bedeviling now women in senior positions, do you believe?</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  Well, I wish there was just one issue, Richard, that it would be easier to solve, but it's a multi-variety problem and therefore requires a multi-variety solution.  But there are lots of things, there are definitely unconscious biases.  You know, there are stereotypes and norms that everyone has in their heads about what leadership looks like, that I think holds women back.</p><p>You've certainly got lack of sponsorship.  You know, you've got culture.  I think the big thing that the 30 Percent Club is focusing on this year is really looking at the  inclusion side of the DNI equation.  So we've spent a lot of time trying to create a lot more diversity, hire more women or under represented candidates.</p><p>But we haven't spent enough time thinking about how to make culture more inconclusive for everyone.  And so I think that is part of the biggest issue is one type of dominant culture --</p><p>QUEST:  And yet in the workplace, most companies have a veritable forest of  policies, you know, pages on the website, mission statements galore about it and are still seeing to somehow fumble in the final hurdle.</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  So policies are great, and words on a website are fantastic.  But what we see is that, first of all, the leadership of the company, the CEO has to take this seriously because it's good for their business, and they have to communicate that authentically.</p><p>They then have to do a diagnostic of where the challenges are in their own company because every company is different.  But I think one of the biggest  challenges we see is that all of this has to be implemented by managers.</p><p>QUEST:  Yes --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  You know, a lot of the problem comes into that middle management layer.  And certainly in my experience, companies don't value management the way they used to, they don't train managers as much.  And if you think about it, when people have bad experiences -- nearly if companies, they tend to leave managers, they don't leave companies.</p><p>QUEST:  If we take the United States, surely, the biggest example of just the difficulty that the -- of gender issue is taking the idea of maternity leave in the United States which you'll be aware of course, is -- you know, you're lucky if you get a few weeks pay and back to work or you're in trouble.</p><p>If you have a society that doesn't recognize that only half the population is genetically capable of having the next generation, then it's going to be very difficult to introduce other policies that will facilitate that.</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  So I think a lot of people think that, you know, maternity leave and having babies is one of the big issues, it's one part of the problem, but it's not the whole problem.  And I think --</p><p>QUEST:  But I guess what I'm saying is, if you don't deal with something as big as that, then you're --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  It's a critical piece --</p><p>QUEST:  Starting, you know, it's much more difficult to start to deal with the other areas.</p><p>[15:55:00]  TRENOWDEN:  So you're right, the U.S., I think is far behind in that space, and happily in the U.K., a lot of companies are now introducing equal, you know, parent leave for both women and men.  And so, I think you're right.  I think once we see, you know, men taking leave as well --</p><p>QUEST:  Yes --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  And sharing with their wives or with their partners, then, you know, we'll start to see more equality definitely.</p><p>QUEST:  Looking at the result of our poll tonight, it's a very -- it's a -- you know, 75 percent say quotas are not the answer.  Would you agree?</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  We would, the 30 Percent Club is against quotas.  We believe that, you know, voluntary business-led targets have a better result.  So I'll give you an example.  For those of us --</p><p>QUEST:  Right --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  With children, if you force your children to do things, you don't get the same sustainable result that you do if you talk to them and you  convince them to do it because they want to do it.</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you for coming in and on a Friday night, good to see you --</p><p>TRENOWDEN:  Thank you very much --</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much.  Few moments left on Wall Street, we'll have a great look at the numbers, the Dow is well off the lows of the day, despite worrying news on the trade -- look at that, that is what you call a serious rally.  Even though Chinese officials are no longer planning for President Xi to visit Mar-a-Lago for a trade and signing summit, it doesn't matter, the markets is only off 22 points now.  We'll take our profitable moment after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment, five years ago tonight, MH-370 went missing.  For some inexplicable reason, the Malaysian  government will not authorize a new search even one by Ocean Infinity that is privately funded on a no find, no fee basis.  It is inexplicable.</p><p>It's no, you're simply saying, well, we will do it if there's a credible reason, we don't want to get people's hopes up.  I tell you, those relatives of those who perished, they don't mind, they'd rather you're out there searching on the off chance and the possibility than sitting at home and thinking well, is it credible enough?</p><p>The reality is the Malaysia, China, Australia, the politics of MH-370 have been dreadful at most throughout the time.  And now there's still an opportunity to go back out and search in the areas most likely at somebody else's cost.  I cannot see why you wouldn't get that search underway again on the 5th anniversary is a good  opportunity to do it.</p><p>And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable.  The weekend is upon us, the Dow barely down, the bell is ringing, the day is done.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>[16:00:00]</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FINWRE-2189810359</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FINWRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWW-J2P1-DY0W-42VJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">316089</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7366\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content and programming copyright 2019 Cable News Network, Inc.

The Dow down 667 points half an hour into the trading session.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[09:30:00] POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: All right, the markets are open. You see the big board up there. In just a few moments we will see how this sell-off -- it looks like it's already accelerating. The Dow down 100 points at the open. We have live team coverage. CNN chief business correspondent Christine Romans, CNN Money business correspondent Alison Kosik with me here in New York. At the New York Stock Exchange, Cristina Alesci joining us. In Hong Kong, CNN Asia Pacific editor Andrew Stevens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cristina, to you. Futures were down more than 800 points just a few moments ago. How's it looking at the open?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CRISTINA ALESCI, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT: Well, that's the Dow and that is certainly a big indicator, but we're also watching the S&amp;P 500 because that is a broader indicator of the market and it officially hit correction territory just before the market opened, Poppy, so not a good sign. A sign that those claps will probably not last very long this morning.</p><p>And what's really going on is fear and panic have taken hold. Investors watched the markets meltdown across the globe last night. And they're reacting to it. The focal point, of course, the one that everyone's talking about is China. It's a huge engine of the global growth and now there are real questions, questions about whether that's sustainable and what kind of ripple effects that will have. So that's what you're talking about what is going on in the market.</p><p>Now, on the fundamentals, investors have to be aware that as far as the U.S. economy goes, a lot of people are waking up this morning questioning what is going on with the U.S. economy. What is causing such a stark slide? Even though China may not be doing as well as everyone had hoped, why is the U.S. suffering so much? And the fundamentals on the U.S. side are there. We've seen a pretty strong jobs market, pretty strong housing market.</p><p>So what a lot of optimistic strategies are saying out there is, look, you know, the U.S. is the cleanest shirt in a pile of dark -- dirty laundry. So maybe this is just temporary. On the other hand, we have oil, which is basically a way to see the -- a way to test economic growth going forward or a metric for economic growth going forward on a global scale. That keeps sliding.</p><p>Now, that is not a great indicator because it indicates that demand for the raw material isn't as strong. And also, we cannot forget, when we talk about oil, yes, demand isn't strong, but we also have a supply glut. That's because the Middle Eastern countries keep producing. We have Iranian oil coming on the market. American producers keep pumping out oil. So there is that fundamental to keep in mind as well, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: Right. Right. Right. All right, Cristina, thank you. Stay with me.</p><p>I just want to have your viewers look at what you're looking at next to me. You're seeing the Dow Jones Industrial average off 800 points. It was off more than 950 points just a moment ago. To give you some perspective here as we continue our live coverage of what just broke on Wall Street, the last time the Dow Jones Industrial average was down over 700 points was October 15, 2008. And we all remember what that felt like.</p><p>Do not panic. Do not jump out of the market right now. Christine Romans here to tell us what it all means for you.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: OK, so this is really rare. When you see a 5 percent move in a market, in the stock market in a single day, it's very, very rare to see this. This is a lot of selling coming from all around the world.</p><p>Now, this brings you back to the level of your 401(k) probably if you have stocks in your 401(k) to about a year and a half ago. A year, year and a half ago. So that's some perspective here. The stock market has gone straight up for about six years.</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Down a big -- big number.</p><p>ROMANS: Now we're down 6 percent. More than 1,000 points here. Incredibly rare. Incredibly rare to see a move that brisk. And this is something that has spread around the world from currencies, emerging market currencies tanking, commodities tanking and then suddenly this expectation, Poppy, that American stocks, U.S. stocks are inflated here.</p><p>Three ways you're going to feel this. Your 401(k) is worth a lot less today than it was yesterday. You're back to, you know, a year ago levels at least for your 401(k), but you're still up a lot from the -- from the crisis. Gas prices are probably going to continue to tank. You know, $2 a gallon is what guessing pretty quickly here because oil prices are crumbling. And all the money is coming out of the stock market and going into the bond market. What does that mean in layman's terms? It means refinance. Lock in your re-fi and buy a house!</p><p>HARLOW: Yes. Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: Home prices have been going up and mortgage rates are down.</p><p>HARLOW: And, Alison, people look at this and they're so nervous and the question is, when does it --</p><p>KOSIK: And they're saying what -- what can stop it, right?</p><p>HARLOW: Well, when does it -- also, when does it trickle into jobs? KOSIK: Right.</p><p>HARLOW: Because, yes, you've got a much stronger unemployment rate than a year ago. But when companies are nervous, they're not in a position to hire.</p><p>KOSIK: Right. When -- it's the exact reason why when you see let's say their second quarter earnings weren't so good. We're coming to the end of a second quarter earnings season. This is all about how companies are doing. And when you see reduced sales, and reduced revenue coming from China, these companies are getting nervous about what the future holds for what they're going to be taking in from -- from China. One of the -- the biggest customers for them. And that's why you're seeing investors pull out of those companies because there's a lot of negativity about what may happen in the future. You know, a lot of companies, you know, sell a lot of their goods overseas.</p><p>[09:35:12] What can stop this slide? I've been hearing, believe it or not, if the Fed comes out in one way, shape or form and says, you know what, we're not going to go ahead and raise interest rates, that could maybe calm the market a little bit.</p><p>HARLOW: But the Fed usually doesn't react to news like this.</p><p>KOSIK: Right. But one -- one way they can do is there is a Fed -- the Fed president, the Atlanta -- of the Atlanta region is speaking later today.</p><p>ROMANS: Watch him (ph).</p><p>KOSIK: Yes. And you can bet that investors are going to be listening to the speech later today and if --</p><p>ROMANS: A month ago the Fed raising interest rates is the final sign that the U.S. economy is back to normal.</p><p>HARLOW: Right. Right.</p><p>ROMANS: So a lot of people want that signal --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>ROMANS: That, look, the U.S. is still strong. When you look at the fundamental of the American economy, home prices have been rising --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>ROMANS: Interest rates still very, very low but they are -- are going to rise. The unemployment rate, 5.3 percent. I don't think we're there yet for a CEO to look at this and say, I'm not going to hire. I'm scaling back my hiring plans. But if this goes on for a long time, it could happen.</p><p>HARLOW: Right. All right, so now the Dow Jones Industrial average, again, let's pull up the big board as I take you live to Hong Kong looking at stocks on Wall Street. The Dow down 983 points. The last time the Dow was down 700 points was in October of 2008. We are far worse than that. It's down nearly 6 percent at the open.</p><p>Andrew Stevens live for us in Hong Kong.</p><p>Andrew, this is just building on the sell-off that we saw in Asia overnight.</p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNN ASIA PACIFIC EDITOR: Absolutely. But, nonetheless, it's extraordinary watching this, Poppy, seeing the level of these falls on Wall Street. And I'm finding it hard to think that this is all to do with a China manufacturing number. You get this sort of reaction. Yes, the Chinese economy is probably weaker than a lot of people thought, but it's not in recession. It's not slumping to the stage that, you know, that would justify this massive sell-off on Wall Street. I'm just curious, this may be something -- was the U.S. market that overvalued? Is this just a correct there? But you guys know that better than I do.</p><p>But just coming back to the -- to the (INAUDIBLE) side of things, yes, we've got a big, big sell-off in China today. The Shanghai composite down 8.5 percent. You've got to go back to 2007 to see that sort of fall. And what was interesting today, and what was key today, was that there was very, very little evidence of the Chinese regulators or the Central Bank in the market. They have been active in the China market, putting a floor under this falling, this tanking market.</p><p>This is a crash in China, essentially. It's down nearly 40 percent in 10 weeks. And on the way down, after we had a big, big initial sell- off, the Chinese authorities started putting money into the market, doing all sorts of very unusual measures, to try and put a floor under that. They succeeded for a whole, but today we're back in that big selling mode and no real sign of the authorities trying to --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>STEVENS: To regulate this fall, manipulate this fall. So it suggests either that they've given up because they have no -- very little credibility left in the markets --</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>STEVENS: Or they're looking at other things, bigger things like the economy, guys.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, and here is the thing that China does have more ammunition, does have more that regulators in the government there can do to try to stop this bleeding.</p><p>A quick break. The Dow down 823 points. This is a historic day on Wall Street that is for sure. More live team coverage straight after this.</p><p>[09:43:06] HARLOW: I'm Poppy Harlow, in for Carol Costello, as we watch a sell-off on Wall Street that has frankly improved quite a bit from the open. I want to welcome our viewers, again, here in the United States and around the world as we are watching the opening on Wall Street.</p><p>Richard Quest with me, Alison Kosik, Cristina Alesci at the New York Stock Exchange, Andrew Stevens in Hong Kong, Christine Romans, chief business correspondent.</p><p>Richard Quest, to you first. This is a reaction to what we saw over -- overseas in Europe and in Asia.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's feeding itself. It's feeding on itself. Yes, yes, it's fed -- fed -- Thursday fed to Friday, Friday fed to Saturday, over the weekend, and now over Asia to Europe and Europe back here.</p><p>But let's not think -- we don't know how much selling is actually going on. This is marking down. This is a marking down at the open. A very severe, very serious, very deep thousand points as Christine said, you don't see 5 percent off a major market like the Dow very often.</p><p>But, you know, we've already come back a bit and --</p><p>HARLOW: Oh, we've come back quite a bit. We were down a thousand at the open.</p><p>KOSIK: Yes, down thousand.</p><p>ROMANS: But another perspective I would say, though, this is a 10 month low for the S&amp;P 500. So think about, markets have gone up for six years.</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: You see a thousand point move almost in the morning and it's still only a 10-month low. That just shows you how quickly and aggressively markets have been going up.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>ROMANS: And how quickly now they're coming down.</p><p>QUEST: And these aren't the markets that they used to be.</p><p>KOSIK: No.</p><p>QUEST: These are computer driven.</p><p>KOSIK: And so you're seeing the reaction of just pressing literally buttons. And that's why you saw that acceleration right when the bell rang.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>KOSIK: Now you're seeing things settle out a bit. There are cooler heads, believe it or not, are prevailing, even at 557 points lower on the down. HARLOW: Let me remind all of our viewers, just put this in context, OK. The last time we saw the Dow down 700 points was in October of 2008. The last time it was down 600 points, August of 2011. When you look at September 2008, down 777 points.</p><p>ROMANS: It was a bad time.</p><p>HARLOW: It was a very different time.</p><p>QUEST: From lower levels. From lower levels so percentages were higher.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: Sure. So percentage wise, when we talk about percentage wise, the markets now down three and a third percent. The last time it was down 6 percent, double where we are now, was September of 2008.</p><p>[09:45:03] Cristina Alesci, I believe we have her at the New York Stock Exchange. Cristina, the sentiment on the floor, what is it?</p><p>ALESCI: There's a sense of nervousness. I mean, we see it play through into the volatility of what the numbers show right now. So you're seeing more volatility.</p><p>We haven't had this kind of volatility in a long time, and part of that is what Richard and Alison were referring to, which is this electronic trading. But once, you know, people enter into the equation, then we have to look and pay attention to what's going to happen over the next several hours. That's going to be really crucial. Investors had to digest what happened overnight with the global markets melting down.</p><p>You know, this is going to raise a lot of questions about global economic growth which was largely driven for awhile by China, right? And now investors are starting to see, you know, cracks in that, starting to question whether their economic numbers are even, you know, are even credible at this point. Alison brought up that point earlier.</p><p>But when you look at the fundamentals, it really does seem like this kind of panic doesn't really make sense in the face of U.S. economic fundamentals, which seem to be pretty strong at this point, which is why the Federal Reserve was looking to raise rates in the September/December time frame.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, that's such an important point to keep this all in perspective, because there's a -- this is so different than 2008 in every way.</p><p>Thank you, all. Stay with me. We're going to take a quick break. On the other side, we're going to tell you what is happening to oil prices. This is a critical part of all of it. Nnext.</p><p>[09:51:11] HARLOW: I'm Poppy Harlow. Want to welcome our viewers again here in the United States and around the world as we watch just a huge sell-off on Wall Street. The Dow right now down 690 points, accelerating the sell-off we saw in Asia and Europe overnight. We have live team coverage. Cristina Alesci at the New York Stock Exchange, Richard Quest, Alison Kosik, Christine Romans here with me; in Hong Kong, Andrew Stevens.</p><p>Christine, to you first. Another big part of this is oil. Oil prices absolutely tanking.</p><p>ROMANS: Oil prices down another 5 percent now below $40 a barrel. It's really remarkable. It's been a crash in commodities like oil, but especially oil, and that's really dangerous for a lot of the countries that rely on oil for their own revenue, that export oil. Also tough for the energy companies that are probably in our 401(k) who have seen their stocks crash. So that's one of the reflections of what's happening in the stock market action.</p><p>Also watching oil, it's going to be good for drivers. Obviously it's good for consumers around the world. It's good for governments that consume, are net consumers of oil around the world. But such a big move in a commodity like that can be very destabilizing. So closely watching that.</p><p>For the stock market it's a psychological here -- 700 points down. That is a big psychological hit to investors at a time when the American economy has been moving forward.</p><p>HARLOW: Right, right.</p><p>ROMANS: But this is about the rest of the world, not about the U.S.</p><p>HARLOW: It's about the rest of the world, but we're increasingly dependent on the rest of the world --</p><p>ROMANS: That's right; you're right.</p><p>HARLOW: And big question marks about what the Fed here is going to do. Just to give you some context, the Dow down 700 points right now. The last time we saw this in terms of points was in October of 2008. However, it was September 2008 that the market was down 6 percent because, remember, the market was a lot lower then. And we're coming off of a six-year bull market.</p><p>And Richard Quest, many people saying this morning do not panic. This is taking a little bit off the table. This is a little bit of giveback in an extraordinary bull market.</p><p>QUEST: There are some evil winds blowing, and the question is do they become hurricanes or do they just pick peter off into the distance? At the moment, this market having down 700 -- between 600 and 800 -- it's looking for its direction. It's looking to see which -- what is --</p><p>ROMANS: Its direction is down, Richard. QUEST: No, no, the next direction. The next direction. Does it go further down or does it rally back up again?</p><p>KOSIK: But this is more -- this is just more of a reaction, there's got to be something that --</p><p>QUEST: Exactly.</p><p>KOSIK: -- that stops it.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, where are the fundamentals that this market is reacting to?</p><p>KOSIK: Well, and that's the thing. OK, let's talk about the U.S. economy. Although it's not great, it's not operating necessarily on all cylinders, it is the prettiest girl at the party. We're talking about better than Europe, obviously better than China. So, yes, it is a solid B. Let's give it a solid B.</p><p>So if you think about how the U.S. fundamentals are doing, many would say it would not warrant an 800 point drop in the Dow.</p><p>HARLOW: But Cristina Alesci, to you at the New York Stock Exchange, this isn't just about U.S. fundamentals. These are companies -- look across the board -- big tech companies, big auto companies from, you know, GM to HP to IBM to Apple, to you name it, these are companies that are just as reliant on the rest of the world as they are on the United States.</p><p>ALESCI: That's right. You can't really look at the U.S. in a vacuum, unfortunately, anymore. Christine brought up this point earlier, but half of the earnings of the S&amp;P 500 companies, which is a much broader index than the Dow, half of those earnings do come from overseas. And the major concern is not what's happening today with U.S. economic data and U.S. fundamentals, but what happens a year from now, what happens two years from now. Do CEOs take a look at that and say, OK, if we have a global economic slowdown, what does that mean to my bottom line? What does it mean to how much money I can pay people and how much money I can spend on infrastructure and research?</p><p>So these are the big questions that are going to drive, you know, the market in the days and the weeks and the months going forward. And it's just too early to tell how much lower we're going to go at this point, but we need another 10 percent, maybe 7 percent to 10 percent, drop to really call it a bear market, which is a long-term switch to the downside here, Poppy.</p><p>[09:55:14] HARLOW: Yes, we're certainly not there yet. We're not even at those circuit breaker levels yet.</p><p>Cristina Alesci at the New York Stock Exchange, stay with me. Quick break. Much more of our live team coverage on just an extraordinary day on Wall Street, next.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news.</p><p>HARLOW: 10:00 Eastern, good morning, everyone. I'm Poppy Harlow in today for Carol Costello as we watch an extraordinary day unfolding on Wall Street. The Dow down 667 points half an hour into the trading session. We, of course, have live team coverage. Andrew Stevens in Hong Kong, Cristina Alesci at the New York Exchange.</p><p>[10:00:00] Here with me in New York, Richard Quest, Alison Kosik, Christine Romans.

FreeMarkets, the dot-com company generating a ton of interest but absolutely no profits.</p><p>And never has luxury looked so good.

And now it does everything.  It's one of the hippest labels around.</p><p>GWYNETH PALTROW, ACTRESS: I think it will continue as long as the stock market is bullish.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is THE MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR.  Reporting tonight from New York, Stuart Varney.</p><p>VARNEY: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to MONEYLINE. Tonight, it is Willow who is on assignment.</p><p>As for Wall Street, the week ended with yet another record session for the Nasdaq composite.  Investors celebrated the absence of inflation and another round of stellar stock debuts.  The buying really picked up in the final hour of trading.</p><p>Greg Clarkin has more in today's \"STREET SWEEP.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GREG CLARKIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It was a vote of confidence for the workings of the so-called \"new economy.\" FreeMarkets is a Web site that lets companies bid on everything from raw materials to commodities to parts -- an eBay for businesses.  And today investors wildly bid up the company's shares, more than 480 percent, in its Wall Street debut.</p><p>ERIC YUPIN, BANKBOSTON ROBERTSON STEPHENS: That market and that space in particular has much more opportunity for this kind of company to capture higher margins and achieve greater transaction volumes and greater transaction fees.  Hence bigger company, more margin potential here.</p><p>CLARKIN: FreeMarkets wasn't the only stock with a white-hot debut.  EBenx soared 124 percent on its first day of trading.  ESpeed, an electronic communication network spun off from the Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald, shot up 99 percent.  And El Sitio, a Spanish and Portuguese language Web site, zoomed 108 percent.</p><p>The buying binge didn't stop at the newcomers.  The Nasdaq composite added 26 points to 3620, its 51st record close of the year.</p><p>Even without the help of tech perennials IBM and Intel, the blue chips managed to climb within 101 points of their August record.  The Dow Jones industrials gained 89 points to close at 11,224.</p><p>But some market watchers caution the rally in technology shares is overdone.</p><p>PETER CARDILLO, WESTFALIA INVESTMENTS: If you look at some of these technology stocks, especially the Internet technology stocks, they have excessive valuations at this time.  And I believe that in the first quarter of the new year, this market is headed for some rough times.  And I -- we could see a 10 to 15 percent correction in the Nasdaq, and a 10 percent in the Dow.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARKIN: And even one more IPO to keep an eye on out for, insurance and money management giant John Hancock Financial Services. The company said it will offer 102 million shares to the public, each priced at $15 to $25.  John Hancock expects to raise nearly $2 billion from this IPO -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Greg Clarkin reporting.  Thank you, Greg.</p><p>Now the stocks have rallied.  It really picked up momentum after a big plunge in crude oil prices.  The U.N. Security Council voted to renew Iraq's oil-for-food deal for another six months.  That means Iraq can, if it chooses, start exporting oil as early as next week. Light sweet crude dropped 92 cents to $25.53 a barrel, bouncing back a bit from the lows of the session.</p><p>The sharp drop in oil prices boosted the inflation-wary bond market.  Traders also liked that weaker-than-expected report on wholesale prices.  The Treasury's 30-year issue moved up 22 ticks, and that put the yield back down to 6.16 percent.  And that is, by the way, the lowest level in some three weeks.</p><p>Holding down long-term interest rates, a steady drumbeat of weaker-than-expected news on inflation.  Today, it was the producer price index, edging up just two-tenths of one percent in November. And excluding a big jump in food and energy costs, the \"core rate,\" as it's called, the core rate of wholesale inflation would not have budged at all, as Kelli Arena reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KELLI ARENA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Most Wall Street economists say investors should rest easy.  Inflation has yet to rear its ugly head.</p><p>GARY THAYER, A.G. EDWARDS: Things are still very benign outside of oil.  The strong dollar is keeping most other prices contained.  As a matter of fact, if you look at the PPI numbers this year, we've had weakness in apparel and food, in capital goods prices.</p><p>ARENA: But oil, always a wild card, is rising.  The energy component accounted for much of the November rise in wholesale prices, up 1.4 percent, driven largely by a spike in heating oil and residential electric power.  But so far, economists do not view it as a threat.</p><p>KEVIN LOGAN, DRESDNER KLEINWORT BENSON: It's still very, very modest.  In the past year, prices fell rather sharply.  And now that we're seeing some recovery in the global economy, these prices are also beginning to recover.  But it's not a threat to inflation.</p><p>ARENA: It is a threat to the administration, however.  Energy Secretary Bill Richardson yesterday said the U.S. is willing to do whatever it takes to protect consumers.</p><p>Looking back over the past 12 months, wholesale prices are up 3.1 percent.</p><p>(on camera): Economists say that should help reassure Federal Reserve policy makers who meet on December 21st to decide the future course of interest rates.</p><p>Kelli Arena, CNN financial news, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VARNEY: Chief economist at Merrill Lynch, Bruce Steinberg, thought the Fed's November rate hike would be its last for quite a while.  A week ago, though, he changed his mind, saying the strength of the economy could indeed force the Fed to raise rates in the near future.  And he joins me now.</p><p>Bruce, welcome to the program.</p><p>BRUCE STEINBERG, MERRILL LYNCH: Thank you, Stuart.</p><p>You think we're in an old-fashioned boom, don't you?  And you think it's going to continue to next year.</p><p>STEINBERG: It's not an old-fashioned boom, it's a new economy boom.  Our economy is just going great.  But despite the strong growth that we're having, there's just no inflation pressure that's observable at all.  And I think we can keep on going for quite some time.</p><p>VARNEY: But if there's no inflation pressure visible, why should the Fed raise rates?</p><p>STEINBERG: What the Fed is chiefly worried about is that we're about to run out of people.  And the unemployment rate is very low. The economy is quite strong, and that's what it's really reacting to. It's not reacting to the actuality of inflation, of which there isn't any, it's worried somehow that down the road we might get some.  I don't think they're right on that, but that's what they are reacting to.  And that's why I think that they'll probably have to tighten policy again.</p><p>VARNEY: Your bet is then the Fed does raise rates early in the year, fairly early on?</p><p>STEINBERG: Probably in February.  If not, then in March.</p><p>VARNEY: Now if we've got such a robust economy, what does that do for corporate profits next year, because that really is the baseline for the stock market's performance?</p><p>STEINBERG: I think corporate profits are going to be great next year, another year of double digit earnings growth for the S&amp;P 500. This year, earnings are probably going to end up going up 15 percent or so, and I think next year they'll be up almost as strongly.</p><p>VARNEY: Boy, you say we're in a new economy.  How much longer can we go on like this?  I mean, nine years of growth, 200,000 new jobs every month, no inflation, et cetera, et cetera.  Can you put a time frame on when we're going to run out of steam?</p><p>STEINBERG: You know, we haven't repealed the business cycle. There will be a downturn someday.  But frankly it's just not on the horizon.  We don't how long this can last.  We are in uncharted territory.  It makes it hard to analyze, kind of exciting to look at. But it could go on for several more years at least.</p><p>VARNEY: What do you think could upset everything?  Is there something you could imagine on the horizon out there?</p><p>STEINBERG: The biggest risk in terms of the near term is that the Fed thinks the party is just getting a little too frenetic and it decides to take away the punch bowl, so to speak, by continuing to tighten policy in 2000.  And if it tightens more than a couple of times, that will have a chilling effect on the economy by late next year.</p><p>VARNEY: Have you ever seen anything like this before?</p><p>STEINBERG: No one has anything like this before.</p><p>VARNEY: That for real?  Nobody has seen anything\u2026</p><p>STEINBERG: No.</p><p>VARNEY: This is unique?</p><p>STEINBERG: This is unique, yes.</p><p>VARNEY: We'll leave it at that.  Bruce Steinberg, Merrill Lynch, thanks very much.</p><p>STEINBERG: OK.</p><p>VARNEY: Now let's take a quick look at some of the other stories that we're working on for MONEYLINE tonight.  And we begin with Bruce Francis.</p><p>BRUCE FRANCIS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Stuart.</p><p>IBM has been a big bust late this week, and Xerox is putting out some news that it won't want to copy.  I'll have the story behind the numbers for these two tech giants.</p><p>STEVE YOUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I'm Steve Young.</p><p>FreeMarkets.com had a flashy IPO today because it's got a lock on the business-to-business Internet auction market.  But as I'll explain, patent lawyers warn it could face stiff competition from other public companies.</p><p>FRED KATAYAMA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And I'm Fred Katayama.</p><p>No Christmas present for day traders.  The boards of the two big exchanges are tightening day-trading requirements.  That has some day traders and day-trading firms crying foul.</p><p>VARNEY: Also coming up on MONEYLINE, farm and pharmaceutical: Are the two faces of Monsanto on track to become two separate companies?  We'll take a look at that.</p><p>Also ahead, prosecutors hammer a U.S. scientist linked to an espionage scandal that shook U.S.-Chinese relations: the latest on the charges against Wen Ho Lee.</p><p>And the iron fist in the calfskin glove: We'll tell you about the ruthless drive behind the LVMH luxury empire in tonight's \"Bottom Line.\"</p><p>We'll be back.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: From CNN's New York headquarters, this is THE MONEYLINE NEWS HOUR.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Now checking some of tonight's \"MONEYLINE Movers\": Ticketmaster Online CitySearch up 3 7/8.  DLJ upgraded that stock to a buy.  Also today, Ticketmaster named Larry Jacobson as president and COO.  He is the former head of Fox Television.</p><p>Positive analysts comments lifted Tyco International two points, the most active stock on the Big Board.  Lehman Brothers resumed coverage with a buy rating and it said the SEC's accounting investigation could support Tyco's position.</p><p>Harcourt General up 3 3/4.  Deutsche Bank Alex Brown upgraded the book publisher to a strong buy.  It said the market for educational publishers is the best it's been in 10 years.</p><p>Network Associates gained 2 5/8.  BankBoston Robertson Stephens upgraded the software firm.  It said concerns about fourth-quarter profits are unfounded.</p><p>After the market closed, investors slammed shares of Xerox.  The company warned that its quarterly profits will fall well below expectations, and that sent the stock down more than four points in after-hours trading.</p><p>Bruce Francis joins us now with the details on this.</p><p>Bruce, what's happened?</p><p>FRANCIS: Stuart, a problem and a familiar one unfortunately for shareholders.  Xerox is warning that earnings could fall short of estimates by as much as 40 percent.  That could reduce Xerox's profit to little more than 39 cents a share when it reports earnings on January 25.  That's less than half of what Xerox earned last year.</p><p>Let's look at the reasons why Xerox won't want to copy this quarter.  Xerox says that its high-end printing business will continue to be plagued by Y2K lockdowns at big customers.  And a recent reorganization of its sales force will leave higher-than-expected levels of bad debt on the books.  And currency problems with both Brazil and Europe will be a drag on the bottom line.  That has some analysts, like Dan Kunsler (ph) of J.P. Morgan questioning the management's ability at Xerox to execute.</p><p>Meanwhile, back at Big Blue, investors are more concerned about the news that they didn't get, specifically a cheerier outlook on Y2K. Incoming chief financial officer John Joyce briefed analysts on Thursday. And by the size of the run-up, investors probably expected some good news to come out of that meeting.  Instead they got an affirmation of a previous warning about this quarter and next.  Plus, a prediction that the year 2000 could be a very good one for IBM.  The stock declined 8 percent over two sessions.  To some analysts, though, that makes IBM a relative bargain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURT KING, BANC OF AMERICAN SECURITIES: I would use the pullback in IBM as a buying opportunity.  We know that Y2K is the ultimate one- time event and that IBM's longer-term prospects remain very bright.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRANCIS: And analyst Kurt King has a 12-month target on IBM of $150 a share.  So from the levels now, some decent appreciation there, Stuart. VARNEY: You got that right.</p><p>Bruce Francis, thank you very much.</p><p>Now this late news: Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley has canceled a campaign appearance due to an irregular heartbeat.</p><p>Jennifer Auther has more on this -- Jennifer.</p><p>JENNIFER AUTHER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Stuart, aides to Senator Bill Bradley have just confirmed that the senator has an irregular heartbeat.  He is being treated at a hospital that they will not disclose.  They will not even disclose the city.  They did say, however, that Bill Bradley was at a fund-raiser here in the San Francisco Bay Area in the East Bay.  He was scheduled to be here in Berkeley, where he was to announce a proposal to set aside $250 million annually to get funded from offshore revenues and tax-exempt donations from private individuals and organizations.</p><p>He was to set out an environmental plan.  However, the senator has canceled afternoon events in California.  He has canceled morning events in Washington state.  We are told he will be able to pick up campaign on Sunday in Orlando, Florida.</p><p>However, the senator, we are told, was first diagnosed with this irregular heartbeat in 1996.  So he's known about it for some time now.  He is receiving treatment.  He is not being hospitalized at this time.</p><p>That's all we know from here at this time.</p><p>Stuart, back to you.</p><p>VARNEY: Jennifer Auther with that late-breaking news.</p><p>Thank you, Jennifer.</p><p>You are watching MONEYLINE, and we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: There were some very big-name stocks that managed to hit 52-week highs today, and they include: American Express, Oracle, America Online, General Electric and Wal-Mart -- new highs, all of them.</p><p>In tonight's other corporate headlines: General Motors will buy a 20 percent stake in Fuji Heavy Industries for $1.4 billion.  Fuji manufacturers Subaru cars and trucks.  GM finished the day: down nearly three-quarters of a point.</p><p>A British newspaper and magazine publisher rejected a cash takeover bid from Gannett.  News Communications and media said Gannett's undisclosed amount is just too low.  Shares of Gannett fell nearly 1 1/4 but gained nearly five in the past two sessions, after the company issued a positive outlook for fourth-quarter profits and revenues.</p><p>The pressure is on for the board of directors at Monsanto.  Its stock jumped nearly four percent today, on a \"Wall Street Journal\" report that the life sciences firm could take dramatic steps to boost its sagging stock price.  Monsanto finished the day up 1 9/16, at 43 13/16.</p><p>And as Allan Dodds Frank reports, investors are hoping for a breakup.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ALLAN DODDS FRANK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Is St. Louis- based Monsanto ready to transform itself into separate agricultural and pharmaceutical firms, or sell out?  Those questions faced the company's directors as they convened today at an undisclosed location in Chicago.  Wall Street has been pining for a breakup since Monsanto failed to merge with American Home Products last year at $57 a share, an offer 30 percent above Monsanto's closing price today.</p><p>Many analyst say the hot new arthritis drug Celebrex, controlled by the company's Searle unit, could make Monsanto worth far more if it were valued as a pharmaceutical firm.</p><p>BILL YOUNG, DONALDSON, LUFKIN &amp; JENRETTE: If Monsanto were to split up AG versus Searle, I don't think it would be too long until the vultures, meaning other large pharmaceutical companies, would go in and make a play to take hold of Searle.</p><p>FRANK: Monsanto sells nearly $2.75 billion worth of pharmaceutical products and takes in more than $4 billion a year from agriculture.  And while its herbicide, Roundup, is the biggest selling weed killer, the company's genetically modified crops have been meeting increasing consumer resistance.</p><p>WILLIAM FIALA, CHEMICAL ANALYST, EDWARD JONES: They bet the farm in AG biotechnology.  They invested billions and billions of dollars, leveraged up their balance sheet, and it's not quite panning out.  So they're looking for someone with some financial strength to team up with.</p><p>FRANK: Monsanto remains strong in agriculture, but its competition is increasing.</p><p>TOM BRAKEL, METHA PARTNERS: The competitive landscape has changed in the agribusiness dramatically I think last week, when Astrazeneca and Novartis put their agribusiness together, creating a very large competitor also in the core protection area, which should be a concern for Monsanto.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FRANK: Analysts usually mention DuPont and Aspirin Behr of Germany as two companies big enough to buy all of Monsanto, and there is Pfizer, which now markets Celebrex with Monsanto.  If Pfizer loses its fight with American Home Products for Warner-Lambert, it might decide it has no choice but to go after Monsanto -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Allan Dodds Frank reporting.  Thank you.</p><p>Now to Wen Ho Lee.  Criminal charges tonight against the nuclear scientist accused of a security breach that rocked Washington.  CNN has learned that prosecutors have filed a 59-count indictment against Wen Ho Lee, who was arrested today.  The indictment charges him with mishandling classified information from the Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory.  Officials linked him to alleged Chinese attempts to steal U.S. nuclear secrets.  But Lee has not been charged with spying, and prosecutors now say lack of proof makes such a charge unlikely.  No reaction from China, where government offices are closed for the night.</p><p>And another story of suspected espionage topping our MONEYLINE news digest: U.S. investigators hope to find out whether an alleged Russian spy had inside help in bugging the State Department. Officials think it is possible, because Stanislav Gusev apparently needed more than one visit to plant the device, which also required maintenance.</p><p>Russia is finding a sympathetic ear in Beijing.  Jiang Zemin and Boris Yeltsin complained today about U.S. domination of world affairs. The leaders wrapped up a two-day summit, promising mutual support on Chechnya and Taiwan.</p><p>In Cuba, massive government choreographed demonstrations again, demanding the United States return a rescued Cuban boy.  Lawyers for 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez say they'll file papers requesting he be granted U.S. asylum.</p><p>Also today, the second deadly air accident for the military in just two days.  A U.S. C-130 crash-landed in Kuwait, attempting an emergency landing after its landing gear malfunctioned.  Three of the 96 on board were killed.</p><p>President Clinton today praised the peacetime bravery of the nation's military.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM J. CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We do not have to be at war for that to be dangerous work.  Most people have no earthly idea how dangerous it is to fly those fast planes, and to fire those powerful weapons and to undergo on rigorous training that they have to undergo.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VARNEY: And new information on another fatal crash, based on that controversial cockpit tape from EgyptAir flight 990.  Federal investigators say there's no evidence of an explosion or mechanical problems in the crew's conversations.</p><p>In a week when it seemed nothing went right for the U.S. in space, a success for a leading-edge commercial competitor.  Europe's new Ariane 5 rocket lifted off today from FrenchGuyana in Latin America on its first mission.  The smooth launch was a triumph for ArianeSpace, the European company leading the world's commercial satellite launch market.</p><p>There's much more coming up, and yes, you are watching MONEYLINE.</p><p>We'll be back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Here are some of the stocks hitting new 52-week lows today: Dave &amp; Buster's restaurant chain, Del Monte Foods, General Mills, U.S. Bancorp and Penzoil.</p><p>A major legal victory for gunmakers tonight.  A Connecticut judge dismissed a $100 million lawsuit brought by the city of Bridgeport against the gun industry.  The judge ruled the city has no standing to sue.  Today's dismissal doesn't mean that troubles of the industry are over.  Nineteen other suits are still working their way through the courts.</p><p>Still to come on MONEYLINE: financial stocks push the Dow industrials ahead.  Investors breathe a sigh of relief on another sign of low inflation.  But day traders not exactly celebrating, as the Nasdaq and Big Board look to tighten their trading rules.</p><p>Plus, from Gwyneth Paltrow and Elton John to these supermodels, LVMH brands catch the eyes of the rich and famous.  But will the love affair with this luxury goods empire last?  \"The Bottom Line\" still to come on MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: MONEYLINE continues.  Here again, Staurt Varney.</p><p>VARNEY: In tonight's headlines, defying predictions and even gravity, the Nasdaq blazes into record territory for the fourth time this week.</p><p>The big tech winner: another tiny company with no earnings but plenty of buzz.  FreeMarkets, the latest IPO firecracker.</p><p>And \"The Bottom Line\" on LVMH.  It sells luxury in a bottle and style in a bag.</p><p>But our top story tonight: a hard-charging rally on news that hit Wall Street before the opening bell.  Stocks pushed higher all across the board on an inflation-friendly economic report.  And they got an even bigger push late in the day as oil prices tumbled.</p><p>The Dow industrials jumped nearly 90 points, ending the day at 11,224.  Volume on the big board is strong at 987 million shares.</p><p>The Nasdaq hit its fourth record of the week and its 51st of the year, up another 26 to end at 3620.  Volume not as brisk as the past two sessions, which were record-setting, but still busy -- more than 1.6 billion shares.</p><p>The enthusiasm extended to the bond market.  The 30-year Treasury gained 22 ticks, the yield down to 6.16 percent.</p><p>The catalyst for this rally: just a .2 percent rise in producer prices last month.  And not counting energy and food, prices would have been flat.</p><p>Greg Clarkin joins us now from the New York Stock Exchange for more on today's run-up -- Greg.</p><p>CLARKIN: Well, Stuart, as you mentioned, the buying really accelerated in the final hour or so of trading.  Investors seizing on hopes the Federal Reserve will hold off on another interest rate hike. Now financial stocks were the big beneficiaries there, but one big loser did emerge after the bell, and that is Xerox.  The photocopying giant warned fourth-quarter earnings could be as much as 40 percent below Wall Street forecasts.  Xerox blames weak sales in the U.S. and Europe and the strong dollar.  And the stock really taking a beating in after-hours trading, down more than $4 for about a 15 to 18 percent drop on that stock.</p><p>Now back to today's regular session.  Losers on the big board ran neck and neck with winners.  The number of stocks hitting new 52-week highs, 87, versus the number of new lows, 324.  Some big Dow movers, IBM fell nearly $5 and has lost eight percent on earnings concerns. American Express and J.P. Morgan both surged.  General Electric gained another five, and ExxonMobil fell more than three as oil prices sank.</p><p>Light sweet crude fell 92 cents a barrel on word Iraq will resume oil exports in an oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.</p><p>That's going to do it from here, Stuart, let's send it back to you.</p><p>VARNEY: Greg, not much action in those big-name tech stocks today?  Nothing going on there at all?</p><p>CLARKIN: Exactly, Stuart, record number 51 for the Nasdaq this year was really made with the absence of the big-name tech stocks, with the exception of Sun Microsystems, which posted a nice gain.  But Dell, Cisco, Microsoft and Intel really just kind of floundering around a bit.  And analysts are saying that's what we've seen in the past couple of sessions, some of the strength in the Nasdaq really coming from the Internet-related stocks, the stocks that make equipment for the Internet as well as software and the like.  That's what really seems to be carrying the Nasdaq these days.</p><p>VARNEY: Greg Clarkin reporting from the big board.</p><p>Well, once again it was a week dominated by tech stocks.  While the Nasdaq composite bounded from record to record, the Dow actually lost ground, down a fraction on the week that is.  But the Nasdaq jumped nearly three percent and the S&amp;P 500 fell more than one percent. But for the second straight day, the biggest winners were not the old tech standbys but the new kids on the block.  IPO mania continues to grip investors, and the result has been some of the splashiest market debuts ever.  Today, business-to-business online auctioneer FreeMarkets went public at $48 a share.  It hit a high of $293.  It closed at $280.  That's a gain of 483 percent, a stunning debut, yes, just a day after VA Linux shattered all previous IPO records.</p><p>Steve Young has more on the latest IPO sensation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YOUNG (voice-over): Offering just an 11 percent slice to the public, FreeMarkets.com Friday triggered an IPO free fall that sent its stock spiralling higher.  It's corporate America's version of eBay, but it runs in reverse.  FreeMarkets lets big corporations get the lowest prices by having suppliers bid for the business.</p><p>ERIC YUPIN, BANKBOSTON ROBERTSON STEPHENS: It's going to change industry structures.  I mean, we believe it's going to lower procurement costs, it's going to lower product cost, and it's going to increase the capacity utilization and productivity of industries.  The ramifications of this kind of solution are extremely profound, hence the investor appetite and the multiples we're seeing, which will give rise to huge companies.</p><p>YOUNG: FreeMarkets is the first publicly traded company in the business-to-business Internet auction game, and the momentum as a so- called \"first mover\" is important.  But it has competition from a subsidiary of the EVS, and it's unclear if FreeMarkets' patent claims will keep other companies from copying its business model.  That's because the claims are pending, but they haven't been issued yet by the patent office.  The problem could affect other Internet IPOs in the pipeline.</p><p>JAMES IBESTER, GIBSON, DUNN &amp; CRUTCHER: This isn't just a FreeMarket issue.  This is an issue that's applicable to many, many of these offerings.  Until the patents not only have been issued by the patent office and then tested in the waters of the federal courts, it's going to be very difficult to assess the value of the patent protection people are able to get on essentially ways of doing business.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>YOUNG: The patent office has been bogged down by a flood of patent claims filed in the last year on doing business over the Internet.  That means it will be several years at least before investors know whether Internet companies with pending patents are nothing more than risky business -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: And we'll be waiting.  Steve Young reporting.</p><p>Well, FreeMarkets wasn't the day's only blockbuster IPO.  ESpeed, an electronic trading software maker that was spun off by Cantor Fitzgerald, that nearly doubled. El Sitio climbed more than 17 1/4.  That is a network of Web sites for Spanish and Portuguese speakers.  And eBenx more than doubled to close at 44 7/8.  That company makes software for paying medical bills online.</p><p>But for VA Linux, day two on Wall Street was far less profitable than day one.  Yesterday's IPO star was today's rather large loser. It was down 21 1/4.  However, if you were lucky enough to get the stock at the IPO price, you are still sitting on a 626 percent return. Investors cashed in on other Linux stocks as well.  Red Hat and Andover.net both slumped, Corel fell 8 3/4.  It was the most active stock on the Nasdaq.</p><p>Coming up, more on IPO mania.  We'll talk to a fund manager, Linda Killian, who's at the center of the IPO action.</p><p>And we'll hear what brought Elton John and Gwyneth Paltrow to a Manhattan soiree.  Could it have been the champagne?  We'll have \"The Bottom Line\" on that one for you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: It's been a breathtaking period to be in IPOs, and that's an understatement.  With FreeMarkets today coming out with its stunning issue, hot on the heels of yesterday's record-breaking showing from VA Linux, the average IPO is up nearly 200 percent this year, and Web-related issues have posted gains of 250 percent.</p><p>Our next guest has been at the heart of the action.  Her fund invests exclusively in IPOs, and her fund is up 97 percent this year. We're now joined by Linda Killian, manager of the IPO Plus Aftermarket Fund.</p><p>Linda, welcome back.</p><p>LINDA KILLIAN, IPO PLUS AFTERMARKET FUND: Thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: There's something I don't understand.  Just take VA Linux for example.  It comes out priced at $30 a share, it goes to 240.  Why wasn't it priced at 50 or 100 or 150?</p><p>KILLIAN: Pricing of IPOs is as much of an art as a science.  If they had in fact, the underwriters had priced it at 80, their entire book of orders may have disappeared.</p><p>VARNEY: May have, but we don't know that.  In the meantime, the company didn't get the money.  It was the underwriters who got the money, and the friends and family and insiders who held shares at the offering price, not the company.  They didn't get the money.</p><p>KILLIAN: You make a good point.  And that's why there are some people who advocate Dutch actions for IPOs.</p><p>VARNEY: Is that likely to come?</p><p>KILLIAN: There is one company that does the Dutch auction method and that's W.R. Hambrecht.  And they've done several deals.</p><p>VARNEY: Is there general dissatisfaction with the pricing of IPOs at this stage of the market?</p><p>KILLIAN: Not if you got in at the offering price.</p><p>VARNEY: Does your fund get in at the offering price?</p><p>KILLIAN: We buy both on the offering and in the aftermarket. That's why we're called the IPO Plus Aftermarket Fund.</p><p>VARNEY: Now, how are you able to get in at the market price, whereas an individual investors, like myself for example, could not.</p><p>KILLIAN: We are an institutional investor, and we also follow the companies very closely from a research standpoint.  We research every IPO that comes to market.  We have researched over 500 IPOs this year.  And from that standpoint, the IPOs themselves, the management of the company, would like to have investors such as ourselves who are basically longer-term holders of IPOs.</p><p>VARNEY: So they are pleasing you?</p><p>KILLIAN: Well, we hope so.</p><p>VARNEY: You are there to be pleased is, right?  Is that the way it is?</p><p>KILLIAN: We hope so.  There's tremendous demand for IPOs, and no investor, whether they're a powerful individual investors or a very large institutional investor, is ever going to get all the shares of an IPO they want.</p><p>VARNEY: How much longer is this going to go on for?</p><p>KILLIAN: That's a very good question.  Certainly we're seeing a very active pipeline for IPOs.  It's at about 200 that are expected to price during -- sometime during the first quarter.</p><p>I expect that the IPO market will continue to move along simply because there are so many very exciting companies that are in the pipeline, and there are so many businesses that are just poised to really start to flourish, like business-to-business activities on the Internet, genomics, I would say finance.com.  Those are just three of the areas that I think are very fruitful.</p><p>VARNEY: In your fund, though, you are allowed to short a stock, aren't you?  Like to short an IPO, you can do that?</p><p>KILLIAN: Yes, we can.</p><p>VARNEY: And in are you shorting some stocks, some IPOs, not in the three areas you mentioned?</p><p>KILLIAN: We believe in risk management at the IPO fund, and, therefore, what we do when we evaluate companies from a fundamental standpoint, when we identify companies that have particularly poor outlooks and business models, we put them on our list to short, and we do short stocks.</p><p>VARNEY: Fair enough.  Linda Killian, many thanks for being with us.</p><p>KILLIAN: Thank you.</p><p>VARNEY: OK.</p><p>Coming up on MONEYLINE, they have a reputation as cowboys who borrow huge sums of money and place risky bets on the market.  But are the rules about to change for day traders?  That story after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Now lets check some of tonight's other movers for you.</p><p>Home Depot up more than 1 1/2, and that's a new 52-week high. ING Barings raised its price target to $99 a share, based on the company's new merchandising efforts.</p><p>Ciena up 10 5/16.  The telecom equipment maker beat fourth- quarter profit estimates by a penny, and it said revenues could grow more than 50 percent next year.  And Lehmann Brothers upgraded its stock to a buy rating.</p><p>Nortel Networks up more than 5 1/2.  It will supply wireless network equipment to AT&amp;T, in a deal valued at $600 million.  The company would not comment on a \"Wall Street Journal\" article that said it may buy Qtera for $3 billion in stock.</p><p>And a strong day for the steel industry.  Lehmann Brothers upgraded several companies.  It cited rising steel prices, positive seasonal factors, and weak stock prices.</p><p>It was a Friday to celebrate on Wall Street, but some investors were not exactly in the mood.  In the hopes of limiting the risks associated with day trading, the boards of the NYSE and the parent of the Nasdaq stock market approved a plan to tighten day-trading requirements.</p><p>Fred Katayama has more on what it could all mean to this group of investors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATAYAMA (voice-over): At issue: What some regulators see as the excessive borrowing by day traders.  To curb the risks, the Big Board and the parent of the Nasdaq proposed rules to boost margin requirements for day traders, defined as those who buy and sell the same stock four times or more in five days.</p><p>AMY BUTTE, ANALYST, BEAR STERNS: It is going to be more expensive for people to become day traders.  Therefore, we should see a little bit of a dampening impact.</p><p>KATAYAMA: Specifically, the exchanges propose to dramatically boost the minimum balance day traders must keep in their account to $25,000 from 2,000.  If it falls below that level, they won't be allowed to trade.</p><p>(on camera): The proposed rules will not bar traders from lending money to each other to meet margin requirements, but it could make overnight lending more difficult.  Traders will not be allowed to withdraw funds for two business days.</p><p>HARVEY HOUTKIN, CEO, ALL-TECH DIRECT: The demonizing of people lending one another money seems almost ironic in a country that is built on free trade, banking, letters of credit, commercial paper, and everything else.</p><p>KATAYAMA (voice-over): Day trading has come under increasing scrutiny after day trader Mark Barton, who lost thousands of dollars, killed 12 people in Atlanta.  Day traders like John Picinich (ph) contend the proposed measures discriminate against them.</p><p>JOHN PICINICH, DAY TRADER: The more rules they impose, the worse it is for us.  I mean, we know what we got to do.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you limit a guy from doing what he wants? You should not be able to.  I mean, this is what America is all about.</p><p>KATAYAMA: The rules must be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KATAYAMA: There was one proposal the industry welcomed.  The exchanges offered to allow traders to borrow up to four times the amount of cash in their accounts, that's up from two times currently -- Stuart.</p><p>VARNEY: Fred Katayama reporting.  Thank you, Fred.</p><p>BellSouth is trying hard to capitalize on the wireless boom in Europe.  The regional phone company teamed up with KPN Telecom to buy Germany's number-three mobile phone operator.  BellSouth will take a $9 billion loan from KPN to purchase the rest of E-Plus shares it doesn't already own.</p><p>Earlier on CNNfn, BellSouth's chief executive said the deal is good news for shareholders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DUANE ACKERMAN, CHMN. AND CEO, BELLSOUTH: When you look at the German market, it's a very attractive market.  It's the ten-largest countries in Europe that's probably the lowest penetrated of all, so there's great opportunity for growth.  So we're really not looking at keeping anyone out.  We were simply looking at the deal that positioned our shareholders the best for the long haul. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VARNEY: Shares of BellSouth ended the day unchanged.  KPN Telecom soared 8 3/4.  But the deal is a blow to France Telecom, which sank 10 points.  It had already made an agreement to buy E-Plus, and said it will now review other options.</p><p>Other corporate headlines tonight: America Online jumped more than 6 1/2 to an all-time high after SalomonSmith Barney analyst Rick Church said a he expected AOL to unveil an alliance with Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart shares up 1 5/8.  AOL and Wal-Mart declined comment on the analyst's note.</p><p>On the drug front, American Home Products knocked down reports that it's looking to buy Pharmacia and Upjohn.  \"The Financial Times\" reported that AHP is eyeing Pharmacia as a fallback plan, in case it loses out on its bid for Warner-Lambert.  Pfizer has mounted a major challenge for Warner, but AHP says it's fully committed to that deal. AHP shares up more than 1 1/4.</p><p>Still to come on MONEYLINE: If it's European, expensive, and stylish, odds are LVMH makes it.  \"The Bottom Line\" on the ultimate status stock.</p><p>That's just ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: And now to our regular Friday feature, \"The Bottom Line.\" It's a segment that usually focuses on American companies on the move and in the news.  But tonight, we look at a European firm whose four initials are synonymous with luxury: LVMH, the French empire behind world-class brands like Moet Chandon, Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior, and run by a Frenchman known as one of Europe's most ruthless dealmakers.</p><p>Peter Viles has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER VILES, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He's known as the king of luxury, the pope of fashion, and this week in New York, Bernard Arnaud held court as only he can.</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: President Chiraq came up to me and said, you must attend the opening of the most fantastic building.</p><p>VILES: The building is the New York headquarters of Arnaud's luxury empire, LVMH, a monument to the worldwide popularity of luxury goods.  From Tokyo to Tampa, the world now wears Christian Dior, carries Louis Vuitton luggage and drinks Dom Perignon champagne -- all brands Arnaud has brought together in a run of ruthless dealmaking that belies his elegant image.</p><p>BERNARD ARNAUD, CHAIRMAN, LVMH: Oh yes, it's a lot of fun.  This is a business which is really completely different, because it's a mixture between creativity and organization, and I think that's what we are very much good at.</p><p>VILES: To the shock of the European elite, Arnaud brought in young designers like John Galliano to jump start aging labels.</p><p>JOHN: He's rejuvenated these labels -- Givenchy, Dior, and Louis Vuitton -- by hiring really smart, good, talented, young designers.  I mean, he really has turned it around.  I mean, Louis Vuitton was just a luggage label, all right, and now it does everything; it's one of the hippest labels around.</p><p>VILES: And when he goes shopping, Arnaud usually gets what he wants.  This year, he took over the British auction house Phillips, watchmakers Zenith International and Tag Heuer, the British shirtmaker Thomas Pink, and teaming with Prada, took a majority of the Italian fashion house Fendi.  He did fail, however, in his bid for Gucci, but is now said to have his eye now on Giorgio Armani and Calvin Klein.</p><p>DAVID VIMERCATI, SALOMONSMITH BARNEY: I think that LVMH will continue pursuing this growth-through-acquisition strategy, and of course, Mr. Arnaud has been seen talking to Armani and to other designers.</p><p>VILES (on camera): When Arnaud is not making designers offers they cannot refuse, he is rolling out new brands like this one, Sephora, a line of makeup stores that has quickly become LVMH's biggest online retail outlet as well.</p><p>(voice-over): What this all adds up to is an $8 billion-a-year company, supporting a stock that has more than doubled in the past year.</p><p>But can the run continue?  The answer lies partly in the strength of the Asian recovery.  Asia accounts for a third of LVMH sales.  LVMH trades in the U.S. as an ADR, which means it is thinly traded. Investors are also buying exposure to the euro currency.</p><p>European fund manager Scott Clemons has his doubts.</p><p>SCOTT CLEMONS, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN: We believe LVMH, although a very high-quality company and very well managed, no doubt, is nonetheless fully valued.  As a matter of fact, on our numbers, the shares are as expensive as some of the products they sell.</p><p>VILES: The other question is, how long will the global love affair with luxury last?  Even at ground zero in the fashion and luxury world, there are doubts about that.</p><p>PALTROW: I think it'll continue as long as the stock market's bullish.  But I think when that stops, the fascination will probably wane a little bit.</p><p>VILES: Peter Viles, CNN Financial News, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) VARNEY: Up next: \"Ahead of the Curve,\" just some of what you need to know tonight before the markets open next week.</p><p>You're watching MONEYLINE.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VARNEY: Checking some of what could move the markets next week: Investors will have another inflation report to look at on Tuesday with the release of the consumer price index.  Also due out: retail sales for November, the latest figures on the manufacturing and housing sectors and on international trade.</p><p>On the earnings front, several big-name firms expected to report include Oracle, FDX, Best Buy, Nike and Circuit City.</p><p>And keep an eye on Foundry Networks.  After the bell, they announced a two-for-one stock split.  The networking equipment maker went public just three months ago.  In after-hours trading, its stock soared more than 17 points, to $295 a share.</p><p>This programming note: Be sure to join us on Monday when we begin a two week special look at the new economy: Is it a boom without end?

Laura Kane, the firm's head of Americas thematic research, offers advice mostly centered around the patience investors should exhibit when deciding when to buy or sell. She also lays out how investors can avoid each of the five pitfalls she outlines. Investing based on themes requires patience and confidence, according to one of UBS's top researchers. </p><p>But actually abiding by those principles is easier said than done. Laura Kane \u2014 the head of Americas thematic research for the firm's chief investment office \u2014 recognizes this, and has compiled a list of five common mistakes made by thematic investors of all types[1]. She also lays out how investors can avoid each pitfall.1) Chasing fadsKane says it's vital to understand the difference between a long-term trend that's going to endure, and a fad that attracts tremendous hype and then fades almost as fast. Bitcoin, she says, is a fad. Meanwhile, changes in global demographics are an important trend in her view. Kane writes that as the global population is growing rapidly and concentrating in cities, while the populations in developed countries are aging. Those have major investing consequences. \"We will see the need for healthcare technologies to cope with an aging population, as well as demand for more energy-efficient infrastructure in growing emerging cities,\" she wrote. How UBS says investors can avoid this pitfall: Investors should focus on the three main \"inescapable forces\" that should transpire, regardless of the business cycle: Population growth \u2014 By 2050, the global population will have surged to 10 billion from 7.5 billion at present time. Aging \u2014 By 2030, individuals older than 60 will outnumber those 25 or younger in developed countries. Urbanization \u2014 By 2050, UBS expects that 68% of the world's population will live in cities.2) Being too earlyEveryone wants to be the first to identify a trend or a great trade, but there is often no advantage in being the first company to disrupt an industry. That means that, as an investor, you may not want to bet on a company that is shaking up a field because it might ultimately be beaten out by later competitors. After all, Amazon wasn't the first online bookseller[2], and if you'd invested in MySpace and passed on Facebook, you've probably been dealing with some regrets. Kane says that should be on investors' minds as they consider investing in ride-hailing companies ahead of the expected IPOs of Uber[3] and Lyft in the next few months[4]. \"The shape of the ride-hailing industry is still being defined, as many variables continue to evolve,\" she wrote.\"Until we get greater clarity on regulatory, liability, and even tax consequences, it will be difficult to choose winners in this space.\" How UBS says investors can avoid this pitfall: UBS says traders should let the dust settle in fledgling industries before making any specific decisions.3) Making just one betAn investor might be overwhelmingly confident about or interested in one single theme, but Kane says they shouldn't put all their eggs in one basket because that's likely to lead to volatility. If a trader insists upon a single theme, Kane recommends they be careful with the rest of their your portfolio to make sure its risks and rewards are well-balanced. How UBS says investors can avoid this pitfall: UBS says traders should diversify holdings so as not to get caught with outsized exposure to a failing idea.4) Not looking under the hoodThematic investors sometimes buy into any company that fits into their favored idea. But Kane says they need to look carefully at every company \u2014 especially if they're new. \"A company could be exposed to an attractive theme, but that does not automatically mean it is a good investment,\" she writes. In addition, Kane advises investors to look hard at issues like corporate governance and culture as well as financial measurements. How UBS says investors can avoid this pitfall: UBS said traders should do exhaustive homework on new entrants to industries and themes they're pursuing.5) Selling too soonKane writes that investors often sell too quickly because they're afraid of future pain. But that haste can cause them to miss out on eventual gains that might dwarf their present losses. \"The temptation is high to walk away from long-term ideas that temporarily underperform,\" she says. \"We advise against trying to jump in and out of long-term thematic investments.\" Kane adds that over the last six decades, a buy-and-hold strategy for the S...00[5] has worked much better than trying to time market highs and lows. That's illustrated by the chart below. Jeremy Grantham, the widely respected investor who successfully predicted the last two financial bubbles, has made a similar point[6]: In a market bubble, getting out of too soon can be just as bad as getting out too late.How UBS says investors can avoid this pitfall: UBS says traders shouldn't abandon a long-term theme because of modest setbacks. It could hurt them just as much to get out too early than wait too long to exit.

Investors in the Cannabis Care CopyPortfolio will get managed access to a group of leading biotech companies listed in North America specialising in medical cannabis.  Medical cannabis is a fast-growing industry following a series of regulatory changes which have increased access to marijuana. </p><p>Growth in the global legal cannabis market is being led by the US and Canada, however, Europe is also following suit. The industry is projected to reach $57 billion worldwide by 2027*.  Yoni Assia, CEO and Co-founder of eToro, comments: \u201cDespite the already impressive growth, many believe that the medical marijuana market is only just beginning to make its mark. The industry is expected to advance considerably in the next few years, as the legalisation of medical use around the world becomes more widespread and the number of adults living in legal use markets increases.\u201d      Today\u2019s news follows the initial launch in September which saw 1,000 clients invest in less than two weeks. The decision to re-open access to the CopyPortfolio follows significant demand from clients. It will close to new investors at midnight on the day that the CopyPortfolio reaches a total of 2,000 investors.    The Cannabis Care CopyPortfolio is managed by eToro\u2019s Investment Committee. The CopyPortfolio currently invests in 10 companies, including businesses which grow medical marijuana, develop cannabis-based pharmaceuticals, and other companies involved in the sector.  Yoni Assia added: \u201cOur aim is to make it as easy as possible for investors to access the assets they want. The demand for investment exposure to the rapidly growing medical cannabis industry is significant, as we saw with the popularity of this fund on launch. We\u2019re pleased to be able to offer more investors access to this industry.\u201cOur clients value diversification. Medical cannabis is a volatile industry and our Cannabis Care CopyPortfolio allows investors to diversify their exposure to the sector.\u201d  The CopyPortfolio carries a minimum investment level of $5,000, and sits alongside other market-themed CopyPortfolios available on the eToro platform, including CopyPortfolios for those wanting exposure to banks, big tech, cryptoassets, gaming companies, and genome engineering technology.     </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN942433220181027</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TKD-YW51-J9XT-P47V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"465\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 27, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Yet some investors are optimistic. They think its markets are cheap, and are waiting on a new wave of IPOs. Lawrence White reports</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AT THE END of 2010 and the beginning of this year, one negative story after another about Vietnam hit the headlines of the local and international media. On December 20, indebted state-owned shipbuilder Vinashin missed a $60 million principal payment to its creditors, revealing a long-suspected funding problem at the company. Three days later Standard &amp; Poor's followed Moody's and Fitch Ratings in cutting the country's long-term credit rating by one notch, having warned on December 13 that Vinashin's woes might affect the creditworthiness of some banks. Then, as fears about inflation developed, the government announced on February 11 that it was devaluing the dong by 8.5% against the US dollar. The IMF welcomed the move as necessary to close the gap between the official and black-market exchange rates but the market responded with unintended grim humour by immediately pushing the unofficial rate higher still. While the official rate moved from D18,932 to the dollar to D20,693, within five days the &amp;unofficial rate had climbed to D21,900.</p><p>As the Vinashin debacle developed, coverage in the local &amp;media exposed more problems at the company. The search for the individuals responsible had begun in August 2010 with the arrest of the chairman, Pham Thanh Binh. The ministry of public security announced in mid-February that it was investigating two former officials at the company - former director of Vinashin Finance Company Ho Ngoc Tung and his deputy, Trinh Thi Hau - for deliberate violation of state economic regulations that allegedly lost the company more than $3 million. On February 24 Vietnam cancelled a $9.8 billion project between Vinashin and Malaysia's Lion Group. As the bad news accumulated, murky details began to emerge. There were reports of further arrests and of officials in a Vinashin investment project buying mothballed, toxic, 50-year old equipment from a South Korean power plant.</p><p>Investors, regulators and the government are all worried by these revelations. The question they are all asking is \"how deep does the rot go?\" Vietnam's risk profile has been seriously affected, with the ratings agencies downgrading it and credit default swaps on the country's sovereign debt widening by about 80 basis points to 300bp by January 17 and to over 400bp by mid-February.</p><p>Calm optimists</p><p>Yet Vietnam's robust optimists are remaining calm. \"The CDS has gone over 400bp,\" says Nikhil Singh, equities head at Indochina Capital, \"but it's skewed because it's one of the few ways investors can hedge Vietnam risk. And you're still talking about a price level that's less than half what you'd pay to insure against Greece or Ireland.\"</p><p>Spending a week talking to bank executives, fund managers, individual investors and market authorities in Vietnam throws up a curious feeling of paradox. Almost everyone Euromoney spoke to talked with dismay or at best cheerful pessimism about the country's short-term economic problems but also universally recommended the country as a destination for investment.</p><p>It is easy to assume that this is akin to the desperation of a man who has only ice to sell suddenly finding himself transported to the Arctic. However, the situation is more complex. With a young, entrepreneurial population, a developing portfolio of good companies and a favourable geographical position for regional trade, Vietnam has developed into a country with excellent prospects. The problem is that the curses of hot money, governmental policy tinkering and global economic problems have conspired to make the country's stock index charts for the past 10 years resemble the peaks and troughs of a particularly dramatic mountain range. This is one of Asia's most exciting, but most risky, investment destinations.</p><p>Bad is good</p><p>When in November 2009 Euromoney visited the offices of Indochina Capital, one of the more prominent overseas investment firms active in Vietnam's southern financial hub, Ho Chi Minh City, the mood was of post-disaster clean-up. Interim manager of the equities division Beat Schuerch had been retained to deal with the fallout from the closure of the firm's Vietnam equities fund, following the crash that began in 2007 and continued for the next 18 months, wiping out all the gains from what had been Asia's best-performing equity index. Returning to the same firm in February this year, Euromoney is greeted by new equities head Nikhil Singh, who says the very fact that Vietnam has had a bad run lately makes this a good time to invest.</p><p>He says: \"I've just come out of a meeting with [listed, majority state-owned dairy company] Vinamilk, who are growing at something like 25% a year and are valued at a price/earnings ratio of just nine. There are good companies here with low market penetration and plenty of room to grow, if you look beyond the negative headlines.\"</p><p>Grabbing a flipchart used for presentations to investors, &amp;Singh makes his case. He cites four main attractions for investing in Vietnam. Valuations are at a four-year low, with an average P/E ratio of 43 in 2007 down to about 11; the drive to equitize (privatize) leading state-owned companies is set to resume; quotas on foreign ownership of companies and sectors are being filled up; and the best companies are growing strongly despite the economic headwinds.</p><p>The quotas, designed to make sure foreign investors cannot hold majority stakes in either specific companies or whole sectors, are part of the reason why investing in Vietnam holds practical difficulties aside from any concerns about macroeconomic or corporate governance issues. When Euromoney wrote about Vinamilk's listing in an April 2006 article presciently titled \"Vietnam's stock market: buckle up and proceed with caution\", it was noted that this IPO single-handedly almost doubled the market capitalization of the Ho Chi Minh stock exchange. The market is thin, and quotas for many of the best companies are almost full and seldom traded, meaning that the market is somewhat illiquid and prone to sudden lurches upwards and downwards. Furthermore, as reported in last month's issue, the effect of the opening of two Vietnam-focused offshore exchange-traded funds has been to drive up dramatically the valuations of the large-cap firms that these ETFs track.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\"There are good companies here with low market penetration and plenty of room to grow, if you look beyond the negative headlines\"Nikhil Singh, Indochina Capital</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Better prices</p><p>\"Vietnam's now very attractive in terms of pricing, compared with 2007 when the [Ho Chi Minh] index was around 1,200,\" says Pham Ngoc Bich, head of research and investment advisory at local securities firm SSI. \"Now it is down at 500, P/E ratios are around 10. If you look at the market-cap weighted average, it's around 20 times because the big-cap stocks have rocketed, but if you remove those five to 10 largest stocks, this is one of the cheapest markets in the region.\"</p><p>Part of the problem with Vietnam has always been its shallow markets. The lack of attractive listed stocks is made worse by the speculative approach to stock trading that local retail investors take. Gold and real estate are seen as long-term investments and equities as a way to make quick money when the markets boom. Add to this mix the tendency for foreign capital to wash in and out of the country in large, fast-moving waves and you have the recipe for a volatile market in which it is hard to build a long-term, diversified portfolio. Vietnam needs more companies to list.</p><p>Vinashin's default highlighted the problems that afflict the least efficient of Vietnam's state-owned enterprises. Market participants hope its troubles will work in reverse and encourage the speedy resumption of the programme to list SOEs that was put on hold during the crisis.</p><p>\"There are over 1,000 SOEs,\" says SSI's Pham Ngoc Bich, \"and the only long-term solution to the issue of their inefficiency is to privatize. That process slowed down over the past two years; everyone's hoping it will resume.\"</p><p>Indochina Capital identifies at least 60 SOEs with approved privatization plans, including crown jewels such as the bank BIDV, Vietnam Airlines, and tourism firms Hanoitourist and Saigontourist. The question is whether or not the government will push through these listings soon, given the uncertain macro&amp;economic climate.</p><p>Strategic plan</p><p>\"We've completed our strategic plan for the next five years,\" says Linh H Nguyen, director in the strategy and international cooperation department at Hanoi Stock Exchange, \"which includes raising our market capitalization to 20% of GDP. But that might be tough given the sluggish economy. Once the new securities law comes into effect in July, that will improve listing requirements in such areas as corporate governance and disclosure, which should lead to more listings of a higher quality.\"</p><p>It might be difficult to convince investors to support the partial listing of even the most solid-seeming state-owned companies. Vinashin is seen as an outlier, unusually poorly managed and unlucky to see its core business of shipbuilding hammered as the price of new ships crashed in the crisis. The real issue, says VinaCapital's head of investment, Andy Ho, is that the company's recent failings have made potential investors question the quality of management at other SOEs.</p><p>\"Most big businesses are in some way conglomerates,\" Ho says. \"Consider Samsung, LG, most of the big tech groups... diversification from your core business is not a problem if you have the resources and skill to manage it. Vietnam's SOEs need to work out how better to train and incentivize managers.\"</p><p>Until then, says Ho, investors are right to be cautious.</p><p>See also<br/><br/>Vietnam and Cambodia's dollar aversion<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:52R9-F401-F0J6-S3GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"04\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>April 2011</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00073V9</classCode><className>FITCH RATINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS561450 CREDIT BUREAUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS523999 MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS522390 OTHER ACTIVITIES RELATED TO CREDIT INTERMEDIATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC8732 COMMERCIAL ECONOMIC, SOCIOLOGICAL, &amp;

Yet some investors are optimistic. They think its markets are cheap, and are waiting on a new wave of IPOs. Lawrence White reports</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AT THE END of 2010 and the beginning of this year, one negative story after another about Vietnam hit the headlines of the local and international media. On December 20, indebted state-owned shipbuilder Vinashin missed a $60 million principal payment to its creditors, revealing a long-suspected funding problem at the company. Three days later Standard &amp; Poor's followed Moody's and Fitch Ratings in cutting the country's long-term credit rating by one notch, having warned on December 13 that Vinashin's woes might affect the creditworthiness of some banks. Then, as fears about inflation developed, the government announced on February 11 that it was devaluing the dong by 8.5% against the US dollar. The IMF welcomed the move as necessary to close the gap between the official and black-market exchange rates but the market responded with unintended grim humour by immediately pushing the unofficial rate higher still. While the official rate moved from D18,932 to the dollar to D20,693, within five days the \u00adunofficial rate had climbed to D21,900.</p><p>As the Vinashin debacle developed, coverage in the local \u00admedia exposed more problems at the company. The search for the individuals responsible had begun in August 2010 with the arrest of the chairman, Pham Thanh Binh. The ministry of public security announced in mid-February that it was investigating two former officials at the company - former director of Vinashin Finance Company Ho Ngoc Tung and his deputy, Trinh Thi Hau - for deliberate violation of state economic regulations that allegedly lost the company more than $3 million. On February 24 Vietnam cancelled a $9.8 billion project between Vinashin and Malaysia's Lion Group. As the bad news accumulated, murky details began to emerge. There were reports of further arrests and of officials in a Vinashin investment project buying mothballed, toxic, 50-year old equipment from a South Korean power plant.</p><p>Investors, regulators and the government are all worried by these revelations. The question they are all asking is \"how deep does the rot go?\" Vietnam's risk profile has been seriously affected, with the ratings agencies downgrading it and credit default swaps on the country's sovereign debt widening by about 80 basis points to 300bp by January 17 and to over 400bp by mid-February.</p><p>Calm optimists</p><p>Yet Vietnam's robust optimists are remaining calm. \"The CDS has gone over 400bp,\" says Nikhil Singh, equities head at Indochina Capital, \"but it's skewed because it's one of the few ways investors can hedge Vietnam risk. And you're still talking about a price level that's less than half what you'd pay to insure against Greece or Ireland.\"</p><p>Spending a week talking to bank executives, fund managers, individual investors and market authorities in Vietnam throws up a curious feeling of paradox. Almost everyone Euromoney spoke to talked with dismay or at best cheerful pessimism about the country's short-term economic problems but also universally recommended the country as a destination for investment.</p><p>It is easy to assume that this is akin to the desperation of a man who has only ice to sell suddenly finding himself transported to the Arctic. However, the situation is more complex. With a young, entrepreneurial population, a developing portfolio of good companies and a favourable geographical position for regional trade, Vietnam has developed into a country with excellent prospects. The problem is that the curses of hot money, governmental policy tinkering and global economic problems have conspired to make the country's stock index charts for the past 10 years resemble the peaks and troughs of a particularly dramatic mountain range. This is one of Asia's most exciting, but most risky, investment destinations.</p><p>Bad is good</p><p>When in November 2009 Euromoney visited the offices of Indochina Capital, one of the more prominent overseas investment firms active in Vietnam's southern financial hub, Ho Chi Minh City, the mood was of post-disaster clean-up. Interim manager of the equities division Beat Schuerch had been retained to deal with the fallout from the closure of the firm's Vietnam equities fund, following the crash that began in 2007 and continued for the next 18 months, wiping out all the gains from what had been Asia's best-performing equity index. Returning to the same firm in February this year, Euromoney is greeted by new equities head Nikhil Singh, who says the very fact that Vietnam has had a bad run lately makes this a good time to invest.</p><p>He says: \"I've just come out of a meeting with [listed, majority state-owned dairy company] Vinamilk, who are growing at something like 25% a year and are valued at a price/earnings ratio of just nine. There are good companies here with low market penetration and plenty of room to grow, if you look beyond the negative headlines.\"</p><p>Grabbing a flipchart used for presentations to investors, \u00adSingh makes his case. He cites four main attractions for investing in Vietnam. Valuations are at a four-year low, with an average P/E ratio of 43 in 2007 down to about 11; the drive to equitize (privatize) leading state-owned companies is set to resume; quotas on foreign ownership of companies and sectors are being filled up; and the best companies are growing strongly despite the economic headwinds.</p><p>The quotas, designed to make sure foreign investors cannot hold majority stakes in either specific companies or whole sectors, are part of the reason why investing in Vietnam holds practical difficulties aside from any concerns about macroeconomic or corporate governance issues. When Euromoney wrote about Vinamilk's listing in an April 2006 article presciently titled \"Vietnam's stock market: buckle up and proceed with caution\", it was noted that this IPO single-handedly almost doubled the market capitalization of the Ho Chi Minh stock exchange. The market is thin, and quotas for many of the best companies are almost full and seldom traded, meaning that the market is somewhat illiquid and prone to sudden lurches upwards and downwards. Furthermore, as reported in last month's issue, the effect of the opening of two Vietnam-focused offshore exchange-traded funds has been to drive up dramatically the valuations of the large-cap firms that these ETFs track.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\"There are good companies here with low market penetration and plenty of room to grow, if you look beyond the negative headlines\"Nikhil Singh, Indochina Capital</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Better prices</p><p>\"Vietnam's now very attractive in terms of pricing, compared with 2007 when the [Ho Chi Minh] index was around 1,200,\" says Pham Ngoc Bich, head of research and investment advisory at local securities firm SSI. \"Now it is down at 500, P/E ratios are around 10. If you look at the market-cap weighted average, it's around 20 times because the big-cap stocks have rocketed, but if you remove those five to 10 largest stocks, this is one of the cheapest markets in the region.\"</p><p>Part of the problem with Vietnam has always been its shallow markets. The lack of attractive listed stocks is made worse by the speculative approach to stock trading that local retail investors take. Gold and real estate are seen as long-term investments and equities as a way to make quick money when the markets boom. Add to this mix the tendency for foreign capital to wash in and out of the country in large, fast-moving waves and you have the recipe for a volatile market in which it is hard to build a long-term, diversified portfolio. Vietnam needs more companies to list.</p><p>Vinashin's default highlighted the problems that afflict the least efficient of Vietnam's state-owned enterprises. Market participants hope its troubles will work in reverse and encourage the speedy resumption of the programme to list SOEs that was put on hold during the crisis.</p><p>\"There are over 1,000 SOEs,\" says SSI's Pham Ngoc Bich, \"and the only long-term solution to the issue of their inefficiency is to privatize. That process slowed down over the past two years; everyone's hoping it will resume.\"</p><p>Indochina Capital identifies at least 60 SOEs with approved privatization plans, including crown jewels such as the bank BIDV, Vietnam Airlines, and tourism firms Hanoitourist and Saigontourist. The question is whether or not the government will push through these listings soon, given the uncertain macro\u00adeconomic climate.</p><p>Strategic plan</p><p>\"We've completed our strategic plan for the next five years,\" says Linh H Nguyen, director in the strategy and international cooperation department at Hanoi Stock Exchange, \"which includes raising our market capitalization to 20% of GDP. But that might be tough given the sluggish economy. Once the new securities law comes into effect in July, that will improve listing requirements in such areas as corporate governance and disclosure, which should lead to more listings of a higher quality.\"</p><p>It might be difficult to convince investors to support the partial listing of even the most solid-seeming state-owned companies. Vinashin is seen as an outlier, unusually poorly managed and unlucky to see its core business of shipbuilding hammered as the price of new ships crashed in the crisis. The real issue, says VinaCapital's head of investment, Andy Ho, is that the company's recent failings have made potential investors question the quality of management at other SOEs.</p><p>\"Most big businesses are in some way conglomerates,\" Ho says. \"Consider Samsung, LG, most of the big tech groups... diversification from your core business is not a problem if you have the resources and skill to manage it. Vietnam's SOEs need to work out how better to train and incentivize managers.\"</p><p>Until then, says Ho, investors are right to be cautious.</p><p>See also<br/><br/>Vietnam and Cambodia's dollar aversion<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:533K-MY51-F0J6-S3HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1615\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"04\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>April 2011</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00073V9</classCode><className>FITCH RATINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS561450 CREDIT BUREAUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS523999 MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS522390 OTHER ACTIVITIES RELATED TO CREDIT INTERMEDIATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC8732 COMMERCIAL ECONOMIC, SOCIOLOGICAL, &amp;

The Nasdaq Composite   It was the worst day for stocks since June. Stocks erased all their gains after a huge bout of exuberance Wednesday, when the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) \u2014 the broadest measure of Wall Street \u2014 and the Nasdaq hit yet another record high. The Nasdaq had also climbed above 12,000 points for the first time in history Wednesday. But it didn't stick. Thursday was the Nasdaq's largest one-day decline from a record high in its history, according to Bespoke Investment Group. All three major indexes finished the day sharply lower. The Nasdaq closed down nearly 5%, and the S&amp;P fell 3.5%, while the Dow finished 2.8%, or 808 points, lower. So, what happened? For one, the the other two major stock indexes \u2014 the Dow (INDU) and the S&amp;P 500 (SPX) \u2014 for months. The rally has been going on for long enough that investors are now taking profit. Even so, the Nasdaq remains up nearly 28% in 2020, still far outpacing its counterparts. The Dow, which only recently turned positive for the year, is back in the red. \"Although there is no single driver for the weakness, it seems as if investors all of a sudden realized how overbought stocks are and sold. Someone yelled fire in a crowded theater and everyone left at once,\" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, in emailed comments. But there are also technical reasons for Thursday's decline: As US-China relations sour, investors are moving money out of tech, which could get hit the hardest from a potential increase in tariffs. \"The Nasdaq is getting hit hard with the continued rotation into cyclicals and expectations big-tech will ultimately pay the cost to a further deterioration with US-Chinese relations,\" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. Stocks in cyclical sectors are expected to perform better as the economy is recovering. The Big Tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), all of which are part of the Nasdaq, have become the safe-haven investment of the summer. But investors have beginning to wonder when the rally will run out of steam, either because of increased regulation or because the economy as a whole picks up enough to void the need for safety picks altogether. \"It's a bit of a wake-up call, which isn't the worst thing in the world. Markets go up and down,\" JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, told CNN Business. Tech stocks were among Thursday's worst performers. Given the summer rally, it's \"perfectly normal,\" to see tech stocks readjusting a bit, Detrick said. But even investors who are still faithful to their safe tech holdings have reason to be a little concerned: Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, told CNN Thursday that a Covid-19 vaccine by October remained \"unlikely,\" though it was possible. Making matters worse, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said late Wednesday that \"the cooperative spirit we had in March and April\" on Capitol Hill has \"dissipated as we move closer and closer to the election.\" This doesn't bode well for Congress agreeing on another stimulus bill, which the market has been hoping for.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42994713518</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RY-2X21-F07F-853V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"578\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 4, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC000858D</classCode><className>LPL FINANCIAL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>SIC6289 SERVICES ALLIED WITH THE EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES OR COMMODITIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

As a Federal Reserve meeting loomed, talk of tariffs between the US, the European Union and China also escalated during the week, helping drive markets lower on Thursday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Vix, an equity volatility gauge based on the S&amp;amp;P 500, rose from 15 last Friday to 23 on Thursday, a sharp increase.</p><p>On Wednesday, new Fed chair <person><nameText>Jerome Powell </nameText></person>raised the Federal Funds rate by 25bp, while indicating that the Fed could raise rates three times in 2019 and twice in 2020.</p><p>\"We think the Fed meeting had quite a hawkish flavour to be honest,\" said Antoine Porcheret, equity derivatives strategist at BNP Paribas in London.</p><p>Reaction to the meeting was mixed, both from the strategists that spoke to GlobalCapital, and in equity markets themselves.</p><p>The Dow Jones industrial average initially went up after the announcement, but then erased any gains, opening 1.1% lower the next day. The S&amp;amp;P 500 opened 0.8% lower from close on Thursday, and was down a further 0.8% at 7pm UK time. The dollar weakened against the euro and pound in the immediate aftermath of the meeting, but then regained those losses the next day. Strategists were tracking the currency pairs as a more expensive currency follows higher rates, all else being equal.</p><p>Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at Natixis, said that the the escalating trade war between the US and other countries, as well as the big tech selloff, were factors in equity weakness, but not the biggest market concern.</p><p>\"The main factor behind weaker equity prices has been the Fed, and the concern that higher interest rates and the removal of liquidity will have potentially profound negative implications for GDP growth,\" he added.</p><p>Herv\u00e9 Guyon, equity derivatives flow strategies and solutions Europe at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in London, took the opposite view, saying that the meeting was actually more dovish than had been priced in by the market. He noted that the dollar traded lower immediately after the meeting.</p><p>\"The market is not observing any clear signs of accelerating inflation, so the implication is that the Fed doesn't think it's behind the curve with rate hikes,\" he said.</p><p>Many GlobalCapital sources were generally careful not to attribute equity market weakness on Thursday to any one factor, noting that reverberations from the suffering tech sector and more talk of tariffs from US president Donald Trump had all contributed to the jitters.Thumbs down</p><p>The news that Cambridge Analytica, a big data political consultancy, may have harvested data from millions of Facebook profiles to support political efforts attracted widespread public criticism and sparked fresh calls for reigning in and regulating big tech companies this week. Facebook's share price fell by more than 10% since last Friday's close, as investors considered the implications for a tech sector that has delivered incredible returns over the past two years.</p><p>Guyon noted that Facebook and other tech companies could also face harsher taxes in Europe, as the European Commission this week reveals a 3% tax for the sector.</p><p>\"There is also clearly regulation to come regarding the responsibility of tech companies to protect user data, which will increase costs,\" he said. \"However, they still have huge potential, especially since they are well positioned to take advantage of developments in AI.\"</p><p>Both Porcheret and Guyon noted that now would be a good time for derivatives players to sell the correlation between big tech companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook.</p><p>\"Over the past year they [big tech companies] have been very correlated, but new regulations and taxes would likely affect these companies differently,\" said Porcheret.</p><p>Investors can take this exposure by selling a correlation swap, making a return if realised correlation is below a specific strike price. They can also buy volatility on single names like Facebook, while selling volatility on a basket or index that encompasses the whole sector.</p><p>One equity analyst told GlobalCapital on Tuesday that a new \"regulatory\" premium was being priced into big tech He added that he had been \"cautious\" on technology stocks for the last six months for this reason.</p><p>\"The market will be much more on our side on this risk,\" he added.Trump Trade</p><p>Fears about a full-blown trade war between the US, the EU and China also severely spooked markets this week. Investors scrambled for ways to gain upside or hedge their positions as the situation developed.</p><p>President Trump on Thursday announced tariff action against China for intellectual property violations.</p><p>Guyon told GlobalCapital that Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has designed an index allowing investors to short a global basket of stocks likely to be affected by the trade war, adding that it had received significant interest from portfolio managers.</p><p>\"It includes names from the metal and mining sectors and auto industries,\" he added.</p><p>Porcheret was sceptical about creating broader exposure to the trade war, telling GlobalCapital that academic research concluded that there were no \"serious comparisons to be made historically\" to the situation, making it difficult to position correctly.</p><p>\"There is of course a consensus that tariffs will be bad for economic growth and the free flow of capital, but any conclusions should focus on the micro level impact, rather than the macro level,\" he added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROWK-b17fvh3ml2hrwr</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROWK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2G-S3W1-F0GS-H3VV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318064</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"916\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global Capital Euroweek</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 22, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002M0M</classCode><className>BNP PARIBAS SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009TCH</classCode><className>NATIXIS SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00083FD</classCode><className>SOCIETE GENERALE SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The one being triggered by the coronavirus pandemic will be the same. \"The Covid-19 impact has hit firms across the world - there's been immense international disruption - with many sectors experiencing major issues of supply, demand, or both.\"However there remain some sections of the economy which are benefitting from the coronavirus fallout.\"He continues: \"Sensibly, investors are now actively seeking these 'new world' sectors and companies in order to grow and protect their wealth. \"This is evidenced by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index which has done well, where other global indices have faltered.\"New industries will come into their own and, as ever, there will be winners and losers. </p><p>This will mean job losses in some sectors and huge - possibly unprecedented - job and investment opportunities in others.\"Last week, in a media release, Nigel Green noted that a Covid-19 recession is likely \"to fundamentally shift how we live, do business and invest.\" He added that it could also be expected to \"speed up the Fourth Revolution, which is fuelled by new technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence and mobile supercomputing.\"Mr Green goes on to say: \"Big tech is just one likely winner. The likes of Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Google's parent company Alphabet have immense cash reserves to continue, maybe even bolster, research and development and to sustain their business operations.\"This sector is also likely to face higher demand as social distancing, isolation and quarantine affect much of its existing and potential consumer base.\"Plus, recently heightened regulatory restrictions and political opposition to their expansion and growth of influence is likely to be scaled back considerably.\"He adds: \"For similar and other reasons, other sectors besides the Silicon Valley giants, are likely to continue to offer positives for investors. \"These include pharmaceutical and healthcare firms, delivery brands, supermarkets and manufacturers of electronic goods, such as fridges and freezers.\"Nigel Green concludes: \"Of course, there will be a recovery from the global economic impact of coronavirus. \"But the world has already changed as a result of it - and will do so more - and savvy investors are aware of this new normal and are already readjusting their portfolios accordingly.\"Times of immense tumult can be times of great ingenuity, promise and opportunity.\"e:<br/>t: +44 207 1220 925<br/>Twitter: @PriorConsultsdeVere Group is one of the world's largest independent advisors of specialist global financial solutions to international, local mass affluent, and high-net-worth clients.

Alibaba and Facebookhave done the same in recent days. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has returned to record territory, up 8 percent since the end of April. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average remain 4.3 percent and 6.8 percent off the records they set on Jan. 26. </p><p>  The rally has come as the global economy shows signs of strain. Fears of a trade war have made investors anxious; emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies have all sold off; and economic data in some regions has softened in recent weeks.</p><p>  ''In an uncertain world with significant downside economic tail risks, technology has been seen to be, correctly, relatively stable,'' Peter Oppenheimer and Guillaume Jaisson, strategists at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a recent report.</p><p>  Such economic uneasiness in the years since the financial crisis had caused investors to pour money into the sector. The likes of Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple have come to be viewed as having nearly unassailable revenue streams that could deliver growth in most economic conditions. With interest rates at historic lows and economic growth lackluster, investors have found that appealing.</p><p>  ''Investors have been well served by the current global dominance of American tech companies, and yet there is plenty of chatter about changing this winning approach,'' Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, said in a recent note.</p><p>  In March, some of the best-performing tech stocks began to struggle. Facebook's handling of user data in the Cambridge Analytica scandal contributed to a backlash against the size and reach of the biggest tech companies and raised concerns that regulators may soon crack down on these firms.</p><p>  The pullback was a rare dip for a sector that had risen consistently for the past several years. Since stock markets in the United States bottomed out in March 2009, shares of Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet have all gained more than 500 percent; Netflixis up 6,500 percent. The S.&amp;P. 500 has risen about 300 percent over that period.</p><p>  How long can the biggest tech stocks dominate the market? For a while, Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson said. They pointed out that earnings and sales growth, not a speculative increase in valuations, have driven the post-financial crisis run-up.</p><p>  ''Unlike the technology mania of the 1990s, most of this success can be explained by strong fundamentals, revenues and earnings rather than speculation about the future,'' Mr. Oppenheimer and Mr. Jaisson wrote.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-387460180606</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SGV-Y081-JBG3-611R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"453\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/business/dealbook/tech-stocks-economic-uncertainty.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/business/dealbook/tech-stocks-economic-uncertainty.html</url><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 6, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001YLV</classCode><className>NVIDIA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

But only in August, when the Democrat ticket is finalised, can investors begin to second guess the impact of US elections. On Monday, polls showed that challenger Joe Biden's lead over Donald Trump had widened (RealClearPolitics' 'RCP Average' has Biden at +9 per cent), making his choice of running mate even more pertinent for asset markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One thing is certain: Mr Biden will be standing alongside a woman, and it's likely she'll have a minority ethnic background - with odds for former ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice (7:2), California Representative Karen Bass (6:1) and Illinois Rep. and Iraq war veteran Tammy Duckworth (8:1) narrowing the gap on bookies' favourite, California senator Kamala Harris (evens), at the start of the week.</p><p>Given that 77-year-old Mr. Biden would be the oldest president in history, there is much conjecture that his deputy will have an expanded role. Although discussions around whether she'll be a left-winger don't necessarily focus on predilections to fiscal largesse - after $3 trillion in federal government stimulus (and a further $1.2 trillion under discussion) to support the economy through Covid-19, that horse has bolted - the approach to tax and regulation will be paramount.</p><p>Speaking at the Legg Mason Global asset management forum, Margaret Vitrano, large-cap equity portfolio manager at ClearBridge Investments, highlighted some estimates that reversing President Trump's cuts to corporation tax could shave 15 per cent off S&amp;P 500 earnings, although such action would require legislative approval in the two congressional houses.</p><p>Republicans currently have a majority in the Senate and the Democrats control the House of Representatives, so the balance is finely poised. If Mr Biden is elected president, but the Republicans retain control of the upper house in Congress, then the scope for tax cuts is greatly reduced.</p><p>Such an outcome would possibly be the most market positive, says Clearbridge investment strategist Jeffrey Schulze: \"A Biden win and a Republican Senate could be a bullish short-term event. The outlook would improve for international trade, possibly with China but definitely with Europe, and the risk of higher taxes would be off the table.\"</p><p>In any case, even if there was a clean sweep for the Democrats, the positive case for Mr Schulze is that \"Biden may not pull the lever on tax rises as he'd need to prioritise recovery and economic growth\".</p><p>The most compelling reason not to raise taxes, in his view, are estimates that taking corporation tax back up to 28 per cent would only raise $70-$130bn a year for the US Treasury anyway - \"a drop in the bucket\" compared to the $4trn budget deficit forecast this year - so the benefits are marginal.</p><p>Overall, however, Mr Schulze is cautious should the 50:50 chance of a Democrat sweep come to pass. He would not be surprised to see Democrats push for a partial reversal of corporation tax cuts (perhaps taking them back to 25 per cent, if not the full 28 per cent), albeit these would be pushed back a year or so and he would expect the S&amp;P 500 to take a 5-10 per cent haircut.</p><p>Perhaps a greater threat of a strong Democrat mandate is in regulation. Although she has dropped back to 16-1 to be running mate, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is a long-time advocate of challenging the monopolistic practices of big tech firms.</p><p>                     Big Tech in Washington                   </p><p>This week, the chief executives of Apple (US:AAPL), Amazon (US:AMZN), Google's parent Alphabet (US:GOOGL) and Facebook (US:FB.) are standing in front of Congress being questioned on their competitive practices. The prospect of antitrust legislation casts a shadow over their future.</p><p>Investors will be all too aware that a high proportion of profits growth for the S&amp;P 500 has been concentrated in the tech behemoths and, with Q2 2020 results being reported by Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon this week, there should be another reminder of their importance.</p><p>                     Pharma and healthcare                   </p><p>Pharmaceutical and healthcare companies have also been subject to political risk. Ever since Hillary Clinton's drug price tweets in 2016, they have been \"walking around with a target on their back\" says Ms Vitrano. There is a recognition, however, that the Covid-19 crisis has shown the value of a strong research and manufacturing base in the country and possibly these companies could find the Democrats a more benign prospect than had they won four years ago.</p><p>When Joe Biden won the Democrat nomination from Bernie Sanders, MediCare4All - a state backed health funding scheme with no need for private insurance - was taken off the table as a policy option. Mr Biden prefers gradual evolution of the old Obamacare, so the risk to the industry has subsided significantly.</p><p>MediCare4All was of greatest threat to insurance-funded hospital and care-home models, and in 2017 drugs were only around 14 per cent of the US healthcare market. That said, the industry will still benefit from drug pricing slipping down the political agenda as policymakers focus on dealing with Covid-19.</p><p>If anything, the pandemic is a chance for drug manufacturers to improve their public relations and Geoffrey Hsu, manager of The Biotechnology Growth Trust (BIOG), said in his fund's annual presentation that companies he'd spoken with intended to generously price products that could help fight Covid-19.</p><p>President Trump's answer to drug price inflation was to remove red tape in the approval process and this decision has helped to bring products to market quickly and keep the lid on prices. Unforgettably, Mr Trump's assertions about the science behind bleach as a cure for coronavirus earned strong ridicule - but his policies have helped to expedite what was already a strong pipeline of drugs.</p><p>Overall, Mr Hsu rates a Biden presidency with a split Congress as the most positive outcome for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Since Bernie Sanders threw in the towel, arguably the industry's worst-case scenario of a Democratic clean sweep of presidency and both houses of congress should no longer be viewed so negatively.</p><p>What this view doesn't allow for is a left-wing Vice President, however. No doubt Republican strategists will focus on Mr Biden's age and who might provide the real energy and drive should the Democrats win. Medicare4All is supported by Kamala Harris, Karen Bass and Elizabeth Warren, so future impetus to the policy can't be ruled out.</p><p>Led by a man who will be turning eighty by the mid-terms, it isn't unreasonable to expect that a Vice President would call significant shots. It's not inconceivable he could die of natural causes in office. Certainly, we could expect that his vice would be groomed to run after one term and that is where candidates more from the Sanders wing of the Democrat party could pose the threat of greater regulation to some industries, if they also enjoyed control of Congress.</p><p>                     Battle over health and economic narratives to dominate election run-in                    </p><p>More immediately, the confusing aspect for investors will be cutting through the noise as mudslinging commences in what will be a brutally fought campaign. While this week's congressional hearings into big tech are primarily about competition, it won't be lost on Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg how damaging any repeat of the Cambridge Analytica scandal - the small research firm that in 2018 was found to have breached Facebook user security to harvest data for political advertisers - would be to his company.</p><p>Reporting in traditional media is partisan too, which could have the consequence of making people less bold about going out and partaking in normal activities - in turn weighing on economic recovery. Initial positive data after states exited lockdown has been dampened; notably the US weekly unemployment claims have once again risen above 1.4m and 32m people were collecting jobless benefits at the start of July.</p><p>As for the virus, cases and deaths are rising but the death rate per confirmed case is dramatically lower in California, Texas and Florida than it was in New York. The loss of life is still tragic but as better treatment methods are being practiced and older people are practising social distancing more effectively, the burden on health services is more manageable.</p><p>That's not to be flippant about a 7-day rolling average death rate that nationally has almost doubled in three weeks and now runs at over 900 per day, but the fear of being overwhelmed has been replaced with an impassioned debate over the trade-off between safety and the need to get the economy up and running again.</p><p>The situation is not the same as in March, says John Bellows, fixed income portfolio manager at Western Asset, when the fear was not knowing whether the virus could be contained or managed. Along with that uncertainty factor he puts the velocity of markets selling off earlier in the year down to the US Treasury market breaking down, but gives the Federal Reserve credit for stepping in and safeguarding the financial system.</p><p>The V-shaped economic recovery that started in April has been stopped in its tracks and Mr Bellows sees a far more gradual recovery and higher unemployment as the US loses 5-6 per cent of economic activity. That won't come back overnight as the virus has made people more cautious.</p><p>In the meantime, however, the federal reserve is continuing to pump money into bond markets, and Mr Bellows does see an opportunity in investment grade credit. Spreads are still wider than a year ago and the fed is prepared to provide whatever bridging funding lines corporates need to get through the crisis, so a great-risk reward in quality corporate bonds is materialising.</p><p>Should spreads widen meaningfully, the Fed could double or triple its buying programme, as it is committed to taking the volatility out of credit markets. Given there is still material upside, investment grade corporate credit is a \"very interesting asset class\", in Mr Bellows' view.</p><p>This week the Federal Reserve open market committee is meeting to discuss next steps. Chair Jay Powell's signal that they aren't even thinking about raising rates was described by Mr Schulze as making his predecessors Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who were famous exponents of monetary easing after the financial crisis, look like the infamously hawkish Paul Volcker.</p><p>Most likely, the Fed will continue to signal how dovish it is while hinting at future measures such as yield curve control - committing to buy up bonds of certain maturities to keep forward rates at target level, helping manage on the run and off the run liquidity.</p><p>Unfortunately, but all too predictably, the politicians aren't as committed as the Fed to pouring oil on troubled water and wrangling over the latest $1.2 trillion fiscal boost has weighed on the value of the US dollar. The hold-up has been due, in part, to concerns among Republicans that some schemes require better monitoring.</p><p>It is also unhelpful, albeit inevitable, that the debate around how to re-open the economy is so politicised and toxic. This is partly driven by the genuine need to balance saving lives with livelihoods, but it is a shame that sensible dialogue on this tragic real-world trade off takes a back seat to ideology for several leading actors in this election race.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-64803893</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-3FC1-JCJY-G32S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1896\"/><timeReceived>11:29 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

But only in August, when the Democrat ticket is finalised, can investors start to second guess the impact of US elections. On Monday, polls showed that challenger Joe Biden's lead over Donald Trump had widened (RealClearPolitics' 'RCP Average' has Biden at +9 per cent), making his choice of running mate even more pertinent for asset markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One thing is certain: Mr Biden will be standing alongside a woman, and it's likely she'll have a minority ethnic background - with odds for former ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice (7:2), California representative Karen Bass (6:1) and Illinois representative and Iraq war veteran Tammy Duckworth (8:1) narrowing the gap on bookies' favourite, California senator Kamala Harris (evens), at the start of the week.</p><p>Given that 77-year-old Mr Biden would be the oldest president in history, there is much conjecture that his deputy will have an expanded role. Although discussions around whether she'll be a left-winger don't necessarily focus on predilections to fiscal largesse - after $3 trillion in federal government stimulus (and a further $1.2 trillion under discussion) to support the economy through Covid-19, that horse has bolted - the approach to tax and regulation will be paramount.</p><p>Speaking at the Legg Mason Global asset management forum, Margaret Vitrano, large-cap equity portfolio manager at ClearBridge Investments, highlighted some estimates that reversing President Trump's cuts to corporation tax could shave 15 per cent off S&amp;P 500 earnings, although such action would require legislative approval in the two congressional houses.</p><p>Republicans currently have a majority in the Senate and the Democrats control the House of Representatives, so the balance is finely poised. If Mr Biden is elected president, but the Republicans retain control of the upper house in Congress, then the scope for tax cuts is greatly reduced.</p><p>Such an outcome would possibly be the most marketpositive, says Clearbridge investment strategist Jeffrey Schulze: \"A Biden win and a Republican Senate could be a bullish short-term event. The outlook would improve for international trade, possibly with China, but definitely with Europe, and the risk of higher taxes would be off the table.\"</p><p>In any case, even if there was a clean sweep for the Democrats, the positive case for Mr Schulze is that \"Biden may not pull the lever on tax rises as he'd need to prioritise recovery and economic growth\".</p><p>The most compelling reason not to raise taxes, in his view, are estimates that taking corporation tax back up to 28 per cent would only raise $70bn-$130bn a year for the US Treasury anyway - \"a drop in the bucket\" compared with the $4 trillion budget deficit forecast this year - so the benefits are marginal.</p><p>Overall, however, Mr Schulze is cautious should the 50:50 chance of a Democrat sweep come to pass. He would not be surprised to see Democrats push for a partial reversal of corporation tax cuts (perhaps taking them back to 25 per cent, if not the full 28 per cent), albeit these would be pushed back a year or so and he would expect the S&amp;P 500 to take a 5-10 per cent haircut.</p><p>Perhaps a greater threat of a strong Democrat mandate is in regulation. Although she has dropped back to 16-1 to be running mate, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is a long-time advocate of challenging the monopolistic practices of big tech companies.</p><p>Big Tech in Washington This week, the chief executives of Apple (US:AAPL), Amazon (US:AMZN), Google's parent Alphabet (US:GOOGL) and Facebook (US:FB.) are standing in front of Congress being questioned on their competitive practices. The prospect of antitrust legislation casts a shadow over their future.</p><p>Investors will be all too aware that a high proportion of profits growth for the S&amp;P 500 has been concentrated in the tech behemoths and, with Q2 2020 results being reported by Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon this week, there should be another reminder of their importance.</p><p>Pharma and healthcare Pharmaceutical and healthcare companies have also been subject to political risk. Ever since Hillary Clinton's drug price tweets in 2016, they have been \"walking around with a target on their back\", says Ms Vitrano. There is a recognition, however, that the Covid-19 crisis has shown the value of a strong research and manufacturing base in the country and possibly these companies could find the Democrats a more benign prospect than had they won four years ago.</p><p>When Joe Biden won the Democrat nomination from Bernie Sanders, MediCare4All - a state-backed health funding scheme with no need for private insurance - was taken off the table as a policy option. Mr Biden prefers gradual evolution of the old Obamacare, so the risk to the industry has subsided significantly.</p><p>MediCare4All was of greatest threat to insurancefunded hospital and care-home models, and in 2017 drugs were only around 14 per cent of the US healthcare market. That said, the industry will still benefit from drug pricing slipping down the political agenda as policymakers focus on dealing with Covid-19.</p><p>If anything, the pandemic is a chance for drug manufacturers to improve their public relations and Geoffrey Hsu, manager of The Biotechnology Growth Trust (BIOG), said in his fund's annual presentation that companies he'd spoken with intended to generously price products that could help fight Covid-19.</p><p>President Trump's answer to drug price inflation was to remove red tape in the approval process and this decision has helped to bring products to market quickly and keep the lid on prices. Unforgettably, Mr Trump's assertions about the science behind bleach as a cure for coronavirus earned strong ridicule - but his policies have helped to expedite what was already a strong pipeline of drugs.</p><p>Overall, Mr Hsu rates a Biden presidency with a split Congress as the most positive outcome for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Since Bernie Sanders threw in the towel, arguably the industry's worst-case scenario of a Democratic clean sweep of presidency and both houses of congress should no longer be viewed so negatively.</p><p>What this view doesn't allow for is a left-wing vicepresident, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.however.No\">www.however.No</url> doubt Republican strategists will focus on Mr Biden's age and who might provide the real energy and drive should the Democrats win. Medicare4All is supported by Kamala Harris, Karen Bass and Elizabeth Warren, so future impetus to the policy can't be ruled out.</p><p>Led by a man who will be turning 80 by the mid-terms, it isn't unreasonable to expect that a vice-president would call significant shots. It's not inconceivable he could die of natural causes in office. Certainly, we could expect that his vice would be groomed to run after one term and that is where candidates from the Sanders wing of the Democrat party could pose the threat of greater regulation to some industries, if they also enjoyed control of Congress.</p><p>Battle over health and economic narratives to dominate election run-in More immediately, the confusing aspect for investors will be cutting through the noise as mudslinging commences in what will be a brutally fought campaign. While this week's congressional hearings into big tech are primarily about competition, it won't be lost on Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg how damaging any repeat of the Cambridge Analytica scandal - the small research firm that in 2018 was found to have breached Facebook user security to harvest data for political advertisers - would be to his company.</p><p>Reporting in traditional media is partisan too, which could have the consequence of making people less bold about going out and partaking in normal activities - in turn weighing on economic recovery. Initial positive data after states exited lockdown has been dampened; notably the US weekly unemployment claims have once again risen above 1.4m and 32m people were collecting jobless benefits at the start of July.</p><p>As for the virus, cases and deaths are rising, but the death rate per confirmed case is dramatically lower in California, Texas and Florida than it was in New York. The loss of life is still tragic, but as better treatment methods are being practiced and older people are practising social distancing more effectively, the burden on health services is more manageable.</p><p>That's not to be flippant about a seven-day rolling average death rate that nationally has almost doubled in three weeks and now runs at over 900 per day, but the fear of being overwhelmed has been replaced with an impassioned debate over the trade-off between safety and the need to get the economy up and running again.</p><p>The situation is not the same as in March, says John Bellows, fixed-income portfolio manager at Western Asset, when the fear was not knowing whether the virus could be contained or managed. Along with that uncertainty factor he puts the velocity of markets selling off earlier in the year down to the US Treasury market breaking down, but gives the Federal Reserve credit for stepping in and safeguarding the financial system.</p><p>The V-shaped economic recovery that started in April has been stopped in its tracks and Mr Bellows sees a far more gradual recovery and higher unemployment as the US loses 5-6 per cent of economic activity. That won't come back overnight as the virus has made people more cautious.</p><p>In the meantime, however, the Federal Reserve is continuing to pump money into bond markets, and Mr Bellows does see an opportunity in investment-grade credit. Spreads are still wider than a year ago and the Fed is prepared to provide whatever bridging funding lines corporates need to get through the crisis, so a great risk/reward in quality corporate bonds is materialising.</p><p>Should spreads widen meaningfully, the Fed could double or triple its buying programme, as it is committed to taking the volatility out of credit markets. Given there is still material upside, investment-grade corporate credit is a \"very interesting asset class\", in Mr Bellows' view.</p><p>This week the Federal Reserve open market committee is meeting to discuss next steps. Chair Jay Powell's signal that they aren't even thinking about raising rates was described by Mr Schulze as making his predecessors Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who were famous exponents of monetary easing after the financial crisis, look like the infamously hawkish Paul Volcker.</p><p>Most likely, the Fed will continue to signal how dovish it is while hinting at future measures such as yield curve control - committing to buy up bonds of certain maturities to keep forward rates at target level, helping manage on the run and off-the-run liquidity.</p><p>Unfortunately, but all too predictably, the politicians aren't as committed as the Fed to pouring oil on troubled water and wrangling over the latest $1.2 trillion fiscal boost has weighed on the value of the US dollar. The hold-up has been due, in part, to concerns among Republicans that some schemes require better monitoring.</p><p>It is also unhelpful, albeit inevitable, that the debate around how to reopen the economy is so politicised and toxic. This is partly driven by the genuine need to balance saving lives with livelihoods, but it is a shame that sensible dialogue on this tragic real-world trade-off takes a back seat to ideology for several leading actors in this election race.</p><p/><p>'The V-shaped economic recovery that started in April has been stopped in its tracks and Mr Bellows sees a far more gradual recovery and higher unemployment as the US loses 5-6 per cent of economic activity'</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Republicans have a majority in the Senate and the Democrats control the House of Representatives, so the balance is finely poised</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-161977335</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GF-PRP1-JCBW-N3W5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1914\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59206\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Beleaguered investors are liquidating their holdings in Sema ahead of the completion of the deal, anxious to end their association with the company, which issued two devastating profit warnings in the space of two months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In order to keep their desired weightings in the IT services sector, fund managers were yesterday moving the cash into stocks such as Didata, up 16p to 441p, Misys, 12p better at 650p, and Logica, which rose 46p to 1,595p. The process has gathered momentum since Friday's big tech sell- off, which brokers said created a number of bargains in the sector.</p><p>There was little cheer elsewhere in the New Economy. The telecoms sector, in particular, suffered another rout, with Vodafone sliding 6.5p to a two-year low of 198p. Investment banks were yesterday warning that regulatory delays mean it will probably now get less than the 11bn euros (pounds 7bn) originally agreed for the sale of its Infostrada business in Italy. Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein told clients: \"This obviously provides Enel with the opportunity to renegotiate the price following the fall in telecoms asset valuations since the deal was made.\"</p><p> Nerves went wider than the Italian job, amid the well rehearsed arguments over the gloomy global outlook for telecoms growth in economic slowdown, and after the giant sums paid for third-generation (3G) mobile licences. But dealers took heart that the collapse in valuations - which included another 38p fall, to 1,362p, for Colt Telecom and 19.5p off the Cable &amp; Wireless share price, now 777.5p - was done by lunchtime, when the stocks began to find support. BT, whose chief executive was quoted in the weekend press as admitting to paying pounds 10bn too much for 3G licences, had another yo-yo performance, falling almost 4 per cent before bouncing to close up 10.5p at 610p. Orange also ended up, 4p better at 565p.</p><p> The day's moves meant Vodafone has again lost its crown as the UK's biggest company. Last night it was worth pounds 127.8bn, while oil giant BPAmoco was worth pounds 130.4bn. BP shares jumped 13p to 580p after a new spike in the oil price, prompted by the US and British airstrikes against Iraq. Shell was 7.5p better at 589.5p.</p><p> The UK's number three company, the drugs goliath GlaxoSmithKline, was up 37p to 1,920p. Tomorrow it reports its first figures since the union of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham at Christmas. Investors were betting yesterday that it will announce bigger-than-expected savings to be made from the merger. There is also hope for a clearer strategy on research and development when gsk presents to analysts in London on Thursday and New York on Friday. Observers thought the resurgence of interest in gsk prompted a switch out of rival AstraZeneca, which dipped 8p to 2,928p.</p><p>Vodafone's problems were cancelled out by the heavyweight gains elsewhere and the FTSE 100 was settled at 6,094, up 5.7 points. With Wall Street closed for a public holiday, and many dealers taking half-term with their kids, trading was light. All the other indices were marginally weaker on the day, with the FTSE techMARK 100 off 14.6 points at 2,505.39 and the FTSE SmallCap down 4.2 at 3,259.3.</p><p> Even the FTSE 250 was off 2.4 at 6,716.8, despite the advance of an army of housebuilders. George Wimpey topped the performance table with a 12.5p rise to 177p ahead of interims tomorrow, and Persimmon was 18.5p better at 292p on a strong recommendation from UBS Warburg, the investment bank.</p><p> Generics, which advises on the commercialisation of technology, was boosted by an investment note from its house broker, Merrill Lynch. Analysts there highlighted the potential for its current projects to receive third-party funding that would crystallise their value.

But what if America is ready to elect a democratic socialist?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Between the coronavirus, sluggish economic growth, tapped-out monetary policy, deficit-driven economic growth and a president shaking the foundations of the global trading system, it's not like Americans didn't already have enough to worry about.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now here comes Bernie Sanders, the independent \"democratic socialist\" whose promises of \"political revolution\" and a slug to the wealthy to fund healthcare and education for all have turned him into the front-runner among Democrats vying to become president.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While US stock markets have for days and weeks seemingly ignored the big-picture threats from viruses and policy-driven asset bubbles - sending the stock indices to ever-higher records - the spell appears to be broken.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So far this week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has shed more than 1900 points in two days - or more than 5 per cent - its biggest decline in more than two years.</p><p>Analysts believe at least some of the drop was caused by the Vermont senator's big win in Nevada on Saturday, which adds to his first place in the New Hampshire primary earlier this month.</p><p>\"You have a lot of things that are overhanging on the economy and now you have the introduction of the idea that Bernie Sanders might be the nominee for the Democrats,\" said Anthony Scaramucci, a Wall Street money manager who once worked as Donald Trump's White House press secretary and has since vowed to campaign against the president in the lead-up to November.</p><p>Scaramucci believes the odds of a Sanders victory against US President Donald Trump in November are already at 45 to 48 per cent.</p><p>\"There has to be a probability that [Trump] doesn't beat him,\" he told The Australian Financial Review on Monday. \"So once Bernie Sanders is named the nominee, you know there has to be a correction [in markets].\"</p><p>The sudden resurrection of Sanders ahead of more conventional moderate alternatives, like former vice president Joe Biden and former Republican and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, is forcing Wall Street to revisit what the independent senator's presidency would mean in practice.</p><p>Active in office since 1981, when he became mayor of the New England town of Burlington in Vermont, Sanders has for most of his public career been dismissed as an obscure and slightly laughable left-wing figure, who famously took his wife on a honeymoon in 1988 to the Soviet Union and set up sister-city programs with places like Puerta Cabezas in Nicaragua and Yaroslavl in Russia.</p><p>In short, the bearded lady of American politics.</p><p>But nobody is dismissing him now. Over the past decade, Sanders - who joined the Senate in 2007 after 16 years in the House of Representatives - has watched and benefited as a large slab of the Democrat base shifted in his direction.</p><p>Having narrowly lost the 2016 Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton in 2016, Sanders relaunched his bid for the presidency early last year and has stood out as the party's most organised and prolific fundraiser ever since.</p><p>Ideologically, Sanders says his way of seeing the world is no longer on the fringes and argues that his model for America isn't anything people in Scandinavia or many other parts of Europe would regard as radical.</p><p>\"Ideas that seemed radical four years ago are now kind of mainstream,\" he told 60 Minutes' Anderson Cooper on Sunday, the day after his thumping victory in the Nevada caucus.</p><p>Grassroots fervour</p><p>The speed of that shift is coming as a shock to many on Wall Street, not the least because Sanders is riding a wave of grassroots fervour among mostly young voters who are buying into the senator's plans for an all-out assault on corporate America and its hard-charging model of capitalism.</p><p>As president, Sanders would reverse Trump's corporate tax cuts, returning the headline rate back up to its pre-2017 rate of 35 per cent from 21 per cent and lift the federal minimum wage to $US15 ($22.73) per hour.</p><p>Consistent with his campaign attacks on the \"billionaire class\", Sanders wants to introduce an \"extreme wealth tax\" on top-earning Americans alongside a national \"wealth registry\" to prevent tax avoidance.</p><p>Those with net worth north of $US32 million would pay 1 per cent, rising to a maximum of 8 per cent on wealth above $US$10 billion.</p><p>Sanders also wants to halt capital gains breaks for households with incomes above $US250,000 and believes there should be a tax on all Wall Street financial transactions.</p><p>Next would likely be what could become the largest trust-busting campaign in a century, targeting for a break-up of \"too big to fail\" banks and big tech firms that together account for about a quarter of the S&amp;P's market value.</p><p>Another Sanders priority would be to shift power away from corporate America towards workers by putting union representatives on boards, strengthen labour rights and force big companies to transfer up to 20 per cent of their equity to workers via so-called Democratic Employee Ownership Funds.</p><p>Healthcare plan</p><p>And that's just the start of the senator's potentially market-moving platform.</p><p>His boldest promise by far would be the creation of a national healthcare scheme that would do away with private insurance that currently covers around 160 million Americans.</p><p>In its place would be a universal system that he says would cost less while extending coverage to more than 30 million people currently outside the system and countless others with inadequate coverage.</p><p>Sanders' campaign options for funding the healthcare plan include using revenue from his wealth tax as well as the administrative savings from having a single payer replace thousands of insurers, which one estimate puts at about $US600 billion a year.</p><p>He has flagged a system in which workers with a family of four earning more than $US29,000 would pay a 4 per cent family premium on every dollar earned above that level. The campaign said on Monday that it would save the average family currently paying private insurance $US4,775 a year.</p><p>Employers would shift away from private premiums, which cost on average $US14,561 for a worker with a family of four, to a single 7.5 per cent payroll tax at a cost of $US4500, they said.</p><p>Still, introducing \"medicare for all\" would lift federal spending over the first decade by between $US32 trillion to $US34 trillion, according to calculations released last year by the Urban Institute, a centre-left think-tank in Washington.</p><p>That number is greater than the American government's total cost over the same period for social security, medicare and medicaid - the nation's largest entitlement programs - according to Congressional Budget Office projections.</p><p>Another major Sanders proposal is to cancel all college debt and make public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition free, which his campaign has costed at $US2.2 trillion over ten years.</p><p>Then there are big-spending plans to provide \"housing for all\" ($US2.5 trillion over a decade) and universal childcare ($US1.5 trillion).</p><p>And even if a hostile congress blocks much of the Sanders agenda, Trump's liberal use of executive orders has created a precedent for wide-ranging intervention across the economy.</p><p>Sanders has promised to introduce government regulations to curb emissions. He wants to ban fracking and supports shuttering existing nuclear power reactors and slash $US1.22 trillion from defence spending.</p><p>While the weekend's Nevada caucus win by Sanders triggered a sharp sell-off across US healthcare and drug stocks, some analysts have argued that his plans could actually spur economic growth, at least for a time.</p><p>Plans for removing the burden of repaying university debt and providing a single-payer healthcare system could free up household resources for new spending and investment.</p><p>Sanders also backs infrastructure investment and has expressed approval for a \"Green New Deal\" splurge on high-speed rail, electric transport and more public options to cut emissions.</p><p>\"Wall Street's getting nervous, the insurance industry's getting nervous, drug companies are getting nervous, and the Democratic establishment is getting nervous,\" Sanders reportedly told supporters in recent days.</p><p>Scaramucci suggests the Sanders resurgence is linked to deteriorating income inequality caused by the same interest rate cuts Trump has so vociferously demanded of the US Federal Reserve.</p><p>\"The great irony of the interest rate activity and the co-ordination of the Federal Reserve with the global banks is that it's having a very big effect on populism, the spectre of nationalism and all this other stuff,\" he told The Australian Financial Review.</p><p>\"The rich have gotten way richer. \"</p><p>The result is a pending battle between a \"radical, oligarchic right-wing figure in Donald Trump, that's going to be going up against a first-time self-declared American socialist.\"</p><p>\"I would tell you right now: don't underestimate the passion and the angry disaffected people who feel disadvantaged by the elites and the establishment that could potentially side with a guy like Bernie Sanders,\" Scaramucci said.</p><p>So far, Trump appears to relish the idea of a Sanders nomination, applauding the senator's Nevada win and urging him to fight against the Democratic Party machine's desire to install a moderate.</p><p>Clearly, it's because many Republicans believe Sanders will be an easy beat once they've pilloried him as a dangerous socialist radical desperate to impose a Venezuelan hell-scape on the American people.</p><p>While there's every chance that strategy will work for Trump come November, there's a risk for the president that just enough Americans in the key swing states might go for the Sanders plan, assuming he gets the nomination.</p><p>Sanders is no Jeremy Corbyn, the failed British Labour leader whose plan included genuine socialism such as the nationalisation of railways, electricity distribution, the post office, and water utilities.</p><p>But he still seems radical by conventional American standards. If that's still a thing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520244236</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y95-H7J1-JBJ7-N3HW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1642\"/><timeReceived>11:23 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
