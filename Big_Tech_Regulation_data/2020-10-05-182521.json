They say stripping or changing this immunity - as politicians on both sides of the aisle increasingly want to do - would give a legal advantage to trolls and extremists. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Section 230 is essentially a Good Samaritan provision,\" said Edward J. Black, president and chief executive of the tech industry trade group Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association. \"It ensures online services - and anyone with a website - can quickly remove extremist content without risk of being sued for their efforts to stamp out bad actors.\"</p><p>Washington and Silicon Valley are now embroiled in what's essentially a messy debate over free speech in the digital age. </p><p>Republican lawmakers want to update the 1996 legal shield to address allegations of bias and suppression of conservative speech. It's also in the crosshairs of Democrats who are concerned about the spread of disinformation and fake news. </p><p>But as Silicon Valley is now making clear, heavy-handed changes to alter this law could have troubling ripple effects - and usher in a whole host of other problems that could turn social media into an unprotected Wild West. </p><p>The debate over Section 230 went into overdrive after the introduction of a bill from Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) this week that would revoke legal immunity from big tech companies unless they could prove to the Federal Trade Commission that they're politically neutral.  </p><p>Kim-Mai Cutler, a partner at the San Francisco-based venture capital firm Initialized Capital, explained the tech industry's concerns succinctly: \"What if the federal government gets more involved in regulating social media platforms, but basically it becomes them forcing platforms to host more harassment, extremism and hate speech under the premise of political neutrality?\" she tweeted.</p><p>The tech industry is now working to illustrate how the provision has shielded companies who were trying to remove hateful content.</p><p>An often-cited example: A white nationalist sued Twitter, claiming the company violated his free-speech rights by banning him from the service after offensive posts.</p><p>Twitter won the significant legal battle last year when a California state appeals court ruled in its favor - because it was protected under Section 230. </p><p>The recent clash also underscores the deep divisions between Democrats and Republicans. </p><p>At its core, Republicans say the companies have gone too far in content moderation - at the expensive of conservatives. But many Democrats who are floating Section 230 changes say the companies haven't intervened enough, allowing violence, hate speech and disinformation to fester on their platforms. They've pressed the companies on whether they're doing enough to remove content such as videos of the mass shooting in New Zealand earlier this year. </p><p>As pointed out by Jeff Kosseff, an assistant professor of cybersecurity law at the Naval Academy, there are two polar opposite criticisms of Section 230: \"I've been asked three times in the past day what this bill's introduction means for Section 230's survival. I have no idea, as I (thankfully) am not a political expert. But I do find it interesting . . . that there are two polar opposite criticisms of 230,\" he tweeted. </p><p>\"I frankly can't think of any legislation that would satisfy both sides.\"</p><p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), one of Section 230's original authors, seems to agree with Silicon Valley that stripping the immunity would make the discourse on these platforms even worse. </p><p> \"This bill would essentially force every platform to become 4chan or 8chan rather than maintain some basic level of decency,\" Wyden said in a statement to The Technology 202. </p><p>\"What CDA 230 actually does is enable private sector companies to take down inappropriate third-party posts without incurring liability.\"</p><p>Hawley's office stood behind its bill following the criticism yesterday. </p><p> \"Google, Facebook and Twitter currently get a massive benefit from government that no other entity gets - immunity from liability,\" Kelli Ford, a spokeswoman for Hawley, said in a statement. \"Senator Hawley's bill says that if they want to keep that special benefit, they have to adhere to the First Amendment standard of no viewpoint discrimination. They are free to do whatever they wish, of course. If these companies prefer to advocate a particular viewpoint or penalize other views, they certainly can. But they shouldn't get 230 immunity while doing it.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:cat.zakrzewski@washpost.com\">cat.zakrzewski@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-ecb50848938911e9aadb74e6b2b46f6a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCW-M5R1-JCDY-T40J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><timeReceived>11:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 21, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>COMPUTER &amp;

They say stripping or changing this immunity - as politicians on both sides of the aisle increasingly want to do - would give a legal advantage to trolls and extremists. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Section 230 is essentially a Good Samaritan provision,\" said Edward J. Black, president and chief executive of the tech industry trade group Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association. \"It ensures online services - and anyone with a website - can quickly remove extremist content without risk of being sued for their efforts to stamp out bad actors.\"</p><p>Washington and Silicon Valley are now embroiled in what's essentially a messy debate over free speech in the digital age. </p><p>Republican lawmakers want to update the 1996 legal shield to address allegations of bias and suppression of conservative speech. It's also in the crosshairs of Democrats who are concerned about the spread of disinformation and fake news. </p><p>But as Silicon Valley is now making clear, heavy-handed changes to alter this law could have troubling ripple effects - and usher in a whole host of other problems that could turn social media into an unprotected Wild West. </p><p>The debate over Section 230 went into overdrive after the introduction of a bill from Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) this week that would revoke legal immunity from big tech companies unless they could prove to the Federal Trade Commission that they're politically neutral.  </p><p>Kim-Mai Cutler, a partner at the San Francisco-based venture capital firm Initialized Capital, explained the tech industry's concerns succinctly: \"What if the federal government gets more involved in regulating social media platforms, but basically it becomes them forcing platforms to host more harassment, extremism and hate speech under the premise of political neutrality?\" she tweeted.</p><p>The tech industry is now working to illustrate how the provision has shielded companies who were trying to remove hateful content.</p><p>An often-cited example: A white nationalist sued Twitter, claiming the company violated his free-speech rights by banning him from the service after offensive posts.</p><p>Twitter won the significant legal battle last year when a California state appeals court ruled in its favor - because it was protected under Section 230. </p><p>The recent clash also underscores the deep divisions between Democrats and Republicans. </p><p>At its core, Republicans say the companies have gone too far in content moderation - at the expensive of conservatives. But many Democrats who are floating Section 230 changes say the companies haven't intervened enough, allowing violence, hate speech and disinformation to fester on their platforms. They've pressed the companies on whether they're doing enough to remove content such as videos of the mass shooting in New Zealand earlier this year. </p><p>As pointed out by Jeff Kosseff, an assistant professor of cybersecurity law at the Naval Academy, there are two polar opposite criticisms of Section 230: \"I've been asked three times in the past day what this bill's introduction means for Section 230's survival. I have no idea, as I (thankfully) am not a political expert. But I do find it interesting . . . that there are two polar opposite criticisms of 230,\" he tweeted. </p><p>\"I frankly can't think of any legislation that would satisfy both sides.\"</p><p>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), one of Section 230's original authors, seems to agree with Silicon Valley that stripping the immunity would make the discourse on these platforms even worse. </p><p> \"This bill would essentially force every platform to become 4chan or 8chan rather than maintain some basic level of decency,\" Wyden said in a statement to The Technology 202. </p><p>\"What CDA 230 actually does is enable private sector companies to take down inappropriate third-party posts without incurring liability.\"</p><p>Hawley's office stood behind its bill following the criticism yesterday. </p><p> \"Google, Facebook and Twitter currently get a massive benefit from government that no other entity gets - immunity from liability,\" Kelli Ford, a spokeswoman for Hawley, said in a statement. \"Senator Hawley's bill says that if they want to keep that special benefit, they have to adhere to the First Amendment standard of no viewpoint discrimination. They are free to do whatever they wish, of course. If these companies prefer to advocate a particular viewpoint or penalize other views, they certainly can. But they shouldn't get 230 immunity while doing it.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:cat.zakrzewski@washpost.com\">cat.zakrzewski@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPOST-ecb50848-9389-11e9-aadb-74e6b2b46f6a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCW-S7G1-JBFW-C1F4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8075</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"817\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12311\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Regional Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 21, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>COMPUTER &amp;

There is a consensus here that Donald Trump is the enemy.\" Democratic presidential candidates (L-R) Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are among the favorites in Silicon Valley ahead of the March 3 primary in California, one of the states voting in \"Super Tuesday\" Photo: GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / WIN MCNAMEE Sanders, who at 78 is from a different generation than the typical tech worker, connects with the younger crowd by promoting himself as a \"disruptor,\" like many emerging tech firms, said San Jose State University political science professor Melinda Jackson. </p><p>\"Focus on big ideas, political revolution, generous universal benefits -- these ideas really appeal to a lot of folks,\" Jackson said.With Californians set to vote on this week's Super Tuesday, when 14 states go to the polls, support for Sanders and Warren comes even with the two progressive candidates pledging to sharply raise taxes on high earners and break up the largest tech companies which dominate key economic sectors. Bernie Sanders, speaking at a campaign event on February 17, 2020 in Richmond, California, connects with young people in the tech sector by promoting himself as a \"disruptor,\" one analyst says Photo: GETTY IMAGES / JUSTIN SULLIVAN  \"Sanders does appeal to many of the workers who feel the downsides of income inequality,\" said Jackson.Some analysts see support for 38-year-old Buttigieg, with a more moderate platform. Reports said a Buttigieg gathering was hosted by Netflix chief Reed Hastings and attended by people linked to Google, Facebook and other large tech firms, an event denounced by rivals as the \"wine cave\" fundraiser.\"Pete Buttigieg is the favored candidate of Silicon Valley as he has a tech-friendly agenda and a moderate stance in regulation,\" said Brookings Institution governance studies director Darrell West.\"He understands how businesses operate and what they need in order to do well.\"West added that while idealistic tech company workers are inclined to support progressive candidates, senior executives worry about regulatory backlash. Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg is believed to be popular in Silicon Valley with a more moderate platform than some of his rivals Photo: GETTY IMAGES NORTH AMERICA / JUSTIN SULLIVAN Buttigieg has the vote of Manu Koenig, who has worked at a series of tech startups and is running for an elected position in part of Silicon Valley.\"For my friends and I, it is just that we want some return to normalcy rather than swinging from one pole to the other,\" Koenig told AFP.\"Clearly, Bernie is the other pole. That's what excites a lot of people about him and scares a lot of people about him.\" Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren, who is running on a platform to break up Big Tech, has some support from young voters in Silicon Valley Photo: GETTY IMAGES / JUSTIN SULLIVAN The 34-year-old cited the popularity of Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar as a sign Silicon Valley voters want reason and collaboration returned to US national politics.Former vice president Joe Biden \"is hardcore normalcy, but he is just too old,\" Koenig said.\"We want normalcy 2.0, or even 3.0,\" he added, using a reference to improved second or third generations of a technology platform.He sees former South Bend, Indiana mayor Buttigieg as in tune with Silicon Valley ways of thinking, from climate change to quickly rolling out solutions and then improving on them as feedback or data dictate.\"I think it is just an awareness of our inter-connectedness and realizing we are developing solutions together,\" Koenig said.Volition startup founder and chief Nick Pinkston sees support for Michael Bloomberg and Buttigieg in the venture capital community.\"Venture capitalists don't want to be taxed, and feel like Bernie and Warren are sort of out to get Silicon Valley,\" Pinkston said.These investors also count on internet giants like Google, Facebook to buy startups they have invested in early, providing lucrative returns. Breaking up big tech would undermine that strategy.Even though the tech world has mostly supported Democrats, a few high-profile executives have allied with Trump including investor Peter Thiel and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who recently hosted a fundraiser for the Republican president.Some young techies who came of voting age in 2016 feel disillusioned and wary of the primaries.\"The election process screwed me over last time,\" said 21-year-old Lucas Garcia, a computer science student.\"We got the popular vote but the popular candidate didn't win, which is kind of bogus.\"He feels that billionaires are out of touch with mainstream life but that those now in the White House have spewed malice at US families of Mexican heritage such as his.\"Do I really want to vote for Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders?\" Garcia asked rhetorically.\"No. But, it's better than someone who hates me and my family.\" </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767158303794129175776100136</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YB3-FPW1-JCMN-Y05G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"938\"/><timeReceived>4:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 1, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002KDX</classCode><className>GETTY IMAGES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>CENTER FOR RESPONSIVE POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SAN JOSE STATE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Apple, which has the largest mainland China business of its US peers, has only said it is \u201cassessing\u201d the situation. Amazon Web Services said it was \u201creviewing the details\u201d of the law. </p><p>But Western companies now must judge how much leeway they will have, whether they can comply with the new regime, or whether they will ultimately have to abandon Hong Kong. One tech executive said his company was considering \u201call options\u201d.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What could the tech companies be forced to do under the new law? </emphasis></p><p>The Hong Kong government can now compel companies to take down online posts or accounts, and to share private user data.</p><p>If, for example, a company refuses to remove a social media post, police are able to seize and confiscate the Hong Kong-based servers that store the messages. </p><p>If the posts are stored on overseas servers, the police can ask internet service providers (ISPs), which control the internet connections between Hong Kong and the rest of the world, to block access to offending websites. </p><p>As Hong Kong businesses, ISPs will find it harder than foreign tech companies to reject requests, said Paul Haswell, a Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Pinsent Masons.</p><p>Mr Haswell predicted that while big tech companies will probably move servers out of Hong Kong, in the end their websites are likely to be blocked. </p><p>\u201cHong Kong authorities can now move up every link in the chain of how information goes from a server to your phone or laptop,\u201d he said.</p><p>Tech companies already receive requests from Hong Kong police to share data to solve crimes. Some <url normalizedValue=\"https://transparency.facebook.com/government-data-requests/country/HK\"> disclose</url> the number of requests they get. Facebook, for example, received 384 requests in 2019 across all its services, and complied with just under half of the requests. </p><p>But under the new law, investigations into national security crimes can be deemed state secrets and any trials may be heard in closed court. Tech companies may be forbidden from disclosing what the police ask them for. </p><p>Messaging apps, including Apple\u2019s iMessage, Signal and WhatsApp, use end-to-end encryption, meaning that only the end users can read messages. But these services can be asked to share metadata, such as the time a message was sent and the number it was sent to, or who is in the same group conversation. WhatsApp also collects contact lists and approximate locations from users with their consent.</p><p>Google Maps also collects GPS data from users and is a prime resource for US law enforcement, which often requests the identities of users within a certain radius of a crime.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cCompanies will collaborate with metadata gladly. Twitter is the only one who has put up some resistance,\u201d said Nathan Freitas, director at Guardian Project, a developer of mobile privacy tools.</p><p>Mr Freitas added that he was concerned about the development of automatic surveillance and tracking for tech companies in Hong Kong.</p><p>For instance, mobile carriers could message everyone within a certain distance of a protest to tell them to go home.</p><p>ISPs and app stores, such as Google Play, could be asked to provide information on who is using or downloading VPNs and cut their service if they continue to do so. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How much is Hong Kong worth to Silicon Valley?</emphasis></p><p>For LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook, the Hong Kong market \u2014 with a population of just over 7m people \u2014 makes up less than 0.3 per cent of their global user base, based on figures by marketing agency We Are Social. </p><p>None of the major internet companies use Hong Kong as their regional headquarters although they all have offices in the city. </p><p>Facebook, for example, opened a large four-story office in Quarry Bay last year where teams are working on policy and communications, legal and finance, sales and marketing, and augmented and virtual reality. </p><p>According to its annual report, Facebook generates \u201cmeaningful revenue\u201d from advertisers in China, listing the region among its top five sources of income outside the US. Much of that business is handled from Hong Kong.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook\u2019s Hong Kong office is advertising for a new associate general counsel for Greater China, who would report to the vice-president and head of legal for Asia-Pacific in Singapore. One requirement listed is a \u201ckeen understanding of Greater China\u2019s legal framework, experience engaging with regulators is a plus\u201d, as well as in areas of internet, data protection, privacy and cyber security laws and user-generated content.\u00a0</p><p>Twitter opened an office in Hong Kong in 2015 but moved most of its China sales force to Singapore the following year, according to reports at the time. Twitter would not confirm this week whether or not it still had any employees in Hong Kong, but the location is still listed on its careers site and the company\u2019s LinkedIn page. </p><p>Microsoft has been in the region longer than its Silicon Valley peers \u2014 its first Hong Kong office opened in 1991 and its 80,000 sq ft base in the Cyberport business district houses some 300 staff. Microsoft and LinkedIn already operate in mainland China, where LinkedIn has some 50m users. In the past, it has been criticised for censoring sensitive content. </p><p>Google, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft all have data centres in Hong Kong, while Twitter and Facebook do not have local data centres. </p><p>Mr Haswell said in theory cloud providers could be asked to hand over client data but in practice \u201clogistically it might not be possible\u201d because they cannot easily identify which data belongs to whom.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What happens next? </emphasis></p><p>As they digest the implications of the new law, none of the tech companies was prepared to discuss its future in Hong Kong. If necessary, they all have offices elsewhere in Asia, with Singapore emerging as a popular tech hub, though it is unclear whether Hong Kong citizens would wish to move.</p><p>Meanwhile, the decision by the companies to \u201cpause\u201d their response to data requests does not absolve them of complying with the law, said Anson Wong Yu Yat, a barrister in Hong Kong. </p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t give any shield to liability because it is not a lawful excuse, it is just a policy that is adopted by a foreign company,\u201d he said. </p><p>Carolyn Bigg, a technology partner at DLA Piper in Hong Kong, said it was important that the companies immediately formulate plans for how everyone from their front desk to their IT department would respond to a request from the authorities. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s making sure your \u2018dawn raid\u2019 plans\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009are updated to take into account this might happen,\u201d Ms Bigg said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Reporting by Yuan Yang and Nian Liu in Beijing, Primrose Riordan in Hong Kong, Mercedes Ruehl in Singapore, Tim Bradshaw in London, Dave Lee and Patrick McGee in San Francisco</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This article has been amended to clarify that WhatsApp does not collect GPS location data. However it can estimate a user\u2019s last known location using other information including IP addresses.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-9c06e9df0ca2485b8afe98e51f529373</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609S-4JN1-DXP9-91YR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1254\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 8, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000C4AF</classCode><className>PINSENT MASONS LLP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In rather direct prose the court wrote Uber, 'must be regarded as being inherently linked to a transport service.' In other words it's a natural litter mate of Yellow Cab and Checker Cab companies and, oh God forbid, subject to the same rules and regulations as everyone else. </p><p>Probably we can expect similar challenges to Uber's \"technology platform\" status stateside and it's been reported [1]that Uber is the subject of a federal investigation probably owing to its theft of trade secrets from Waymo. Tsk,Tsk. Elsewhere in Washington the FCC headed by Ajit Pai shot down in cold blood the Obama era Net Neutrality rule much to the consternation of Netflix and Google who labeled the action \"misguided\". It is probably a good indication that a minority has arrived when an administration's two most visible members ( Pai and Nikkei Haley ) are the most slandered in the popular media. Both know the value of Machiavelli's advice to the Prince: ' One should wish to be\u00a0both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved.' The only guiding principle coming from Big Tech appears to be \"What's in it for me?\" To date Elon Musk has captured $4.9 billion in federal subsidies which makes Solyndra's $550 million bankruptcy look like penny poker. His Tesla Motors is facing a lawsuit from the state of Michigan because Tesla has not followed the franchise rule that every other auto manufacturer must as called for, according to Michigan, by the interstate commerce clause. To his supporters[2] it's the \"dormant interstate commerce clause\" an anachronism that should br judicially euthanized. Now I do have a libertarian bent and you are better off listening to even a bad lawyer than me but that said let's add a bit of historical context[3]. In the glory days of FDR's New Deal and the Agriculture Adjustment Act one Roscoe Filburn had the temerity to grow 12 bushels of wheat above his allotment which was intended for his own use. Not since the Teapot Dome scandal! He was fined for that transgression and the Supreme Court agreed..Roscoe Filburn[4] was a farmer in what is now suburban Dayton, Ohio[5] who admitted producing wheat in excess of the amount permitted. He maintained, however, that the excess wheat was produced for his private consumption on his own farm. Since it never entered commerce at all, much less interstate commerce, he argued that it was not a proper subject of federal regulation under the Commerce Clause. In July 1940, pursuant to the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) of 1938, Filburn's 1941 allotment was established at 11.1 acres (4.5 ha) and a normal yield of 20.1 bushels of wheat per acre. Filburn was given notice of the allotment in July 1940 before the Fall planting of his 1941 crop of wheat, and again in July 1941, before it was harvested. Despite these notices, Filburn planted 23 acres (9.3 ha) and harvested 239 more bushels than was allowed from his 11.9 acres (4.8 ha) of excess area.[6] The Federal District Court ruled in favor of Filburn. The Act required an affirmative vote of farmers by plebiscite to implement the quota. Much of the District Court decision related to the way in which the Secretary of Agriculture had campaigned for passage: The District Court had held that the Secretary's comments were improper. The government then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which called the District Court's holding against the campaign methods which led to passage of the quota by farmers a \"manifest error\". The court then went on to uphold the Act under the Interstate Commerce Claus.Again context. Even at today's wheat prices ( about $4.25 per bushel ) Filburn's ill gotten gain would amount to about $80. Law is law but Musk's supporters would have us believe that law is archaic. Unrelated to Michigan's attempt to abridge Musk's right to do as he damn well pleases another issue has arisen. Google, Uber, Lyft and of course Tesla want' to use the power of the federal government to impose on the states standards for autonomous vehicles. All of a sudden the interstate commerce clause should no longer be dormant. 'We are facing an opportunity to expand the options for transportation[5] by car by also making it smarter and safer,' said committee chairman, U.S. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D. But engineers must first shield vehicles from cyber attacks and said self-driving cars must operate seamlessly in bad weather \u2014 two significant challenges for the auto industry, said Mary (Missy) Louise Cummings, director of Duke University's Humans and Autonomy Lab and Duke Robotics. \"I am decidedly less optimistic,\" she told the panel. Self-driving cars are \"absolutely not ready for widespread deployment, and certainly not ready for humans to be completely taken out of the driver's seat.\"\"Consistency, thou art a jewel,' Shakespeare. By all means let's make our cars safer and smarter but just for good measure let's allow Silicon Valley to develop artificially intelligent congressmen and senators who can get in out of the rain.

In rather direct prose the court wrote Uber, 'must be regarded as being inherently linked to a transport service.' In other words it's a natural litter mate of Yellow Cab and Checker Cab companies and, oh God forbid, subject to the same rules and regulations as everyone else. </p><p>Probably we can expect similar challenges to Uber's \"technology platform\" status stateside and it's been reported [1]that Uber is the subject of a federal investigation probably owing to its theft of trade secrets from Waymo. Tsk,Tsk. Elsewhere in Washington the FCC headed by Ajit Pai shot down in cold blood the Obama era Net Neutrality rule much to the consternation of Netflix and Google who labeled the action \"misguided\". It is probably a good indication that a minority has arrived when an administration's two most visible members ( Pai and Nikkei Haley ) are the most slandered in the popular media. Both know the value of Machiavelli's advice to the Prince: ' One should wish to be\u00a0both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved.' The only guiding principle coming from Big Tech appears to be \"What's in it for me?\" To date Elon Musk has captured $4.9 billion in federal subsidies which makes Solyndra's $550 million bankruptcy look like penny poker. His Tesla Motors is facing a lawsuit from the state of Michigan because Tesla has not followed the franchise rule that every other auto manufacturer must as called for, according to Michigan, by the interstate commerce clause. To his supporters[2] it's the \"dormant interstate commerce clause\" an anachronism that should br judicially euthanized. Now I do have a libertarian bent and you are better off listening to even a bad lawyer than me but that said let's add a bit of historical context[3]. In the glory days of FDR's New Deal and the Agriculture Adjustment Act one Roscoe Filburn had the temerity to grow 12 bushels of wheat above his allotment which was intended for his own use. Not since the Teapot Dome scandal! He was fined for that transgression and the Supreme Court agreed..Roscoe Filburn[4] was a farmer in what is now suburban Dayton, Ohio[5] who admitted producing wheat in excess of the amount permitted. He maintained, however, that the excess wheat was produced for his private consumption on his own farm. Since it never entered commerce at all, much less interstate commerce, he argued that it was not a proper subject of federal regulation under the Commerce Clause. In July 1940, pursuant to the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) of 1938, Filburn's 1941 allotment was established at 11.1 acres (4.5 ha) and a normal yield of 20.1 bushels of wheat per acre. Filburn was given notice of the allotment in July 1940 before the Fall planting of his 1941 crop of wheat, and again in July 1941, before it was harvested. Despite these notices, Filburn planted 23 acres (9.3 ha) and harvested 239 more bushels than was allowed from his 11.9 acres (4.8 ha) of excess area.[6] The Federal District Court ruled in favor of Filburn. The Act required an affirmative vote of farmers by plebiscite to implement the quota. Much of the District Court decision related to the way in which the Secretary of Agriculture had campaigned for passage: The District Court had held that the Secretary's comments were improper. The government then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which called the District Court's holding against the campaign methods which led to passage of the quota by farmers a \"manifest error\". The court then went on to uphold the Act under the Interstate Commerce Claus.Again context. Even at today's wheat prices ( about $4.25 per bushel ) Filburn's ill gotten gain would amount to about $80. Law is law but Musk's supporters would have us believe that law is archaic. Unrelated to Michigan's attempt to abridge Musk's right to do as he damn well pleases another issue has arisen. Google, Uber, Lyft and of course Tesla want' to use the power of the federal government to impose on the states standards for autonomous vehicles. All of a sudden the interstate commerce clause should no longer be dormant. 'We are facing an opportunity to expand the options for transportation[5] by car by also making it smarter and safer,' said committee chairman, U.S. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D. But engineers must first shield vehicles from cyber attacks and said self-driving cars must operate seamlessly in bad weather   two significant challenges for the auto industry, said Mary (Missy) Louise Cummings, director of Duke University's Humans and Autonomy Lab and Duke Robotics. \"I am decidedly less optimistic,\" she told the panel. Self-driving cars are \"absolutely not ready for widespread deployment, and certainly not ready for humans to be completely taken out of the driver's seat.\"\"Consistency, thou art a jewel,' Shakespeare. By all means let's make our cars safer and smarter but just for good measure let's allow Silicon Valley to develop artificially intelligent congressmen and senators who can get in out of the rain.

A deceptively edited video of former vice president Joe Biden that widely circulated on Twitter last week could be a harbinger of disinformation in the election.</p><p>Twitter confirmed Friday that it would not remove the 19-second clip, which was edited to make the Democratic presidential candidate appear racist. The video's spread was bolstered by several reporters and people with large Twitter followings, who shared it with little context.</p><p>As my colleague Greg Sargent wrote: \"If you thought the 2016 election was awash in disinformation and lies, get ready: The 2020 election is going to make that affair look like a knitting session.\"</p><p>Biden is warning that any Democratic nominee would be vulnerable to disinformation in the aftermath of the video's spread, according to The New York Times. That could put even more pressure on Silicon Valley companies to invest in rooting out falsehoods on their platform and set the stage for batties between candidates and companies in the coming years.</p><p>2. Disinformation tactics will evolve as Silicon Valley invests heavily to avoid a repeat of the 2016 election.</p><p>The cast of actors who could potentially target the 2020 races is much broader - and their arsenal of weapons is constantly evolving.</p><p>Russia is no longer the only threat. Iran and China have shown that they are also investing in influence operations on social media. Domestic actors also played a significant role in spreading disinformation in the 2018 midterms.</p><p>The edited Biden video, and a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, that went viral last year, show how powerful video editing can be in creating a false political narrative. And researchers warn that deepfakes -which allow people to use artificial intelligence to make it appear someone is saying or doing something that never happened - are developing swiftly and creating new concerns.</p><p>Expect these evolutions to be a key focus of Washington lawmakers in the coming weeks. The House Energy and Commerce Committee will kick things off Wednesday with a hearing on \"manipulation and deception in the digital age.\"</p><p>3. California's new privacy law took effect on Jan. 1, and other states will consider adopting their own data-collection restrictions in the absence of federal action.</p><p>It's official. California residents have new controls over their privacy. But tech companies still have some time before enforcement of the law begins in six months, so expect them to spend the first half of the year adjusting to the new regulation.</p><p>In the absence of federal action in Washington last year, other states are considering their own privacy legislation. The tech industry is closely watching states like New York and Washington, which could adopt their own privacy legislation in the coming months.</p><p>This flurry of activity at the state level is prompting the industry's lobbying groups to invest more in states, Axios's Kim Hart and Margaret Harding McGill write. States are also expected to take a greater role on issues such as autonomous vehicles and facial recognition.</p><p>4. Tech giants' power and size will be under the microscope as antitrust investigations heat up at the federal and state level.</p><p>Antitrust will continue to dominate the tech policy debate, especially as the House subcommittee leading an antitrust investigation into Big Tech plans to release a report on its findings in the first half of 2020.</p><p>The action on the Hill comes as the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department have their own ongoing probes of the tech giants, and states attorneys general are also launching investigations of companies including Facebook and Google.</p><p>Any developments in these investigations could become a key topic on the campaign trail. Many Democratic candidates have been weighing in on their positions on breaking up Big Tech as they try to differentiate their economic platforms.</p><p>5. The industry's treatment of contract workers will face a reckoning - starting with a law targeting gig-economy workers known as AB5 in California.</p><p>Companies like Uber, Lyft and Postmates built entirely new business models by relying heavily on contract workers to power their driving and delivery workforces. But a new law in California that aims to reclassify these gig workers as full-time employees could pose an existential threat to that way of doing business.</p><p>AB5 took effect last week, and the companies are stepping up their efforts to ensure that they don't have to reclassify their drivers. My colleague Faiz Siddiqui this morning reports that Uber has launched an internal initiative known as \"Project Luigi\" to fight the law. The initiative aimed to revamp aspects of the app to make it more friendly to California drivers, including adding the ability to see estimated trip fares up front and then reject a trip without penalty</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Uber and Postmates sued California to challenge the legislation on the grounds that it \"violates constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process because of how it targets some workers and companies.\" They're also pushing a ballot initiative to counter the law in California in 2020.</p><p>-SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GLENN HUTCHINS, CO-CEO OF SILVER LAKE PARTNERS, TALKS TO BLOOMBERG'S ERIK SCHATZKER ABOUT DELL.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEPTEMBER 22, 2009</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: ERIK SCHATZKER, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GLENN HUTCHINS, CO-CEO, SILVER LAKE PARTNERS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">14:12</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ERIK SCHATZKER, BLOOMBERG NEWS: We are here with Glenn Hutchins. Glenn, we have to start off with Skype. It's in the headlines. It's obviously the subject of some litigation. I wouldn't be surprised if you are a little bit constrained on what you can say, but I do want to ask you this. The founders of Skype have taken what some people might call a scorched earth tactic with regard to litigation. Has this caught you off guard? Are you surprised?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GLENN HUTCHINS, CO-CEO, SILVER LAKE PARTNERS: No comment.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Okay, just so our viewers are clear that is basically where we're going to go on the subject of Skype because I don't want to waste their time. I certainly don't want to waste yours. Okay, let's move on then.</p><p>Let's talk about finance. The G-20 taking place this week in Pittsburgh. You have written passionately about how we need to look at the credit crisis, how it developed, and where we need to go from here. A lot of focus at the G-20 on bonuses. You're not a banker, but you do business with these people. You were in the Clinton Administration, you understand the kinds of pressures that policy makers are under. Are they taking the right approach?</p><p>HUTCHINS: By the way, do I get a break on my terminal service - price break on my terminal service for being here today?</p><p>SCHATZKER: We'll have to talk with the Chair -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUTCHINS: I think what we need to do is restore confidence in the financial markets. Obviously the bonus issue is one that has created a bunch of political agita. I think the background of that is that we are in a time period in which American incomes have stagnated. A lot of people have suffered.</p><p>Unemployment is going up substantially. America is in a transition in important parts of our manufacturing base are in decline. And to see people making this much money, even though it might have been earned or might have been justified in some uneconomic sense, it's a political problem and it creates a lack of confidence. It contributes to a lack of confidence in the markets. So I think in general what we can do - again, this doesn't relate to me, it doesn't relate to my firm, except that we as participants in the broader economy, I think what we can do to restore confidence with appropriate regulation of compensation as part of that is the appropriate thing to do.</p><p>SCHATZKER: When we think about regulating financial services, are there any guiding principles you think we need to follow?</p><p>HUTCHINS: Yes, I think in general there are two key rationales for regulation. One is systemic risk. Does the firm generate, or its activities generate systemic risk? Do we need to regulate it to protect the system?</p><p>And second, is there consumer protection element? And because we do need to protect consumers and make sure again people can have trust in the marketplace to do business with folks. And I think we learned some from the mortgage economy that a whole bunch of people got products that were inappropriate for them, whether they were knowledgeable about it or not. We don't know. And so, to protect consumers from those sort of problems and create consumer confidence in the financial system again, I think, is very important.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Consumer protection and systemic risk. Okay, as you point out, you're not effectively part of Wall Street. Why was it important to you to go back and understand this debate?</p><p>HUTCHINS: Well I am an investor. Two things - one is that I, as an investor - I think you need to have to a very thorough understanding of the macro economic environment as a backdrop to what your investments are, what your investments can be. And also, I think that if you have a perspective that is useful to public debate, you have some degree of an obligation to share it with others.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Okay, let's talk about private equity. It did seem back in 2007 like it was the golden age. Doesn't feel like the golden age anymore. There is a lack of leverage that affects some firms perhaps more than yours, but there is also a premium being placed on liquidity, as Larry Fink of Blackrock reminded us the other day. People shouldn't be under the misunderstanding perhaps that private equity is a liquid investment, but could it be caught up in the collateral damage as endowments of other institutions think carefully about how much money they are willing to dedicate to illiquid instruments?</p><p>HUTCHINS: Well I think the biggest issue with respect to liquidity on behalf of the institutions that invest in alternative assets, which takes in private equity, hedge funds, venture capital, et cetera, relates to hedge funds for two reasons. One is they were bought to -- expected to own liquid instruments which were rendered illiquid by the liquidity crisis.</p><p>And second, they were thought to have - expected by their investors to have periodic liquidity and many of them put up what are called gates and restricted people's access to their securities. So I think that issue, the liquidity problem that we've all faced relates more to the hedge fund business model than to the private equity business model that was well understood to be an illiquid asset class.</p><p>That's point one. Point two is as the resources in certain pools of capital shrink, there might well be smaller-sized funds in the future. There might well be less robust fundraising. But on the other hand that is being offset by large pools of new capital in other geographies of the world entering the alternative asset market.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHATZKER: China, Singapore, that kind of thing?</p><p>HUTCHINS: Yes, exactly right.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Okay, with about 30 seconds to go, you focus on tech. We just saw a big tech deal today - Dell buying Pro Systems (ph), yesterday in fact. How is that going to affect your business? You've got a lot of big tech interests? You're competing for some of the same companies.</p><p>HUTCHINS: Look, I want to first congratulate the guys at Dell for that transaction..

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its  accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GLENN HUTCHINS, CO-CEO OF SILVER LAKE PARTNERS, TALKS TO BLOOMBERG'S ERIK  SCHATZKER ABOUT DELL.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEPTEMBER 22, 2009</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: ERIK SCHATZKER, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GLENN HUTCHINS, CO-CEO, SILVER LAKE PARTNERS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">14:12</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ERIK SCHATZKER, BLOOMBERG NEWS: We are here with Glenn Hutchins.  Glenn, we have to start off with Skype. It's in the headlines. It's  obviously the subject of some litigation. I wouldn't be surprised if you  are a little bit constrained on what you can say, but I do want to ask you  this. The founders of Skype have taken what some people might call a  scorched earth tactic with regard to litigation. Has this caught you off  guard? Are you surprised?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GLENN HUTCHINS, CO-CEO, SILVER LAKE PARTNERS: No comment. </p><p>SCHATZKER: Okay,  just so our viewers are clear that is basically  where we're going to go on the subject of Skype because I don't want to  waste their time. I certainly don't want to waste yours. Okay, let's move  on then. </p><p>Let's talk about finance. The G-20 taking place this week in Pittsburgh.  You have written passionately about how we need to look at the credit  crisis, how it developed, and where we need to go from here. A lot of focus  at the G-20 on bonuses. You're not a banker, but you do business with these  people. You were in the Clinton Administration, you understand the kinds of  pressures that policy makers are under. Are they taking the right approach? </p><p>HUTCHINS: By the way, do I get a break on my terminal service - price  break on my terminal service for being here today? </p><p>SCHATZKER: We'll have to talk with the Chair -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUTCHINS: I think what we need to do is restore confidence in the  financial markets. Obviously the bonus issue is one that has created a  bunch of political agita. I think the background of that is that we are in  a time period in which American incomes have stagnated. A lot of people  have suffered. </p><p>Unemployment is going up substantially. America is in a transition in  important parts of our manufacturing base are in decline. And to see people  making this much money, even though it might have been earned or might have  been justified in some uneconomic sense, it's a political problem and it  creates a lack of confidence. It contributes to a lack of confidence in the  markets. So I think in general what we can do - again, this doesn't relate  to me, it doesn't relate to my firm, except that we as participants in the  broader economy, I think what we can do to restore confidence with  appropriate regulation of compensation as part of that is the appropriate  thing to do. </p><p>SCHATZKER: When we think about regulating financial services, are  there any guiding principles you think we need to follow? </p><p>HUTCHINS: Yes, I think in general there are two key rationales for  regulation. One is systemic risk. Does the firm generate, or its activities  generate systemic risk? Do we need to regulate it to protect the system? </p><p>And second, is there consumer protection element? And because we do need to  protect consumers and make sure again people can have trust in the  marketplace to do business with folks. And I think we learned some from the  mortgage economy that a whole bunch of people got products that were  inappropriate for them, whether they were knowledgeable about it or not. We  don't know. And so, to protect consumers from those sort of problems and  create consumer confidence in the financial system again, I think, is very  important. </p><p>SCHATZKER: Consumer protection and systemic risk. Okay, as you point  out, you're not effectively part of Wall Street. Why was it important to  you to go back and understand this debate? </p><p>HUTCHINS: Well I am an investor. Two things - one is that I, as an  investor - I think you need to have to a very thorough understanding of the  macro economic environment as a backdrop to what your investments are, what  your investments can be. And also, I think that if you have a perspective  that is useful to public debate, you have some degree of an obligation to  share it with others. </p><p>SCHATZKER: Okay, let's talk about private equity. It did seem back in  2007 like it was the golden age. Doesn't feel like the golden age anymore.  There is a lack of leverage that affects some firms perhaps more than  yours, but there is also a premium being placed on liquidity, as Larry Fink  of Blackrock reminded us the other day. People shouldn't be under the  misunderstanding perhaps that private equity is a liquid investment, but  could it be caught up in the collateral damage as endowments of other  institutions think carefully about how much money they are willing to  dedicate to illiquid instruments? </p><p>HUTCHINS: Well I think the biggest issue with respect to liquidity on  behalf of the institutions that invest in alternative assets, which takes  in private equity, hedge funds, venture capital, et cetera, relates to  hedge funds for two reasons. One is they were bought to -- expected to own  liquid instruments which were rendered illiquid by the liquidity crisis. </p><p>And second, they were thought to have - expected by their investors to have  periodic liquidity and many of them put up what are called gates and  restricted people's access to their securities. So I think that issue, the  liquidity problem that we've all faced relates more to the hedge fund  business model than to the private equity business model that was well  understood to be an illiquid asset class. </p><p>That's point one.  Point two is as the resources in certain pools of  capital shrink, there might well be smaller-sized funds in the future.  There might well be less robust fundraising. But on the other hand that is  being offset by large pools of new capital in other geographies of the  world entering the alternative asset market.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHATZKER: China, Singapore, that kind of thing? </p><p>HUTCHINS: Yes, exactly right. </p><p>SCHATZKER: Okay, with about 30 seconds to go, you focus on tech. We just  saw a big tech deal today - Dell buying Pro Systems (ph), yesterday in  fact. How is that going to affect your business? You've got a lot of big  tech interests? You're competing for some of the same companies. </p><p>HUTCHINS: Look,  I want to first congratulate the guys at Dell for  that transaction.. I thought it was a terrific idea what they did and they  are on the right track combining services with their hardware offering. And  it is consistent with a broad theme that we have had of the consolidation  generally in the technology industry and the consolidation specifically in  the services sector. So it is very consistent with our investment model.  There are plenty of companies out there for us to invest in. We're not  competing with Michael Dell for any businesses.</p><p>SCHATZKER: All right, Glenn. Thank you very much.

Glenn, we have to start off with Skype. It's in the headlines. It's  obviously the subject of some litigation. I wouldn't be surprised if you  are a little bit constrained on what you can say, but I do want to ask you  this. The founders of Skype have taken what some people might call a  scorched earth tactic with regard to litigation. Has this caught you off  guard? Are you surprised?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  GLENN HUTCHINS, CO-CEO, SILVER LAKE PARTNERS: No comment. </p><p>  SCHATZKER: Okay,  just so our viewers are clear that is basically  where we're going to go on the subject of Skype because I don't want to  waste their time. I certainly don't want to waste yours. Okay, let's move  on then. </p><p> Let's talk about finance. The G-20 taking place this week in Pittsburgh.  You have written passionately about how we need to look at the credit  crisis, how it developed, and where we need to go from here. A lot of focus  at the G-20 on bonuses. You're not a banker, but you do business with these  people. You were in the Clinton Administration, you understand the kinds of  pressures that policy makers are under. Are they taking the right approach? </p><p>  HUTCHINS: By the way, do I get a break on my terminal service - price  break on my terminal service for being here today? </p><p>  SCHATZKER: We'll have to talk with the Chair -</p><p>  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>  HUTCHINS: I think what we need to do is restore confidence in the  financial markets. Obviously the bonus issue is one that has created a  bunch of political agita. I think the background of that is that we are in  a time period in which American incomes have stagnated. A lot of people  have suffered. </p><p> Unemployment is going up substantially. America is in a transition in  important parts of our manufacturing base are in decline. And to see people  making this much money, even though it might have been earned or might have  been justified in some uneconomic sense, it's a political problem and it  creates a lack of confidence. It contributes to a lack of confidence in the  markets. So I think in general what we can do - again, this doesn't relate  to me, it doesn't relate to my firm, except that we as participants in the  broader economy, I think what we can do to restore confidence with  appropriate regulation of compensation as part of that is the appropriate  thing to do. </p><p>  SCHATZKER: When we think about regulating financial services, are  there any guiding principles you think we need to follow? </p><p>  HUTCHINS: Yes, I think in general there are two key rationales for  regulation. One is systemic risk. Does the firm generate, or its activities  generate systemic risk? Do we need to regulate it to protect the system? </p><p> And second, is there consumer protection element? And because we do need to  protect consumers and make sure again people can have trust in the  marketplace to do business with folks. And I think we learned some from the  mortgage economy that a whole bunch of people got products that were  inappropriate for them, whether they were knowledgeable about it or not. We  don't know. And so, to protect consumers from those sort of problems and  create consumer confidence in the financial system again, I think, is very  important. </p><p>  SCHATZKER: Consumer protection and systemic risk. Okay, as you point  out, you're not effectively part of Wall Street. Why was it important to  you to go back and understand this debate? </p><p>  HUTCHINS: Well I am an investor. Two things - one is that I, as an  investor - I think you need to have to a very thorough understanding of the  macro economic environment as a backdrop to what your investments are, what  your investments can be. And also, I think that if you have a perspective  that is useful to public debate, you have some degree of an obligation to  share it with others. </p><p>  SCHATZKER: Okay, let's talk about private equity. It did seem back in  2007 like it was the golden age. Doesn't feel like the golden age anymore.  There is a lack of leverage that affects some firms perhaps more than  yours, but there is also a premium being placed on liquidity, as Larry Fink  of Blackrock reminded us the other day. People shouldn't be under the  misunderstanding perhaps that private equity is a liquid investment, but  could it be caught up in the collateral damage as endowments of other  institutions think carefully about how much money they are willing to  dedicate to illiquid instruments? </p><p>  HUTCHINS: Well I think the biggest issue with respect to liquidity on  behalf of the institutions that invest in alternative assets, which takes  in private equity, hedge funds, venture capital, et cetera, relates to  hedge funds for two reasons. One is they were bought to -- expected to own  liquid instruments which were rendered illiquid by the liquidity crisis. </p><p> And second, they were thought to have - expected by their investors to have  periodic liquidity and many of them put up what are called gates and  restricted people's access to their securities. So I think that issue, the  liquidity problem that we've all faced relates more to the hedge fund  business model than to the private equity business model that was well  understood to be an illiquid asset class. </p><p> That's point one.  Point two is as the resources in certain pools of  capital shrink, there might well be smaller-sized funds in the future.  There might well be less robust fundraising. But on the other hand that is  being offset by large pools of new capital in other geographies of the  world entering the alternative asset market.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> SCHATZKER: China, Singapore, that kind of thing? </p><p> HUTCHINS: Yes, exactly right. </p><p> SCHATZKER: Okay, with about 30 seconds to go, you focus on tech. We just  saw a big tech deal today - Dell buying Pro Systems (ph), yesterday in  fact. How is that going to affect your business? You've got a lot of big  tech interests? You're competing for some of the same companies. </p><p>  HUTCHINS: Look,  I want to first congratulate the guys at Dell for  that transaction.. I thought it was a terrific idea what they did and they  are on the right track combining services with their hardware offering. And  it is consistent with a broad theme that we have had of the consolidation  generally in the technology industry and the consolidation specifically in  the services sector. So it is very consistent with our investment model.  There are plenty of companies out there for us to invest in. We're not  competing with Michael Dell for any businesses.</p><p>  SCHATZKER: All right, Glenn. Thank you very much. Glenn Hutchins, Co- CEO of Silver lake Partners.</p><p>  HUTCHINS: So do I get that price break?</p><p>  SCHATZKER: We'll be talking about it.</p><p>  14:17 </p><p> ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Bloomberg LP cannot guarantee its accuracy.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GLENN HUTCHINS, CO-CEO OF SILVER LAKE PARTNERS, TALKS TO BLOOMBERG'S ERIK SCHATZKER ABOUT DELL.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEPTEMBER 22, 2009</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SPEAKERS: ERIK SCHATZKER, BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GLENN HUTCHINS, CO-CEO, SILVER LAKE PARTNERS</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">14:12</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ERIK SCHATZKER, BLOOMBERG NEWS: We are here with Glenn Hutchins. Glenn, we have to start off with Skype. It's in the headlines. It's obviously the subject of some litigation. I wouldn't be surprised if you are a little bit constrained on what you can say, but I do want to ask you this. The founders of Skype have taken what some people might call a scorched earth tactic with regard to litigation. Has this caught you off guard? Are you surprised?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GLENN HUTCHINS, CO-CEO, SILVER LAKE PARTNERS: No comment.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Okay, just so our viewers are clear that is basically where we're going to go on the subject of Skype because I don't want to waste their time. I certainly don't want to waste yours. Okay, let's move on then.</p><p>Let's talk about finance. The G-20 taking place this week in Pittsburgh. You have written passionately about how we need to look at the credit crisis, how it developed, and where we need to go from here. A lot of focus at the G-20 on bonuses. You're not a banker, but you do business with these people. You were in the Clinton Administration, you understand the kinds of pressures that policy makers are under. Are they taking the right approach?</p><p>HUTCHINS: By the way, do I get a break on my terminal service - price break on my terminal service for being here today?</p><p>SCHATZKER: We'll have to talk with the Chair -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HUTCHINS: I think what we need to do is restore confidence in the financial markets. Obviously the bonus issue is one that has created a bunch of political agita. I think the background of that is that we are in a time period in which American incomes have stagnated. A lot of people have suffered.</p><p>Unemployment is going up substantially. America is in a transition in important parts of our manufacturing base are in decline. And to see people making this much money, even though it might have been earned or might have been justified in some uneconomic sense, it's a political problem and it creates a lack of confidence. It contributes to a lack of confidence in the markets. So I think in general what we can do - again, this doesn't relate to me, it doesn't relate to my firm, except that we as participants in the broader economy, I think what we can do to restore confidence with appropriate regulation of compensation as part of that is the appropriate thing to do.</p><p>SCHATZKER: When we think about regulating financial services, are there any guiding principles you think we need to follow?</p><p>HUTCHINS: Yes, I think in general there are two key rationales for regulation. One is systemic risk. Does the firm generate, or its activities generate systemic risk? Do we need to regulate it to protect the system?</p><p>And second, is there consumer protection element? And because we do need to protect consumers and make sure again people can have trust in the marketplace to do business with folks. And I think we learned some from the mortgage economy that a whole bunch of people got products that were inappropriate for them, whether they were knowledgeable about it or not. We don't know. And so, to protect consumers from those sort of problems and create consumer confidence in the financial system again, I think, is very important.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Consumer protection and systemic risk. Okay, as you point out, you're not effectively part of Wall Street. Why was it important to you to go back and understand this debate?</p><p>HUTCHINS: Well I am an investor. Two things - one is that I, as an investor - I think you need to have to a very thorough understanding of the macro economic environment as a backdrop to what your investments are, what your investments can be. And also, I think that if you have a perspective that is useful to public debate, you have some degree of an obligation to share it with others.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Okay, let's talk about private equity. It did seem back in 2007 like it was the golden age. Doesn't feel like the golden age anymore. There is a lack of leverage that affects some firms perhaps more than yours, but there is also a premium being placed on liquidity, as Larry Fink of Blackrock reminded us the other day. People shouldn't be under the misunderstanding perhaps that private equity is a liquid investment, but could it be caught up in the collateral damage as endowments of other institutions think carefully about how much money they are willing to dedicate to illiquid instruments?</p><p>HUTCHINS: Well I think the biggest issue with respect to liquidity on behalf of the institutions that invest in alternative assets, which takes in private equity, hedge funds, venture capital, et cetera, relates to hedge funds for two reasons. One is they were bought to -- expected to own liquid instruments which were rendered illiquid by the liquidity crisis.</p><p>And second, they were thought to have - expected by their investors to have periodic liquidity and many of them put up what are called gates and restricted people's access to their securities. So I think that issue, the liquidity problem that we've all faced relates more to the hedge fund business model than to the private equity business model that was well understood to be an illiquid asset class.</p><p>That's point one. Point two is as the resources in certain pools of capital shrink, there might well be smaller-sized funds in the future. There might well be less robust fundraising. But on the other hand that is being offset by large pools of new capital in other geographies of the world entering the alternative asset market.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SCHATZKER: China, Singapore, that kind of thing?</p><p>HUTCHINS: Yes, exactly right.</p><p>SCHATZKER: Okay, with about 30 seconds to go, you focus on tech. We just saw a big tech deal today - Dell buying Pro Systems (ph), yesterday in fact. How is that going to affect your business? You've got a lot of big tech interests? You're competing for some of the same companies.</p><p>HUTCHINS: Look, I want to first congratulate the guys at Dell for that transaction.. I thought it was a terrific idea what they did and they are on the right track combining services with their hardware offering. And it is consistent with a broad theme that we have had of the consolidation generally in the technology industry and the consolidation specifically in the services sector. So it is very consistent with our investment model. There are plenty of companies out there for us to invest in. We're not competing with Michael Dell for any businesses.</p><p>SCHATZKER: All right, Glenn. Thank you very much. Glenn Hutchins, Co- CEO of Silver lake Partners.</p><p>HUTCHINS: So do I get that price break?</p><p>SCHATZKER: We'll be talking about it.</p><p>14:17</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

The outcome of this is seen in the growing global power of companies such as Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook and Alibaba.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A leading businessman attending the Summit brought home the palpable fear inside some Australian companies about platforms such as Amazon when he described it to Chanticleer as a \"really scary company\".</p><p>But there were a number of optimistic messages to come out of the panel discussion about the \"platform revolution\". The panel included platform economics expert Sangeet Choudary, Maile Carnegie, who is group executive digital banking at ANZ Banking Group, and Adrian Turner, the chief executive of the CSIRO's data innovation division, Data61.</p><p>It sounds counter-intuitive, but Carnegie said that in financial services the most sensible response to the growth in the power of disruptors from the United States and China is for Australia's big four banks to be increasingly open with their data.</p><p>\"We very much take the view that data is going to become just like our customers' money,\" she said. \"By definition, banking is going to open up, but the critical question is who wins out of that change.</p><p>\"When we open up data, not just in banking, but across other industries, we need to make sure we do it in a way that is sensible in terms of the social implications, and that the increase in competition is going to genuinely open up competition between local players, rather than playing into the hands of the big tech giants.</p><p>\"I joined the banking industry 18 months ago on the assumption that we were going to see a significant acceleration both of pace and scale of disruption in the industry. I think when we look back we will say that the change has been evolutionary and that it will become revolutionary.\"</p><p>Turner said there was an opportunity for Australia to take advantage of its data resources in health and agriculture to build its own platforms, which could achieve global leadership.</p><p>\"We produce enough agricultural exports to feed about 1 per cent of the world's population; that is a growth market for this country because counterfeit food is a real problem,\" he said.</p><p>\"In other countries, as much as 50 per cent of Australian beef products is switched for counterfeit products on the ground.</p><p>\"If we want to command a premium for our agriculture exports, we need to be able to attest to the provenance of our products. There is no one company that can do that at the minute, but there is a public private partnership opportunity that could.\"</p><p>Choudary said there will be two winners and lots of losers from the platform revolution. The first category of winners includes the platforms themselves and the second category includes the niche producers with unique products.</p><p>The losing category includes everyone else. Choudary says these businesses will be commoditised.</p><p>Regulators will inevitably have to respond to the growth and expansion of platforms but they will have to be careful not to make them even stronger, according to Carnegie.</p><p>She believes competition laws are antiquated when applied to the globalisation of a business and the speed of innovation. Also, she says the platform companies will themselves be disrupted.</p><p>\"The big tech companies that we currently talk about are incredibly powerful, but as things move, companies like Google are going to have to really pedal very, very hard to be able to move from a desktop and mobile world to a natural language interface world, so we are going to see ongoing disruption,\" she told the Summit. \"As governments look to regulate they are potentially going to regulate in a way that is going to be advantageous to the existing platform players.</p><p>\"They are going to do it because they want to open up competition and to stimulate start-ups, which is good, but if you look at the open economy and open data platform in Australia, if we are not careful and there aren't reciprocal data-sharing rights you are basically going to strengthen the platform providers more than the start-ups.\"</p><p>For example, Choudary says in the US, Amazon receives an 80 per cent discount from courier companies for the delivery of goods. That enhances the network effects of the Amazon platform because only those on the platform can enjoy this benefit.</p><p>Another example he gave of Amazon's power and influence was its access to information made available to it through its ownership of Amazon Web Services (AWS). He says spikes in data usage could be a guide to top performing businesses that may be the subject of investment by Amazon's venture fund.</p><p>Choudary said we need to get the governance of platforms right without standing in the way of innovation. He said AWS had made it easier for start-ups to reach critical mass at low cost.</p><p>Turner said if you apply platform thinking to a country level there are two types of countries that will succeed: those with scale and those that differentiate.</p><p>The problem is Australia does not have either. The challenge was to identify where we have natural competitive advantage; the most obvious sector was healthcare because of the rich data.</p><p>\"Australia has a phenomenal healthcare system - this is such a wonderful global opportunity for us,\" he said.</p><p>Carnegie said Australia does not understand the quality of its healthcare assets. \"As a nation we need to start looking and defining our critical assets differently.</p><p>\"We are one of the few countries in the world that has a quality healthcare database and we don't think of it as a national asset, but if you were in America right now, trying to look at their healthcare system, they would be begging to have the quality of data that we have because of Medicare and few other things.\"</p><p>Carnegie, who is a member of the advisory board of Innovation and Science Australia, said we need to re-invent our vocational training system.</p><p>TONY BOYD</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.boyd@fairfaxmedia.com.au\">tony.boyd@fairfaxmedia.com.au</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc6z5ekh86zd21gwvbpfvi</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RT8-SN81-JD34-V0Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

No, nor would I. But you need not worry. There are rules that prevent the marketing of alcohol before the 9pm watershed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The same, alas, cannot be said for the social media platforms where our children increasingly congregate. Unlike broadcasters and publishers, Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat are not subject to regulation. There are mountains of inappropriate material on these platforms, and little to stop children stumbling on them.</p><p>This problem was underlined last week when spirits giant Diageo pulled out of Snapchat over concerns that its ads were being shown to people under the age of 18. Its Captain Morgan brand had been a \"sponsored lens\" campaign on Snapchat, allowing British users to superimpose the rum brand's pirate mascot on to selfies. It's the kind of harmless frippery commonplace on social media sites.</p><p>What Diageo did not realise was that the tool was being shown to thousands of under-18s. Under the advertising code, media companies are not allowed to show alcohol commercials if 25% of the audience is below drinking age, but the FTSE giant had been assured by Snapchat that 77% of its British users were old enough to buy alcohol. The Captain Morgan campaign could run.</p><p>As it turned out, Snapchat's data is unreliable, to say the least. The minimum age for setting up a Snapchat account is 13. The company, however, does not check users' credentials when they register and plenty of pre-teens provide an incorrect date of birth to get a Snapchat account.</p><p>Its users are, in reality, considerably younger than the data Snapchat provided to Diageo to win its business. The spirits maker had, unwittingly, fallen foul of the rules. Last week, Britain's advertising watchdog rapped Captain Morgan on the knuckles for failing to take \"sufficient care\" that its ads were not being shown to minors. Diageo immediately pulled out of Snapchat.</p><p>I'd imagine that chief executive Ivan Menezes was both angry and embarrassed. His marketing team had, in effect, been hoodwinked by the social media giant.</p><p>The row may be small beer when set against the YouTube furore last year, but it shows that, despite the endless scandals, big tech still treats its users and advertisers with disdain.</p><p>Facebook has rightly been vilified for disseminating fake news during the US presidential election and failing to stamp out cyber-bullying.</p><p>Last week, founder <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>penned a new year letter, pledging to heal the wounds in society and \"protect our community from abuse and hate\".</p><p>We have heard these hollow pieties from the Facebook founder many times before. He and his peers have been blinded by avarice for too long. Unless they open their eyes and clean up their houses soon, regulators will do the work for them.Has the Premier League peaked? Since the Premier League's inception in 1992 (then the Premiership), broadcast rights auctions have been a cause for jubilation in football club boardrooms. Like bubbles in a champagne flute, the bonanzas just kept going up and up.</p><p>The latest round of bidding, which kicks off in coming weeks, could prove sobering. The last sale of domestic broadcast rights in 2015 saw Sky and BT splash out more than \u00a35bn for a three-year deal - a 70% jump from the previous contract.</p><p>However, the era of hyper-inflation could be drawing to an end. Football viewing figures are lacklustre. BT is operating under great constraints after a number of own goals, including an accounting scandal in Italy. Sky, meanwhile, is looking to pour more of its cash into high-end dramas, while it waits to be subsumed by Fox and then Disney. Sky and BT also appear to have arrived at an informal armistice. Last month they signed a deal to sell each others' sports channels.</p><p>The Premier League's great hope is that one of the Silicon Valley giants will enter the fray. That sounds like wishful thinking. It's far more likely that Amazon and Facebook will bid for the much cheaper international rights packages.</p><p>As they contemplate the January sales, club chairmen would do well to pause and reflect.A moral compass Most FTSE 100 chief executives would jump at the chance to join the prime minister's council of business leaders.

Perhaps, the main challenge is that people expect their online news to be available for free.  \"It took a while for the music industry to get hold of internet piracy but they did, thus enabling services like Spotify and iTunes to prosper. In news, it wasn\u2019t piracy but rather the BBC, which expanded rapidly into publishing written news stories online and for free, thereby making it impossible for all but the most niche news publications to build a digital paid-for subscription business. </p><p> \u201cI am a big supporter of the BBC but I am happy that one of the recommendations of the recent Cairncross report was to ask Ofcom to review whether the online content of the BBC has crept too far away from its Charter obligations and has lost the distinctiveness, relevancy, quality and trust which underpins these obligations.  \"Given the difficulty of asking people to pay for news in the UK (indeed only seven per cent said they would be willing to do so in the latest Reuters survey), most news publishers have therefore adopted a strategy of building significant online scale and making money through digital advertising.  \u201cGiven that advertising money tends to flow to where people are spending their time, the digital advertising market has exploded in recent years and in 2018 was worth \u00a312bn in the UK; that\u2019s more than twice the amount spent on TV advertising.  Mr Fox praised the ability of digital to better understand reader engagement, but also highlighted digital platforms\u2019 brand safety problems, he said: \u201cEach month our digital brands reach 38m people in the UK and a similar number overseas. We have never had such a huge readership as we have now. It also enables us to create far more content, unrestricted by the constraints of a fixed pagination paper. In addition, digital enables us to expand beyond words and pictures into video, podcasts, email newsletters and social media story formats.  \u201c\u2026In print, reader feedback is restricted to the letters page. In digital we can have a real time and two-way dialogue with our readers. Digital also gives us access to a whole new toolbox for finding new stories by analyzing what\u2019s happening on Twitter, Facebook and elsewhere.  \u201cHowever, consumers are becoming worried about how their personal data is being used for commercial purposes and regulators are becoming increasingly concerned about the emergence of a small number of big players in digital markets.  \u201cDigital advertisers want to ensure that their adverts appear in a brand safe environment, and as such will increasingly seek to advertise on trusted digital news brands rather than allowing their ads to appear randomly in the wild west of the world wide web.     \u201cI\u2019m proud that at Reach we are making a successful digital transition. Last year we attracted over \u00a3100m of digital advertising to our news sites. That\u2019s \u00a3100m we didn\u2019t have a few years ago.\u201d  Print remains an important part of Reach\u2019s identity and output, Mr Fox said: \u201cJust like Mark Twain, reports of its death have been grossly exaggerated. The biggest national stories in today's news agenda still originate in print. When Boris Johnson wants to make an impact - which is most days really - he writes a letter or a column in the Daily Telegraph.  \u201c\u2026Every single day the power of print is evident and I'm hugely proud of that. It was very reassuring to see that in last year\u2019s Edelman Trust barometer there has been a huge increase in trust in traditional media, reaching levels not seen since 2012.  \u201cMillions of readers still enjoy the physicality of the printed newspaper. There is nothing like the serendipity of browsing through a paper and coming across a stunning photo, a witty political observation, an insightful opinion piece or a moving human interest story. Indeed, I believe that the newspaper still represents extraordinary value for money and as an industry we have undervalued and under-priced it for years.\u201d     In his concluding remarks, Mr Fox spoke about recent print successes and the mood shifting away from social media following recent safety issues on platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.  He concluded: \u201cIt seems that advertisers have realised that the pendulum may have swung too far towards digital advertising and needs to swing back towards traditional media such as print. In addition, public opinion and the legislative process is also finally catching up with some of the negative consequences of the digital world.  \u201cThe recent reports from Caincross, the DCMS Select Committee, and the Furman report in the UK; the Copyright directive going through the European Parliament and the huge fines being imposed on Facebook, Google and Apple for anti-trust, privacy and tax avoidance violations by the EU combined with the calls to break up \u2018Big Tech\u2019 from Senator Elizabeth Warren in the US, all point to tightening digital regulation across the globe.  \u201cAnd the tragic suicide of Molly Russell, whose father blamed, in part, the images of self-harm she had seen on Instagram and the horrors of the New Zealand mosque atrocity, broadcast live on Facebook, feel like seminal moments in galvanising public opinion and political energy towards creating a more level playing field between the digital and physical worlds.  \u201cAt the same time as the mood shifts away from social media, there are great print success stories to be told. The Economist is seeing increases in print subscriptions. The Guardian has launched a new international weekly print publication. The Week and Week Junior were sold last year to Exponent for \u00a3166 million and we ourselves have made significant investments in print, buying the Regional titles of Local World in 2015 and the publishing assets of Northern &amp; Shell in 2018.  \u201cWe recently opened a Sunday print edition of the Manchester Evening News. And print is increasingly attracting the Silicon Valley tech tycoons. Amazon chief Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, biotech entrepreneur Patrick Soon-Shiong bought the Los Angeles Times, and Alibaba boss Jack Ma purchased the South China Morning Post\u2026 Print may not have the power it had in the 18th Century, but don\u2019t write it off just yet.\u201d  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN925283120190329</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VS6-KNH1-J9XT-P4JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1065\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 29, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Congress should handle developing federal privacy regulations and not leave the task to the agency, Simons continued. Sen. Marco Rubio's, R-Fla., privacy legislation directs the FTC to deliver privacy regulation recommendations to Congress (see 1901160047). Simons didn't mention Rubio's bill, however. \"We've suggested that they not dump it on us by saying 'you take care of it, you come up with rules, you come up with regulations,'\" Simons said. \"We don't want that. We want Congress to do that.\"</p><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee and lawmakers should resist using antitrust law as a political weapon, said the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity Friday. Citing Sen. Elizabeth Warren's, D-Mass., proposal to break up big tech, the group launched an advertising campaign that will target committee member states and Washington, D.C. \"To prevent a politicization of an important process, antitrust decisions should be made by the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice -- not by political leaders campaigning for elected office,\" said Senior Tech Policy Analyst Billy Easley.</p><p>Privacy has societal implications that Congress needs to address, and the developing patchwork of state laws is an impetus to act, Simons said. If Congress delivers a bill, he reiterated the agency is seeking civil penalty authority, \"targeted\" rulemaking authority as in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and eliminating common carrier and nonprofit exemptions from regulatory scrutiny.</p><p>Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., reintroduced her opt-in consent data privacy bill Friday, as expected (see 1903040054). It would grant the FTC first-offense civil penalty authority and targeted rulemaking authority. It would require companies obtain independent privacy audits.</p><p>Information Technology and Innovation Foundation Vice President Daniel Castro lauded DelBene's bill, saying it shows it's \"possible to protect consumers without undermining innovation.\" The plan would \"significantly strengthen the FTC's enforcement capabilities, establish uniform national rules for the digital economy, and ensure businesses are focused on protecting consumers' most sensitive information,\" he wrote.</p><p>A patchwork of state laws can make it \"harder\" for companies to defend themselves in cases, said National Association of Attorneys General Multistate Antitrust Task Force Chair Sarah Oxenham Allen at the ABA event. States do sometimes jointly negotiate settlements, but a company can face up to 51 different cases with different standards, she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDEM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VS2-XTK1-JC8G-83DX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"497\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 01, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., asked the commission about President Donald Trump's social media executive order (see 2008040059).</p><p>The FTC has jurisdiction over \"commercial speech,\" not political content curation, said Simons: \"If we see complaints that are not in our jurisdiction, then we don't do anything. If we see complaints that are, we take a closer look and figure out whether there's a violation. And then we determine whether it's appropriate to act.\" The EO directs the agency to review speech complaints (see 2007230072) and \"consider taking action\" to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices by entities covered under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The agency hasn't taken \"any action according to the executive order,\" Simons said.</p><p>Ranking member Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., announced plans to introduce federal legislation granting the FTC price-gouging authority (see 2006190055). The law would make clear it's an illegal practice and would impose civil penalties for deceptive emergency-related scams like those during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>\"This one is a layup I think a lot of people agree on,\" Cantwell told us, saying she hopes to gain Republican sponsors. \"We'll just have to get the definition right and the parameters right.\" The FTC should be able to use the authority in a time of \"emergency for the defined period of time that just basically says these are excessive pricing,\" she said.</p><p>Wicker said at the hearing he's looking forward to seeing the bill. \"We'd be very open to discussing it,\" he told us afterward, saying there haven't been extensive discussions, which may be a function of scheduling.</p><p>Senate Consumer Protection Subcommittee Chairman Jerry Moran, R-Kan., noted his panel has explored the issue with the FTC. Whether he can support a bill from Cantwell, he told us, \"all depends on the details of the bill, but price gouging is not acceptable, is contrary to protecting consumers.\"</p><p>\"There ought to be certainly federal authority clearly on price gouging,\" Senate Consumer Protection Subcommittee ranking member Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told us, noting his support in other contexts. \"I look forward to supporting hers or some measure.\"</p><p>\"It sounds like something I'd support, but it is not something I've thought about yet,\" Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., told us.</p><p>FTC Testimony</p><p>The FTC Technology Enforcement Division is pursuing a number of \"very significant investigations\" against Big Tech platforms, Simons told the panel.</p><p>He asked Congress to clarify Section 13b of the FTC Act, which the agency relies on to recoup penalties for consumers. He also urged passage of federal privacy legislation, with civil penalty authority, FTC jurisdiction over nonprofits and common carriers and Administrative Procedure Act rulemaking, a request Simons has made repeatedly. Commissioners Noah Phillips, Rohit Chopra, Christine Wilson and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter discussed the importance of passing federal privacy legislation, though the Democrats raised concerns about preempting state laws.</p><p>Chopra and Wilson cited the need to scrutinize CDA Section 230 and potential abuse from the tech industry. There's bipartisan consensus the protections have been abused, and scrutiny is warranted, Chopra said in response to Wicker's questions about the EO. Big Tech has \"too much power\" to dictate policy and regulation, the FTC member said without addressing Trump's order. Chopra made some \"very good\" points about some companies being too powerful, Wicker said.</p><p>Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, raised speech concerns about online content moderation. Phillips said it's a difficult question, but online speech moderation has First Amendment implications, and it's something the FTC has to keep in mind.</p><p>Wilson noted her public statement with Chopra (see 2006110065) about the need to review targeted advertising and how data monetization affects content curation: \"This issue is a really important one.\" Wicker asked if studies are underway. Wilson said nothing has been announced.</p><p>The FTC would support a federal price-gouging statute, Simons told Cantwell. Slaughter suggested clear definitions to bring cases, and Chopra said no federal law should preempt state laws. He suggested criminal penalties for certain price gougers.</p><p>Cantwell agreed content curation is a problem, and is undermining the newspaper industry. Big Tech controls the entry point and is limiting the options of newspaper companies, she said.</p><p>Citing the recent House hearing with Big Tech CEOs (see 2008030057), Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., asked Simons if the agency should explore past acquisitions. Simons declined to discuss specifics about investigations, saying there's litigation. The commission \"dearly\" needs resources for antitrust probes, Simons said, noting the agency was twice the size in the 1980s.</p><p>Wicker, Moran, Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., raised concerns about the invalidation of the Privacy Shield (see 2007240031, asking how the agency plans to enforce obligations. Companies just need to follow whatever promises they made as part of the PS, Simons said. They can say they're no longer certified under the agreement, which will free them of their obligations, but the agency will uphold enforcement against unmet promises, Simons said. It's unfair for the EU to hold the U.S. to a standard that other EU members aren't meeting, Phillips told Blackburn, noting the agency will do whatever it can to ensure companies can continue transferring data securely.</p><p>The FTC and the Commerce Department should work with their European counterparts to create interim PS guidance to \"protect consumers and help businesses,\" Wicker and Cantwell wrote Wednesday in a letter with House Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, D-N.J., and ranking member Greg Walden, R-Ore. \"Thousands of American businesses that rely on Privacy Shield are left with few options for the processing of data from the EU,\" they wrote, saying it's \"critical\" to avoid unnecessary disruption to businesses.</p><p>Blumenthal asked Simons if the FTC would depose Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in the current antitrust case. Simons declined to offer specifics. He said sometimes it's important to depose executives, and sometimes it's not necessary.</p><p>Thune discussed his Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency Act (see 2007280053), introduced with Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii. He asked Simons how consumers would benefit if civil enforcement from federal agencies were allowed, as written in the bill. It's fairly common for the FTC to battle Section 230 defenses in court, so it would be very helpful to avoid that and allow the agency to go after platform participants and platforms, Simons responded.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JT-3BR1-JC8G-8001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1150\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 06, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Even as the financial crisis raged, the former computer programmer has talked up the importance of upgrading the bank's systems. On February 20th, BBVA bought Simple, an American online-banking platform, for $117m, in a deal that hints at the potential for innovators to shake up retail banking.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BBVA, with ?607 billion in assets and 50m customers, believes that traditional banks will soon lose their monopoly on banking. In an opinion piece in the Financial Times last year, Mr Gonzalez warned that banks faced certain death unless they took on the likes of Amazon or Google. New entrants will not have the legacy costs of banks and can tempt clients with convenient mobile apps. He predicts mobile services could even triple the number of bank customers worldwide in the next decade. </p><p>Internet banking has had false starts before and thus far big tech companies have not really ventured into the low-margin, highly regulated and capital-intensive world of retail banking. True, non-banks have had some success in places like Kenya, which lacks an adequate banking network. And niche players like PayPal are thriving in payments. But their impact has been limited. \"I am dying to fund a disruptive bank,\" <person><nameText>Marc Andreessen, </nameText></person>a venture capitalist, recently tweeted.</p><p>Banks have several lines of defence, says Jason Napier, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. They have millions of customers who tend to stay put. What is more, barriers to replicating technology are relatively low: cool new apps developed in Silicon Valley can be quickly copied by banks.</p><p>Still, he says a revolution is afoot, if not perceptible. As consumers do more banking on their mobile phones, visits to branches are falling. Simple says its clients login 2.4 times a day, on average. That compares with the mere handful of interactions most customers have with bank branches in a year. Its app allows users to work out how much it is \"safe to spend\" instead of simply providing a current balance. And it allows them to extract complex information easily by asking, for instance, how much they had spent on coffee and taxis in New York over the past month. Simple's base of young customers has grown by 330% in a year to 100,000.</p><p>If technology barriers are low, why didn't BBVA simply develop its own app? Time may be one factor. Another may be culture. Carlos Torres, head of BBVA's strategy and corporate development, says it is hard for a large organisation to replicate the entrepreneurial talent of an upstart. The Simple deal also suggests new entrants might still need banks. Simple itself is not regulated as a bank. Instead it places customers' funds with the Bancorp, which provides banking services to other firms. BBVA plans to move these funds to Compass, its American subsidiary.</p><p>The challenge for BBVA is to make Simple profitable. It plans to roll out new products, such as mortgages, in addition to the checking account that Simple currently offers. BBVA's focus will be on America where its retail business is still sub-scale. In time it hopes to introduce Simple in BBVA's core markets, including Spain and Mexico. It is not clear whether BBVA will eventually adopt Simple's technology for its own clients, or keep it independent.</p><p>For other lenders, upgrading creaky infrastructure to allow zippy functions along the lines of Simple's may be costly, but savings will come from fewer branches. And they still have the heft to buy pesky upstarts that threaten to disrupt them. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-SC4AH82</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BMF-WKP1-DY2R-21TG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"603\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

It got so bad that the Columbia University's Richman Center in November to the problem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, just three months later, the world has changed. In recent weeks, two pioneering fintechs - LendingClub and Varo Money - have proven that direct participation in the banking system is possible for digital financial providers.</p><p>It's looking like 2020 will be the tipping point for fintech movement into the regulated banking space.</p><p>Just this week, LendingClub said it is , marking the first time a major fintech lender is purchasing a bank. The deal is a strategic and financial home run for LendingClub, combining the online consumer lender with a modern, flexible national deposit platform.</p><p>It sets the company on a path for long-term success by stabilizing its core funding, adding needed flexibility to its business model and stripping away costly intermediaries. This is something other fintech lenders should emulate.</p><p>Assuming the deal is approved by regulators, LendingClub would be able to fund its own loan warehouse with deposits, a big savings as compared to borrowing from bank lenders.</p><p>Because it would have a bank balance sheet to work with, LendingClub could be far pickier in deciding when, and at what price, it sells its loans. And the deal completely eliminates the need to pay its current bank partner, WebBank, for its services in originating loans.</p><p>Buying Radius will also help LendingClub turn its loyal customer base into a source of new growth. Today, LendingClub is great at generating new online loan customers, but it has little to offer them beyond its core installment loan products. With the Radius deal, LendingClub will be able to offer its customers a complete suite of financial tools and in time, more automated ways to help customers manage their financial lives seamlessly.</p><p>LendingClub's deal follows closely behind a recent (but long-delayed) decision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to approve Varo Money's application for deposit . This was a which many hope will provide the roadmap for future de novo fintech applicants to take the same path, but in less time.</p><p>Varo's dual-track online banking strategy looks pretty good in retrospect. Varo built a large with a number of revenue streams while it was pursuing a bank license.</p><p>Varo's customer base and brand presence - plus its cloud-based modern IT core -will give it a big head start over other startup banks.</p><p>Of course, there are still obstacles ahead for both LendingClub and Varo.</p><p>LendingClub will need to keep regulators happy with its growth plans, integration roadmap and market strategy for Radius. And Varo Money will have to meet the challenge of moving 1 million synthetic fintech bank customers from its existing partner bank to its new deposit platform - all while building out its lending and fee businesses. Both these things seem achievable.</p><p>There are a couple of points that other fintechs interested in banking should keep in mind when considering the implications of LendingClub and Varo Money.</p><p>The first is that simpler is better: both LendingClub and Varo followed traditional paths to bank ownership by either acquiring an existing insured bank or starting a new bank through the de novo process.</p><p>Neither tried for the more exotic or the Comptroller of the Currency's new fintech charter, . That turned out to be a smart move.</p><p>Although it is rumored that the FDIC will soon approve a couple of new ILC charters, even successful ILC applicants are likely to run into opposition from Congress and small bankers, who worry that big tech companies can to gain a banking license.</p><p>There is nothing in the law to prevent Amazon, Google, Microsoft or Facebook from acquiring one of these new ILCs since the Bank Holding Company Act doesn't apply to that charter. The political stakes and risks for ILC applicants have become higher than ever.</p><p>The second thing to keep in mind is that while the fintech banking door is open, not everyone can enter.</p><p>Both Varo and LendingClub presented themselves to regulators, particularly the FDIC, as \"fintech\" rather than \"tech-fin.\"</p><p>Varo Money is led by a strong team of experienced bankers, and LendingClub's executive ranks are full of the same, soon to be supplemented by Radius Bank's management team. These are people with long histories in regulated banking, and the credibility that goes along with that.</p><p>This contrasts with the more tech-first companies like Robinhood that followed the \"move fast, break things\" ethos of Silicon Valley when they sought a bank charter.</p><p>The FDIC is focused on risk control.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CARDPM-00000170-a055-df0e-ab77-a8d7a6c10003-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CARDPM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBH-XP71-F06X-W0M4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"803\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

It got so bad that the Columbia University's Richman Center in November to the problem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, just three months later, the world has changed. In recent weeks, two pioneering fintechs - LendingClub and Varo Money - have proven that direct participation in the banking system is possible for digital financial providers.</p><p>It's looking like 2020 will be the tipping point for fintech movement into the regulated banking space.</p><p>Just this week, LendingClub said it is , marking the first time a major fintech lender is purchasing a bank. The deal is a strategic and financial home run for LendingClub, combining the online consumer lender with a modern, flexible national deposit platform.</p><p>It sets the company on a path for long-term success by stabilizing its core funding, adding needed flexibility to its business model and stripping away costly intermediaries. This is something other fintech lenders should emulate.</p><p>Assuming the deal is approved by regulators, LendingClub would be able to fund its own loan warehouse with deposits, a big savings as compared to borrowing from bank lenders.</p><p>Because it would have a bank balance sheet to work with, LendingClub could be far pickier in deciding when, and at what price, it sells its loans. And the deal completely eliminates the need to pay its current bank partner, WebBank, for its services in originating loans.</p><p>Buying Radius will also help LendingClub turn its loyal customer base into a source of new growth. Today, LendingClub is great at generating new online loan customers, but it has little to offer them beyond its core installment loan products. With the Radius deal, LendingClub will be able to offer its customers a complete suite of financial tools and in time, more automated ways to help customers manage their financial lives seamlessly.</p><p>LendingClub's deal follows closely behind a recent (but long-delayed) decision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to approve Varo Money's application for deposit . This was a which many hope will provide the roadmap for future de novo fintech applicants to take the same path, but in less time.</p><p>Varo's dual-track online banking strategy looks pretty good in retrospect. Varo built a large with a number of revenue streams while it was pursuing a bank license.</p><p>Varo's customer base and brand presence - plus its cloud-based modern IT core -will give it a big head start over other startup banks.</p><p>Of course, there are still obstacles ahead for both LendingClub and Varo.</p><p>LendingClub will need to keep regulators happy with its growth plans, integration roadmap and market strategy for Radius. And Varo Money will have to meet the challenge of moving 1 million synthetic fintech bank customers from its existing partner bank to its new deposit platform - all while building out its lending and fee businesses. Both these things seem achievable.</p><p>There are a couple of points that other fintechs interested in banking should keep in mind when considering the implications of LendingClub and Varo Money.</p><p>The first is that simpler is better: both LendingClub and Varo followed traditional paths to bank ownership by either acquiring an existing insured bank or starting a new bank through the de novo process.</p><p>Neither tried for the more exotic or the Comptroller of the Currency's new fintech charter, . That turned out to be a smart move.</p><p>Although it is rumored that the FDIC will soon approve a couple of new ILC charters, even successful ILC applicants are likely to run into opposition from Congress and small bankers, who worry that big tech companies can to gain a banking license.</p><p>There is nothing in the law to prevent Amazon, Google, Microsoft or Facebook from acquiring one of these new ILCs since the Bank Holding Company Act doesn't apply to that charter. The political stakes and risks for ILC applicants have become higher than ever.</p><p>The second thing to keep in mind is that while the fintech banking door is open, not everyone can enter.</p><p>Both Varo and LendingClub presented themselves to regulators, particularly the FDIC, as \"fintech\" rather than \"tech-fin.\"</p><p>Varo Money is led by a strong team of experienced bankers, and LendingClub's executive ranks are full of the same, soon to be supplemented by Radius Bank's management team. These are people with long histories in regulated banking, and the credibility that goes along with that.</p><p>This contrasts with the more tech-first companies like Robinhood that followed the \"move fast, break things\" ethos of Silicon Valley when they sought a bank charter.</p><p>The FDIC is focused on risk control.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000170-5f7b-df0e-ab77-dfff92a90001-35</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y84-2H91-JCRW-52TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"803\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SourceMedia, Inc.

It got so bad that the Columbia University's Richman Center in November to the problem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, just three months later, the world has changed. In recent weeks, two pioneering fintechs - LendingClub and Varo Money - have proven that direct participation in the banking system is possible for digital financial providers.</p><p>It's looking like 2020 will be the tipping point for fintech movement into the regulated banking space.</p><p>Just this week, LendingClub said it is , marking the first time a major fintech lender is purchasing a bank. The deal is a strategic and financial home run for LendingClub, combining the online consumer lender with a modern, flexible national deposit platform.</p><p>It sets the company on a path for long-term success by stabilizing its core funding, adding needed flexibility to its business model and stripping away costly intermediaries. This is something other fintech lenders should emulate.</p><p>Assuming the deal is approved by regulators, LendingClub would be able to fund its own loan warehouse with deposits, a big savings as compared to borrowing from bank lenders.</p><p>Because it would have a bank balance sheet to work with, LendingClub could be far pickier in deciding when, and at what price, it sells its loans. And the deal completely eliminates the need to pay its current bank partner, WebBank, for its services in originating loans.</p><p>Buying Radius will also help LendingClub turn its loyal customer base into a source of new growth. Today, LendingClub is great at generating new online loan customers, but it has little to offer them beyond its core installment loan products. With the Radius deal, LendingClub will be able to offer its customers a complete suite of financial tools and in time, more automated ways to help customers manage their financial lives seamlessly.</p><p>LendingClub's deal follows closely behind a recent (but long-delayed) decision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to approve Varo Money's application for deposit . This was a which many hope will provide the roadmap for future de novo fintech applicants to take the same path, but in less time.</p><p>Varo's dual-track online banking strategy looks pretty good in retrospect. Varo built a large with a number of revenue streams while it was pursuing a bank license.</p><p>Varo's customer base and brand presence - plus its cloud-based modern IT core -will give it a big head start over other startup banks.</p><p>Of course, there are still obstacles ahead for both LendingClub and Varo.</p><p>LendingClub will need to keep regulators happy with its growth plans, integration roadmap and market strategy for Radius. And Varo Money will have to meet the challenge of moving 1 million synthetic fintech bank customers from its existing partner bank to its new deposit platform - all while building out its lending and fee businesses. Both these things seem achievable.</p><p>There are a couple of points that other fintechs interested in banking should keep in mind when considering the implications of LendingClub and Varo Money.</p><p>The first is that simpler is better: both LendingClub and Varo followed traditional paths to bank ownership by either acquiring an existing insured bank or starting a new bank through the de novo process.</p><p>Neither tried for the more exotic or the Comptroller of the Currency's new fintech charter, . That turned out to be a smart move.</p><p>Although it is rumored that the FDIC will soon approve a couple of new ILC charters, even successful ILC applicants are likely to run into opposition from Congress and small bankers, who worry that big tech companies can to gain a banking license.</p><p>There is nothing in the law to prevent Amazon, Google, Microsoft or Facebook from acquiring one of these new ILCs since the Bank Holding Company Act doesn't apply to that charter. The political stakes and risks for ILC applicants have become higher than ever.</p><p>The second thing to keep in mind is that while the fintech banking door is open, not everyone can enter.</p><p>Both Varo and LendingClub presented themselves to regulators, particularly the FDIC, as \"fintech\" rather than \"tech-fin.\"</p><p>Varo Money is led by a strong team of experienced bankers, and LendingClub's executive ranks are full of the same, soon to be supplemented by Radius Bank's management team. These are people with long histories in regulated banking, and the credibility that goes along with that.</p><p>This contrasts with the more tech-first companies like Robinhood that followed the \"move fast, break things\" ethos of Silicon Valley when they sought a bank charter.</p><p>The FDIC is focused on risk control.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-00000170-5f7b-df0e-ab77-dfff92a90001-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y80-2G61-F06X-W1X9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"803\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SourceMedia, Inc.

At last week's Financial Review Innovation Summit, Airtree Ventures founder Daniel Petre said the idea of creating an algorithmic committee was \"ridiculous\".</p><p>\"Advertisers decide whether the price they pay for advertising is fair or not on an ROI [return on investment] basis. We don't need any committee of algorithmic geniuses to tell us whether the algorithm is useful or not. That's a complete joke and should be completely cast aside,\" Mr Petre said.</p><p>Mr Sims said critics of the plan seemed to be responding to speculation about what might happen, rather than what was in the report. The report proposes a specialist digital platforms branch be established within the ACCC to develop expertise in digital markets and the use of algorithms, and take action to enforce competition and consumer laws.</p><p>\"The point in relation to what was referred to as an algorithm review committee or something like that, there's no such reference in the report, much less any recommendations to that effect,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>\"What we'll be doing is, either in response to complaints from businesses, or off our own bat, be just testing things with the algorithms by doing what anybody could do, which is just put requests to the algorithms and see what happens.\"</p><p>He said the ACCC wouldn't be looking to get a detailed view of how the Google and Facebook algorithms worked, rather they would be assessing the results of the sites, either off its own bat or as a result of complaints from others.</p><p>New ombudsman</p><p>The ACCC report said Google and Facebook had both the ability and incentive to favour their own related businesses, or commercial partners at the expense of other business users of their platforms.</p><p>It said the opacity of their key algorithms meant there was significant potential for \"self-preferencing\" to substantially lessen competition.</p><p>This was highlighted in a 2017 European Commission ruling that found Google had systematically given prominent placement to its own comparison shopping service Google Shopping, by demoting rival comparison shopping services in its search results.</p><p>\"If it's a complaint about Google, for example, referencing its own travel advisory business to the detriment of Flight Centre, for example, then you can easily put in a lot of searches and find out what the output from the algorithm is,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>\"Then we would have the ability to, in a targeted way, find from Google, why that's happening ... we would have the information-gathering powers to do that, then we would determine whether or not there was anti-competitive behaviour or not.\"</p><p>Mr Sims said the ACCC would need fresh funding in the region of $5 million to establish its new division, and that it would work in concert with a new independent ombudsman to resolve complaints and disputes between businesses or consumers and digital platforms.</p><p>He said Australian companies or consumers that found themselves on the wrong side of a decision or problem from Google or Facebook had no real possibility of redress as they had no idea who to talk to, and no ability to get responses.</p><p>\"This would first of all, give them an avenue to talk Facebook and Google, which they can't now because it's just not possible,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>\"It is very faceless and that is a deliberate tactic. But I think we've got to make sure that they have contacts in Australia that you can contact, and then separately, there would be an ombudsman, if it got that far, that could resolve the issue.\"</p><p>Anti-merger proposal controversial</p><p>From a commercial perspective, one of the most controversial part of the ACCC report was the proposal to change merger laws to add competition factors to question whether an acquisition was removing a potential competitor and whether assets, like the kind of data, held by an acquired company would reduce competition from the market.</p><p>As well as Mr Petre, a number of start-up founders and other members of the local tech scene have warned that restricting the ability for local companies to get acquired by tech giants could stymie the growth prospects of the Australian tech sector.</p><p>On Friday, StartupAUS chief executive Alex McCauley said many start-ups in the tech sector relied on strong merger and acquisition opportunities to build their company's investment case.</p><p>He said that, if acquisitions became more difficult in Australia, it would inevitably weaken the ability to attract investment and reduce the number of high-quality founders choosing to build businesses here.</p><p>\"This ironically would crimp opportunity for new competition from local firms, despite the recommendations aiming to enhance the competitive environment in Australian tech,\" Mr McCauley said.</p><p>\"Lots of start-up founders deliberately target this sort of acquisition as a way to reach a profitable exit. Making this harder or less likely would reduce the ability for successful entrepreneurs to recycle capital back into their next enterprise.</p><p>\"The intention here - to help Australian companies - is a good one. But the bottom line is that making it harder for startups to get acquired isn't good for startups and it isn't good for the economy.\"</p><p>Mr Sims said he had faced similar criticisms when previously expressing concerns about big banks looking to buy up fintech start-ups, but that close regulatory observation was necessary to avoid monopolistic behaviour.</p><p>He said the assessment that an acquisition would substantially lessen competition was a high bar for the ACCC to get over in deciding to block a deal, but that it wouldn't shy away from taking a tough approach.</p><p>\"Taking it to the extreme, if all start-ups got acquired by either the big four banks, or Google and Facebook, then what a terrible outcome that is. I mean, that means there's no competitive threat ever to the incumbents, that's a shocking outcome,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>\" I understand it's a matter of balance, but it has got to be something that substantially lessens competition, and if it does, we will definitely take action.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520163157</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRH-SV81-JBJ7-N14H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1195\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Mr Zuckerberg added that this framework could take the form of a worldwide roll-out of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p><p>Mr Sims, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman, said that getting a global agreement about data protection would be \"a much better\" way to manage the issue and welcomed Mr Zuckerberg's \"recognition\" that big tech companies such as Facebook and Google \"have to be accountable for what people see [on their platforms]\".</p><p>\"But in the short-term that can be very slow and we can't always wait for global agreement because the issues are too pressing,\" he added. \"Countries may have to move on their own, and alignment will come later as these issues can't wait for the slowest country.\"</p><p>Mr Sims spent three days last week at the American Bar Association's anti-trust conference speaking to the European Commission, US Department of Justice and US Fair Trade commission among other competition bodies. Since meeting with the global competition regulators, he said worldwide regulatory alignment was unlikely in the short term and the ACCC would push ahead with its world-first inquiry into the digital platforms' impact on advertising and traditional media. A final report is due in June.</p><p>The final report would likely include \"recommendations that are largely aligned with GDPR but [there will be] important differences as well\", he said.</p><p>\"If you seek global alignment, it's fantastic in theory, and great if it could be done, but each country has to move according to its own views, according to the solutions to the problems.\"</p><p>Facebook and other digital giants such as Google are under increased scrutiny in many countries, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison recently threatening prison time and billions of dollars in fines if extremist content isn't quickly removed.</p><p>The new legislation was in response to a livestream video of the NZ attacks broadcast on Facebook by the alleged gunman and may be presented to the G20 summit in June in a move that signals the Australian government's willingness to work on a global basis for concerns like enforcement.</p><p>'We can't always wait for global agreement because the issues are too pressing.'

At last week's Financial Review Innovation Summit, Airtree Ventures founder Daniel Petre said the idea of creating an algorithmic committee was \"ridiculous\".</p><p>\"Advertisers decide whether the price they pay for advertising is fair or not on an ROI [return on investment] basis. We don't need any committee of algorithmic geniuses to tell us whether the algorithm is useful or not. That's a complete joke and should be completely cast aside,\" Mr Petre said.</p><p>Mr Sims said critics of the plan seemed to be responding to speculation about what might happen, rather than what was in the report. The report proposes a specialist digital platforms branch be established within the ACCC to develop expertise in digital markets and the use of algorithms, and take action to enforce competition and consumer laws.</p><p>\"The point in relation to what was referred to as an algorithm review committee or something like that, there's no such reference in the report, much less any recommendations to that effect,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>\"What we'll be doing is, either in response to complaints from businesses, or off our own bat, be just testing things with the algorithms by doing what anybody could do, which is just put requests to the algorithms and see what happens.\"</p><p>He said the ACCC wouldn't be looking to get a detailed view of how the Google and Facebook algorithms worked, rather they would be assessing the results of the sites, either off its own bat or as a result of complaints from others.</p><p>The ACCC report said Google and Facebook had both the ability and incentive to favour their own related businesses, or commercial partners at the expense of other business users of their platforms.</p><p>It said the opacity of their key algorithms meant there was significant potential for \"self-preferencing\" to substantially lessen competition.</p><p>This was highlighted in a 2017 European Commission ruling that found Google had systematically given prominent placement to its own comparison shopping service Google Shopping, by demoting rival comparison shopping services in its search results.</p><p>\"If it's a complaint about Google, for example, referencing its own travel advisory business to the detriment of Flight Centre, for example, then you can easily put in a lot of searches and find out what the output from the algorithm is,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>\"Then we would have the ability to, in a targeted way, find from Google, why that's happening ... we would have the information-gathering powers to do that. Then we would determine whether or not there was anti-competitive behaviour or not.\"</p><p>Mr Sims said the ACCC would need fresh funding in the region of $5 million to establish its new division, and that it would work in concert with a new independent ombudsman to resolve complaints and disputes between businesses or consumers and digital platforms.</p><p>Australian companies or consumers that found themselves on the wrong side of a decision or problem from Google or Facebook had no real possibility of redress as they had no idea who to talk to, or ability to get responses.</p><p>\"This would, first of all, give them an avenue to talk to Facebook and Google, which they can't now because it's just not possible,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>\"It is very faceless and that is a deliberate tactic. But I think we've got to make sure that they have contacts in Australia that you can contact, and then separately, there would be an ombudsman, if it got that far, that could resolve the issue.\"</p><p>From a commercial perspective, one of the most controversial parts of the ACCC report was the proposal to change merger laws to add competition factors to question whether an acquisition was removing a potential competitor and whether assets, like the kind of data, held by an acquired company would reduce competition from the market.</p><p>As well as Mr Petre, a number of start-up founders and other members of the local tech scene have warned that restricting the ability for local companies to get acquired by tech giants could stymie the growth prospects of the Australian tech sector.</p><p>On Friday, StartupAUS chief executive Alex McCauley said many start-ups in the tech sector relied on strong merger and acquisition opportunities to build their company's investment case.</p><p>He said that, if acquisitions became more difficult in Australia, it would inevitably weaken the ability to attract investment and reduce the number of high-quality founders choosing to build businesses here.</p><p>\"This ironically would crimp opportunity for new competition from local firms, despite the recommendations aiming to enhance the competitive environment in Australian tech,\" Mr McCauley said.</p><p>\"Lots of start-up founders deliberately target this sort of acquisition as a way to reach a profitable exit. Making this harder or less likely would reduce the ability for successful entrepreneurs to recycle capital back into their next enterprise.</p><p>\"The intention here, to help Australian companies, is a good one. But the bottom line is making it harder for start-ups to get acquired isn't good for start-ups and it isn't good for the economy.\"</p><p>Mr Sims said he had faced similar criticisms when previously expressing concerns about big banks looking to buy up fintech start-ups, but that close regulatory observation was necessary to avoid monopolistic behaviour.</p><p>He said the assessment that an acquisition would substantially lessen competition was a high bar for the ACCC to get over in deciding to block a deal, but that it wouldn't shy away from taking a tough approach.</p><p>\"Taking it to the extreme, if all start-ups got acquired by either the big four banks, or Google and Facebook, then what a terrible outcome that is. I mean, that means there's no competitive threat ever to the incumbents. That's a shocking outcome,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>\"I understand it's a matter of balance, but it has got to be something that substantially lessens competition, and if it does, we will definitely take action.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc76j11o3rpxcjxuqv5pm</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WRH-SXY1-JD34-V00C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1190\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Max Mason reports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Competition tsar Rod Sims is not the first to try to find a way to force Facebook and Google to pay for the value they get from journalism on their platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the draft of a compulsory code of conduct - which is a negotiate-arbitrate model - is far from the finish line in the battle to reel in the power of big tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In its decision, the independent arbitrator must consider: the direct value of news content, and how much money is directly made from ads around news content; indirect value - the value to the platforms of actually have the content there (a much harder prospect to measure); the cost of producing news; and whether the payment amount would place an undue burden on Facebook or Google.</p><p>Sims admits that value will be hard to measure, and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission doesn't have the data to do that. He says it is the ACCC's job to correct the imbalance in bargaining power, which is the core issue, rather than the regulator or government setting the price digital platforms should pay media companies.</p><p>\"Value is very hard to work out. I'm sure both sides will have a go at it. You've got value, you've also got cost of journalism, and no undue burden. The three things are all equal,\" Sims tells The Australian Financial Review.</p><p>Rough industry estimates suggest Nine, owner of The Australian Financial Review, and News Corp could spend about $250 million a year on journalism, Australian Community Media and Seven West Media $100 million each, and Network Ten $50 million. The cost is substantial for independents such as Crikey, and regional networks such as Prime Media and WIN Corp.</p><p>Sims says it's the one tangible measure of the three important considerations to begin talks.</p><p>\"The beauty of the cost of journalism is if the number comes out to be 1 per cent ... that's not very sensible,\" he says. \"If it's 100 per cent of the cost of journalism, you'd say 'Well, there's no way the platforms should cover all the costs of journalism.'</p><p>\"So you'd naturally go to 10, 20 or 30, I don't know what the right number is, but you can tell that they provide at least a framework to anchor any discussion of value.\"</p><p>Combining Nine, News Corp, Seven, Ten and ACM would get to at least $750 million a year. Factor in other organisations and spend on journalism would be $1 billion in Australia. Taking 20 per cent of that, $200 million, is a substantial amount of money, and that's before value of journalism to the platforms has been considered.</p><p>The cost of producing journalism will be easier to find, but Sims recognises the value can't just be based on cost.</p><p>\"We all know that print, or these days online, does drive a lot of other media stories,\" says Sims. \"I think newspaper stories do have a degree of importance here. But that's really making the point I'm making - that the parties are well placed to make those points.\"</p><p>Here's where it gets tricky. Value could be very substantial, depending on what it is measured. Google itself admits it sends more than 3 billion clicks to Australian news organisations each year and that is the limit of the value exchange. But would Google actually lose those 3 billion clicks if it didn't have any news, and another search platform did?</p><p>Sims says media companies will be able to ask for information from the tech companies in working out the value. The tech giants will not be able to rely on their own data when making their own case, without providing its information to news media businesses.</p><p>Sims and the government want to curb a major imbalance in bargaining power between Facebook and Google, and local media companies, with the primary goal of fair financial compensation for the value created for the digital giants by having journalism on their platforms.</p><p>\"When you've got this level of imbalance in bargaining power, forcing negotiation, forcing mediation will get you so far. But, having that arbitration at the end does really even up the bargaining power,\" Sims says.</p><p>\"The threat that arbitration is there - parties usually like to avoid arbitration where somebody else determines the outcome - might just drive a range of commercial deals.\"</p><p>The code will give digital platforms and media companies the opportunity to agree to a deal. If they do not, they will go through three months of mediation before moving to a binding final-offer arbitration where the independent arbitrator must choose an offer within 45 days.</p><p>Google and Facebook will have armies of lawyers combing through the draft code of conduct.</p><p>Why? Precedent. Regulators across the world are battling to deal with Facebook and Google's monopolistic powers, and if Sims' model works, you can bet the house the platforms will face similar regimes in other countries.</p><p>\"Australia is seen as innovative in a legislative sense, in that our parliaments produce high-quality legislation in the field of arbitration,\" says Dr Sam Luttrell, international arbitration group partner at law firm Clifford Chance.</p><p>It may be that this code is followed, or may be that this code informs the way governments around the world approach these issues.\"</p><p>While the ACCC is to be commended, Luttrell says, the draft code raises complex legal issues: it is a coercive process and there may not be an appeal, which could see Facebook and Google challenge its constitutional validity; and the timetable of 45 days, for some extremely complex issues, is very short.</p><p>\"There are checks and balances built into the model that are well conceived for the most part, and this is draft legislation, and draft legislation is never perfect, nor is, for that matter, the final act,\" Luttrell says.</p><p>Don't expect the code of conduct to be the end of Google and Facebook's efforts to not pay for news content.</p><p>They've got form of dodging attempts. When regulation was passed in Spain in October 2014 to have Google and other aggregators pay news publishers for products like GoogleNews, the US-based search giant was swift and brutal.</p><p>By mid-December 2014, less than a month before the legislation came into effect, Google simply shut down Google News.</p><p>'Internationally, there have been a number of attempts to make Google and Facebook pay for the use of journalistic content.</p><p>One French proposal required Google to pay for the use of snippets of news articles from French media companies.</p><p>Google reverted to showing only headlines of articles to avoid paying fees, resulting in the French competition regulator ordering Google to negotiate with French publishers. Those negotiations are ongoing.</p><p>Google Australia head of policy Lucinda Longcroft says the ACCC code is not grounded in commercial reality and continues the tech giant's line that there is no market power imbalance.</p><p>\"In terms of the ACCC's report, as a premise we fundamentally disagree with the claim that there is a market power imbalance,\" Longcroft said during a Competition Policy International discussion. \"In fact, the ACCC's and the government's own data showed that we are only a small part of the traffic that news publishers receive from Australian users.</p><p>\"We are deeply concerned about the current draft of the code. It is heavy-handed intervention and does not reflect commercial reality.\"</p><p>Sims says the ACCC has learned from the experiences of Spain, France and Germany in coming up with its model, in that it's related to Google Search and Facebook News Feed, the core products of the two US giants.</p><p>\"[Spain was] something that could be turned off. What we've done, we've learnt from that. In this we're applying it to all media, to all news items,\" he says.</p><p>Citing an economic study done of the Spanish experience, Google, in its submission to the ACCC's efforts to draw up a code of conduct in Australia, notes the negative effect of its decision.</p><p>\"A reduction in the availability and visibility of news in online aggregation services like Google News particularly harms small and medium-sized publishers without established brands,\" the company argues on page 13 of its submission.</p><p>Yet, less than a page later, Google continues to reject the idea there is an imbalance in its relationships with media business.</p><p>\"We do not accept that the current value exchange with NMBs [news media businesses] associated with search results reflects an imbalance in bargaining power.\"</p><p>Though Google News and Google Search are different products, the US tech giant is stating its decisions hurt small and medium publishers in Spain, yet it does not have more power in bargaining with media companies over search results, an area of its business where it is hugely dominant the world over.</p><p>\"To the extent that there is a bargaining power imbalance between NMBs and Google, the bargaining framework should seek to correct that imbalance by creating negotiating conditions that would exist between two arms' length parties with equal bargaining power.</p><p>\"It should not create a framework that creates a bargaining power imbalance or that requires Google to act against its commercial interests (for example, by requiring us to make payments for inputs that don't generate economic value).\"</p><p>Here lies one of the key issues. Google still refuses to acknowledge it holds a dominant position - Sims, the ACCC and the government have long decided they, and Facebook, do - and the Alphabet-owned company believes journalism doesn't hold any value to it worth paying for.</p><p>They don't believe they should pay, so expect legal challenges to come.</p><p>However, Sims says defining news will be relatively easy for most. For example, Nine and News Corp would be put on the list, and once on the list, all of their journalism would be included.</p><p>\"You get through the gate by producing core news, and that's defined as publicly significant issues, journalism that engages Australians in public debate, informs democratic decision-making, journalism relating to community and local events,\" Sims says.</p><p>\"Any one of those headings gets you through the door, and once you're through the door ... then all their news produced by journalists is covered.\"</p><p>If Google and Facebook ran newsrooms, employed and paid thousands of journalists across Australia, then a code of conduct would not be necessary. But they don't do journalism.</p><p>Instead, the code seeks to remunerate the creators of journalism for the value Google and Facebook get from having it on their platforms.</p><p>The idea that news organisations have not adapted to change, with tech leaders essentially implying the media industry are a bunch of Luddites, is a naive world view that sycophantically follows an adage that tech can only create good and should be taken up without care for the consequences on society.</p><p>It fails to look at the ways journalism has constantly evolved its model.</p><p>Technology is a net benefit to the world and its progress, but its use needs to be purposeful and critiqued like any other element of human evolution.</p><p>The ACCC's code is about a level playing field in an environment dominated by global giants. It doesn't appear Google and Facebook are going to accept that lying down.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7bt71satwi81lq0vlbcn</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K4-0721-F0J6-J2HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1853\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Max Mason reports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Competition tsar Rod Sims is not the first to try to find a way to force Facebook and Google to pay for the value they get from journalism on their platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the draft of a compulsory code of conduct - which is a negotiate-arbitrate model - is far from the finish line in the battle to reel in the power of big tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In its decision, the independent arbitrator must consider: the direct value of news content, and how much money is directly made from ads around news content; indirect value - the value to the platforms of actually have the content there (a much harder prospect to measure); the cost of producing news; and whether the payment amount would place an undue burden on Facebook or Google.</p><p>Sims admits that value will be hard to measure, and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission doesn't have the data to do that. He says it is the ACCC's job to correct the imbalance in bargaining power, which is the core issue, rather than the regulator or government setting the price digital platforms should pay media companies.</p><p>\"Value is very hard to work out. I'm sure both sides will have a go at it. You've got value, you've also got cost of journalism, and no undue burden. The three things are all equal,\" Sims tells The Australian Financial Review.</p><p>Rough industry estimates suggest Nine, owner of The Australian Financial Review, and News Corp could spend about $250 million a year on journalism, Australian Community Media and Seven West Media $100 million each, and Network Ten $50 million. The cost is substantial for independents such as Crikey, and regional networks such as Prime Media and WIN Corp.</p><p>Sims says it's the one tangible measure of the three important considerations to begin talks.</p><p>\"The beauty of the cost of journalism is if the number comes out to be 1 per cent ... that's not very sensible,\" he says. \"If it's 100 per cent of the cost of journalism, you'd say 'Well, there's no way the platforms should cover all the costs of journalism.'</p><p>\"So you'd naturally go to 10, 20 or 30, I don't know what the right number is, but you can tell that they provide at least a framework to anchor any discussion of value.\"</p><p>Combining Nine, News Corp, Seven, Ten and ACM would get to at least $750 million a year. Factor in other organisations and spend on journalism would be $1 billion in Australia. Taking 20 per cent of that, $200 million, is a substantial amount of money, and that's before value of journalism to the platforms has been considered.</p><p>The cost of producing journalism will be easier to find, but Sims recognises the value can't just be based on cost.</p><p>\"We all know that print, or these days online, does drive a lot of other media stories,\" says Sims. \"I think newspaper stories do have a degree of importance here. But that's really making the point I'm making - that the parties are well placed to make those points.\"</p><p>Here's where it gets tricky. Value could be very substantial, depending on what it is measured. Google itself admits it sends more than 3 billion clicks to Australian news organisations each year and that is the limit of the value exchange. But would Google actually lose those 3 billion clicks if it didn't have any news, and another search platform did?</p><p>Sims says media companies will be able to ask for information from the tech companies in working out the value. The tech giants will not be able to rely on their own data when making their own case, without providing its information to news media businesses.</p><p>Sims and the government want to curb a major imbalance in bargaining power between Facebook and Google, and local media companies, with the primary goal of fair financial compensation for the value created for the digital giants by having journalism on their platforms.</p><p>\"When you've got this level of imbalance in bargaining power, forcing negotiation, forcing mediation will get you so far. But, having that arbitration at the end does really even up the bargaining power,\" Sims says.</p><p>\"The threat that arbitration is there - parties usually like to avoid arbitration where somebody else determines the outcome - might just drive a range of commercial deals.\"</p><p>The code will give digital platforms and media companies the opportunity to agree to a deal. If they do not, they will go through three months of mediation before moving to a binding final-offer arbitration where the independent arbitrator must choose an offer within 45 days.</p><p>Google and Facebook will have armies of lawyers combing through the draft code of conduct.</p><p>Why? Precedent. Regulators across the world are battling to deal with Facebook and Google's monopolistic powers, and if Sims' model works, you can bet the house the platforms will face similar regimes in other countries.</p><p>\"Australia is seen as innovative in a legislative sense, in that our parliaments produce high-quality legislation in the field of arbitration,\" says Dr Sam Luttrell, international arbitration group partner at law firm Clifford Chance.</p><p>It may be that this code is followed, or may be that this code informs the way governments around the world approach these issues.\"</p><p>While the ACCC is to be commended, Luttrell says, the draft code raises complex legal issues: it is a coercive process and there may not be an appeal, which could see Facebook and Google challenge its constitutional validity; and the timetable of 45 days, for some extremely complex issues, is very short.</p><p>\"There are checks and balances built into the model that are well conceived for the most part, and this is draft legislation, and draft legislation is never perfect, nor is, for that matter, the final act,\" Luttrell says.</p><p>Don't expect the code of conduct to be the end of Google and Facebook's efforts to not pay for news content.</p><p>They've got form of dodging attempts. When regulation was passed in Spain in October 2014 to have Google and other aggregators pay news publishers for products like GoogleNews, the US-based search giant was swift and brutal.</p><p>By mid-December 2014, less than a month before the legislation came into effect, Google simply shut down Google News.</p><p>'Internationally, there have been a number of attempts to make Google and Facebook pay for the use of journalistic content.</p><p>One French proposal required Google to pay for the use of snippets of news articles from French media companies.</p><p>Google reverted to showing only headlines of articles to avoid paying fees, resulting in the French competition regulator ordering Google to negotiate with French publishers. Those negotiations are ongoing.</p><p>Google Australia head of policy Lucinda Longcroft says the ACCC code is not grounded in commercial reality and continues the tech giant's line that there is no market power imbalance.</p><p>\"In terms of the ACCC's report, as a premise we fundamentally disagree with the claim that there is a market power imbalance,\" Longcroft said during a Competition Policy International discussion. \"In fact, the ACCC's and the government's own data showed that we are only a small part of the traffic that news publishers receive from Australian users.</p><p>\"We are deeply concerned about the current draft of the code. It is heavy-handed intervention and does not reflect commercial reality.\"</p><p>Sims says the ACCC has learned from the experiences of Spain, France and Germany in coming up with its model, in that it's related to Google Search and Facebook News Feed, the core products of the two US giants.</p><p>\"[Spain was] something that could be turned off. What we've done, we've learnt from that. In this we're applying it to all media, to all news items,\" he says.</p><p>Citing an economic study done of the Spanish experience, Google, in its submission to the ACCC's efforts to draw up a code of conduct in Australia, notes the negative effect of its decision.</p><p>\"A reduction in the availability and visibility of news in online aggregation services like Google News particularly harms small and medium-sized publishers without established brands,\" the company argues on page 13 of its submission.</p><p>Yet, less than a page later, Google continues to reject the idea there is an imbalance in its relationships with media business.</p><p>\"We do not accept that the current value exchange with NMBs [news media businesses] associated with search results reflects an imbalance in bargaining power.\"</p><p>Though Google News and Google Search are different products, the US tech giant is stating its decisions hurt small and medium publishers in Spain, yet it does not have more power in bargaining with media companies over search results, an area of its business where it is hugely dominant the world over.</p><p>\"To the extent that there is a bargaining power imbalance between NMBs and Google, the bargaining framework should seek to correct that imbalance by creating negotiating conditions that would exist between two arms' length parties with equal bargaining power.</p><p>\"It should not create a framework that creates a bargaining power imbalance or that requires Google to act against its commercial interests (for example, by requiring us to make payments for inputs that don't generate economic value).\"</p><p>Here lies one of the key issues. Google still refuses to acknowledge it holds a dominant position - Sims, the ACCC and the government have long decided they, and Facebook, do - and the Alphabet-owned company believes journalism doesn't hold any value to it worth paying for.</p><p>They don't believe they should pay, so expect legal challenges to come.</p><p>However, Sims says defining news will be relatively easy for most. For example, Nine and News Corp would be put on the list, and once on the list, all of their journalism would be included.</p><p>\"You get through the gate by producing core news, and that's defined as publicly significant issues, journalism that engages Australians in public debate, informs democratic decision-making, journalism relating to community and local events,\" Sims says.</p><p>\"Any one of those headings gets you through the door, and once you're through the door ... then all their news produced by journalists is covered.\"</p><p>If Google and Facebook ran newsrooms, employed and paid thousands of journalists across Australia, then a code of conduct would not be necessary. But they don't do journalism.</p><p>Instead, the code seeks to remunerate the creators of journalism for the value Google and Facebook get from having it on their platforms.</p><p>The idea that news organisations have not adapted to change, with tech leaders essentially implying the media industry are a bunch of Luddites, is a naive world view that sycophantically follows an adage that tech can only create good and should be taken up without care for the consequences on society.</p><p>It fails to look at the ways journalism has constantly evolved its model.</p><p>Technology is a net benefit to the world and its progress, but its use needs to be purposeful and critiqued like any other element of human evolution.</p><p>The ACCC's code is about a level playing field in an environment dominated by global giants. It doesn't appear Google and Facebook are going to accept that lying down.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7bt6xzdg5ubx2gbidar</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K4-0721-F0J6-J2J3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1853\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

explosive acquisition-fuelled growth of the world's large digital platforms is posing a significant challenge for competition authorities, Rod Sims says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Sims, chairman of the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, called on global competition regulators to work together to meet this and other challenges, and consider whether traditional approaches to assessing mergers were withstanding the test of time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It is easy to suggest our markets would be more competitive if YouTube and DoubleClick were separate to Google, and if Instagram and WhatsApp were separate to Facebook,\" he said in a keynote speech at International Competition Network's merger workshop in Melbourne on Thursday.</p><p>\"But predicting the future competitive effect of such acquisitions before they occur is extremely difficult.</p><p>\"This illustrates the difficulties when you only have nascent competitors, or competitors in related markets.\" An ACCC inquiry resulted in Australia becoming one of the first countries in the world to develop broad reforms for the leading digital platforms, after Mr Sims said Google and Facebook had \"almost unfettered market power\" with a significant impact on consumers.</p><p>Under the Morrison Government's response to the inquiry, the ACCC will oversee the establishment of a new code to address the power imbalance between the platforms and media companies in Australia.</p><p>Steps will also be taken to ensure media businesses and digital platforms operate on a more regulatory footing, and that local journalism is supported.</p><p>While Mr Sims said be believed the Australian economy was too concentrated, and it was sometimes extremely difficult to challenge proposed mergers.</p><p>Competition authorities, he said, often felt like they were \"on the back foot\", seeking evidence about the unknown future world when much of the relevant knowledge and evidence was held by the parties to the transaction.</p><p>Previous decisions of the Federal Court and the Australian Competition Tribunal suggested there was an added challenge - the considerable weight given to the testimony of senior executives from the merger parties when pre-merger internal company documents showed a different story.</p><p>The ACCC this month lost a significant legal challenge to its efforts to block the $15bn merger between TPG and Vodafone, which involves the combination of Australia's third and fourth-largest telcos.</p><p>\"My sense is that courts in some other jurisdictions are more sceptical of self-serving testimony by the merger parties,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>\"The challenge applies to all merger reviews but is even greater when the market environment is rapidly evolving and incumbents are acquiring emerging and innovative new players.\" The ACCC chief said competition authorities could help each other out with these challenges, particularly in matters involving global firms with complex and far-reaching operations.</p><p>Google's proposed $US2bn acquisition of smartwatch maker Fitbit, which some regulators were actively considering, was a key example.</p><p>\"It's a very important matter,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>In the meantime, the ACCC was looking at some of the key areas of difference with overseas counterparts, including different measures used to challenge anti-competitive mergers such as abuse of market power provisions or attempted monopoly provisions.</p><p>Some jurisdictions also allowed courts to start with the premise that increased concentration would cause a lessening in competition, while greater weight was given to the views of competition authorities and their merger guidelines in recognition of their expertise.</p><p>The \"inherent bias and unreliability\" of information created after the deal was agreed was also a consideration, and there was a focus - like in Australia - on the difficult task of determining what was likely to happen to the target company in the future rather than the immediate competitive effects.</p><p>Mr Sims said the Australian system was out of place compared to the formal, mandatory and suspensory regimes in many countries.\"We assess the vast majority of mergers under a voluntary and informal merger review process,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

explosive acquisition-fuelled growth of the world's large digital platforms is posing a significant challenge for competition authorities, Rod Sims says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Sims, chairman of the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission, called on global competition regulators to work together to meet this and other challenges, and consider whether traditional approaches to assessing mergers were withstanding the test of time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It is easy to suggest our markets would be more competitive if YouTube and DoubleClick were separate to Google, and if Instagram and WhatsApp were separate to Facebook,\" he said in a keynote speech at International Competition Network's merger workshop in Melbourne on Thursday.</p><p>\"But predicting the future competitive effect of such acquisitions before they occur is extremely difficult.</p><p>\"This illustrates the difficulties when you only have nascent competitors, or competitors in related markets.\" An ACCC inquiry resulted in Australia becoming one of the first countries in the world to develop broad reforms for the leading digital platforms, after Mr Sims said Google and Facebook had \"almost unfettered market power\" with a significant impact on consumers.</p><p>Under the Morrison Government's response to the inquiry, the ACCC will oversee the establishment of a new code to address the power imbalance between the platforms and media companies in Australia.</p><p>Steps will also be taken to ensure media businesses and digital platforms operate on a more regulatory footing, and that local journalism is supported.</p><p>While Mr Sims said be believed the Australian economy was too concentrated, and it was sometimes extremely difficult to challenge proposed mergers.</p><p>Competition authorities, he said, often felt like they were \"on the back foot\", seeking evidence about the unknown future world when much of the relevant knowledge and evidence was held by the parties to the transaction.</p><p>Previous decisions of the Federal Court and the Australian Competition Tribunal suggested there was an added challenge - the considerable weight given to the testimony of senior executives from the merger parties when pre-merger internal company documents showed a different story.</p><p>The ACCC this month lost a significant legal challenge to its efforts to block the $15bn merger between TPG and Vodafone, which involves the combination of Australia's third and fourth-largest telcos.</p><p>\"My sense is that courts in some other jurisdictions are more sceptical of self-serving testimony by the merger parties,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>\"The challenge applies to all merger reviews but is even greater when the market environment is rapidly evolving and incumbents are acquiring emerging and innovative new players.\" The ACCC chief said competition authorities could help each other out with these challenges, particularly in matters involving global firms with complex and far-reaching operations.</p><p>Google's proposed $US2bn acquisition of smartwatch maker Fitbit, which some regulators were actively considering, was a key example.</p><p>\"It's a very important matter,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>In the meantime, the ACCC was looking at some of the key areas of difference with overseas counterparts, including different measures used to challenge anti-competitive mergers such as abuse of market power provisions or attempted monopoly provisions.</p><p>Some jurisdictions also allowed courts to start with the premise that increased concentration would cause a lessening in competition, while greater weight was given to the views of competition authorities and their merger guidelines in recognition of their expertise.</p><p>The \"inherent bias and unreliability\" of information created after the deal was agreed was also a consideration, and there was a focus - like in Australia - on the difficult task of determining what was likely to happen to the target company in the future rather than the immediate competitive effects.</p><p>Mr Sims said the Australian system was out of place compared to the formal, mandatory and suspensory regimes in many countries.\"We assess the vast majority of mergers under a voluntary and informal merger review process,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

I think we'll get started here. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Alexia Quadrani, the Media Analyst at JPMorgan. And we're very pleased to have Sinclair here with us today. I'm very pleased to welcome Chris Ripley, the President and CEO of Sinclair; and Lucy Rutishauser, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Thank you both very much for coming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP, INC.: Thanks, Alexia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Questions and Answers</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: I think we'll just kick it off with some questions on your recent transaction and then we could jump into the core business. You recently announced the acquisition of 21 regional sports networks from Disney that were previously owned by Fox. Can you provide us a brief overview of the transaction and what assets you're actually purchasing?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: So it's certainly a transformative transaction in every respect of the word. It's a $10.6 billion acquisition, $9.6 billion after you adjust for minority Interest. The headline purchase multiple is very attractive at 6.5x and it's 5.5x after you adjust for the step-up in tax basis, which has an NPV of about $1.5 billion. And that does not include any cost synergies which we think will be significant here over time amounting to over $100 million on a run rate basis. It's the largest portfolio of RSNs in the country. So it gets us into the RSN business, into the sports business in a big way with a scale platform, has 14 MLB teams, 16 NBA teams and 12 NHL teams. And we've also set it up so that it has a separate credit silo and capital structure so that we can bring on strategic partners in the future, who just want to get RSN exposure.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: I guess, with these RSNs, you're purchasing the largest portfolio of regional sports networks in the market. Can you talk about the advantages of the combination of Sinclair's broadcast business with the RSNs?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: So we have been focused on sports for the last 4, 5 years as a means to create a sustainable and profitable business for ourselves in this changing video landscape. We've always been very strong in news. We are the largest news producer -- local news producer in the U.S. in terms of volume. And when we looked at what was happening in the marketplace with the increase of the peak TV phenomenon that is often much talked about, I first started with cable companies creating more and more original program and more and more general entertainment, now increasingly big tech coming in with incremental dollars creating seemingly unlimited supply of general entertainment. We knew we wanted to move into an area that would be more sustainable for us and that is really news and sports. And adding this portfolio to our news portfolio makes us the preeminent local sports and news company in the country. And the portfolios are very complimentary. The operation of an RSN is very similar to a TV station. They have 3 main functions: administration, production and ad sales. Those are things that we do at our stations every day. And as I mentioned earlier, we haven't factored any specific synergies in on the cost side, but there definitely will be some as we plug in this very complimentary portfolio into our platform.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: Two common concerns we often hear about RSNs, in general, is the high exposure to the pay TV affiliate fees given the decline in the ecosystem subscribers and the risk that the MVPDs will increasingly seek to tier sports networks to pass on the high cost to consumer. So I guess, can you talk broadly about how you</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>of risk factors?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: This was obviously something we did a lot of work on, and major part of the transaction was understanding the strength of the product and the product is incredibly strong. As I mentioned earlier, sports and news are the place you want to be in terms of linear live viewing. They've massively outperformed every other genre in just about every metric of viewership that you can look at. And this product is, in many respects, must have product for the distributors and they will look to continue bringing this to their subscribers. I'm also, I think, very hardened by the fact that the main competitor, the Liberty group that competed against us, did have support from the 3 largest distributors in their bid, which all we need to do here for this to be a home run, no pun intended, is to get status quo renewals. That's it. It's not a high bar. And we know at the end of the day this is a very strong product, so we're very confident that it will not be tiered and it will be renewed.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: As you mentioned previously, you have been investing in a lot of sports assets recently, including you -- I think you own Ring of Honor, Tennis Channel and some high school sports as well. Do you see an opportunity to distribute some of this content on the RSNs longer term?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: There definitely is a synergy between all of our various sports outlets. There will be content sharing that goes on between them. We do a nice little business today in high school sports, for instance, which is sometimes even outrates the broadcast prime time on some of our stations. That content is directly relevant to regional audiences at the RSNs. Tennis content certainly would be relevant. Wrestling would be relevant. So we haven't figured out exactly how that will all interplay. Once we get in and start operating, we'll be able to figure that part out. But again, additional upside.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: And how about on the cost synergy side, I think you flagged $100 million over 5 years. Is there any additional color you can give us in terms of timing or where you'll see these savings?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: So the $100 million over the next 5 years is a very conservative number. It doesn't kick-in in year 1. But after year 1, there will be some significant programming agreements that roll off that will start to impact year 2 and onward. And the production technology that's being used at the RSNs is about 10 years old. And so there is a fairly substantial opportunity to modernize the technology that's used to produce these games and make them more efficient, while at the same time upgrading the user experience and the actual quality of production. And that will generate additional savings, which will roll out over the next 5 years and reach that $100 million number. We think there will be opportunities above and beyond that, as I mentioned, just sort of in blocking and tackling in administration, add sales and the like but that hasn't been quantified yet.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: Right now, the RSNs are primarily distributed to the legacy virtual MVPD -- the legacy MVPDs. As the distribution landscape shifts in the coming years, I guess how are you thinking about the potential carriage on the digital platforms? And how might this be sort of impacted by league restrictions?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Well, there has been a -- the vastest part of the business has been the virtual MVPDs, the streamers. And the Fox RSNs have gone from no subscribers to 5 million subscribers on virtual MVPDs over the last few years. And as I said, by far the fastest part, a growing part of the business, and I think that will continue. And we're seeing the bundle transform to a more streaming set-top-box-free-type experience and I expect that will continue. In terms of the leagues, well, we've met with all the leagues before we agreed to buy this asset. And the leagues are very much aligned with the RSNs as local partners. The RSNs need the leagues and leagues need the RSNs to succeed. They need them to do all the local production. They need them to distribute the games to their consumers in the market. And they need them to make the user or the viewer experiences as good as possible. And so there is a shared sense of success there with the leagues. And I expect, from my conversations, to be able to secure whatever rights are needed in the future to continue to grow local audiovisual consumption of any type, whether it's a new technology like VR or AR that -- those that will be the dominion of the RSNs going forward as a partnership with the league.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: Even before this deal, as you know, you guys announced the Marquee Sports Network with the Chicago Cubs, can you talk about this partnership and how you could be a model perhaps for your relationship with other teams?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: The Cubs deal was a great deal. And as you point out, a good example about how to align interest. The Cubs have significant -- have a significant stake in the success of that network. And they were one of the few teams in this country that could have gone on their own and did this all by themselves, but they chose to partner with Sinclair. And I think that just in onto its own, tells you something about what we bring to the table. And in terms of alignment of interest, the Fox RSN portfolio already comes with significant team ownership across several of the MLB teams, and that is a trend as we renew contracts. We will increasingly give the teams upside in their individual RSNs and that aligns interest. It also variabilizes more the cost structure and that will be a trend going forward.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: I'm moving on to sort of the core, I guess, the core legacy business, the core business. Coming into this year, there has been some concern that core advertising was slow to recover from the elections, similar to 2017. You've recently stated you expect core to be up in 2019. Why do you think the ad market has come in better than expected?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Well, it wasn't really better than expected for us.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: For you -- for us, perhaps I should say for us.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: I guess that the market was...</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER, SENIOR VP &amp; CFO, SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP, INC.: Skeptical.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Skeptical. And rightly so, last year, the industry got off to a bad start. The first 2 quarters were very negative, and we've rebounded off of that in the back half of the year, we had political. And then that core strength or relative strength, if you will, has continued on into this year. So we were flattish in Q1 and will be flattish up in Q2. And then in the back half of the year, you've got the benefit of lapping the ChryslerFiat issues that dogged us last year as a major advertiser. And then you also have the benefit of not have -- of getting the spots back from political, the political crowd out that depressed core in the back half of last year.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: And auto is the category that some of the competitors have flags under pressure giving lower vehicle sales this year. You stated you expect it to increase in '19. Can you talk about some of the drivers on this, including maybe past investments you've made into the category?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: So auto came off a 5- or 6-year growth run after the great recession, just quarter-after-quarter growth. The market's going through sort of a consolidation period right now in auto. So you have seen some weakness. And we have relatively done better because we've hired category specialists. And those category specialists know the business of an auto dealership Tier 3 supplier. They know that business better than our average -- when they add the average, the seller would know it. And they come in with specialty solutions and products that focus on generating sales for the advertiser, not just on selling spots. So that approach has been successful in the marketplace and it's why you're seeing us outperform others in that category.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: We keep hearing all sorts of local advertising-driven companies talk about the services category, which has been really strong. I think Lamar just highlighted it a few minutes ago actually. Both you and your competitors continue to say it's red hot right now. I guess, what's driving the strength behind this?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Services has definitely been a great category for us. The 3 areas that have really driven that are legal, insurance and banking. And legal category has -- is one of our larger categories. It's always been strong for us and continues to grow. And insurance and banking can ebb and flow, but it's particularly strong right now.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: I guess, switching to political. Can you talk about your outlook for 2020 as well as, I guess, 2019, given the potential for early primary spending?</p><p>LUCY A. RUTISHAUSER: Sure. So we are very excited about 2020's prospects. If you think about, right now, the number of people that have entered the race on the democratic side, actually this number's going to blow your way. Not all of them will come to the table there with money, but there are now over 700 people who have registered on the democratic side to run for presidency across the country. So yes -- and look the first people were already throwing their name into the ring the day after Congress was sworn in, which is very early in the process over a year before the first primaries get aired. So we have that. When you look at the states that were lean in 2016, we're in 7 or 8 of the 10 lean states. And we're there in a big way with a lot of the news. So we're in the swing states. You've got a lot of people running. We already know there's a lot of issue, national issue money, not to mention local issue money that's coming forward. And then when you look historically, and you've heard us talk about our growth initiatives, and one of those is expanding our news dayparts because that's the first place that political money goes. So we've spent a lot of time focusing on our local news, adding dayparts and we actually saw the first return of that in 2018 when we increased our share of the political dollars in our markets. So I'm going to throw a stat out for you. Do not change your models for this stat, but some of the third-party research is now saying that 2020's political funding could be 70% over 2016's. Again don't build that into your models for us quite yet, but I think it really just goes to show what we have to look forward to and we're still very early in the process.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: That's amazing. I have got a ton more questions, but since it's such a full room, I want to stop for a minute and see if there is any questions from the audience. I think we have one right here and one over there. Could you just wait for 1 second? The mic will come because of the webcast. Okay, second row.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: So on the RSNs, assuming the deal passes the regulatory scrutiny and goes through, do you expect there would be a cap on the number of RSNs you could eventually own? And then second, if you were to buy more RSNs, would financing come exclusively from the RSN subsidiary? Or could that include cash, debt or others from the parent Sinclair?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: From a precedent standpoint, they're -- the market at the DOJ is defined as cable and cable sports. So -- but from a precedential standpoint, you wouldn't expect there to be any limitation on the number of RSNs any one player could own. But that will, obviously, be up to the DOJ to determine. They look at things on a case-by-case basis, but precedence would say no to your answer. And then in terms of financing, since we did set this up so that they each have their own capital structure, we'd anticipate that most of the financing will come from the RSN silo as not to totally exclude the notion that some amount of, say, equity with more equity would come from the Sinclair side. But going forward, these 2 divisions, if you will, or silos as we're calling them, are set up to pursue their own path for capital raising.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: The third row.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Is there any chance that the -- in siloing the capital structures that, that won't be achievable at the end of the day? Is that -- so is there any chance that, that structure would...</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: It's really been achieved. So we haven't closed yet, but the -- all the financing is fully committed to and so it's very, very unlikely that it won't be achieved, I guess, is the answer to your question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Can you describe the STIRR initiative and how that's performing?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: STIRR is our foyer into the AVOD segment. It's gone well ahead of expectations. It's been a great launch for us and it's in primarily focused on user expansion at this point and well ahead of its stats as it relates to where we thought it would be. Really the key to STIRR, as we see it, is that it gives you both a linear lean back experience and VoD experience. So a lot of streaming apps or experiences, they just focus on demand. Whereas this gives you the ability to channel surf just like you would on a normal standard traditional experience, but also seamlessly jump into on-demand. And the other really interesting thing about STIRR is that it focuses on local. So the most watched channel on STIRR is STIRR CITY. So depending on what city you're in, you will get a customized channel for your location, which will include things like your local news and other locally focused programming and that happens to be the most watched channel on STIRR today. So that's really the secret sauce of STIRR is combining linear and on-demand, and also giving you linear -- local programming. Plus right now, we're above 30 national channels on top of that. So, so far, so good.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: Is it too early to really tell how big the opportunity could be down the road? I know you just recently launched.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Yes, it's probably too early. But I will note that Viacom is making hay with Pluto, doing quite well there. They have very high expectations for that platform and we think STIRR could follow a similar path.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: I'll be one here and then -- okay, go ahead in the back. It's one in the back, you can take it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I noticed the way that the other media sort of coverage you as a company is, let's just say, unfair at times or at least that there is an agenda there seems to be. Do you view that as an asset or liability? How do you think about that as you make strategic decisions for the company itself?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Do I view it as an asset or a liability, that's a good question. Look, it is what it is. We don't let that affect our strategic path going forward. We're going to do what's in the best interest of the shareholders to create value, and the coverage will be -- what the coverage is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Can you comment on the financial trends of the RSNs? There's obviously been some concerns of late so maybe that would be helpful.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Well, the announcement that we made in terms of the acquisition multiple is what we think will be the trough year for the RSNs in terms of where EBITDA is. So we expect growth on a go-forward basis for -- from calendar '19 and onward.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: Since you're getting big in sports -- bigger in sports, any plans for exploring sports betting?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Yes. Sports betting, we think, is going to be a big tailwind for this acquisition. When you take a look at the impact of what daily fantasy did for the NFL viewership was quite substantial and we would have made the acquisition regardless of whether there was a sports betting opportunity. But in this case, sports betting is spreading across the country. As I think you all know, 30-odd states are looking at it or have either made it legal or looking at it now. And we think the RSNs will be a prime beneficiary of this trend. And that will benefit the RSNs really in 3 significant ways. Number one is it'll increase engagement and in terms of tonnage, the RSNs do over 5,000 live events. The Fox RSNs do over 5,000 live events a year and so a lot on the regular-season games and if there is a reason for people to tune in because they are gaming or they are actually betting on the outcome of the game and the RSNs will really benefit from that increased engagement, that engagement will be monetized through additional advertising by having more impressions. And then also we will benefit from a new category of advertiser coming in. So the actual betting houses themselves will want to advertise in these games because that's their target audience, and that's a brand-new category, which is expected to be multibillion dollars entering the ecosystem and putting additional pressure on the pricing of the inventory. And then the third main benefit that we see from sports betting is the phenomenon of in-game betting, which you can see in Europe has become a substantial part of the marketplace and we think the U.S. will follow that same trend and people will ultimately be doing their gaming integrated with the media and doing it on a prop, not just on a game outcome basis but on a prop basis and a play-by-play basis. And that sort of engagement, we will -- we think will benefit us in terms of engagement, but also in terms of ancillary revenue opportunities.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: You will then develop your own path for in-game there? That's...</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Well, we'll have to see. We're certainly going to experiment with different ways. There's already RSNs that are putting out 2 feeds. One gaming-centered feed that has, right now, it's a sweepstakes-site style betting to experiment with and we'll have to see whether we pursue a platform or not that, that's yet to be determined. But I think as a media company within this space, whether you have your platform or not, you're going to have many opportunities to benefit from this.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: Let me jump back in with a couple of more questions because I know we're going to get run out of time. The DOJ recently held a forum to discuss how it views the local ad market. Did you get a sense at all that the broadcasters made any headway in their argument that the market should be redefined to include cable and digital advertising?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Look, it was a great session. I thought all the panelists did an excellent job, especially on the second day. Specifically, I give my hats off to Dave Lougee, who handled the panel that specifically talked about the market definition between broadcast and cable and online video. There was also participation on that panel from Comcast and Facebook. And that panel in particular was a resounding success, I guess, from my perspective. But also, everyone in unison agreed that those markets have now blended together from an advertising perspective, as we've been living that for quite some time. And so I think it achieved the goals that the industry had hoped, and it'll just be up to the DOJ now to see what they do with it.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: I guess, I was going to ask you what are the next steps? Is it waiting for the DOJ to do something? Or is there anything else you guys can in the broader industry can do?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: I think the ball is really in the DOJ's court to decide whether they're ready to make a shift in precedence or not.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: And then turning to the national cab, I feel like we've been discussing this for a very long time. Do you anticipate that the FCC will look at this in 2019?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Well, the NPRM has been out there for a while. We know the FCC would like to do something and they've been looking at various alternatives. The industry, the NAB, pretty much all the players have gotten behind the notion of a 78% cap and there's a decent amount of momentum around that idea. And again, I don't know exactly what the FCC is thinking, but if I had to guess, they probably will try to act on that NPRM. And the industry consensus right now is 78%.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: Okay, I'm going to sneak in one more before we run out of time. I guess, can you discuss where you are in the Tennis Channel in terms of national distribution advertising and the launch of an international</p><p>DTC product?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: So Tennis Channel has been a phenomenal success for us. We've over doubled the homes that it's now viewable in since acquisition about 3 years ago. It significantly increased its distribution revenues and it's set to have a banner year next year. And the viewership, as I have stated on a few of our calls has been sort of slow in coming as we've added Nielsen and Nielsen's panels are not nearly as robust as Comscore. So it's taking a while for the increased distribution to translate into increased viewership, but we're starting to see that now. Fairly significant gains in year-over-year viewerships starting to hit the tape for the Tennis Channel, which is encouraging to see. And it seems like that asset now is starting to fire on all cylinders. In terms of the international DTC opportunity, we have mentioned that we're incubating an international play that should launch near the end of this year and European territories will be the first target. So we're going to build on the success that we've had with our OTT app here in the U.S. that does both TV Everywhere plus direct-to-consumer and start launching the Tennis Channel in foreign territories.</p><p>ALEXIA SKOURAS QUADRANI: All right. Well, we're out of time. Thank you very much for coming and joining us.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S.

Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us again. I'm here today with Chris Ripley, CEO of Sinclair. Chris, thank you for doing this, second year in a row. We really appreciate it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP, INC.: Thanks, Mike...</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Pleasure. Good to see you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: So the question we'd ask to start things off is, it's hard, it's almost only 2 months into it, but what lasting impact do you think comes from this period in time? When you think about where we go after this, what changes in your mind from where we were before?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: It's a great question. I think it's something that we read in media, I mean, economists, just every business leader that I know of is trying to figure that question out. And I don't have a crystal ball any more than anyone else, so we're all just sort of guessing. But some things that I'm pretty sure on are that work from home has actually worked. It's worked amazingly well for a company like ourselves who -- the historical mindset is that most things needed to be done in the office/studios. And that's being totally blown apart. And so that's happening before our eyes in real time, and it has implications for how we operate on a go-forward basis once COVID goes away. I do think we'll become more efficient, more productive because of what we're doing today and feel we'll be able to have -- give people more flexibility from a lifestyle perspective and actually increase productivity and efficiency to boom. So I think it could be a win-win.</p><p>And then the other thing that is obviously very clear right now is that media consumption's skyrocketed, and it continues to be at these elevated levels. I think and, again, this is a speculation, but I do think that is going to persist post-COVID. I don't think this is just going to be a blip. Just for instance, our local news ratings are up almost 40% system-wide. And I don't necessarily expect that to -- that level to persist. But I do actually think we're going to have a long tail of enhanced ratings because of that. You're going to have people who start to do more work at home, have more time for consumption of media and then perhaps relying on in-home media more than out-of-home for quite some time as just -- in terms of just consumers and what their entertainment options are, in-home, I think, ends up being a big winner out of this. And I don't think it necessarily is all back to normal when COVID goes away. I think that trend will persist.</p><p>And then obviously, the big question of the day that I'm sure you're dealing with at this conference that everyone's sort of thinking about on the downside is: Will there be economically driven cord cutting? When you listen to all the big MVPDs, and they just had their quarterly earnings, they all seem to indicate that they thought that may happen, but they didn't see it in their numbers yet. And so they're sort of speculating the people lose their jobs, they can't afford to pay-TV bundle, they cut the cord. And so the -- this could accelerate cord-cutting and then do those people -- does that change consumer behavior? Or do they just simply re-sign up when they get their jobs back as they traditionally would have done through a downturn? People don't know the answer to that, but that's probably the biggest concern about this for the media industry, which I would say, by and large, compared to a lot of businesses, we're in pretty good shape. There's a lot of worse situations that I wouldn't want to be dealing with right now.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: No. Yes. We've heard someone describe that. Other thing is hot messes. I'll talk about that later.</p><p>So let me start with how this pandemic is affecting your business, that's on the advertising line, clearly, local. Given the real-time data you're seeing from your stations, can you help frame this decline compared to the last recession of '08, '09. So how is this different? And what are you seeing in the field relative to maybe the last time?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Yes. Well, look, it's -- just from a high level, it's clear that this is much steeper and much faster than the declines we saw in 2009. We were having pretty good Januarys and Februarys. And then March was fine until the end of March, just fell off a cliff. And that weakness has extended into April and now into May. And the business is being placed in a much shorter time frame, usually 1 to 2 weeks now instead of the typical 4 to 6. So our visibility has been lessened. Obviously, the lack of live sports, that's a whole sort of advertising category that's essentially dissipated. And then it will come back when the sports comes back, but that's been an impact.</p><p>And as we guided to in our quarterly earnings last week, we think core is going to be down sort of mid- to high 30s in terms of core advertising. And that is with the assumption that there's a little bit of a pickup in the back half of the quarter as some of these states start to open up. And so there is some chance that it's worse than that, if that doesn't happen. And so just to compare that to 2009, the worst quarter in 2009 was about down 20% on the core advertising side. So core advertising is certainly, it's an economically sensitive area, and we're certainly seeing that today. The good news for us and companies like Sinclair is that we are substantially less exposed to advertising than we were in 2009. Just to give you an idea, the company, overall, only 25% of its ad revenue comes from advertising today, and that was 85% in 2009. So huge difference in terms of exposure, and that really is showing now in the model and the financial performance.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. Cool. And as you see states opening up, seas opening up, are you seeing -- what can you tell us about the cadence of advertising that's happening in real time in the past couple of weeks?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Yes. Look, I think it's really early to draw any hard conclusions based on some of the reopenings. We're hopeful that this -- the SBA PPP program, which was targeted at small- and medium-sized businesses, really bridged people through this sort of 2-month shutdown period that they -- that's forgivable in the PPP. And we've talked to car dealers, for instance, and they've been shut down or almost shut down for 2 months now. But if they've gotten PPP loans, basically the government floated them for that -- for those 2 months. And so they are anticipating a backlog of demand coming back and hitting the marketplace and a very quick return to normal demand trends. And the -- because of the PPP loans that they've been -- they've received that are forgivable, they're able to just -- their financial resources are not strained at all. And so I actually think there's so many things different here that we don't really have historical reference points for, like the amount of stimulation, the amount that -- the fact that this is the first sort of -- since the Spanish flu, which was so long ago, the economy was so different and you really can't draw any parallels, and then there was no mass quarantine done in the Spanish flu. So there's just -- there's so many unprecedented things about this, but there is reason to believe, especially with all the stimulus that the markets will bounce back pretty quickly. My biggest concern is really just the consumer behavior front, just having less economic activity as people return and they just decide to not do that extra dinner out or not go to the movie theaters or not go to a concert, all that sort of adds up to the general economic outlook.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. Can you talk about political for a second? Really strong first quarter. It looks like the money was in, in the first quarter. Have you seen any changes to political spending? And what's your view for maybe the acceleration or the concentration of political spend over the back half of the year?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: So yes, political has remained strong. We are still expecting to have a record quarter. What I'd like to say about politicians that makes them such great advertisers is they never return the money. Whatever money they raise, they spend it. So -- and they have a limited time to make an impact. So they really are the perfect advertiser in many ways. And we had a record first quarter on political. There will be less in Q2 because the primaries pretty much are over. And so -- and then from a timing perspective, it really heats up in Q3. October is a huge part of the equation in terms of political advertising, it's probably like 50% to 60% of the total in that 1 month. So that's where it's concentrated. And there's been a record amount of fundraising done by the various parties. And as I said earlier, whatever is raised is spent. So it's still a good setup for political advertising.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. You referenced this in my -- in the answer to my first question on what's going to change. I wonder on the cord-cutting front, do you expect the rate of cord-cutting to accelerate. So what -- so what are you thinking? What are you planning for? And then what do you do to prepare if it does pick up, what changes within your organization, your strategies if it does pick up, cord-cutting measures?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Yes. So look, it's a tale of 2 cities, like I mentioned, on the one hand, consumption is way up. People's reliance on us is way up, right, especially as it relates to local news. People's desire to see local sports, which, I think, will come back at some point this summer on a fanless basis. But we won't be too far away from being able to see that. In fact, we just reopened the tennis market last weekend in West Palm and did the first U.S.-based pro tennis tournament out on tennis channel. Weekend before that, we did it in Germany, too. So local sports are coming back. I'm fairly certain about that. And the demand for it is very, very high. We just did a survey recently that says 23% of people are ready to upgrade their TV package to watch live sports when it comes back, which is a pretty high number in terms of these people like upgrading their package from maybe one tier to another. And so we think the demand will be very high for local sports. So you've got, on the one hand, consumption way up, people relying on it way more, people wanting it much more. But on the other hand, you've got just the cold, hard economics of people losing their jobs, having to make cuts, et cetera. So hard to say how that pans out. But I think net-net, I would -- I think that augurs well for when those people do get their jobs back, that they will come back.</p><p>And so just to answer your second question, how do you prepare for this? Well, in some regards, we've been preparing for this for years. We have dealt with a challenging core advertising environment for quite some time. So we've always known that we need to focus on new revenue streams, and we've been doing that over the years. We've built a pretty substantial digital and digital marketing services business through our sales force. We're always looking to increase our ad yield. We're going to have big opportunities there on the RSN front. And we have a multi-platform focus. And we've had that for many years now. We look to be on all platforms where our consumers are. And the next frontier for us is going to be direct-to-consumer. We're dabbling a bit in it with STIRR and NewsON, but the next wave will be more substantial. And we -- that's going to be a big part of our growth story going forward.</p><p>And then we're doing little things as well like we're going to run an ad campaign on the benefits of pay TV. I just don't think people focus on what incredible entertainment value it actually is. And so we're going to use some of our own airtime to tell people just that.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. You talked to, I'm sure, all the leagues, all the team owners. What's the current thinking on when baseball, hockey, basketball come back? So if you're in our shoes, what's your expectation for seeing those sports come back?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Yes. So as I mentioned, tennis is already back, and it's not the full stops yet. It is -- they're doing exhibitions, but it is professional tennis. And then in terms of NBA, NHL and MLB, there's a lot of speculation. No one knows for sure. But one -- a few things that I do know is that the leagues are very focused on restarting as soon as they can, obviously, safely and responsibly. And they're willing to do it without fans. And so that's a big -- that's not an easy economic decision by the way, there's some trade-offs there. And there's some shared pain that probably has to go around, including to the players. You're not going to have gate revenue. And so that's important because most people don't think a vaccine is going to be around until sometime next year widely distributed, and are you really going to put 30,000 people into a building when there's no vaccine yet. So I think July is a -- has some potential for some of these leagues to restart around then or maybe August. So anyway, I think it's really a return this summer.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. And then I know you gave guidance on the call, but that -- let's assume for second quarter, there's not a lot of sports. Do you want to remind everyone of what the impact is on your RSNs, not a lot of sports and therefore no advertising at the...</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Yes. Yes. There was a lot of concern, I think, early on that this would be sort of the fatal blow to Diamond Sports, but it's actually a remarkably well-hedged business. This -- the idea that certain games wouldn't be delivered or less than or none would be delivered had already been contemplated, not by us, so I can't take a credit. This was Fox and others who were dealing with things like strikes, primarily that was what the focus was on, like what -- because strikes have happened, seasons have been missed due to work stoppages. So the contracts are very clear. There -- we'll certainly have -- I am expecting there to be a rebate situation where we'll all have to send some money back to the MVPDs because we don't hit our minimum game thresholds. We won't know that till the season -- till we know what's going on in the season and how much we'll actually deliver. But that revenue goes down, but then there's also rebates from the teams. So the teams underdeliver to us, then the money sort of flows through, and it's -- (inaudible) and so that's the 90% of the revenue on the sports side. Same is true with tennis, by the way.</p><p>And so then you've got advertising, which is a much smaller, which is only 10% of the sports revenue. That does go away. But again, there's offsetting costs that go away in the form of production costs. And so those 2 numbers are very similar as well. And so it is a remarkably well-hedged business.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. I saw a report early on that if the teams play baseball played out of their local market, there is impact to RSNs? Is there anything true to that the teams have to play in market? Is there any contract terms on that?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: No. No, I don't think that's accurate. We have -- certainly, look, if they end up delivering less games, if for some weird reason, it doesn't matter how -- why they weren't delivered. They would owe us money back for that. So in some sense, we obviously want to get as many games as possible. Don't get me wrong, but we're protected if we get less. And so -- but the way our contracts work is not -- they're not tied to a location now. We can only broadcast within a certain geography, but like, for instance, we take a -- when the Royals are playing in New York, we deliver that game to the Royals region. They're not playing in that region. They're playing in New York.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: So it doesn't matter?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Yes. I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. Cool. Let's stay with the RSN topic because that's -- a year ago, when we sat down after the deal was done. Could you share with us how negotiations have gone relative to your expectations over the past year? And then do you have confidence that those RSNs will still be carried on big basic and overall major virtual and nonvirtual distributors?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Yes. So things have gone pretty much as expected. Since we bought, 70% of all the subscribers of the RSNs have been renewed for multiyear contracts on status quo terms like we talked about when we were leading up to the transaction. There's really just 2 major MVPDs outstanding that have not gone through this renewal process with us. And that one is DISH, which we all, I think, know quite a lot about at this point. And I don't have any new updates there, if you want to know. And then the other is Comcast. And the only reason Comcast isn't done yet is their expirations were later than everyone else's. And so the broadcast side and the RSN side come up this summer. And we expect to renew on a [status quo] basis with Comcast as well.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: And is your goal to make all these renewals coterminous going forward? Is that maybe what can happen with DISH longer term?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Sure. Yes. No, that is the goal. And it's already been largely achieved, absent DISH and Comcast, which Comcast was already like almost on top of each other anyway. DISH had the biggest spread -- it's about a 2-year spread between the 2 expirations. So it's largely -- and everyone else is now coterminous. And as we achieve renewals with others, they'll be coterminous as well.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. If we talk about -- when you presented last year to us, you said, look, the opportunity to RSNs was driving local advertising because Fox, that wasn't a priority for Fox. They were doing some other things, right? So I know it's early days, but could you give us any update on how that integration has gone and any signs of success that you can point to?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Sure. So yes. Look, you always have to be skeptical when CEOs start talking about revenue synergies and so -- but I'm happy to report on this one, that there is -- it's actually coming through. So in January and February, the RSNs were up double digits on the ad side. And that -- we call it the Sinclair effect, but it's really just a lot of hard work in getting them in the flow on the political side, where they weren't previously in the flow, rolling out all of our digital market services, which we've spent years top grading through our broadcast group. And using this downtime to train all the staff on those new products. And already, even despite the downturn in COVID, they're making sales of these new products that we're giving them. So we've really leveraged the sales force. We've improved their yield. And the evidence was showing in January and February now, obviously, all bets are off with the -- especially with the RSNs, their ad revenue is significantly down because there's no sports on right now. But when the sports return, the advertising will turn.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Speaking of all bets, let's talk about betting because that's another area you're very excited about as an opportunity to drive more, both engagement and advertising. So what's your latest thoughts on the rollout of legalized betting across the U.S.?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: I think we're at 22 states right now, 10 with mobile and with dozens more expected over the next 3 to 4 years. I think that COVID could accelerate states going legal because their budgets are just taking a bazooka hit basically because of COVID. So they need the revenue now more than ever, and there's great case studies. In New Jersey, it has been a phenomenal success. And so I think it's -- I think that trend is going to accelerate. I think it's going to be a huge impact on our business. We're very focused on being at the convergence of gaming and sports. We want to gamify sports. We want you to be able to play for money or not for money in an interactive and engaging and a visually engaging way. And we think it's going to be a great boom for not only consumption, but also open up new ad revenue streams. And ultimately, we think sports betting will likely be a bigger economic opportunity for the RSNs than advertising. Maybe not as big as subscriptions, but bigger than advertising.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: And how do you plan to accelerate that confluence of gaming and consumption?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: So we are in deep talks right now with who's who of sportsbook operators and other partners to be at the forefront and jointly develop some of these new experiences for our viewers. And hopefully, we'll have some more news on that later on this year.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. And would you have to work with the MVPDs as well because as a sports fan, I watched my TV through my (inaudible). How do you integrate that with the MVPDs?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: I think we will be able to integrate new experiences within certain MVPD solutions. Just depends how capable their boxes are and their systems and whether they have open APIs and things like that. But to the extent that we aren't able to technologically deliver new experiences through the MVPD, we will have a second screen sort of simulated experience that you can do -- you can watch your linear and just -- and then get a simulated second screen experience on your phone.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. Cool. And in those -- in the states that have opened up gambling where you have RSNs, what have you seen in terms of either usage or appetite? Is there anything detectable at this point from early signs of gambling into new markets?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Well, what we do see quite -- the most obvious and largest impact is on the advertising side. When a state goes legal, the sports betting operators quickly become your biggest category, and they pay significant premiums to the going -- the average unit rates because they're all, and rightly so, focused on being a first mover and grabbing as many players as possible. So you get a -- it's a huge plus on the advertising side when they go legal.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. Earlier this year, Major League Baseball changed some of its streaming rights, I guess, relationships with their teams. They gave back their digital rights, I believe, to the teams earlier this year. What does that mean for you? And how do digital rights come to market in baseball?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Yes. So look, we already stream all of our products. We just do it on an authenticated basis. What you're referring to is the direct-to-consumer rights, which we already have on NBA and AHL. MLB was sort of the last piece missing, and now that change makes those available. So that's -- it's really good for us. And we -- all new deals going forward will include those direct-to-consumer rights. And the process, though, for transferring on existing deals is still to be completed, but something we're working on.</p><p>So anyway, the -- it really rounds out our rights. And then we're doing a lot of work right now, trying to figure out how do we roll out a product set around this that will be accretive to our viewers in terms of giving them what they want and the type of access they want. But also something that's complementary to the existing distribution ecosystem. We don't really -- a lot of people see this as a zero-sum game or a either/or. We don't see it that way. We think we can have direct-to-consumer products that are complementary to the existing distribution paradigm.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Do you assume the way we do that if you're paying for the bundle today, you're a sports fan, and therefore, if you're not a bundled subscriber, you're not a sports fan, so the TAM opportunity outside of the bundle may not be that large? Or do you think there's a TAM opportunity outside the bundle for people who cut the cord who are sports fans?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: It's an interesting question. And we're doing a lot of research on that right now. And there's more sports fans outside the bundle than you may think. And that's -- the early indication is that -- and who knows why, maybe that was economically driven. We haven't quite figured that part out yet. But we were surprised to see how many. And fandom is so broad in this country, just to give you an idea. 70% of Americans self-identify them as fans of either MLB, NBA or NHL or multiple. 70%, okay? And that's like -- and that's including females, males. So it's -- fandom is very strong in this country. It's very widespread. And so there are more sports fans -- There's certainly a greater preponderance of sports fans in the bundle. No doubt about that. But there is opportunity outside the bundle for other offerings.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: And this is the question I asked earlier to David Zasloff, how do you introduce a package that's complementary to your core business, that's additive to the ecosystem? So then thinking through the pricing, the bundling, what types of offers you're thinking about to bring people into your nonlinear offerings of people who are outside the bundle? And thus -- but also not disrupting the economics of your business?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Yes. We haven't -- without having -- getting into the details of our specific product plans, which are currently confidential, I would say, just broadly, it's really just a matter of thinking about this in one level of sophistication more than just, hey, I have an RSN today that I'm distributing through cable companies and satellite companies, and now I'm just going to make that same product available on a direct-to-consumer basis. That's not the answer. At least your content up into more packages, you're going to offer more content than you historically have because on a streaming basis, you have unlimited shelf space. On an RSN, you have a channel and you can only put x on it. So you have more shelf space, you have a chance to offer fans who want to go deeper with the teams, with the players, you have a chance to upsell them. You have a chance to segment your viewer base and offer products that hit the super fan, the super to medium fans, the medium fan to the casual fan. And then you could stratify your products based on their desire to engage and their desire to pay.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. You talk a bit about -- I know COVID impacted your strategies and goals for the Marquee RSN in Chicago. But how was that going up until the recent pandemic and your views on long-term goals for the strong RSN?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: So launch of Marquee has gone very well. It's a great product, great studio. Obviously, it'd be better if the Cubs' games were actually on there right now, but they're actually doing a pretty good job with what they have. And so kudos to everyone in Chicago for getting that done and just doing a fabulous job. We achieved all of our expected distribution deals, all except for Comcast, which has been widely talked about. So no secrets there. So essentially, though, we got it -- just one piece of the puzzle missing. Great-looking channel, great-looking product, just missing one key distributor, and that was just a matter of timing. I think Comcast would have been up already if the season had started on time. The season didn't start on time, and so what's the point, right? So we expect that to be resolved as soon as we understand when baseball is going to start up again.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: One last RSN, I want to ask some others, the rest of your business. There's been a couple of RSNs that come to market lately. You guys didn't pursue those or maybe they never came to market. Well, understanding your interest, your tolerance for maybe doing some more RSN additions at this point.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Yes. Look, we're always open to transactions. We're historically a consolidator. That's -- a big part of our DNA is rolling things up. We think we get synergies out of doing that. We add value out of doing that, but we do continue to be very disciplined on price. And so has to be the right properties at the right price, but we're certainly open for business on that front for the right opportunities.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. So let me turn to -- and you said this in the beginning that the -- your company is very different than it was 10 years ago. A big part of the story is retrans or reverse retrans. It's a question I like to ask network affiliates, how are you thinking about the relationship between your retransition growth and then the fixed amount of dollars back to the network? So how do you basically balance the demand to actually keep your shareholders' growing revenue stream and yet paying back networks that increasingly need more of your licensees to pay their bills?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Well, I don't know if they need more, but they want more.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: They want more.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: The -- look, as I like to say, you don't pay your bills with margin, you pay your bills with dollars. And what we're -- we have been focused on and have been successful in doing every year has been to be able to grow the difference between what we take in from the MVPDs and what we give out to the networks or what we call net retrans. And so we've been able to continue to grow that, and that's really what pays the bills at the end of the day. Certainly, the margin has gone down. But that's not what pays your bills, it's the dollars coming in the door and those continue to go up.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: And if cord-cutting picks up, you're still confident you're able to deliver the -- you'd be able to actually see a growing contribution from the net of those 2 things?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Look, there's no doubt cord cutting makes that more challenging. But when you -- we don't renew our network deals for terribly long, usually like anywhere from 2 to 4 years so that you can make adjustments when you come back to the table.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. Speaking of adjustments, this is a long question, so bear with me, okay? So last week, as you know, the NFL announced an exclusive national game with Amazon, which will add to the number of games available to viewers outside of the broadcast system. The step-up makes it -- makes some of your most coded programming by viewers and advertisers available on an alternative platform to your stations and what can be seen as a free environment, and couple that with the perception of a recessionary environment where consumers are looking for ways to save their money, it actually moves potentially more people to an OTT environment outside of broadcast. So we focus a lot of our attentions on the networks and the renewals of the NFL, but you and your stations that contract for retrans with all distributors. So as one of the largest owner stations in this country that carry NFL, how do you think about the importance of the NFL renewal by them? And then they have a silver case that more and more of the NFL broadcast may leave the pay ecosystem, right? So I'm sure you saw it as well. You have a reaction to that.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Sure. So look, first off, I'd say we're much more than just the NFL. We have a whole plethora of programming, other sports, local news, primetime, daytime, there's game shows. And so look, on the broadcast side, it's strength to strength to strength. So NFL, no doubt is important, but we're much more than just NFL. So our model doesn't live and die just based off the NFL. And there, you may see some minor amount of (inaudible) like you were just referring to with Amazon. But from everything I'm hearing and expecting, you're going to largely see status quo out of the NFL in this next round of renewals.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. So if we're hearing significant cost increases for the NFL, are you assuming that whatever the increases will be from the networks, there's going to be a build come and do for you to pay a similar type of increase along the way? So how do you think about that given all the headlines of inflation that's coming?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Sure. Well, look, we have historically always contributed towards the NFL contracts. That's been a part of many of our network affiliation agreements for quite some time. Generally, it's a pretty small percentage of the overall deal that the affiliates end up covering. The network does the deal for lots of different reasons beyond just charging us more. So we pitch in when these new deals come around. But you also got to remember that we have been through the last -- it's night and day, if you compare back to the last recession, for instance, in 2009 to now, what we used to pay them then and what we use to pay them now is, I mean, orders of magnitude different. And so they have a lot more resources now. They have a lot more cash coming in. And so they are in a much better financial position than they were 10 years ago.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Let me ask you 2 more. If any questions from the room, please send them to me. First question, as you mentioned it in the beginning of how working from home work is different. People are maybe rethinking how to do things. Just broadly on the cost side for your company, are there any things that you're thinking about on the cost side that gets redefined or reexamined during -- from coming out of this period in time, I wonder what changes on your cost structure.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: So look, we reacted pretty early to COVID and really tried to tackle nonessential expenses, discretionary expenses, and that's one of the reasons where we outperformed our expectations on Q1 EBITDA. So we pulled those levers. As we think about the business going forward, I think there will be areas, as I mentioned earlier, of greater productivity and efficiency, especially as it relates to the production side and the back office side of what we do. And so what we're really trying to do through this downturn is learn as much as we can in terms of how people are behaving, how productive they are, how can we optimize our systems and our processes and our labor to -- based on these learnings. And so right now, we haven't made any conclusions yet, but we're in a learning mode. And just to give you one example, a real-world example that's going on right now is that we have -- we're producing a new DISH cast for one of our markets, in our smaller markets in Florida, out of West Palm Beach. So it's out of a different market, and it's done with one person on a green screen on about $10,000 worth of equipment. So -- and we're live with that. And it's a smaller market. You obviously wouldn't do this in New York, but it's proving to us that we -- and it's a great -- it's a [good-looking] product. So you -- it's maybe not quite what a traditional shiny floor studio model would produce, but it's probably 95% there. So that's just sort of in beta right now. And it just points towards being able to do a lot more robust.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. One more would be on cap allocation and usage of cash flow. I know you bought stock back in the first quarter. I know you basically repaid some debt. So we're in a strange time, but how are you thinking about whatever cash you have coming in, how the allocation is going to be and sources of cash?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Well, we have -- on the STG side, we really think about it in 2 different silos or buckets. We have 2 different credit groups. And we're well on our way to -- well, I mean, look, the broadcast side will certainly have less EBITDA because of COVID-19, but we think it will rebound next year, sort of back on the trend line. So we were well on our way to hitting our leverage target on the STG side. And we don't think our path there has really deviated significantly. So we have been allocating more dollars from the STG side to repurchase equity. And then on the Diamond side, it's been all about deleveraging. And obviously, if we get DISH back, that could change things, but we don't know whether that will happen or not. So we're focused on with the cash to delever there.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: And here's my last question. People who want to send in, please be my guest. The question I have for you is, there's a good chance coming out of this that Google, Facebook, Amazon are stronger than the consumer world. Your industry is still heavily regulated with caps that are in place for a long, long time. Do you think that we get a change to the regulatory landscape on a national collapse or any change that you see post this crisis?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: You broke up on me a little bit in the very beginning. I got the question at the end. I don't know if there was something in the beginning?</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Well, the point at the beginning of the question is, there's a good chance that these national digital players will be that much stronger coming out of this, right?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Right.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: And then relatively to be how much weaker because they're going to have a -- they're rowing coming out pretty quickly. So does that change at all the regulatory landscape? Because it seems like a very uneven playing field between the digital winners and just the station industry and how it's tracking and it's fragmenting?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Yes. Look, it's a great point. In many ways, we are competing for attention, for ad dollars, for -- with the big digital companies. And they've gotten so big and so powerful, and we're so small compared to them. And I think people, certainly in D.C., they get that. They're -- hence, you see all this attention given to big tech. But unfortunately, I think the government sort of answered that maybe to try to make big techs smaller, not allow other companies to get bigger. And at least that's sort of the way the democrats are thinking about it, maybe the republicans not so much. But we're just -- we're such a overregulated industry overall. I just can't -- there's no real logical reason to continue that. And if -- but for the courts, by the way, that reality would have come to pass. The FCC did do a valiant effort to try to deregulate the industry, but the third circuit of appeals just won't let them do their job. So they are appealing to the Supreme Court, and I hope the Supreme Court takes it up and breaks this 20-year log jam we've had with the Third Circuit Court, the same judges, just for whatever reason, not allowing the FCC to do their job. And so it would be great if the Supreme Court picked that up and actually broke the log jam. And I think they would end up -- if they did take it up, I'm pretty sure they would find in favor of the FCC and allow them to move forward. And so that would be big. But absent the courts right now, I don't see anything really happening on the regulatory front until after the elections.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Okay. Well, Chris, we'll leave it there. Thank you for doing this, second year in a row. We really appreciate it. Really do.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Thanks, Mike.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Maybe next year, we'll do it live together. We'll follow up on where we've gone a year later.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Sounds good.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Thank you. Have a good day, and stay safe.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S. RIPLEY: Take care.</p><p>MICHAEL BRIAN NATHANSON: Bye.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER S.

And those two genres, in terms of live viewership, are head and shoulders above any other genre.\"</p><p>Ripley added: \"The current marketplace is getting flooded by big tech - Netflix and Amazon - on the general entertainment side. That's a problem for anyone who wants to make money. We didn't want to go up against 800-pound gorillas with unlimited cash.\"</p><p>Disney was forced to sell the RSNs, as they are known, by the Department of Justice because of antitrust concerns as part of its $71.3 billion acquisition of Fox's entertainment assets that closed earlier this year. (The slimmed-down new Fox is also built on news and live sports.) By acquiring the 21 RSNs, Sinclair will own the linear TV and streaming rights to the games of 42 pro teams: 14 Major League Baseball teams, 16 NBA teams and 12 NHL teams. </p><p>The sale requires Department of Justice approval.</p><p>The purchase includes a tapestry of rights on channels across the country, from Phoenix to Detroit to St. Louis. These are often among the most-watched local stations, but much of the networks' financial success since many were formed in the 1990s has been tied to the cable bundle.</p><p>The channels, which pay teams for the rights to broadcast games and then sell those rights to cable distributors, have counted on wide distribution of cable packages. In addition to lost revenue for RSNs from cord-cutting, many of the rights deals include already-locked-in annual increases in payments to teams. And as some networks have asked for higher distribution fees, they have been met with pushback.</p><p>SportsNet LA, which shows Dodgers games in Los Angeles, is not available in many homes in Los Angeles. Comcast did not carry the YES Network, which airs New York Yankees games, in 2016.</p><p>Ripley said he expects to package the RSNs and broadcast channels to cable distributors, which pay fees to broadcast stations even though they are available over the air free. He suggested there would be some business operations streamlining involved in sales and back-end management as well.</p><p>\"We will package things up and incentivize distributors to take everything in one package,\" Ripley said. \"Already having good relationships with distributors will be a benefit. </p><p>\"And we're not going to market with unreasonable asks. We don't expect this to be a fast-growing revenue business.\"</p><p>What the channels do have is exclusivity, which Ripley emphasized. If St. Louis Cardinals fans want to watch the Cardinals, or Detroit Tigers fans want to watch the Tigers, they will have to go to Sinclair.</p><p>\"I fundamentally believe that sports rights will be valuable for the foreseeable future and will continue to increase in value,\" Ripley said. \"There is no greater form of entertainment in terms of passion and willingness to spend. That's the passion we're tapping into and supplying, no matter what happens to the cable bundle, streaming, digital - these games will have a place in any ecosystem.\"</p><p>Ripley said Sinclair also sees opportunity in legalized sports betting and building out content on the RSNs. When they were owned by Fox before the Disney acquisition, most of the channels offered little beyond live games and pre- and postgame coverage. Sinclair, Ripley said, would also consider airing some RSN content on its broadcast stations in the future.</p><p>Sinclair's push into sports has been in the works for years. The network is in the process of finalizing a $3.5 billion deal that would make it a part-owner of the YES Network, according to a person with knowledge of the deliberations. YES was also part of the Disney-Fox deal. Other partners in that sale include the Yankees and Amazon. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>Sinclair also owns the Tennis Channel and has a stake in Stadium, a sports network that is available on broadcast TV and digitally. Earlier this year, Sinclair announced a partnership with the Chicago Cubs to form a new channel to show its games exclusively.</p><p>Additionally, Ripley said, the price of the networks made them particularly attractive. They were once valued at more than $20 billion, but Sinclair paid roughly half that. Ripley said he believed that the price was lower because many of the usual media firms that would want the RSNs, and could afford them, were unable to bid. AT&amp;T and Comcast probably would have faced regulatory approval issues, while Disney was the current seller and Fox had already sold them.</p><p>As it has acquired broadcast stations in recent years, Sinclair has come under fire for its conservative-leaning programming during news broadcasts on its local stations. The website Deadspin created a video that cut together clips of anchors on local stations reading scripted remarks excoriating \"fake news\" that seemed to echo some of President Trump's rhetoric. (Trump also supported Sinclair's effort to acquire Tribune Media, which was ultimately rejected by the FCC.) More recently, Sinclair was criticized for airing a commentary segment on its stations that defended using tear gas on migrants at the border.</p><p>Asked how such reporting about its news operation could affect the reaction to Sinclair's acquisition of the RSNs, Ripley said: \"First of all, I take umbrage that there's anything wrong with our news reporting. But setting that aside, is it a chance to rebrand the company? I think in many ways that is true. But you're not going to see any of these networks branded as Sinclair Sports. We're not a front-facing brand and never will be.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ben.strauss@washpost.com\">ben.strauss@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-ec07a836702211e98be0ca575670e91c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W28-XT31-JCDY-T0RV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1019\"/><timeReceived>4:38 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 7, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002G4M</classCode><className>SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

Cash rich companies will look to use this year to acquire tech and talent in a more buyer-friendly market or pursue consolidation opportunities. In the digi-infra space, the lockdown has emphasised the need for continued investment in technology infrastructure and the pace of fibre and data centre deals has only increased as funds and strategics flex their muscles in this critical area.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Developments in Venture Capital</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q1 20 global VC investments were significantly down against Q1 2019 (total number of deals down 20% and total deal value down 9%) and that trend has continued into Q2 against Q2 2019 (total number of deals down 23% and total deal value down 10%). VCs have understandably been focused on ensuring the health of portfolio companies, with further rounds being required to fund certain businesses through the expected crisis duration (with down-rounds starting to appear where business models of portfolio companies have been affected by the crisis, e.g. Monzo).</p><p>Deals are still getting done though and we have seen fund raises by the likes of Lilium and Cazoo in Europe (although both of those deals were in the pipeline prior to the lockdown) and Lendingkart (a virtual lender based in India) and Halodoc (an Indonesian virtual consultation app) in Asia. Those sectors benefiting from Covid-19 effects (e.g. certain bio-techs, telemedicine, remote working aids) have also been able to attract new money and VC funds have plenty of dry powder to service these opportunities.</p><p>2020 will though likely provide something of a reality check for some of the early-stage companies that are reliant on VCs to meet cash needs. Some may find it difficult to secure the necessary funds and failure rates are expected to increase (even for some with otherwise sound business models). For others, funding terms (including valuations) are generally becoming more investor-friendly (as happened after the Global Financial Crisis) and processes less company-driven as fear of missing out recedes.</p><p>Tech acquisitions</p><p>It is a varied story across different parts of the sector but, overall, M&amp;A activity has continued in the sector and we expect to see increasing activity as the year progresses. While some of U.S. Big Tech were initially impacted by reduced advertising revenues, all of FAMGA continue to generate substantial amounts of cash and are now trading above pre-crisis levels. With more than $560bn of cash on their balance sheets, we have already seen the major U.S. players starting to make acquisitions as prices moderate and liquidity issues start to bite (e.g. Amazon's play for self-driving vehicle start-up Zoox).</p><p>There remain also certain strategic imperatives for U.S. Big Tech and tech investors, for example, the ongoing battle for dominance of digital infrastructure and payment systems in Asia. The major Chinese tech companies such as Alibaba and Tencent are already embedded in the Asian payments infrastructure, and together with Huawei are seeking to rollout cloud and data centre capacity to serve populous markets demanding digital transformation services. In response we have seen Facebook's recent investments in GoPay and Jio Platforms and Google and Microsoft's data centre activity in Asia.</p><p>Major Chinese tech companies have similarly performed strongly despite the crisis and China was obviously one of the first countries to emerge from lockdown. We are likely to see these companies and other Chinese players target Europe, other parts of Asia and Latin America in the continued hunt for new markets and product areas, as was seen with Tencent's investment into Afterpay. However, governments have already tightened foreign investment controls relating to technology  (see Section 2) and we expect the regulatory response will show an increased level of protectionism in many parts of the sector (particularly for data-heavy businesses or those perceived to be developing critical technologies). At the same time, merger control authorities will continue to increase their guard against killer acquisitions. Some start-ups (if cash rich) may see an opportunity for consolidation if competitors or companies in adjacent business areas are facing distress (Revolut, for example, has indicated it will look for acquisition targets during the crisis). Major corporates are also starting to look at opportunities to acquire technology and tech talent to assist with response to disruption in their markets (e.g. Walmart's acquisition of CareZone and Verizon's acquisition of Blue Jeans Network). These acquisitions may include technology-related suppliers that are facing general liquidity issues. While on average listed technology stocks have effectively regained any losses since Covid-19 started to impact the market, prices of a number of key verticals within the sector remain dampened. Private equity funds and corporates will therefore look for value in the listed company space where pricing remains depressed due to uncertainties around post-Covid-19 trading. A key area of activity for acquisitions is in the digital infrastructure sub-sector. Strong revenue businesses such as telecom tower companies, data centres and fibre businesses continue to attract attention from major corporates and pension funds (e.g. Vantage Data Centres' acquisition (backed by Digital Colony and PSP) of Next Generation Data, the largest data centre in Europe).</p><p>With the crisis emphasising the importance of this critical technology infrastructure, we see activity remaining strong throughout the year.</p><p>Government funding measures</p><p>Governments all over the world have been responding to the Covid-19 crisis with a wide range of support measures designed to keep corporates and businesses afloat during the immediate impact of the crisis. For most developed economies, technology businesses are now a key employer and revenue generator making support for start-ups high on the list of focus areas. These funding measures are unique to each jurisdiction and governments have taken many different approaches with varying eligibility criteria and exclusions. As we emerge from lockdown, the effect of increased debt levels on tech companies could start to create a further wave of M&amp;A and fund-raising activity.</p><p>Read more:  Government Covid-19 funding measures -support for Fintechs in key jurisdictions (May 2020)</p><p>The lockdown has produced some real winners and, as with every down-turn, there is a flight to quality.

These tech companies have out-performed the market during the crisis and they are again in the regulatory spotlight. As a result, we expect to see further moves to regulate the digital economy in coming months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Increasing regulatory scrutiny</p><p>While Covid-19 has temporarily halted the UK Information Commissioner's investigation into privacy and AdTech, it seems to have done little to slow down the antitrust authorities, who are continuing to pro-actively pursue new and existing cases.</p><p>The European Commission has launched two new investigations into Apple in relation to: the terms and conditions of its app store; and its rules on how Apple Pay should be used in merchants' apps and websites. Its investigation into Amazon - Marketplace is expected to escalate in the coming months and a number of preliminary probes into Facebook and Google remain open.</p><p>In the U.S., there is also increasing scrutiny: the federal and state antitrust enforcers have opened probes into the major U.S. tech companies in the last year, while a Congressional antitrust sub-committee has been holding high-profile public hearings on conduct in the sector.</p><p>Regulating the digital economy</p><p>However, the most significant developments over the next year may stem from increased legislative efforts to regulate the digital economy. The GDPR marked a watershed in efforts to regulate data not just in the EU but globally: the so-called \"Brussels Effect\" resulting in (perhaps begrudging) widespread adoption of a higher standard of general privacy compliance, with jurisdictions as far afield as Thailand and India among those taking or expected to take the European rules as a model for their own markets in 2020.</p><p>Its impact has not been lost on policymakers, with the next year expected to see the initiation of even more sweeping regulatory reform that will directly impact tech companies:</p><p>At the EU level, at the start of June the EU Commission launched a public consultation on the Digital Services Act and a 'new competition tool' that would allow it to initiate market investigations into perceived structural competition problems, with the ability to impose market-wide remedies on companies. Also, the long-awaited ePrivacy Regulation remains on the horizon. The former is already tagged as a legislative \"bulldozer\", covering topics such as online platforms' responsibility for content as well as new antitrust powers for the European Commission.</p><p>In the UK, the CMA's final report from its market study into online platforms and digital advertising was published in July, recommending that the UK government establish a new regulatory regime for online platforms. The report includes a wide range of politically controversial proposals, including the potential breakup of Google and Facebook, to address a slew of competition concerns in relation to the AdTech industry. The autumn should also bring news of the UK government's plan for its new online harms regime, with legislation said to follow soon afterwards.</p><p>Finally, U.S. regulatory developments are likely to turn heavily on the outcome of the elections in November, but may ultimately be the most momentous given Big Tech's centre of gravity on the U.S. West Coast.</p><p>Read more:  UK's CMA seeks new regulatory regime to take on Google and Facebook (July 2020)</p><p>Read more:  The EU's Digital Services Act: Difficult choices ahead (June 2020)</p><p>Opening new regulatory fronts</p><p>These legislative efforts are seeking in part to embed the lessons of the last few years, as well as opening new regulatory fronts. For example, the EU's recent Platform - to - Business Regulation addresses how online platforms treat businesses operating on their platforms - a concern which has run through the European Commission's antitrust investigations over the last decade.</p><p>The EU is also consulting on proposals to impose wide-ranging new rules on online platforms deemed to hold significant market power. Germany will enact similar rules in the Autumn and the UK is actively doing likewise. This would mark a significant escalation of the intensity of regulation and draws parallels with the European Commission's \"access\" regime imposed on telecommunications markets in the early 2000s. Indeed, Europe is not alone with the Japanese Diet having passed the Digital Platform Transparency Act at the end of May. Although aiming to compel platform operators to deal with business users and consumers with greater fairness and transparency, this new legislation has drawn criticism from industry leaders (including the CEO of e-commerce giant Rakuten) who complain that it will have an adverse effect on technology innovation in Japan.</p><p>Harmonising competing policy objectives</p><p>To regulate Big Tech effectively, legislation will need to harmonise competing policy objectives, notably privacy and anti-trust law, encouraging competition while also offering individuals sufficient protection in their interactions with digital markets. The next decade may well be spent examining, shaping, and implementing the legislative efforts of the next year.</p><p>There continues to be an increasingly interventionist approach to regulating the digital economy. - Christian Ahlborn Tech Sector Leader, Competition Partner, London</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

They can also order technology companies such as Facebook and Google -- both of which opposed the bill during its fast-tracked process through parliament -- to block accounts or sites spreading false information. </p><p>The act also provides for prosecutions of individuals, who can face fines of up to 50,000 SGD (over $36,000), and, or, up to five years in prison. If the alleged falsehood is posted using \"an inauthentic online account or controlled by a bot,\" the total potential fine rises to 100,000 SGD (around $73,000), and, or, up to 10 years in prison. </p><p>Companies found guilty of spreading \"fake news\" can face fines of up to 1 million SGD (around $735,000).</p><p>The government has promised anyone who is affected by the bill will be able to lodge an appeal quickly and cheaply, but rights groups and lawyers have repeatedly warned it could be subject to abuse and may have a stifling effect on free speech. </p><p>Singapore's Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam said that ministers will have to explain why a piece of content is false if they are ordering a takedown or correction, and will not simply be able to arbitrarily issue a ruling. </p><p>'Political purposes'</p><p>Speaking at the time Parliament was considering the bill, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong the \"power to hold online news sources and platforms accountable if they proliferate deliberate online falsehoods.\"</p><p>\"If we do not protect ourselves, hostile parties will find it a simple matter to turn different groups against one another and cause disorder in our society,\" Lee said, echoing concerns voiced by other lawmakers that Singapore's small, multi-ethnic, multi-religious society makes it particularly vulnerable to misleading content spread online.</p><p>But despite repeated assurances by the government that the bill is only intended to stop the rapid spread of malicious falsehoods, many critics remain unconvinced, pointing to Singapore's poor record on press freedom and protecting political dissent. </p><p>In the most recent world rankings on press freedom by watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Singapore placed 151 out of 180 countries, among the worst positions for a country that considers itself a democracy.</p><p>Human Rights Watch Asia deputy director Phil Robertson told CNN in April he expected the new bill -- which comes ahead of elections next year -- to be used for \"political purposes.\"</p><p>\"The Singapore government has a long history of calling everything they disagree with as false and misleading,\" he said.</p><p>While the law is aimed primarily at controlling content within Singapore, rights groups have also pointed to the potential leverage it will give over big tech firms and international media with large presences in the city state, including Facebook, Twitter and Google. </p><p>\"This law would give Singapore overwhelming leverage over the likes of Facebook and Twitter to remove whatever the government determines is 'misleading',\" Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's Regional Director for East and Southeast Asia, said in a statement. \"This is an alarming scenario. While tech firms must take all steps to make digital spaces safe for everyone, this does not provide governments an excuse to interfere with freedom of expression -- or rule over the news feed.\"</p><p>The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), a grouping of prominent judges and lawyers, also condemned the law ahead of its introduction, saying there was a \"real risk that the law will be misused to clamp down on opinions or information critical of the government.\" </p><p>Controls on speech</p><p>Singapore is only the latest country to introduce new regulations aimed at stopping the spread of false or extremist content online. </p><p>Often these laws are fast-tracked through legislatures in response to specific events or media panics, without the scrutiny that would typically accompany such far-reaching laws. </p><p>In April, after just two days of deliberations -- and over the protests of critical lawmakers, industry experts and rights groups -- Australia introduced new legislation in response to New Zealand's Christchurch massacre, much of which was streamed online. Under the laws, internet firms like Facebook and Google will be compelled to remove violent content or face massive fines and even prison time.</p><p>Similar proposals in the United Kingdom are currently in a consultation phase, though their passage may by stymied by ongoing political turmoil over Brexit and a potential election within the next year. </p><p>In Fiji, officials used a media storm over revenge porn to ram through a law opposition legislators and activists said was a \"Trojan horse\" for censorship and control of online speech. </p><p>Speaking about the Singaporean legislation, Kirsten Han, editor of the South East Asia-focused news site New Naratif, told CNN in April that the problem was in part fueled by platforms failure to tackle issues by themselves. </p><p>\"The problems that tech companies have had with fake news and hate speech have given (governments) a good opportunity to justify the need for such laws,\" she said. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

They can also order technology companies such as Facebook and Google -- both of which opposed the bill during its fast-tracked process through parliament -- to block accounts or sites spreading false information.</p><p>The act also provides for prosecutions of individuals, who can face fines of up to 50,000 SGD (over $36,000), and, or, up to five years in prison. If the alleged falsehood is posted using \"an inauthentic online account or controlled by a bot,\" the total potential fine rises to 100,000 SGD (around $73,000), and, or, up to 10 years in prison.</p><p>Companies found guilty of spreading \"fake news\" can face fines of up to 1 million SGD (around $735,000).</p><p>The government has promised anyone who is affected by the bill will be able to lodge an appeal quickly and cheaply, but rights groups and lawyers have repeatedly warned it could be subject to abuse and may have a stifling effect on free speech.</p><p>Singapore's Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam said that ministers will have to explain why a piece of content is false if they are ordering a takedown or correction, and will not simply be able to arbitrarily issue a ruling.</p><p/><p>'Political purposes'</p><p>Speaking at the time Parliament was considering the bill, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong the \"power to hold online news sources and platforms accountable if they proliferate deliberate online falsehoods.\"</p><p>\"If we do not protect ourselves, hostile parties will find it a simple matter to turn different groups against one another and cause disorder in our society,\" Lee said, echoing concerns voiced by other lawmakers that Singapore's small, multi-ethnic, multi-religious society makes it particularly vulnerable to misleading content spread online.</p><p>But despite repeated assurances by the government that the bill is only intended to stop the rapid spread of malicious falsehoods, many critics remain unconvinced, pointing to Singapore's poor record on press freedom and protecting political dissent.</p><p>In the most recent world rankings on press freedom by watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Singapore placed 151 out of 180 countries, among the worst positions for a country that considers itself a democracy.</p><p>Human Rights Watch Asia deputy director Phil Robertson told CNN in April he expected the new bill -- which comes ahead of elections next year -- to be used for \"political purposes.\"</p><p>\"The Singapore government has a long history of calling everything they disagree with as false and misleading,\" he said.</p><p>While the law is aimed primarily at controlling content within Singapore, rights groups have also pointed to the potential leverage it will give over big tech firms and international media with large presences in the city state, including Facebook, Twitter and Google.</p><p>\"This law would give Singapore overwhelming leverage over the likes of Facebook and Twitter to remove whatever the government determines is 'misleading',\" Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International's Regional Director for East and Southeast Asia, said in a statement. \"This is an alarming scenario. While tech firms must take all steps to make digital spaces safe for everyone, this does not provide governments an excuse to interfere with freedom of expression -- or rule over the news feed.\"</p><p>The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), a grouping of prominent judges and lawyers, also condemned the law ahead of its introduction, saying there was a \"real risk that the law will be misused to clamp down on opinions or information critical of the government.\"</p><p/><p>Controls on speech</p><p>Singapore is only the latest country to introduce new regulations aimed at stopping the spread of false or extremist content online.</p><p>Often these laws are fast-tracked through legislatures in response to specific events or media panics, without the scrutiny that would typically accompany such far-reaching laws.</p><p>In April, after just two days of deliberations -- and over the protests of critical lawmakers, industry experts and rights groups -- Australia introduced new legislation in response to New Zealand's Christchurch massacre, much of which was streamed online. Under the laws, internet firms like Facebook and Google will be compelled to remove violent content or face massive fines and even prison time.</p><p>Similar proposals in the United Kingdom are currently in a consultation phase, though their passage may by stymied by ongoing political turmoil over Brexit and a potential election within the next year.</p><p>In Fiji, officials used a media storm over revenge porn to ram through a law opposition legislators and activists said was a \"Trojan horse\" for censorship and control of online speech.</p><p>Speaking about the Singaporean legislation, Kirsten Han, editor of the South East Asia-focused news site New Naratif, told CNN in April that the problem was in part fueled by platforms failure to tackle issues by themselves.</p><p>\"The problems that tech companies have had with fake news and hate speech have given (governments) a good opportunity to justify the need for such laws,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20191001singapore-fake-news-internet-censorship-intl-hnk1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X62-B641-DY60-M11Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"943\"/><timeReceived>1:05 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 1, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It is one of the most far-reaching sources of information and media, so it is no surprise that in today's world news reaches people faster than ever before. The new law in Singapore enables the government to regulate news on social media. There is no denying the absolute success of social media, it has become a necessity of the modern world, however with the rise of social media there has been a steady rise of fake news as well. Fake news acts as threat to democracy, debate and order. Social media enables the spread of fake news as there is no established set of checks and corrections.</p><p>It is as simple to be equipped with an email id and false information to spread fake news. There have been turbulent information in recent times regarding substantial social media platforms misusing information and spreading fake news that it comes as no surprise that government bodies decide to step in to regulate the news present on social media. This is currently taking place in Singapore, despite protests from activists and social media platforms.  The new law enables government ministers to demand online platforms to put warnings against any information they might deem false and in extreme situations have the information taken down. The law entails a fine up to SGD 1m (USD 720,000) and jail terms up to 10 years.</p><p>The new bill has activists worried that this might bring upon restriction on rights such as free speech and right to freedom of expressions and academics are worried that this might hinder academic freedom. Big tech companies who have their Asian headquarters in Singapore are worried as well, Google said the passing of the new legislation is likely to hurt innovation and the growth of the digital information ecosystem, but the law is a step towards setting up a system which ensures the regulation of the authenticity of the news which circulates within social media, which is one of the world's influential source of media.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

URA just exhibited the Draft Masterplan 2019. It puts together all of our urban plans for the next 10-15 years, and we do have many exciting plans to take our city to the next level in that timeframe. Singapore may be very built up, but we also have new greenfield sites to build, for example, in Punggol Digital District. So there are new districts, new greenfield sites and over the longer term, even the Greater Southern Waterfront for us to develop and think about what new solutions can be put in place.   </p><p>New public and private sector investments are needed to realise these plans. We are very mindful that in putting these plans together, we should not continue with a business as usual approach. It should not just be building more of the same. Each time we do a new project, it has to be better than what we have before. For example, whenever we have a new public housing estate, we are always looking to push the frontiers of sustainable living. Punggol was our first eco precinct where we prototyped and test bedded new ideas. Now, we're developing a new town in Tengah and we're taking it even further. So that must always be the mind-set in Singapore because this is a small little island and the only place that we have. The mind-set of continuous improvement must be there to keep Singapore moving forward.</p><p>And that's why R&amp;D is so important. It is necessary to enable us to develop new and more effective ways to build a better city for the future. To use a military phrase, investing in R&amp;D for our city is a \"force multiplier\". It amplifies and enhances whatever assets we have and makes it better and more impactful.  </p><p>Some of the research we do will not make headlines. Some of the research we do deal with very pedestrian, day-to-day issues. They are not the big tech topics of the day. They are not the things that investors are looking at to create the next big unicorn. But they can lead to outcomes which benefit Singaporeans, and enhance our daily lives.</p><p>For example, one project we are working on is the Cool Singapore project. It's a big issue with rising temperatures not just at the global level but also urban heat island effects. So we are looking to develop cool coatings and building materials, so that our buildings and roads absorb less heat, and we can find ways to lower the ambient temperature and improve thermal comfort.</p><p>Another example is the research we are doing on trees. We do research on many things including on trees in Singapore. We have more than 2 million trees planted all over Singapore on state land, and we will plant many more. It's wonderful to have trees in our little city, we are a City in a Garden, but each time a tree falls or gets uprooted, potential accidents can happen. And so we want our trees to be healthy, we want them to be safe. So we're studying the impact of environmental conditions like strong winds on a tree's stability. We're modelling that so that we can estimate how much force will break or uproot a tree, and then appropriate protective measures can be taken.</p><p>These are just two examples of many research projects that we have been doing over the past years and we will need to take even more innovative ideas to tackle future challenges. Some of these longer term challenges are existential in nature, for example, threats like climate change and rising sea levels. How do we deal with that, understand the nature of the threat and take protective action? Some are shorter- to medium-term concerns, like meeting the needs of our ageing population, keeping our infrastructure up to date and meeting the growing demands from our people for a better quality of life at a sustainable cost. So we are doing all these to improve the quality of life and create a better city for our people. But there is also an economic imperative to upgrade, innovate and transform our city.</p><p>We want to ensure that our urban infrastructure is first-class and up-to-date, and our city is competitive and relevant. That has always been Singapore's competitive advantage and we must continue to keep it that way because the competition is intense. There are many cities around the world, all looking to upgrade themselves and success is never preordained. Whatever we can do, others can do too. We're building our Changi airport, we have T3, we have built T4, we have built Jewel, now we are building T5. Each time we do one, it's getting better, but others can easily follow the same thing. We're building a new terminal in Tuas. We're trying to make it better. Others are following suit too. So the competition among cities is real and we have to continue to keep pace and ensure that whatever we have continues to push the boundaries and provides first class, best in class infrastructure for investments. This is how we can continue to attract new investments, new economic activities, anchor them here in Singapore, because it is an attractive place to do business, and we can create more good jobs for Singaporeans. So that's the economic imperative to do R&amp;D.;</p><p>Besides addressing national issues, R&amp;D can also be a source of competitive advantage for our companies. Compared to the past, we now have a stronger eco-system in the built environment industry, in the private sector. Many of our companies in the built environment, be it developers, utilities providers, consultants or builders, many of you, besides doing projects within Singapore, have also been venturing abroad, building your own external wings. When you compete overseas for projects, you know that the competition is intense and you are often fighting against large international, global players. So you need to differentiate yourselves with deep capabilities in several niche areas where you can play a useful role and provide a good value proposition.</p><p>Unfortunately, our surveys indicate that the built environment industry in Singapore currently invests only a small fraction of its revenue in research and innovation. I hope to be proven wrong but this is from survey results. We are doing far less in the built environment, in the private sector, compared to other industries within Singapore, and certainly compared to international benchmarks. So there is scope for the private sector, for our companies to do more R&amp;D and innovation, and commercialise your research into solutions that can be deployed within Singapore, and in markets overseas. The Government will do our part to help you in this journey.</p><p>That is why two years ago, I announced a new Cities of Tomorrow (CoT) R&amp;D programme. It focused on the built environment and we had four verticals - advanced construction, resilient infrastructure, creating of new spaces and, sustainability and liveability. This is not the entirety of the Government's R&amp;D in urban solutions. For example, we also have research and development in agri-tech, in urban mobility, in energy and in water. But within the MND Family particularly, and within the built environment space, the CoT programme was something we started to help push R&amp;D efforts in this area.</p><p>I am happy to announce that two years since we launched this programme, we have made good progress. We launched Grant Calls for 30 R&amp;D projects. We received many applications and I am very happy to see that notwithstanding the point I made just now that surveys indicate low spending on R&amp;D, 75% of the applications we received involved the private sector. So we are seeing more responses from companies. We want to continue to develop and grow this Cities of Tomorrow programme.  In the next two years, we will be adding more areas of research.</p><p>One, under advanced construction, we are exploring additive manufacturing or 3D printing for buildings. This enables industry players to speed up construction and improve construction quality, while reducing manpower, cost and wastage. Under resilient infrastructure, we are looking to explore technologies like automation, predictive analytics and robotics for smart facilities management (FM). The aim is to reduce our reliance on manpower for infrastructure and building maintenance, but also lower the cost and raise productivity, particularly in managing our ageing infrastructure and estates. This is a topic not only useful for Singapore, but for cities all over the world. It is very easy to think about building something new, but not a lot of people have applied their minds to looking at more effective maintenance, particularly in the areas I talked about, and in using data and technology to do this. So we hope to also grow a new research area in this space.</p><p>Third, in the area of sustainability and liveability, we would like to explore how buildings and spaces affect human beings. This is research that is interesting, it is multi-disciplinary, and we can bring together different fields, including architecture and design, psychology, as well as social and behavioural science to better understand how building forms and spaces can shape human behaviours. The intent is to rigorously assess what really makes for good human-centric design. Too much of this work today is done by intuition. It is very subjective. While it may be a subjective process, scientific methods can enable us to do this work more rigourously, more effectively.</p><p>So with this expanded scope of the Cities of Tomorrow programme, we expect to invest close to $70m on CoT projects over the next two years. I will encourage all researchers, be it from our research institutions, our Institutes of Higher Learning or companies, to look out for our Grant Calls and to submit proposals. We will be putting out Grant Calls in this areas, so look out for them.</p><p>I am very mindful that the journey from R&amp;D to commercial solutions is not easy. That's why we have been looking at ways to strengthen partnerships with the private sector to support all of you in your R&amp;D journey. There are several ways we can do so. I will share three broad ideas. First, government agencies have been and will continue to work with the industry as co-investors and co-developers of research and innovation. We do have a healthy pipeline of public sector projects coming on stream. For many of this projects, it is not the government doing all of it by ourselves. We want to engage the private sector, not just as vendors, not only as people to build, but also to co-develop new, promising, bold ideas. Certainly within the MND Family, I would encourage all my agencies like HDB, URA, NParks and BCA to adopt this mind-set and approach.</p><p>I am happy that this morning, we have two agreements that are being signed. HDB has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Evonik for the development and deployment of advanced materials, and also a research Collaboration Agreement (RCA) with V-Key, which makes it easier and more secure to use smart home appliances in HDB flats. That's one approach where government agencies proactively work with the private sector in order to do joint research and co-develop new ideas with you.</p><p>Second, for the bigger companies, some of you probably already have some R&amp;D programme in place, and some idea of technology road mapping for the future.  One way for you to take this further is to set up a Corporate Lab in collaboration with one of our universities. The Government through the National Research Foundation will support the effort with a scheme to provide funding support for companies that are interested in doing such a Corporate Laboratory. The idea is to encourage public-private R&amp;D collaboration between universities and companies. So universities in Singapore can work on cutting-edge solutions to industry problems. This will not apply to all companies. But the bigger companies with scale, who already have some intent to do R&amp;D would be in a position to set up a Corporate Laboratory.</p><p>For example, in the built environment space, we already have corporate labs set up by companies.  Surbana-Jurong together with NTU has set up a corporate lab and they are doing research on Underground Storage, Sustainable Indoor Solutions, Digital Technologies for Building Productivity. Sembcorp in collaboration with NUS has a corporate lab looking at energy (optimisation of power generation), water treatment (enhancing industrial used water treatment) and waste management.</p><p>These are two examples and certainly there can be many more. We have many companies in the built-environment space. For those of you who think you can benefit from setting up a corporate lab, it comes with Government support, so you are not having to invest 100% of the cost for R&amp;D.; The Government through the NRF will support you in this joint endeavour and I hope some companies can consider the benefits of doing so and participate in this. That is the second way in which companies can do more in R&amp;D.;</p><p>Third, we know that not all companies are ready to have their own corporate labs. Many smaller firms will face many barriers to invest in research. It is costly and risky to invest, and the investments you put in may or may not translate into useable solutions. Companies may also not find it easy to source for partners to perform R&amp;I.;</p><p>We have looked at this issue carefully, because the bigger companies can do something, but how do we support the broader grouping of companies in the built environment space. We have decided that the way to support all of you is to set up a platform called the Built Environment Technology Alliance (BETA) or BETA. What is BETA? It is a membership platform where we will bring together industry stakeholders and catalyse more industry R&amp;D.;</p><p>To illustrate further, today, under most of the research done under the Government, the research tends to be driven from the top down. The Government will specify a problem or challenge statement, we will put out a call and we receive proposals from the industry or from research institutions. With BETA, we will not be specifying the problem statements from the top down. Instead we will let companies drive the process, and specify your needs and your requirements.  </p><p>If you join BETA as a company with a specific problem, BETA might link you up with the relevant research institutions to conduct the necessary R&amp;D work. Or BETA could tell you that there is a start-up or a company here that has a solution there might meet your needs, so why don't you consider this particular solution.  </p><p>Or alternatively, a firm may want to deploy a new R&amp;D product. You think it is quite effective but it is still at the research stage and you can approach BETA. BETA will help you to find potential end-adopters. Some of these may be government agencies like HDB or JTC, or it could be a private company too. They will provide that matching service - government agencies and private companies may then be able to work with that particular company to research, test bed and eventually commercialise the product. So we envisage a platform like this where industry stakeholders can come together. You may be an innovator, you may be a developer, you may be a consultant, but regardless of where you are from, working together as one stakeholder group to catalyse more industry R&amp;D.;</p><p>Besides such matching and bringing together of stakeholders, BETA will also provide physical space, equipment and facilities for members to work on their research innovations. For many small firms, this requires capital expenditure which they are not able to cough up. Hopefully by providing access to shared services, it will help to bring down the upfront cost of doing R&amp;D work. There will also be funding support to help companies co-share the cost and risk of R&amp;D.;  </p><p>Finally, if it is a product you want to commercialise, we are prepared to look at the regulatory sandbox. Particularly if there are regulatory impediments, we will help you and facilitate the process of engaging the different regulators, to see how we can enable deployment of this new solution.</p><p>I have provided a broad outline of how BETA works. We will be sharing more details in due course.  But I hope this can be something useful to companies in the built environment space. We have shared this with some of our companies and many of them have expressed interest to join BETA. They range from developers like Capitaland and City Developments Limited, to builders like Tiong Seng, Woh Hup as well as companies like Sembcorp and Surbana Jurong. We welcome more companies, more researchers, more research institutions to be part of BETA, and we look forward to your active participation when we roll this out eventually.</p><p>This morning, we are also recognising some of the R&amp;D projects that have been done in the public sector working in collaboration with the private sector. We are recognising some of the recipients of the MND R&amp;D Awards this year. Many of the projects demonstrate good teamwork and partnerships between government agencies, research institutions and the industry. Through their hard work and commitment, we have seen how our investments in research have helped to improve the daily lives of Singaporeans.</p><p>With all the various efforts that I have just announced, we hope that we can catalyse more R&amp;D in the built environment space. We need this to happen. This is not just a good to have. This is something that is critical, to take us to our next stage of development. I know companies will have concerns about spending more on R&amp;D.; Particularly when you look at the overall economic environment - you see dark clouds over the horizon. But a period of difficult and challenging times is precisely the thing that should give us the impetus to build capabilities now so that eventually, we can emerge stronger after the downturn.</p><p>It is challenging but we shouldn't lose this opportunity to think about what ways we can build new capabilities through research and innovation. The government will be doing its part. As I said, with different programmes and initiatives, with funding support, and we look forward to strengthening this partnership with the private sector in order to build a better city in the future. Through this morning's R&amp;D congress, I hope we can strengthen our partnerships between the different stakeholders in the public and private sector and together embark on this exciting journey ahead to build a better Singapore for tomorrow. Thank you very much.</p><p>Source: Ministry of National Development, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0048691337</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMS-S0T1-JB5M-W55W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3105\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 23, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001430</classCode><className>PUBLIC HOUSING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N230000CC</classCode><className>CONSTRUCTION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009S2V</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST0008XKH</classCode><className>CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS &amp; COMPONENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>GC311</classCode><className>SINGAPORE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

For instance, it shows exemplary use cases - a global first. But it still requires more work.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The framework was first launched in January last year at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The Model AI Governance Framework, as it is called, won an award at a United Nations-sponsored summit for its ability to foster socio-economic development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> While groundbreaking at that time for summing up the principles that should be adhered to - such as explainability, transparency, fairness and human-centricity - the framework lacked examples to show how these enigmatic principles could be applied in the real world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Last month, the framework document was updated with a dozen use cases - including those from Grab, DBS Bank, HSBC and American multinational pharmaceutical firm Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (MSD) - to do just this.</p><p> The updated document, totalling 119 pages, also comes with a self-assessment tool that distils the upheld principles into a questionnaire checklist. It aims to be an authoritative global guide for responsible, transparent and accountable AI use.</p><p>  AI seeks to simulate human traits - such as problem solving, learning, planning and predicting. The technology can also process a vast amount of information and predict outcomes faster and more accurately than humans. But it can also run amok, requiring human oversight and accountability.</p><p> Thus, the level of human involvement in AI-based decision-making was discussed at length in all use cases in the framework document.</p><p> In situations where the probability and severity of harm to humans are low, no human involvement is required. Grab's example was used to explain how this approach can be justified.</p><p> The ride-hailing firm has completely outsourced ride allocations to an AI algorithm in what is known as a \"human-out-of-the-loop\" approach. The algorithm takes into account drivers' preferred trip types, and where they start and end their day to reduce trip cancellations initiated by them.</p><p> Grab's justification: It is not technically feasible for a human to manage the high volume of trip allocations - over 5,000 a minute. Also, there is little or no harm done when assigned trips are cancelled.</p><p> The approach is contrasted with two opposites by DBS and MSD, for their AI efforts to counter money laundering and flag employees with the highest risk of quitting, respectively.</p><p>DBS, the largest bank in South-east Asia, has automated its money laundering detection system, but it also involves human supervisors when necessary. The system first flags suspicious transactions. Then an AI system rates the likelihood of the flagged activities to be criminal by analysing historical trends. The bank's human supervisors will need to review only cases with high risk ratings.</p><p>  Human involvement satisfies both the AI framework and the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) requirement for accountable decision-making.</p><p> Similarly, MSD requires human oversight in human resource-related decisions, even though it uses an AI algorithm to predict which employee is most likely to quit.</p><p> The pharmaceutical firm recognises that managing attrition risk is sensitive. Even though its AI system analyses employee data such as work tenure and performance ratings to make predictions, the system is not given a free hand to act on the predictions.</p><p> It recognises the risk of discrimination and potential for a huge backlash if biased or inaccurate data used in the prediction leads to the unfair and wrongful treatment of employees, such as the withholding of benefits.</p><p> The harm that AI can inflict on its human creators is no longer the imagination of robot apocalypse fiction writers when one looks at recent AI episodes.</p><p> Take Microsoft's 2016 chatbot Tay, which learnt profanities in less than 24 hours from the Twitter community and started spewing offensive racist remarks. The machine has since been taken down.</p><p> Similarly in 2018, e-commerce giant Amazon shut down its AI recruitment engine after discovering it had discriminated against women.</p><p> In Amazon's case, its AI system used all the job applications it had received over a 10-year period to learn how to spot the best candidates. As in many technology firms, Amazon has a low proportion of women working in the company. The algorithm picked that up and decided that male dominance was a success factor.</p><p> Admittedly, Ms Kathy Baxter, architect of ethical AI practice at software firm Salesforce, said: \"AI can be both a blessing (and) a curse.\"</p><p> That AI wields a double-edged sword is one of the most difficult conundrums for humans in the current digital age.</p><p> These issues have contributed to heightened discourse in AI ethics and governance over the last year.</p><p> Minister for Communications and Information S. Iswaran, in announcing the updated framework in Davos two weeks ago, said: \"There are concerns about how (AI) will be used, and whether people can have trust in AI when it is used.\"</p><p>  The framework, for all that it aims to achieve, lacks authority and bite in its current form.</p><p> First, it could be stricter on ensuring that the positive examples it cites are able to stand up to scrutiny, even if adhering to the guidelines is entirely voluntary.</p><p> Specifically, companies could be more transparent about the data that goes into their algorithms and how AI decisions are derived, especially if they have completely outsourced decision-making to AI.</p><p> Currently, the framework allows companies to provide a narrative that suits their agenda.</p><p>            Take the Grab use case. The framework document does not shine any light on what other data goes into its algorithm. For instance, does Grab consider consumers' feedback on bad routes, lousy share-ride matches and driver problems'</p><p> Also, how are dynamic prices and surge fares set? Does Grab practise price discrimination based on data from users' devices or their past records in accepting higher prices? How do consumers know if they are being taken for a ride if they do not know what others are paying'</p><p> When asked, Grab declined to provide more clarity to The Straits Times.</p><p> In fact, being open about what data goes into an algorithm does not compromise one's competitive advantage. It is one thing experts have suggested companies can afford to be more open about, without spilling their secret sauce, source code or intellectual property.</p><p> Another way to be transparent without losing one's trade secrets is to reveal if an algorithm can generate consistent results across a diverse range of people, and disclose the margin of error.</p><p> Said Ms Baxter: \"Today, people expect to know what's in their food or the medication they take, and companies expect to know the details of the electrical components they purchase or the ingredients in the chemicals they use.</p><p> \"When AI becomes more common, businesses, governments and the society will have similar expectations.\"</p><p> There are exceptions, however.</p><p> For instance, DBS has declined to share how its AI system spots money laundering. It does not want to give crooks the tools to reverse engineer its process - a valid reason, and an outcome that the MAS requires.</p><p>  To improve consumers' representation in the rapidly developing AI field, the Singapore AI framework could also take in more voices from academia and non-profit organisations.</p><p> To be sure, most of the 38 organisations that helped to shape the second edition of the AI framework are commercially driven. They include big tech firms Apple, Google, Facebook, IBM and Microsoft as well as banks, insurance firms, pharmaceutical firms and consultancy firms.</p><p> Including more voices from non-profit organisations and academics will offer a variety of perspectives, including those from consumers.</p><p> Noting the importance of diversity in opinion, Ms Baxter said: \"Having different people coming in with different expertise, different lenses to ask questions... is really important... to identify what are the assumptions that everybody is making in a homogeneous (setting).\"</p><p>  Including more voices from non-commercially driven entities can lead to more robust discussion on data ownership, which is lacking in the framework.</p><p> One idea bandied about in the academic community as a solution to the AI ethical conundrum is to allow consumers to own, and thus price and sell, their personal data.</p><p> Personal data is said to be the oil of the 21st century and is essential for companies involved in AI development.</p><p> \"AI implementers will be motivated to be more accountable and transparent about the mechanics behind their algorithms to obtain the data they need from consumers,\" said Assistant Professor Bryan Low from the National University of Singapore's department of computer science.</p><p> Greater clarity on data ownership will also allow any wealth gained from AI use to be shared. After all, companies benefit commercially from using a massive amount of consumer data - including their health, Internet usage, facial features, voice patterns and location information - to train AI systems.</p><p> The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation - which gives EU residents the right to know what data is being kept and request for it to be deleted - provides latitude for the pricing of personal data.</p><p> If every EU resident asks for all their data to be erased, companies will need to find new ways to collect data, or even pay consumers directly for it instead of paying in kind with their free services.</p><p> The downside is those who can afford to keep their privacy will get to keep it. But those who cannot afford it will sell it. The result is a skewed data set.</p><p>  There has also been discussion on whether new laws should be introduced to curb the irresponsible use of AI, rather than rely on voluntary ethical frameworks.</p><p> Governments and legislators are reluctant to pass laws at this point in time to avoid stifling the development of AI.</p><p> And while the use of data without consent has come into the spotlight following the 2018 Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal - where millions of people's data was used for political advertising purposes - there has not been a comparable scandal in the field of AI to attract regulatory and public ire.</p><p> \"Legislation tends to be more reactive when there is no former precedence,\" said Prof Low.</p><p> Just as big tech firms had enjoyed unbridled growth for more than a decade before they came under tighter regulations on fake news and personal data collection and use, AI deployments will likely be put on a long leash for a while.</p><p> Even so, there is still plenty of room for companies to improve the way they account for their AI use. It starts with engaging those most affected - consumers and employees.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-658743</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4T-YHS1-JCF2-80K2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1795\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00042AK</classCode><className>MERCK SHARP &amp;

If the \"fake news\" is posted using \"an inauthentic online account or controlled by a bot,\" the total potential fine rises to 100,000 SGD (around $73,000), and, or, up to 10 years in prison.</p><p>Companies such as Facebook, if found guilty of spreading \"fake news,\" can face fines of up to 1 million SGD (around $735,000).</p><p>What exactly constitutes \"a false statement of fact\" is to be defined by the government, which can then choose to issue a demand for a correction, removal of the offending post, or to pursue legal action against the poster or social network.</p><p/><p>Singapore has a poor record on press freedom. In the most recent world rankings on press freedom by watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Singapore placed 151 out of 180 countries, among the worst positions for a country that considers itself a democracy.</p><p>Human Rights Watch Asia deputy director Phil Robertson told CNN he expected the new bill -- which comes ahead of elections later this year -- to be used for \"political purposes.\"</p><p>\"The Singapore government has a long history of calling everything they disagree with as false and misleading,\" he said.</p><p>The bill is supported by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and is almost certain to pass the ruling-party dominated Parliament.</p><p>As well as general free speech concerns, it will also raise serious questions for international tech and media companies which call Singapore home, including Facebook, Google and the BBC, all of which have their Asia headquarters in the city-state. While CNN has no editorial presence in Singapore, its parent company WarnerMedia has offices in the city.</p><p>That international presence could make those companies vulnerable to pressure from the Singapore government, and potentially put employees at risk of prosecution should they not comply with the new law.</p><p>Facebook's director of public policy for Asia-Pacific, Simon Milner, said that while the company in principle supported regulation on spreading online falsehoods, it had concerns at the law's granting of \"broad powers to the Singapore executive branch to compel us to remove content they deem to be false and proactively push a government notification to users.\"</p><p>CNN has reached out to Google and the BBC for comment.</p><p/><p>'Serious problem'</p><p>The new Singaporean bill follows a pattern of governments around the world, but particularly in Asia, seizing on legitimate concerns about fake news and other issues to pass new laws critics say are designed to clamp down on online expression.</p><p>In January, Fiji enacted a new law on online safety critics say is a \"Trojan horse\" for censorship of the internet, while since 2017 in the Philippines, Cambodia and Malaysia concerns about \"fake news\" have been used to justify new crackdowns on media. Malaysia has since repealed its fake news law, but the other countries continue to defend them as necessary for protecting citizens online. China too, the world's most sophisticated censor of the internet, has used concerns about online misinformation to defend its own sweeping controls on free speech.</p><p>Speaking Friday at an anniversary event for Channel NewsAsia, Singapore PM Lee said fake news was a \"serious problem for many countries.\"</p><p>He defended the new law as giving the government the \"power to hold online news sources and platforms accountable if they proliferate deliberate online falsehoods.\"</p><p>\"This includes requiring them to show corrections or display warnings about online falsehoods, so that readers or viewers can see all sides, and make up their own minds about the matter. In extreme and urgent cases, the legislation will also require online news sources to take down fake news before irreparable damage is done,\" he said.</p><p>\"If we do not protect ourselves, hostile parties will find it a simple matter to turn different groups against one another and cause disorder in our society.\"</p><p>Lee did not mention the potential prison sentences or large fines for spreading \"fake news,\" or the concerns international media might have about operating in Singapore under the new law.</p><p>The prime minister's office and the Singapore Ministry of Law did not respond to requests for comment on this article.</p><p>K. Shanmugam, Singapore's law minister, said in a press briefing that the government would protect free speech and said takedown orders would be rare, according to the Wall Street Journal. \"I think the reality of falsehoods and hate speech and harmful content on the internet is a reality that is here to stay,\" he said. \"We have to deal with it as best as we can.\"</p><p/><p>'Far-reaching' legislation</p><p>While Lee and other government officials have defended the bill as necessary for protecting Singaporeans online, it has been met with massive resistance from tech, media and human rights groups.</p><p>In a statement, Jeff Paine, managing director of the Asia Internet Coalition -- whose members include Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and other major tech firms -- said the bill \"gives the Singapore government full discretion over what is considered true or false.\"</p><p>\"As the most far-reaching legislation of its kind to date, this level of overreach poses significant risks to freedom of expression and speech, and could have severe ramifications both in Singapore and around the world.\"</p><p>In a submission to Parliament, Singapore Press Holdings, the country's largest media organization, warned that a broad interpretation of \"fake news\" could could lead to \"fears among citizens about freely expressing their opinions or engaging in robust and constructive debates, or even to self-censorship by news outlets wary of falling foul of the law.\"</p><p>Kirsten Han, editor of the South East Asia-focused news site New Naratif, warned \"the (anti-fake news) bill is really broad, granting sweeping powers to the government with limited checks and balances.\"</p><p>\"It has the effect of allowing the government to be the arbiter of truth, if they want to,\" she wrote in a newsletter Monday.</p><p>The New Naratif says it has faced significant pressure from the Singapore government, which last year refused to allow it to register as a private company, due to funding it receives from overseas, which the government said would be contrary to national interests.</p><p>Speaking to CNN, Han said the government had wanted to pass such legislation for some time.</p><p>\"The problems that tech companies have had with fake news and hate speech have given them a good opportunity to justify the need for such laws,\" she said.</p><p>She predicted that the way the law is drafted could muzzle many ordinary Singaporeans even if their posts didn't technically contravene it.</p><p>\"(The bill) grants ministers so much discretion to demand corrections, takedowns and access to be blocked.\" Han said. Under the law, people are able to appeal the order, but Han expressed concern about ordinary people's ability to afford such legal cases.</p><p>\"How many Singaporeans will have the resources or desire to take the matter to court and get the (government's) direction overturned and a Facebook post/article/blog post reinstated?\"</p><p/><p>What censorship?</p><p>Singapore has long controlled both the media and online expression, despite the city's courting of international tech firms.</p><p>\"Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's government reacts quickly to criticism from journalists and does not hesitate to sue them, apply pressure to make them unemployable, or even force them to leave the country,\" media watchdog RSF said in a recent report on the country.</p><p>\"The Media Development Authority has the power to censor all forms of journalistic content. Defamation suits are common in the city-state and may sometimes be accompanied by a charge of sedition, which is punishable by up to 21 years in prison.\"</p><p>Last year, the ruling People's Action Party (PAP), described a report on press freedom in Singapore by Human Rights Watch as a \"type of deliberate falsehood\" and \"an example of how false and misleading impressions can be created by a selective presentation of facts, designed to promote an underlying agenda.\" That agenda, PAP said, was \"to change Singapore's society -- in the ways it desires.\"</p><p>The statements were made in a submission to the select committee which drafted the new anti-fake news bill. Under the new law, there's concern that future HRW reports deemed to be spreading \"deliberate falsehoods\" could see the group targeted, the perfect way for Singapore to defend against the group's claims that it enacts \"severe restrictions on free speech.\"</p><p>Phil Robertson, the HRW director, told CNN that if the bill passes into law in its current form, \"I expect that they will go after us.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20190401singapore-fake-news-intl1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT1-NK31-DY60-M375-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1559\"/><timeReceived>1:32 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 1, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Continue reading Singapore's fake news law should be a warning to American lawmakers</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The national flag flying on the roof of the Parliament House in Singapore | Photo credit should read ROSLAN RAHMAN/AFP via Getty Images</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Sunday evening, 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl sat down with YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki to voice a now-familiar critique: YouTube allows too many dangerous and disturbing videos to remain on the site. She brings up a distorted video of Rep. Nancy Pelosi that falsely describes her as drunk; altered copies of the Christchurch shooting video, quack science, and misleading political ads, among other questionable videos found on the site. It leads to the following exchange:</p><p>Lesley Stahl: The struggle for Wojcicki is policing the site, while keeping YouTube an open platform.</p><p>Susan Wojcicki: You can go too far and that can become censorship. And so we have been working really hard to figure out what's the right way to balance responsibility with freedom of speech.</p><p>Stahl: But the private sector is not legally beholden to the First Amendment.</p><p>As it so happens, some countries are trying to make tech platforms legally beholden to police speech according to national laws. One of them is Singapore, where in October a new law went into effect with the stated purpose of fighting  fake news.  James Griffith wrote about the law for CNN:</p><p>Under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill, it is now illegal to spread  false statements of fact  under circumstances in which that information is deemed  prejudicial  to Singapore's security, public safety,  public tranquility,  or to the  friendly relations of Singapore with other countries,  among numerous other topics.</p><p>Government ministers can decide whether to order something deemed fake news to be taken down, or for a correction to be put up alongside it. They can also order technology companies such as Facebook and Google   both of which opposed the bill during its fast-tracked process through parliament   to block accounts or sites spreading false information.</p><p>Those government ministers wasted little time in enforcing that law, taking action twice in the past week. And if you had to guess, what type of social media post would spur them into action the fastest? Would it be a post that spread hate speech or promoted violence? Would it be a post that spread harmful misinformation, such as a false election date intended to mislead voters? Or would it be a post that criticized the government?</p><p>If you guessed No. 3, then you've been paying attention to the arguments that every single critic of this law has made since it was first proposed. Here's Griffiths again, from Saturday:</p><p>One offending item was a Facebook post by an opposition politician that questioned the governance of the city-state's sovereign wealth funds and some of their investment decisions. The other post was published by an Australia-based blog that claimed police had arrested a  whistleblower  who  exposed  a political candidate's religious affiliations.</p><p>In both cases, Singapore officials ordered the accused to include the government's rebuttal at the top of their posts. The government announcements were accompanied by screenshots of the original posts with the word  FALSE  stamped in giant letters across them.</p><p>Now, credit where it's due: Facebook's response to this can only be described as hilariously bitchy. Here's Fathin Ungku and John Geddie in Reuters (emphasis mine):</p><p>Facebook said on Saturday it had issued a correction notice on a user's post at the request of the Singapore government, but called for a measured approach to the implementation of a new  fake news  law in the city-state.</p><p>Facebook is legally required to tell you that the Singapore government says this post has false information,  said the notice, which is visible only to Singapore users.</p><p>It's hard to think of a more dismissive way of phrasing that, short of maybe describing the Singapore government as a sniveling mosh pit of baby clowns. But that description would also presumably be in violation of the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill.</p><p>Last week, Sacha Baron Cohen made the case  although not in so many words   that the United States needs its own version of Singapore's law. Like Stahl, he questioned the value of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. And he suggested that tech platforms should be held liable for what their users post. He did so out of legitimate concern over the dangerous misinformation and hate speech that really does spread on these platforms   and out of frustration that they are currently not held accountable for any of it.</p><p>But the lesson of Singapore is that the fake-news law you want probably won't be used in the way that you want. In fact, it may be used in ways that you don't want at all!</p><p>Granted, just because one country implemented a law this way doesn't mean that Western democracies will. But if you think that they won't   why, exactly? In the United States, the First Amendment may offer some protections to average citizens who want to criticize their government online. Others won't be as lucky. And as the FOSTA-SESTA debacle showed, even the United States is not immune to terrible consequences from noble-sounding speech regulation.</p><p>As the debate over Section 230 rages on, that's something we ought to keep in mind.</p><p>Pushback</p><p>In our last edition, I wrote somewhat flippantly that  YouTube has had such a rough year that I struggled to come up with a major product or policy win.  YouTube wrote in to say, not unfairly, that is has indeed has some wins this year. Among them:</p><p>Just a few examples: our updated hate speech policy, which resulted in not just thousands of accounts coming down at launch, but 5x spikes in video removals and channel terminations; a reduction in our violative view rate by 80% over the past 18 months; changes to the way recommendations work resulting in a 50% drop in watchtime on borderline content in the US (and that # is about to go up); a suite of tools that is helping creators successfully diversify their revenue streams; and improvements to the way copyright claims work, solving a top pain point for creators.</p><p>One reason I think that some of these moves haven't resonated is that they feel so abstract. If YouTube has taken down five times as many videos this year, how much of the problem is solved? How much is left to go? It all still feels quite mysterious. Still, incremental progress is the actual way that most big tech problems get solved. So: point taken.</p><p>The Ratio</p><p>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.</p><p>Trending up: Facebook released a new tool that will allow users to transfer photos and videos from Facebook to other services, starting with Google Photos. It's the sort of charming, pro-competition move that seems to happen more frequently amid the looming threat of antitrust regulation!</p><p>Trending down: Google's limits on political ads have a loophole Trump could exploit. Although the company is pulling powerful targeting tools from political advertisers, they can still target display ads using tools from other companies.</p><p>Trending down: Leaked documents show TikTok may have hid videos of people with disabilities. Queer and fat users were also pushed out of view. The news is the latest content moderation debacle the video sharing platform is facing as it tries to expand around the world.</p><p>Governing</p><p>TikTok said it had made a mistake in suspending the account of 17-year-old Feroza Aziz, who had posted witty but incisive videos about politics. Aziz had her account suspended after posting a video accusing China of putting Muslims in concentration camps. Tony Romm and Drew Harwell from The Washington Postlay out the timeline. (Here's TikTok's apology.)</p><p>TikTok, however, said it had penalized her not for her comments about China, but rather for a video she had shared earlier   a short clip, posted to a different account, that included a photo of Osama bin Laden. Aziz's video violated the company's policies against terrorist content, TikTok said, so the company took action against her device, making any of her other accounts unavailable on that device. TikTok said her videos about China did not violate its rules, had not been removed and had been viewed more than a million times.</p><p>But the video in question   a copy of which she shared with The Post   actually was a comedic video about dating that the company had misinterpreted as terrorism, Aziz said.</p><p>By Wednesday evening, TikTok had reversed course: The company said it restored her ability to access her account on her personal device. TikTok also acknowledged that her video about China had been removed for 50 minutes on Wednesday morning, which it attributed to a  human moderation error. </p><p>A federal judge ruled Facebook doesn't have to pay damages to 29 million users whose personal information was stolen in a September 2018 data breach. Users can require the company to employ automated security monitoring and educate people better about hacking threats. It's not the big payday the plaintiffs were hoping for. (Jonathan Stempel / Reuters)</p><p>EU antitrust regulators are investigating Google's data collection practices. The company is now being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic for how it monetizes peoples' information. (Foo Yun Chee / Reuters)</p><p>Voting machines in Northampton County Pennsylvania glitched on election night, forcing officials to count paper ballots instead. The issue exposed flaws in both the election machine testing and procurement process, and offers us plenty of reason to worry in 2020. (Nick Corasaniti / The New York Times)</p><p>A new rule requiring people in China to scan their faces when signing up for new mobile plans went into effect yesterday. The rule has sparked widespread privacy concerns, as well as increased scrutiny of China's sophisticated surveillance tactics. (Annabelle Timsit / Quartz)</p><p>Chinese regulators also announced new rules governing video and audio content online, including a ban on fake news and deepfakes. Any use of AI or VR also needs to be clearly marked or it could be considered a criminal offense. (Reuters)</p><p>Chinese data mining firm MiningLamp is helping police solve crimes, track drug dealers, and prevent human trafficking. The company has been compared to Palantir, which helps law enforcement agencies in the US. (Sarah Dai and Li Tao / South China Morning Post)</p><p>Shopkeepers in India are protesting Amazon and Walmart. They say the companies engage in predatory pricing in violation of new rules meant to protect local businesses. (Ari Altstedter / Bloomberg)</p><p>Industry</p><p>Match Group, the company that owns most major online dating services, screens for sexual predators on Match   but not on Tinder, OkCupid or PlentyofFish. A spokesperson said there are  definitely  registered sex offenders using Match services, according to Hillary Flynn, Elizabeth Naismith Picciani and Keith Cousins from Columbia Journalism Investigations:</p><p>For nearly a decade, its flagship website, Match, has issued statements and signed agreements promising to protect users from sexual predators. The site has a policy of screening customers against government sex offender registries. But over this same period, as Match evolved into the publicly traded Match Group and bought its competitors, the company hasn't extended this practice across its platforms   including Plenty of Fish, its second most popular dating app. The lack of a uniform policy allows convicted and accused perpetrators to access Match Group apps and leaves users vulnerable to sexual assault, a 16-month investigation by Columbia Journalism Investigations found.</p><p>Match first agreed to screen for registered sex offenders in 2011 after Carole Markin made it her mission to improve its safety practices. The site had connected her with a six-time convicted rapist who, she told police, had raped her on their second date. Markin sued the company to push for regular registry checks. The Harvard-educated entertainment executive held a high-profile press conference to unveil her lawsuit. Within months, Match's lawyers told the judge that  a screening process has been initiated,  records show. After the settlement, the company's attorneys declared the site was  checking subscribers against state and national sex offender registries. </p><p>Mark Zuckerberg went on CBS This Morning, where he did not want to talk about what he talked about with President Trump the other day.</p><p>New on Instagram: messy bedrooms.  People aren't interested in seeing this perfectly curated grid. It's about giving yourself permission to be a little bit more human,  said one writer quoted in this article. (Julie Vadnal / Elle)</p><p>Rowan Winch is the 15-year-old behind the popular Instagram meme account @Zuccccccccccc. This charming profile shows how he, like many American teenagers, uses the internet for entrepreneurial gains. It also shows what happened when Facebook decided to crack down on meme accounts, depriving him of his biggest platform. (Taylor Lorenz / The New York Times)</p><p>Not everyone is excited about YouTube's new homepage layout, which the company rolled out a few weeks ago. The homepage used to be broken up into a number of different, easily digestible sections. Now, those sections are gone, replaced with an endless feed of recommended videos.

This year, we have about 40,000 participants - one-third more than last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">b) This year, we also hope that we've made your experience better - richer in content, and even higher in quality.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">c) We have also put greater focus on issues that will interest you more - ASEAN, Financial Inclusion, AI in finance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Encouraging Signs in Our Young FinTech Journey</p><p>2 FinTech is relatively new in Singapore, but we are on a promising journey, and the entire sector is bubbling with excitement in Singapore.</p><p>a) People coming together.</p><p>b) Ideas are hatched.</p><p>c) Companies are formed.</p><p>d) Jobs are created.</p><p>e) Solutions are found to solve real problems.</p><p>f) The entire FinTech Festival epitomises what is happening here.</p><p>3 Let me share the stories of three FinTech firms in Singapore:</p><p>a) M-DAQ - it is in the business of foreign exchange, helping enterprises pay and collect monies from their partners overseas, as well as manage FX risks</p><p>b) Silent Eight - it is using AI to fight financial crime and is working with several global financial institutions.</p><p>c) Thin Margin - it is changing the concept of money changing to give clients better rates and greater convenience</p><p>Let us take a look at what the founders have to say.</p><p>4 Wonderful, inspiring stories. Today I stand here facing quite tough competition. Because earlier this morning, PM Modi said Come to India. And just now, the central bank governor from Kenya said Come to Kenya. Now, I am telling you, Come to Singapore!.</p><p>5 These are three companies, out of many, that have decided to come to Singapore. Why did they decide to build on their dreams in Singapore? I think there are three main reasons, which is what I want to talk about today.</p><p>First, Singapore is a Great Place</p><p>6 Singapore is not a place just for Crazy Rich Asians. You don't have to be rich, you can lead a fairly comfortable and affordable life here. It is a city for everybody.</p><p>a) The best way to think about Singapore, is to think of us geographically. We are at the crossroads of the world - the Eastern-most fringe of the Indian Ocean, the Western-most fringe of the Pacific Ocean. This is where the sea lanes of communication converge. We are a node in this convergence. This shapes how we think and who we are.</p><p>b) Here in Singapore, it is safe and things works.</p><p>i. Whether it is transport, healthcare, public education. Everything works well. If it doesn't work, we will fix it.</p><p>ii. Rule of law and security are taken very seriously.</p><p>iii. So much so that President Donald Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un chose to meet here.</p><p>c) We have a diverse culture and you can see that in our food, art, entertainment and our people.</p><p>i. People from different religions, backgrounds and cultures truly respect each other. Every minority has its own space to practice their religion and culture. At the same time, people respect each other and the common space we have as Singaporeans.</p><p>ii. So much so that we decided in our early years of independence that we shall use English as our main mode of working communication.</p><p>d) We also understand this city is all we've got, so we have to cherish it</p><p>i. We are one of two rare cities where you find nature reserves in the middle of the city - the other is Rio de Janeiro. If you walk in our nature reserves, you will see more varieties of flora and fauna than the whole Europe combined.</p><p>ii. We reclaimed land to make part of the sea to become a reservoir - 1/6th the size of Singapore. Over time, salt water become fresh water.</p><p>iii. We turn our rubbish into dust by burning them and created an artificial island out of it, Pulau Semakau. Today, it is an island of greenery with flora and fauna.</p><p>7 Most importantly, this is a great place to start a business.</p><p>a) We are a node in Southeast Asia, a significant market- 650 million people, a rising middle class, fairly high mobile and Internet penetration, with a lot more headroom for growth. There is plenty of growth opportunities in the ASEAN market.</p><p>b) We are a great spring board to the region - there are 3,000 financial institutions and every major global bank operating in Singapore.</p><p>i. These FIs may be traditional players but they are also Fintech firms. They want to collaborate with fellow FinTech players and with start-ups, or be your customer.</p><p>ii. Take for example the three stories we just saw. Silent Eight and M-DAQ did well in Singapore because they first started working with traditional and established FIs.</p><p>iii. And there is also a supportive industry around FinTech- angel investors, venture capitalists, private equity, IT companies, management consultants and head-hunters. There is a whole ecosystem around FinTech.</p><p>c) Besides being a springboard to ASEAN, we are also a springboard to the world.</p><p>i. We have been busy forging free trade agreements for 20 years. This was before we had trade wars and uncertainties about the multilateral trading systems. We know that as a small country, we need trade to survive, and trade politics can be difficult.</p><p>ii. So Singapore makes sure that we have access to all our main markets. Today, we have FTAs within the ASEAN region and the bigger Asian region - China, Japan, India, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand. Further afield, the US, Canada, Mexico and soon, the EU once the FTA has been ratified.</p><p>iii. MAS has been developing connections through a network of 25 FinTech Co-operation Agreements with counterparts in UK, US, Japan and many of our ASEAN neighbours. Through these agreements, you can better enter these markets and navigate the regulatory landscape of these overseas markets.</p><p>d) Within this small space, we plan our city well. There will be space for you to set up here.</p><p>i. We have set aside 100,000 square feet in a FinTech Hub in the middle of the city on Robinson Road to ensure you have the physical space.</p><p>ii. Every University has incubator space and they will welcome you too.</p><p>Second, We Are Open to Ideas</p><p>8 Our whole existence as a city state boils down to that attitude: we are prepared to experiment, we are open to ideas, we try solutions that others may not have tried before.</p><p>a) This is how we built up our armed forces, ensure water sufficiency, control traffic congestion, forge racial harmony, provide public housing - we learn from others, build upon the lessons, and try new solutions. If it fails, we try again.</p><p>b) Experimentation is in our blood. This is why big tech companies are doing interesting things here.</p><p>i. Google is working on its Next Billion Users project in Singapore.</p><p>ii. Alibaba has many research centres in China. But when it decided to have its first research centre outside of China, they built two - one in Silicon Valley and the other in Singapore, with the Nanyang Technological University.</p><p>iii. Grab has its global innovation hub at the National University of Singapore.</p><p>iv. Mastercard is housing its largest innovation lab in the world in Singapore, to find the next digital payment breakthrough.</p><p>v. And still others - PayPal, Siemens, Dyson, HP and Amazon Prime - they are all building their research and innovation hubs here.</p><p>9 MAS is committed to support experimentation and innovation. Two examples of this at work:</p><p>a) One, MAS encouraging our FIs to use RegTech - using technology to help FIs overcome their regulatory pains</p><p>i. One of those pain points is submitting reports and providing data to the regulator.</p><p>ii. Last year, MAS announced that we will transform the way we collect data from FIs - data must be machine-readable, and in time, we want zero duplication of data requests.</p><p>iii. We are setting aside S$35 million to help smaller banks and insurers make use of RegTech. More details will be announced in the coming months.</p><p>b) Two, the longstanding regulatory philosophy of making good use of ex-post supervision vs ex-ante regulation. This means that when a new idea comes along, we want to say start first. After you start, we will observe and see how we can optimise the regulation.</p><p>i. One good example of this is the regulatory sandbox. This is where regulations are suspended, and allows firms to test their ideas with real customers in a fixed period of time.</p><p>ii. This is a learning experience for both the FinTech companies and MAS.</p><p>iii. Some people have said the Sandbox is too hard to get in. We will push this approach further. Today, we will launch a public consultation to seek industry's views on the creation of the Sandbox Express.</p><p>iv. It will make it easier to get into the Sandbox. 21 days - that will be our target.</p><p>v. This will be for activities where the risks are low or well understood. We can relax the system and allow tests and experiments to happen more quickly.</p><p>vi. Some think maybe that is still not good enough and prefer something more laissez faire - but we are not that kind of regime. We regulate to harmonise concerns in the urban environment. That's why whatever works in Singapore, it most likely can work in most other urban environments. If it works here, it has credibility all over the world.</p><p>10 A good example is our ePayment system.</p><p>a) It did not go the way of certain laissez faire regimes - where the system can grow so fast, it takes over the entire financial system and bypasses traditional financial services. Although it is convenient, it gives rise to prudential concerns. They are close loop systems that do not encourage inter-operability and overtime, stifles competition.</p><p>b) So when it comes to ePayment, we decided very consciously to take a bit more time but make sure ePayment is open architecture. So ePayment in Singapore is rather unique.</p><p>i. First, it works like any other ePayment in the world, where you can transfer funds using mobile phone number or ID number of the recipient.</p><p>ii. But what is different is the backend - it rides on a national inter-bank funds transfer infrastructure called FAST.</p><p>iii. Which is opened up for non-banks to participate.</p><p>iv. On the front end - we have a common QR code regardless of payment modes and wallets. It is the first of its kind globally.</p><p>v. So one ePayment system with one common backbone, one common QR.</p><p>vi. We want to get it right because payment is fundamental - we all use payments and we use it in every sector of the economy.</p><p>vii. By ensuring open architecture and interoperability, we encourage competition, and over time, promote innovation.</p><p>viii. Therefore, laissez faire does not equal innovation in our context.</p><p>Third, We Believe in Skills and Talent</p><p>11 To innovate, create new jobs, in an area like FinTech, we need a broad range of talent.</p><p>a) Because FinTech is neither all Fin or all Tech.</p><p>b) Not all Fin - AI for security in FIs can be applied in a variety of sectors. ePayment functions ride and serve many other services, from games to retail to social networking.</p><p>c) Not all Tech - Beyond techies, you need people who can market, raise funds, anthropologists, psychologists, artists, designers, HR experts.</p><p>d) We need a whole talent ecosystem.</p><p>12 That's why the most important support is our education system, because that's how we develop our talent.</p><p>a) Education cannot just be about rote learning and acing exams.</p><p>b) We need to nurture curiosity and joy of learning, because how else are you going to keep learning your whole life to keep up with advancement of knowledge and technology? You need to have that passion and hunger.</p><p>c) Fortunately, since 1997, we have been moving education to an inquiry-based approach. You are required to work in teams, be hands-on and solve real problems. This is more likely to trigger joy and curiosity in our children.</p><p>d) Recently, we removed 1 out of every 4 examinations to make time for more inquiry-based and more hands-on applied learning, to nurture the interest and joy of learning.</p><p>e) We don't believe in forcing all our young to learn coding, because there is a chance that by the time they enter the workforce, the language becomes outdated. Instead, we focus on teaching them the fundamentals - values, literary, numeracy.</p><p>f) So in maths, our focus is on problem solving that exercise our young in computational, analytical and logical thinking.</p><p>i. Here's an example of a typical math problem that 12- year old student in Singapore will solve.</p><p>ii. Edwin has $190 less than Mary. After Edwin spent $20, the amount he left was 5/12 of Mary's money. How much money did Mary have? The problem sounds difficult but all our children are taught how to visualise the problem, decompose it, solve it step-by-step.</p><p>g) This is an open-source curriculum and is adopted by many countries. They improve upon it and we, in turn, learn from them. That is an open architecture.</p><p>h) Our students have done well. They came in first in all four domains of international PISA tests in 2015 - for 15-year olds, number one in maths, science, reading and collaborative problem solving.</p><p>13 Higher education is transforming as well.</p><p>a) More than 90% of our students progress to post-secondary education - in vocational institute (ITE), polytechnics or universities.</p><p>b) In some universities, computational thinking, digital literacy and quantitative reasoning have become compulsory modules.</p><p>c) The entire curriculum is changing. More inter-disciplinary learning, fewer lectures, fewer tutorials, more projects, prototyping, internship, overseas exposures, community immersion, entrepreneurship stints. Education is now more of an experience.</p><p>d) Hackathons are getting popular.</p><p>i. 5 polytechnics launched an API Hackathon this year. 130 students developed FinTech prototypes, best of which are showcased at this Festival.</p><p>ii. Tomorrow, PM Modi and I will witness the unveiling of winners of the Singapore-India Hackathon.</p><p>14 Because of that we are seeing interesting FinTech start-ups spinning offs from Universities.</p><p>a) One example is Zilliqa - a spin-off from NUS. It is founded by NUS Computing researchers and is transforming the world of blockchain through 'sharding', a concept developed at the university. 'Sharding' divides a blockchain network into shards that can process transactions at the same time, that way they can enhancing scalability and energy efficiency of cryptocurrency mining. They surpassed a US$1 billion market cap in May 2018.</p><p>b) Another company is Funding Societies - co-founded in 2015 by NUS alumnus Kelvin Teo. Today, it is the leading peer-to-peer financing platform in Southeast Asia. The company has crowdfunded more than S$285 million in loans. In 2018, the company was listed on KPMG's Fintech100 list.</p><p>15 Our young will no doubt be prepared well. But we are also upgrading all our adult workers, through a nation-wide movement called SkillsFuture.</p><p>a) Our universities are transforming themselves - not just education institutes for the young, but for everyone. They are transforming themselves into institutes of lifelong learning. NUS now enrols students not just for four years for a degree but for 20 years. Graduates are welcomed to come back and learn new skills.</p><p>b) Total training hours for adults have increased drastically- from 26.7 million in 2013 to 41.1 million in 2017.</p><p>c) A large part of increase is driven by tech training, including data analytics, cybersecurity, agile software development and more.</p><p>d) We are even going to the community, teaching IT illiterate citizens how to use digital tools.</p><p>e) This will not make them tech experts, but they can become smart users.</p><p>f) We are retooling an entire working population to support our economic transformation.</p><p>16 A final point on talent and skills - for a small country and small population, we will not have enough expertise in many areas of specialisations.</p><p>a) Hence we believe in complementing local with foreign expertise - grow our own timber, but also welcome experts from around the world.</p><p>b) And if there is a capability we do not possess, we welcome international experts to teach in our Polytechnics and Universities.</p><p>c) That way, we can better grow businesses, open up more opportunities and create jobs in Singapore.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>17 In summary, three answers to the question 'Why Singapore?'</p><p>a) Singapore is a great place.</p><p>b) We keep an open mind to ideas.</p><p>c) We believe in skills and talent.</p><p>18 These makes us a living lab. This is where you get things to work in a complex, sophisticated, well-regulated but business-friendly environment. If it works here, it can work elsewhere in the world.</p><p>19 I hope I have convinced you. If you are still not convinced - it's okay. I hope you enjoy your stay in Singapore. Take a look at our airport, try out SIA and eat some durians.</p><p>20 Have a good afternoon. Thank you.</p><p>(Government of Singapore)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TR7-WTX1-JB5P-J01B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2756\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000194</classCode><className>BOARDS OF DIRECTORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DIYD</classCode><className>ASEAN COUNTRIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009HPF</classCode><className>EDUCATION SYSTEMS &amp;

This year, we have about 40,000 participants - one-third more than last year. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">b) This year, we also hope that we've made your experience better - richer in content, and even higher in quality. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">c) We have also put greater focus on issues that will interest you more - ASEAN, Financial Inclusion, AI in finance. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Encouraging Signs in Our Young FinTech Journey </p><p>2 FinTech is relatively new in Singapore, but we are on a promising journey, and the entire sector is bubbling with excitement in Singapore. </p><p>a) People coming together. </p><p>b) Ideas are hatched. </p><p>c) Companies are formed. </p><p>d) Jobs are created. </p><p>e) Solutions are found to solve real problems. </p><p>f) The entire FinTech Festival epitomises what is happening here. </p><p>3 Let me share the stories of three FinTech firms in Singapore: </p><p>a) M-DAQ - it is in the business of foreign exchange, helping enterprises pay and collect monies from their partners overseas, as well as manage FX risks </p><p>b) Silent Eight - it is using AI to fight financial crime and is working with several global financial institutions. </p><p>c) Thin Margin - it is changing the concept of money changing to give clients better rates and greater convenience </p><p>Let us take a look at what the founders have to say. </p><p>4 Wonderful, inspiring stories. Today I stand here facing quite tough competition. Because earlier this morning, PM Modi said Come to India. And just now, the central bank governor from Kenya said Come to Kenya. Now, I am telling you, Come to Singapore!. </p><p>5 These are three companies, out of many, that have decided to come to Singapore. Why did they decide to build on their dreams in Singapore? I think there are three main reasons, which is what I want to talk about today. </p><p>First, Singapore is a Great Place </p><p>6 Singapore is not a place just for Crazy Rich Asians. You don't have to be rich, you can lead a fairly comfortable and affordable life here. It is a city for everybody. </p><p>a) The best way to think about Singapore, is to think of us geographically. We are at the crossroads of the world - the Eastern-most fringe of the Indian Ocean, the Western-most fringe of the Pacific Ocean. This is where the sea lanes of communication converge. We are a node in this convergence. This shapes how we think and who we are. </p><p>b) Here in Singapore, it is safe and things works. </p><p>i. Whether it is transport, healthcare, public education. Everything works well. If it doesn't work, we will fix it. </p><p>ii. Rule of law and security are taken very seriously. </p><p>iii. So much so that President Donald Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un chose to meet here. </p><p>c) We have a diverse culture and you can see that in our food, art, entertainment and our people. </p><p>i. People from different religions, backgrounds and cultures truly respect each other. Every minority has its own space to practice their religion and culture. At the same time, people respect each other and the common space we have as Singaporeans. </p><p>ii. So much so that we decided in our early years of independence that we shall use English as our main mode of working communication. </p><p>d) We also understand this city is all we've got, so we have to cherish it </p><p>i. We are one of two rare cities where you find nature reserves in the middle of the city - the other is Rio de Janeiro. If you walk in our nature reserves, you will see more varieties of flora and fauna than the whole Europe combined. </p><p>ii. We reclaimed land to make part of the sea to become a reservoir - 1/6th the size of Singapore. Over time, salt water become fresh water. </p><p>iii. We turn our rubbish into dust by burning them and created an artificial island out of it, Pulau Semakau. Today, it is an island of greenery with flora and fauna. </p><p>7 Most importantly, this is a great place to start a business. </p><p>a) We are a node in Southeast Asia, a significant market- 650 million people, a rising middle class, fairly high mobile and Internet penetration, with a lot more headroom for growth. There is plenty of growth opportunities in the ASEAN market. </p><p>b) We are a great spring board to the region - there are 3,000 financial institutions and every major global bank operating in Singapore. </p><p>i. These FIs may be traditional players but they are also Fintech firms. They want to collaborate with fellow FinTech players and with start-ups, or be your customer. </p><p>ii. Take for example the three stories we just saw. Silent Eight and M-DAQ did well in Singapore because they first started working with traditional and established FIs. </p><p>iii. And there is also a supportive industry around FinTech- angel investors, venture capitalists, private equity, IT companies, management consultants and head-hunters. There is a whole ecosystem around FinTech. </p><p>c) Besides being a springboard to ASEAN, we are also a springboard to the world. </p><p>i. We have been busy forging free trade agreements for 20 years. This was before we had trade wars and uncertainties about the multilateral trading systems. We know that as a small country, we need trade to survive, and trade politics can be difficult. </p><p>ii. So Singapore makes sure that we have access to all our main markets. Today, we have FTAs within the ASEAN region and the bigger Asian region - China, Japan, India, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand. Further afield, the US, Canada, Mexico and soon, the EU once the FTA has been ratified. </p><p>iii. MAS has been developing connections through a network of 25 FinTech Co-operation Agreements with counterparts in UK, US, Japan and many of our ASEAN neighbours. Through these agreements, you can better enter these markets and navigate the regulatory landscape of these overseas markets. </p><p>d) Within this small space, we plan our city well. There will be space for you to set up here. </p><p>i. We have set aside 100,000 square feet in a FinTech Hub in the middle of the city on Robinson Road to ensure you have the physical space. </p><p>ii. Every University has incubator space and they will welcome you too. </p><p>Second, We Are Open to Ideas</p><p>8 Our whole existence as a city state boils down to that attitude: we are prepared to experiment, we are open to ideas, we try solutions that others may not have tried before. </p><p>a) This is how we built up our armed forces, ensure water sufficiency, control traffic congestion, forge racial harmony, provide public housing - we learn from others, build upon the lessons, and try new solutions. If it fails, we try again. </p><p>b) Experimentation is in our blood. This is why big tech companies are doing interesting things here. </p><p>i. Google is working on its Next Billion Users project in Singapore. </p><p>ii. Alibaba has many research centres in China. But when it decided to have its first research centre outside of China, they built two - one in Silicon Valley and the other in Singapore, with the Nanyang Technological University. </p><p>iii. Grab has its global innovation hub at the National University of Singapore. </p><p>iv. Mastercard is housing its largest innovation lab in the world in Singapore, to find the next digital payment breakthrough. </p><p>v. And still others - PayPal, Siemens, Dyson, HP and Amazon Prime - they are all building their research and innovation hubs here. </p><p>9 MAS is committed to support experimentation and innovation. Two examples of this at work: </p><p>a) One, MAS encouraging our FIs to use RegTech - using technology to help FIs overcome their regulatory pains </p><p>i. One of those pain points is submitting reports and providing data to the regulator. </p><p>ii. Last year, MAS announced that we will transform the way we collect data from FIs - data must be machine-readable, and in time, we want zero duplication of data requests. </p><p>iii. We are setting aside S$35 million to help smaller banks and insurers make use of RegTech. More details will be announced in the coming months. </p><p>b) Two, the longstanding regulatory philosophy of making good use of ex-post supervision vs ex-ante regulation. This means that when a new idea comes along, we want to say start first. After you start, we will observe and see how we can optimise the regulation. </p><p>i. One good example of this is the regulatory sandbox. This is where regulations are suspended, and allows firms to test their ideas with real customers in a fixed period of time. </p><p>ii. This is a learning experience for both the FinTech companies and MAS. </p><p>iii. Some people have said the Sandbox is too hard to get in. We will push this approach further. Today, we will launch a public consultation to seek industry's views on the creation of the Sandbox Express. </p><p>iv. It will make it easier to get into the Sandbox. 21 days - that will be our target. </p><p>v. This will be for activities where the risks are low or well understood. We can relax the system and allow tests and experiments to happen more quickly. </p><p>vi. Some think maybe that is still not good enough and prefer something more laissez faire - but we are not that kind of regime. We regulate to harmonise concerns in the urban environment. That's why whatever works in Singapore, it most likely can work in most other urban environments. If it works here, it has credibility all over the world. </p><p>10 A good example is our ePayment system. </p><p>a) It did not go the way of certain laissez faire regimes - where the system can grow so fast, it takes over the entire financial system and bypasses traditional financial services. Although it is convenient, it gives rise to prudential concerns. They are close loop systems that do not encourage inter-operability and overtime, stifles competition. </p><p>b) So when it comes to ePayment, we decided very consciously to take a bit more time but make sure ePayment is open architecture. So ePayment in Singapore is rather unique. </p><p>i. First, it works like any other ePayment in the world, where you can transfer funds using mobile phone number or ID number of the recipient. </p><p>ii. But what is different is the backend - it rides on a national inter-bank funds transfer infrastructure called FAST. </p><p>iii. Which is opened up for non-banks to participate. </p><p>iv. On the front end - we have a common QR code regardless of payment modes and wallets. It is the first of its kind globally. </p><p>v. So one ePayment system with one common backbone, one common QR. </p><p>vi. We want to get it right because payment is fundamental - we all use payments and we use it in every sector of the economy. </p><p>vii. By ensuring open architecture and interoperability, we encourage competition, and over time, promote innovation. </p><p>viii. Therefore, laissez faire does not equal innovation in our context. </p><p>Third, We Believe in Skills and Talent </p><p>11 To innovate, create new jobs, in an area like FinTech, we need a broad range of talent. </p><p>a) Because FinTech is neither all Fin or all Tech. </p><p>b) Not all Fin - AI for security in FIs can be applied in a variety of sectors. ePayment functions ride and serve many other services, from games to retail to social networking. </p><p>c) Not all Tech - Beyond techies, you need people who can market, raise funds, anthropologists, psychologists, artists, designers, HR experts. </p><p>d) We need a whole talent ecosystem. </p><p>12 That's why the most important support is our education system, because that's how we develop our talent. </p><p>a) Education cannot just be about rote learning and acing exams. </p><p>b) We need to nurture curiosity and joy of learning, because how else are you going to keep learning your whole life to keep up with advancement of knowledge and technology? You need to have that passion and hunger. </p><p>c) Fortunately, since 1997, we have been moving education to an inquiry-based approach. You are required to work in teams, be hands-on and solve real problems. This is more likely to trigger joy and curiosity in our children. </p><p>d) Recently, we removed 1 out of every 4 examinations to make time for more inquiry-based and more hands-on applied learning, to nurture the interest and joy of learning. </p><p>e) We don't believe in forcing all our young to learn coding, because there is a chance that by the time they enter the workforce, the language becomes outdated. Instead, we focus on teaching them the fundamentals - values, literary, numeracy. </p><p>f) So in maths, our focus is on problem solving that exercise our young in computational, analytical and logical thinking. </p><p>i. Here's an example of a typical math problem that 12- year old student in Singapore will solve. </p><p>ii. Edwin has $190 less than Mary. After Edwin spent $20, the amount he left was 5/12 of Mary's money. How much money did Mary have? The problem sounds difficult but all our children are taught how to visualise the problem, decompose it, solve it step-by-step. </p><p>g) This is an open-source curriculum and is adopted by many countries. They improve upon it and we, in turn, learn from them. That is an open architecture. </p><p>h) Our students have done well. They came in first in all four domains of international PISA tests in 2015 - for 15-year olds, number one in maths, science, reading and collaborative problem solving. </p><p>13 Higher education is transforming as well. </p><p>a) More than 90% of our students progress to post-secondary education - in vocational institute (ITE), polytechnics or universities. </p><p>b) In some universities, computational thinking, digital literacy and quantitative reasoning have become compulsory modules. </p><p>c) The entire curriculum is changing. More inter-disciplinary learning, fewer lectures, fewer tutorials, more projects, prototyping, internship, overseas exposures, community immersion, entrepreneurship stints. Education is now more of an experience. </p><p>d) Hackathons are getting popular. </p><p>i. 5 polytechnics launched an API Hackathon this year. 130 students developed FinTech prototypes, best of which are showcased at this Festival. </p><p>ii. Tomorrow, PM Modi and I will witness the unveiling of winners of the Singapore-India Hackathon. </p><p>14 Because of that we are seeing interesting FinTech start-ups spinning offs from Universities. </p><p>a) One example is Zilliqa - a spin-off from NUS. It is founded by NUS Computing researchers and is transforming the world of blockchain through 'sharding', a concept developed at the university. 'Sharding' divides a blockchain network into shards that can process transactions at the same time, that way they can enhancing scalability and energy efficiency of cryptocurrency mining. They surpassed a US$1 billion market cap in May 2018. </p><p>b) Another company is Funding Societies - co-founded in 2015 by NUS alumnus Kelvin Teo. Today, it is the leading peer-to-peer financing platform in Southeast Asia. The company has crowdfunded more than S$285 million in loans. In 2018, the company was listed on KPMG's Fintech100 list. </p><p>15 Our young will no doubt be prepared well. But we are also upgrading all our adult workers, through a nation-wide movement called SkillsFuture. </p><p>a) Our universities are transforming themselves - not just education institutes for the young, but for everyone. They are transforming themselves into institutes of lifelong learning. NUS now enrols students not just for four years for a degree but for 20 years. Graduates are welcomed to come back and learn new skills. </p><p>b) Total training hours for adults have increased drastically- from 26.7 million in 2013 to 41.1 million in 2017. </p><p>c) A large part of increase is driven by tech training, including data analytics, cybersecurity, agile software development and more. </p><p>d) We are even going to the community, teaching IT illiterate citizens how to use digital tools. </p><p>e) This will not make them tech experts, but they can become smart users. </p><p>f) We are retooling an entire working population to support our economic transformation. </p><p>16 A final point on talent and skills - for a small country and small population, we will not have enough expertise in many areas of specialisations. </p><p>a) Hence we believe in complementing local with foreign expertise - grow our own timber, but also welcome experts from around the world. </p><p>b) And if there is a capability we do not possess, we welcome international experts to teach in our Polytechnics and Universities. </p><p>c) That way, we can better grow businesses, open up more opportunities and create jobs in Singapore. </p><p>Conclusion </p><p>17 In summary, three answers to the question 'Why Singapore?' </p><p>a) Singapore is a great place. </p><p>b) We keep an open mind to ideas. </p><p>c) We believe in skills and talent. </p><p>18 These makes us a living lab. This is where you get things to work in a complex, sophisticated, well-regulated but business-friendly environment. If it works here, it can work elsewhere in the world. </p><p>19 I hope I have convinced you. If you are still not convinced - it's okay. I hope you enjoy your stay in Singapore. Take a look at our airport, try out SIA and eat some durians. </p><p>20 Have a good afternoon. Thank you. </p><p>(Government of Singapore)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2132752919</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCV-XCN1-JBHT-D39V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2778\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Thai News Service Group Nov 15, 2018</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Speech/Lecture</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Association of Southeast Asian Nations--ASEAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Southeast Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kenya</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Singapore</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Japan</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Financial institutions</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>International finance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Blockchain</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Angel investors</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Employment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Education</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Startups</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Festivals</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 928120</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIYD</classCode><className>ASEAN COUNTRIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN32</classCode><className>BLOCKCHAIN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009HPF</classCode><className>EDUCATION SYSTEMS &amp;

And if we are to spread the benefits of growth, innovation must be pervasive and not the exclusive preserve of the talented or well-endowed. Innovation is not a zero-sum game. It thrives on diversity, collaboration, and openness.</p><p>There is much we can learn from each other. France and Singapore have been deepening collaboration in areas such as finance, science, and technology. 2018 was designated as the France-Singapore Year of Innovation. Today, I want to focus on innovation in financial services. Globally, the financial industry is facing slower economic growth, tighter regulation, and keener competition.</p><p>To overcome these headwinds and contribute to the broader economy, the industry needs to harness technology, foster innovation, and transform itself. But how to do this, while maintaining the single most important commodity that underpins financial institutions - trust. As Stephen Covey said: Strength lies in differences, not in similarities. This principle is embodied in the French novel The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas.</p><p>Set in the 17th century, the novel recounts the journey of D'Artagnan, who left for Paris to join the Musketeers of the Guard, and how he overcomes all adversities. Together with him are three musketeers with contrasting personalities: - Athos who is intelligent;</p><p>- Porthos who is adventurous; and</p><p>- Aramis who is true and faithful.</p><p>But together they form a well-balanced trio that supports D'Artagnan on his journey. The three musketeers today are Finance, Technology, and Trust, corresponding to Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Society is D'Artagnan.</p><p>Can the three modern musketeers work together to support Society? Can they complement one another? Can they click? Finance - the Astute Musketeer Losing Appeal</p><p>Let me introduce the first musketeer - Finance.</p><p>Like Athos, Finance is wise but can be complicated, and to some extent, mysterious and non-accessible to many people. As a result, Finance - at least in its traditional form - is losing its appeal.</p><p>Consumers find that banks' processes are too cumbersome to navigate. They are increasingly looking to technology firms for their needs. Some of them are even losing trust in the ability of banks to act in their interest. Bill Gates once said: People need banking, not banks. It is a reminder that, to survive, Finance needs to be intuitive, innovative and customer-centric.</p><p>Technology - the Musketeer who can Transform Finance</p><p>This is where the second musketeer - Technology - comes in.</p><p>Technology is akin to Porthos, the fearless musketeer who is eager to try new ways for a better future. In a similar vein, Technology presents us opportunities to revitalise Finance:</p><p>the opportunity to enhance customer experience; the opportunity to strengthen risk management; and the opportunity to improve cost efficiency. Let me elaborate on each of these opportunities.</p><p>First, enhancing customer experience. This has become a critical success factor in many industries, including finance. Why?</p><p>Basically, technology firms have reshaped the way businesses interact with customers.</p><p>They have empowered customers and set higher bars for customer satisfaction. Whether they are established Big Tech firms or small FinTech start-ups, they pose a competitive challenge to financial institutions. If I have to name one thing these technology firms do very well, much better than financial institutions, it would be that they are obsessively customer-centric. 3</p><p>Tech firms embed themselves in the customer journey and use data analytics to deeply understand customer needs.</p><p>They then provide end-to-end solutions, often customised to individual circumstances. They have agile IT systems, efficient processes, and a culture that emphasises speed. Essentially, tech firms think of themselves not as being in a particular industry, but as platforms, upon which they provide access to the services their customers need. Traditional banks tend to be largely product-centric.</p><p>The credit card division tries to sell you unsecured credit, the wealth management division tries to sell you mutual funds, the lending division tries to sell you a mortgage. They start with the product and try to persuade the customer why their product is good for him. Many banks do not have a complete picture of their customers. They are weighed down by legacy IT systems and bureaucratic processes. But several banks are stepping up to the challenge. Athos is learning from Porthos.</p><p>Banks are investing heavily in technology to optimise their operations and enhance their systems. They are collaborating with technology firms to accelerate the pace of innovation. They are becoming more customer-centric. These banks are using technology to provide customised solutions, complete solutions, and seamless solutions.</p><p>First, customised solutions to suit the individual needs and characteristics of the customer.</p><p>Some banks are experimenting with personalised products and services, not just based on what the customer asks for but by anticipating what the customer might need.</p><p>Commonwealth Bank of Australia's mobile app is using behavioural science to provide customers with financial management advice based on their spending patterns and financial goals. Some banks are offering personalised interactions at every customer touchpoint.</p><p>Royal Bank of Canada has enabled its customers to pay their bills on the mobile app via speech and voice recognition. Second, complete solutions that are based on the total picture of the customer.</p><p>Today's customers are more sophisticated and want holistic solutions.</p><p>In a survey of 10,000 tech-savvy customers, Accenture found that 80% of them want integrated solutions that address both their financial and non-financial needs. Financial needs are really driven by non-financial desires. People do not desire a housing loan or a fire insurance policy. People desire a house. To provide complete, holistic solutions, you need comprehensive customer data and you need a deep understanding of the customer journey.</p><p>The customer data that most banks have are simply not sufficient to develop a good understanding of the financial situation or needs of their customers.</p><p>Customers have multiple relationships, with deposits and loans, investments, insurance policies, and retirement plans, spread across many financial institutions. How many financial institutions advising a customer have a complete picture of the customer's balance sheet - all his assets and liabilities? Some banks have started to offer aggregator services which consolidate financial information such as bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and investments from all the financial institutions serving their customers.</p><p>This allows financial institutions to provide holistic financial planning. BBVA provides its corporate customers with a consolidated view of all their financial information from about 90 financial institutions. Next, understanding the customer journey.</p><p>Some banks have begun to offer their corporate customers complete, end-to-end solutions, based on a keen understanding of their customers' work processes.</p><p>United Overseas Bank in Singapore provides its corporate customers an integrated digital platform that enables the customer to: - generate purchase orders and invoices with a few clicks;</p><p>- streamline its payroll process; and</p><p>- get up-to-date views of its financials.</p><p>Some banks are positioning themselves as partners with their customers on their life journey, integrating their financial and non-financial needs.</p><p>DBS Bank in Singapore provides its customers looking to buy a car an online portal that enables them to calculate their budget, find an affordable car, connect with the seller, get a car loan, and finally purchase a car insurance. Third, banks are using technology to provide seamless solutions. This means resolving bottlenecks and providing customers with a frictionless experience.</p><p>This means using technology to resolve bottlenecks in processes to provide customers with a frictionless experience.</p><p>Banks such as BBVA, Mitsubishi UFJ, and BNP Paribas are using blockchain technology for syndicated loans. It improves efficiency. - Each step of the loan process, from credit underwriting to credit administration, is documented in the distributed ledger, thereby eliminating the need for duplicative back office processing.</p><p>- The loan process is shortened from about two weeks to two days.</p><p>It also improves trust. - Every record in the distributed ledger has a user code and time stamp.</p><p>- This creates an audit trail, leading to higher level of trust among the participants.</p><p>Let me share two initiatives from the Singapore financial sector, which show that achieving a seamless customer experience often requires collaboration across institutions and inter-operability across systems.</p><p>The two key ingredients for a digital transaction are identity authentication and secure payments. The Singapore government worked closely with the industry to make the customer experience seamless in these two areas.</p><p>First, seamless identity authentication through MyInfo.</p><p>MyInfo is a government digital service that enables Singapore residents to authorise third-parties to access their personal data residing across different government agencies through APIs. This means that, with the consent of the customer, banks can use the MyInfo service for more efficient KYC using government-verified personal data. I can now open a bank account or obtain a credit card - online and instantly - when I give consent to my bank to access my data through MyInfo.</p><p>Customers do not need to go through the tedious process of filling up forms and providing hardcopy documents to banks for verification. And they certainly don't need to go to the bank branch. Banks benefit from higher productivity and better risk management. Second, secure and seamless payments through PayNow.</p><p>PayNow was jointly developed by MAS and the banking industry. It enables individuals and businesses to transfer funds using just the personal ID number or mobile phone number or unique entity number of their recipients. It operates 24-by-7 and funds can be transferred directly from one bank account to another in real-time. I can now send money to my friend in just three clicks on my smart phone - all I need to know is his mobile number. Business users of PayNow can generate a QR code containing their unique entity number.</p><p>This means I can now pay my utilities provider, telephone company, or plumber by simply scanning their QR code using my smart phone and keying in the amount to be transferred. Let me now move on to the second way in which Technology can benefit Finance - strengthening risk management.</p><p>Risk management and compliance have become major cost drivers in financial institutions since the global financial crisis.</p><p>Processes have become slower and more cumbersome. The answer does not lie in lowering regulatory requirements or risk management standards. We know from 2008 what that can lead to. Instead, financial institutions should harness technology to make risk management and compliance more efficient and effective. Technology can improve the efficiency of risk management.</p><p>JP Morgan is using machine learning to review loan contracts. This reduces the review time from 360,000 man-hours to seconds. It also minimises human errors. OCBC Bank in Singapore is using machine learning to monitor customer transactions real-time and across multiple channels. This allows the bank to identify fraudulent fund transfers and take more timely actions to recover the funds. Technology can make risk management less passive and more predictive by harnessing the informational value of data.</p><p>Ping An Insurance has developed a system that detects whether a banking customer is lying about the reason for borrowing money. - It is based on subtle changes in customers' facial expressions, with the analytical algorithm based on 30,000 videos of real lending cases.</p><p>- According to Ping An, this has helped to reduce credit losses by 60%.</p><p>Blackrock and Rhodium are using data analytics to assess the risks of climate change to assets such as mortgage backed securities under different scenarios. We have not tapped on the full potential of new technologies.</p><p>Research by IBM has found that quantum computing algorithms can compute the risk of an investment portfolio near real-time. This is a significant reduction from the present Monte Carlo simulation approach which can take days. The third big opportunity that Technology offers Finance is improving cost-efficiency.</p><p>This is particularly relevant for banks - saddled with the high costs of maintaining extensive branch networks and deterred from entering new markets or reaching underserved segments of the population because the cost of setting up branches is too high.</p><p>Technology is changing this in two ways. 7</p><p>First, the use of digital platforms to quickly and cheaply acquire customers.</p><p>The ubiquity of the Internet combined with the proliferation of the smart phone has helped to slash the cost of acquiring a customer. According to research by Oliver Wyman, it costs about $30 to acquire an online banking customer compared to $150 using offline channels. Basically, the smart phone is replacing the bank branch. Non-bank players have led the way in digital banking.</p><p>In the UK, we have seen a proliferation of so-called neo-banks - basically non-bank start-ups who have obtained licenses to do banking business without physical branches.</p><p>Starling has opened 520,000 personal accounts since getting a banking license in 2016. Monzo has opened 1.6 million accounts, adding 30,000 each week. - Monzo's customers can connect their accounts to 600 different apps and services, and create rules to integrate banking into their daily lives.</p><p>- For example, users can create a rule that automatically logs calories to the health app on their mobile phone whenever they purchase coffee.</p><p>But banks can also play the same game, and more of them are doing it.</p><p>DBS Bank from Singapore launched a digi-bank in India two years ago and has already garnered 2.5 million customers.</p><p>Digibank is using artificial intelligence to learn customers' spending habits and will prompt them if they are overspending, or provide relevant marketing offers such as coffee vouchers for a caffeine-lover. Maybe we should combine the DBS Bank app and the Monzo app to achieve a more balanced intake of coffee! United Overseas Bank from Singapore has just launched in Thailand a digital-only bank TMRW (pronounced tomorrow) aimed at millennials.</p><p>It comes complete with an engagement lab using behavioural insights to study customer's banking habits and needs. TMRW's mobile app features a game designed to encourage their customers to save more. In Hong Kong, the regulator has given out licenses to 8 virtual banks to acquire and deliver banking services through the Internet.</p><p>The take-up numbers are interesting; they indicate the competition emerging in the space of digital banking. Out of the 8 virtual banks, 5 are non-banks but 3 are backed by banks. But the second and potentially more powerful way in which technology is helping to drive down the cost of financial intermediation is through partnerships between financial institutions and FinTech firms.</p><p>Soc-G\\xE9n is working with TagPay to provide mobile banking in Africa through a cloud-based platform that is compatible with any mobile phone. AXA is working with MicroEnsure to offer simple and affordable insurance products to customers across Asia and Africa. By helping to reduce customer acquisition costs, these collaborations have helped to serve a larger social purpose - enhancing financial inclusion and expanding opportunity. But there is a lot more we need to do.</p><p>There are about 1.7 billion adults globally who are unbanked. In the ten ASEAN countries of Southeast Asia, half the adult population is unbanked. This is a shame. The ASEAN countries have a burgeoning middle class and increasingly modern infrastructure, yet so many do not have access to a bank account, secure and affordable payments, or insurance protection. Banks and insurers face high costs in reaching out to customers in remote areas. We need to take collaboration between financial institutions and FinTech firms to a much broader level - through platforms for innovation and inclusion.</p><p>This is why the MAS, the ASEAN Bankers Association, and the World Bank's International Finance Corporation have teamed up to establish the ASEAN Financial Innovation Network, or AFIN in short.</p><p>AFIN aims to bring banks and FinTech firms from across the world to develop innovative solutions to penetrate hard-to-reach markets in a cost efficient way.</p><p>Last year, AFIN launched the API eXchange - the world's first cross-border, open architecture platform to enhance financial inclusion. The API eXchange is a cloud-based platform that does two things: - It is a marketplace, enabling financial institutions to discover and connect with FinTech partners through APIs on a globally curated platform.</p><p>- It also provides a sandbox environment for financial institutions and FinTech firms to design and test cross-border solutions.</p><p>I have spoken so far of how the two musketeers - Finance and Technology - can and must come together to bring value and convenience to customers. But for consumers to be part of this ecosystem, there needs to be Trust - the third musketeer.</p><p>Trust - the Musketeer who Binds Consumers to Finance</p><p>Trust is similar to Aramis, the third musketeer who is faithful and values friendship.</p><p>Trust is a key attribute for the success of a financial ecosystem. 9</p><p>It is a shared responsibility among all the actors in the ecosystem. Banks in particular must be trustworthy so that customers have faith that their money and data are safe with them. As Finance adopts more Technology, it must pay close attention to three risks, so as to maintain the Trust of consumers.</p><p>First, cyber risk.</p><p>As more financial services move online and collaboration among banks and technology companies becomes more pervasive, a growing risk that financial institutions are facing is in cyber space.</p><p>The frequency, scale, and complexity of cyber-attacks are mounting. Attackers can carry out sophisticated and prolonged attacks that can be difficult to identify and defend against. According to a study by FireEye, the median time it takes to detect a cyber intrusion is 78 days. We need some common risk management standards in cyber defence.</p><p>The risk management systems in financial institutions and regulatory and supervisory frameworks for cyber resilience are uneven and still evolving. There is no international equivalent of the Basel Capital Accord in cyber risk management. But given the clear and present danger that cyber risk poses, MAS has put in place a mix of mandatory requirements and best practice guidelines in this area. Given their role as repositories of public monies and conduits for payments, banks in particular must meet higher cyber security standards. MAS expects banks to:</p><p>limit unscheduled system downtime of their critical IT systems to not more than 4 hours within a year; conduct due diligence on third-party service providers' controls to safeguard customer information; and report all significant cyber incidents to MAS within one hour. But cyber risk management should go beyond banks.</p><p>The connectedness among participants in the financial system means that a cyber-attack on one party can potentially escalate into a more systemic problem. We need to level up the cyber resilience of all financial institutions, not necessarily to the level of banks but at least to a basic level - what we call cyber hygiene. Research has shown that the majority of cyber incidents can be avoided if some simple cyber hygiene practices are adopted. MAS will soon issue a set of mandatory requirements on cyber hygiene that will apply to all financial institutions in Singapore. They include basic things like: 10</p><p>securing administrative accounts; controlling network access at the perimeter; installing security patches promptly; installing anti-virus software on their systems; and implementing multi-factor authentication for users who access confidential information over the Internet. In short, if we don't get cyber security right, financial institutions will be constrained in how much they can leverage on technology.</p><p>The second area financial institutions must address to ensure customer confidence is information security risk.</p><p>Information security is not the same as cyber security.</p><p>Information security is focused on protecting data, while cyber security is focused on protecting systems. They are however closely related. Data leaks can occur when a system is not properly secured. In the financial ecosystem, information security risk is growing for two key reasons:</p><p>One, more data are becoming digitised. The International Data Corporation has estimated that digital data will increase fivefold from 2018 to 2025.</p><p>Two, as banks begin to collaborate with FinTech and BigTech players, customer data that was traditionally within the inner sanctum of banks will increasingly be shared with third party service providers. Banks have to exercise care for the data they hold, as well as those that they have shared with third parties. This means:</p><p>understanding at a granular level the data that are held, processed or shared; assessing the criticality and sensitivity of all data sets; putting in place targeted measures to safeguard data; and taking swift recovery measures in the event of a data breach. Besides their personal health data, people regard their personal financial data as most sensitive. Financial institutions have a particular responsibility to safeguard this data.</p><p>The third area to watch closely is risk from the misuse of data analytics and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Data analytics and artificial intelligence can help to uncover patterns which we are unaware of and to provide insights that we could not have gained from traditional analytical tools. 11</p><p>But unless there is public trust that data analytics and artificial intelligence will be used responsibly, financial institutions will not get the social license they need to apply these technologies widely.</p><p>To gain this trust, we must address four areas in data analytics and artificial intelligence:</p><p>Privacy of data. How do we safeguard the confidentiality of personal data? Explainability of results. How do we minimise the black box syndrome? Accountability for decisions. How can we hold humans ultimately responsible for decisions made by self-learning machines? Acceptability of outcomes. How do we minimise unconscious bias, social exclusion, and ethically unacceptable consequences? MAS has co-created with the financial industry in Singapore a set of preliminary principles to guide the responsible use of data analytics and artificial intelligence in financial services.</p><p>The Principles are centred on four pillars - fairness, ethics, accountability, and transparency. Hence, the short-hand name FEAT Principles. They are not prescriptive but represent an industry consensus that individual financial institutions take reference from when formulating their own data governance policies and practices. We believe that the FEAT Principles will help to promote public confidence and trust in the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence in our financial sector. Conclusion</p><p>Let me conclude.</p><p>Technology and Finance must come together. And they must do so in a manner that maintains Trust.</p><p>Finance, Technology and Trust are like the three musketeers of old.</p><p>Like Athos, Finance allocates resources to those who need it. Like Porthos, Technology represents the aspiration for Finance to innovate. Like Aramis, Trust engenders confidence in Finance. The motto of the three musketeers is: Tous pour un, Un pour tous - One for all, All for one.</p><p>If Finance, Technology, and Trust can do the same, we can have innovation and dynamism with safety and stability. We can benefit not only the financial industry, but society at large. We can raise productivity, expand opportunity, and enrich the lives of our people. Thank you.</p><p>(Government of Singapore)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W40-5561-DXMS-80MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4117\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 15, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002EIQ</classCode><className>BANQUE DE FRANCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>Technology Security</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Mjk5QkJDODM0NDcyNDcxQjg1REI2NDU4REJBODkxNTc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzBDNzQyN0JENDRFNDYwMkEyNjVFRTgxNjNFRDExNUI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Commercial Law (UCC)</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI5QjdCNzBDNjY0NEY3QzlGRTNCQTMzQ0IwQ0MzRUQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzZFMDNGNTY2MjVBNDI2REE1QzY4QzBDNDVCMkZFRkU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDIzQzFDMzEwMEUxNEZGN0EyQUYwOUI2QTIwOEM2MjI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Insurance Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDM4MzQ2QUYzMTY0NDQzQTkxRDQwRUUzRUM5RDg0OEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Fire Insurance</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzcwRjdBM0IxRjQzNEY1N0FGMjM4QkY0QTg3OTYyNjE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzZFRUM3RDQ3M0Y1NDc1RUE2N0E4M0ZGQjY0MDk1MTY</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURCMkIyODk4NDUwNDQ2NkE3RkQ0Qzg3RUVCOENGQUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTA3MzFBREE5RDkxNEIyNkExMzYyNTkwMEI4ODA2MTQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N926150GC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp;

And if we are to spread the benefits of growth, innovation must be pervasive and not the exclusive preserve of the talented or well-endowed.  Innovation is not a zero-sum game. It thrives on diversity, collaboration, and openness. </p><p>There is much we can learn from each other.   France and Singapore have been deepening collaboration in areas such as finance, science, and technology.   2018 was designated as the France-Singapore Year of Innovation.  Today, I want to focus on innovation in financial services. Globally, the financial industry is facing slower economic growth, tighter regulation, and keener competition. </p><p>To overcome these headwinds and contribute to the broader economy, the industry needs to harness technology, foster innovation, and transform itself.   But how to do this, while maintaining the single most important commodity that underpins financial institutions - trust.  As Stephen Covey said: Strength lies in differences, not in similarities. This principle is embodied in the French novel The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas. </p><p>Set in the 17th century, the novel recounts the journey of D'Artagnan, who left for Paris to join the Musketeers of the Guard, and how he overcomes all adversities.   Together with him are three musketeers with contrasting personalities:  - Athos who is intelligent; </p><p>- Porthos who is adventurous; and </p><p>- Aramis who is true and faithful. </p><p>But together they form a well-balanced trio that supports D'Artagnan on his journey.  The three musketeers today are Finance, Technology, and Trust, corresponding to Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. Society is D'Artagnan. </p><p>Can the three modern musketeers work together to support Society?   Can they complement one another? Can they click?  Finance - the Astute Musketeer Losing Appeal </p><p>Let me introduce the first musketeer - Finance. </p><p>Like Athos, Finance is wise but can be complicated, and to some extent, mysterious and non-accessible to many people. As a result, Finance - at least in its traditional form - is losing its appeal. </p><p>Consumers find that banks' processes are too cumbersome to navigate.   They are increasingly looking to technology firms for their needs.   Some of them are even losing trust in the ability of banks to act in their interest.  Bill Gates once said: People need banking, not banks. It is a reminder that, to survive, Finance needs to be intuitive, innovative and customer-centric. </p><p>Technology - the Musketeer who can Transform Finance </p><p>This is where the second musketeer - Technology - comes in. </p><p>Technology is akin to Porthos, the fearless musketeer who is eager to try new ways for a better future. In a similar vein, Technology presents us opportunities to revitalise Finance: </p><p>the opportunity to enhance customer experience;   the opportunity to strengthen risk management; and   the opportunity to improve cost efficiency.  Let me elaborate on each of these opportunities. </p><p>First, enhancing customer experience. This has become a critical success factor in many industries, including finance. Why? </p><p>Basically, technology firms have reshaped the way businesses interact with customers. </p><p>They have empowered customers and set higher bars for customer satisfaction.   Whether they are established Big Tech firms or small FinTech start-ups, they pose a competitive challenge to financial institutions.  If I have to name one thing these technology firms do very well, much better than financial institutions, it would be that they are obsessively customer-centric. 3 </p><p>Tech firms embed themselves in the customer journey and use data analytics to deeply understand customer needs. </p><p>They then provide end-to-end solutions, often customised to individual circumstances.   They have agile IT systems, efficient processes, and a culture that emphasises speed.   Essentially, tech firms think of themselves not as being in a particular industry, but as platforms, upon which they provide access to the services their customers need.  Traditional banks tend to be largely product-centric. </p><p>The credit card division tries to sell you unsecured credit, the wealth management division tries to sell you mutual funds, the lending division tries to sell you a mortgage.   They start with the product and try to persuade the customer why their product is good for him.   Many banks do not have a complete picture of their customers.   They are weighed down by legacy IT systems and bureaucratic processes.  But several banks are stepping up to the challenge. Athos is learning from Porthos. </p><p>Banks are investing heavily in technology to optimise their operations and enhance their systems.   They are collaborating with technology firms to accelerate the pace of innovation.   They are becoming more customer-centric.  These banks are using technology to provide customised solutions, complete solutions, and seamless solutions. </p><p>First, customised solutions to suit the individual needs and characteristics of the customer. </p><p>Some banks are experimenting with personalised products and services, not just based on what the customer asks for but by anticipating what the customer might need. </p><p>Commonwealth Bank of Australia's mobile app is using behavioural science to provide customers with financial management advice based on their spending patterns and financial goals.  Some banks are offering personalised interactions at every customer touchpoint. </p><p>Royal Bank of Canada has enabled its customers to pay their bills on the mobile app via speech and voice recognition.  Second, complete solutions that are based on the total picture of the customer. </p><p>Today's customers are more sophisticated and want holistic solutions. </p><p>In a survey of 10,000 tech-savvy customers, Accenture found that 80% of them want integrated solutions that address both their financial and non-financial needs.   Financial needs are really driven by non-financial desires. People do not desire a housing loan or a fire insurance policy. People desire a house.  To provide complete, holistic solutions, you need comprehensive customer data and you need a deep understanding of the customer journey. </p><p>The customer data that most banks have are simply not sufficient to develop a good understanding of the financial situation or needs of their customers. </p><p>Customers have multiple relationships, with deposits and loans, investments, insurance policies, and retirement plans, spread across many financial institutions.   How many financial institutions advising a customer have a complete picture of the customer's balance sheet - all his assets and liabilities?  Some banks have started to offer aggregator services which consolidate financial information such as bank accounts, credit cards, loans, and investments from all the financial institutions serving their customers. </p><p>This allows financial institutions to provide holistic financial planning.   BBVA provides its corporate customers with a consolidated view of all their financial information from about 90 financial institutions.  Next, understanding the customer journey. </p><p>Some banks have begun to offer their corporate customers complete, end-to-end solutions, based on a keen understanding of their customers' work processes. </p><p>United Overseas Bank in Singapore provides its corporate customers an integrated digital platform that enables the customer to:  - generate purchase orders and invoices with a few clicks; </p><p>- streamline its payroll process; and </p><p>- get up-to-date views of its financials. </p><p>Some banks are positioning themselves as partners with their customers on their life journey, integrating their financial and non-financial needs. </p><p>DBS Bank in Singapore provides its customers looking to buy a car an online portal that enables them to calculate their budget, find an affordable car, connect with the seller, get a car loan, and finally purchase a car insurance.  Third, banks are using technology to provide seamless solutions. This means resolving bottlenecks and providing customers with a frictionless experience. </p><p>This means using technology to resolve bottlenecks in processes to provide customers with a frictionless experience. </p><p>Banks such as BBVA, Mitsubishi UFJ, and BNP Paribas are using blockchain technology for syndicated loans.   It improves efficiency.  - Each step of the loan process, from credit underwriting to credit administration, is documented in the distributed ledger, thereby eliminating the need for duplicative back office processing. </p><p>- The loan process is shortened from about two weeks to two days. </p><p>It also improves trust.  - Every record in the distributed ledger has a user code and time stamp. </p><p>- This creates an audit trail, leading to higher level of trust among the participants. </p><p>Let me share two initiatives from the Singapore financial sector, which show that achieving a seamless customer experience often requires collaboration across institutions and inter-operability across systems. </p><p>The two key ingredients for a digital transaction are identity authentication and secure payments. The Singapore government worked closely with the industry to make the customer experience seamless in these two areas. </p><p>First, seamless identity authentication through MyInfo. </p><p>MyInfo is a government digital service that enables Singapore residents to authorise third-parties to access their personal data residing across different government agencies through APIs.   This means that, with the consent of the customer, banks can use the MyInfo service for more efficient KYC using government-verified personal data.  I can now open a bank account or obtain a credit card - online and instantly - when I give consent to my bank to access my data through MyInfo. </p><p>Customers do not need to go through the tedious process of filling up forms and providing hardcopy documents to banks for verification. And they certainly don't need to go to the bank branch.   Banks benefit from higher productivity and better risk management.  Second, secure and seamless payments through PayNow. </p><p>PayNow was jointly developed by MAS and the banking industry.   It enables individuals and businesses to transfer funds using just the personal ID number or mobile phone number or unique entity number of their recipients.   It operates 24-by-7 and funds can be transferred directly from one bank account to another in real-time.   I can now send money to my friend in just three clicks on my smart phone - all I need to know is his mobile number.  Business users of PayNow can generate a QR code containing their unique entity number. </p><p>This means I can now pay my utilities provider, telephone company, or plumber by simply scanning their QR code using my smart phone and keying in the amount to be transferred.  Let me now move on to the second way in which Technology can benefit Finance - strengthening risk management. </p><p>Risk management and compliance have become major cost drivers in financial institutions since the global financial crisis. </p><p>Processes have become slower and more cumbersome.   The answer does not lie in lowering regulatory requirements or risk management standards. We know from 2008 what that can lead to.   Instead, financial institutions should harness technology to make risk management and compliance more efficient and effective.  Technology can improve the efficiency of risk management. </p><p>JP Morgan is using machine learning to review loan contracts. This reduces the review time from 360,000 man-hours to seconds. It also minimises human errors.   OCBC Bank in Singapore is using machine learning to monitor customer transactions real-time and across multiple channels. This allows the bank to identify fraudulent fund transfers and take more timely actions to recover the funds.  Technology can make risk management less passive and more predictive by harnessing the informational value of data. </p><p>Ping An Insurance has developed a system that detects whether a banking customer is lying about the reason for borrowing money.  - It is based on subtle changes in customers' facial expressions, with the analytical algorithm based on 30,000 videos of real lending cases. </p><p>- According to Ping An, this has helped to reduce credit losses by 60%. </p><p>Blackrock and Rhodium are using data analytics to assess the risks of climate change to assets such as mortgage backed securities under different scenarios.  We have not tapped on the full potential of new technologies. </p><p>Research by IBM has found that quantum computing algorithms can compute the risk of an investment portfolio near real-time.   This is a significant reduction from the present Monte Carlo simulation approach which can take days.  The third big opportunity that Technology offers Finance is improving cost-efficiency. </p><p>This is particularly relevant for banks - saddled with the high costs of maintaining extensive branch networks and deterred from entering new markets or reaching underserved segments of the population because the cost of setting up branches is too high. </p><p>Technology is changing this in two ways. 7 </p><p>First, the use of digital platforms to quickly and cheaply acquire customers. </p><p>The ubiquity of the Internet combined with the proliferation of the smart phone has helped to slash the cost of acquiring a customer.   According to research by Oliver Wyman, it costs about $30 to acquire an online banking customer compared to $150 using offline channels.   Basically, the smart phone is replacing the bank branch.  Non-bank players have led the way in digital banking. </p><p>In the UK, we have seen a proliferation of so-called neo-banks - basically non-bank start-ups who have obtained licenses to do banking business without physical branches. </p><p>Starling has opened 520,000 personal accounts since getting a banking license in 2016.   Monzo has opened 1.6 million accounts, adding 30,000 each week.  - Monzo's customers can connect their accounts to 600 different apps and services, and create rules to integrate banking into their daily lives. </p><p>- For example, users can create a rule that automatically logs calories to the health app on their mobile phone whenever they purchase coffee. </p><p>But banks can also play the same game, and more of them are doing it. </p><p>DBS Bank from Singapore launched a digi-bank in India two years ago and has already garnered 2.5 million customers. </p><p>Digibank is using artificial intelligence to learn customers' spending habits and will prompt them if they are overspending, or provide relevant marketing offers such as coffee vouchers for a caffeine-lover.   Maybe we should combine the DBS Bank app and the Monzo app to achieve a more balanced intake of coffee!  United Overseas Bank from Singapore has just launched in Thailand a digital-only bank TMRW (pronounced tomorrow) aimed at millennials. </p><p>It comes complete with an engagement lab using behavioural insights to study customer's banking habits and needs.   TMRW's mobile app features a game designed to encourage their customers to save more.  In Hong Kong, the regulator has given out licenses to 8 virtual banks to acquire and deliver banking services through the Internet. </p><p>The take-up numbers are interesting; they indicate the competition emerging in the space of digital banking.   Out of the 8 virtual banks, 5 are non-banks but 3 are backed by banks.  But the second and potentially more powerful way in which technology is helping to drive down the cost of financial intermediation is through partnerships between financial institutions and FinTech firms. </p><p>Soc-G\u00e9n is working with TagPay to provide mobile banking in Africa through a cloud-based platform that is compatible with any mobile phone.   AXA is working with MicroEnsure to offer simple and affordable insurance products to customers across Asia and Africa.  By helping to reduce customer acquisition costs, these collaborations have helped to serve a larger social purpose - enhancing financial inclusion and expanding opportunity. But there is a lot more we need to do. </p><p>There are about 1.7 billion adults globally who are unbanked.   In the ten ASEAN countries of Southeast Asia, half the adult population is unbanked.   This is a shame. The ASEAN countries have a burgeoning middle class and increasingly modern infrastructure, yet so many do not have access to a bank account, secure and affordable payments, or insurance protection.   Banks and insurers face high costs in reaching out to customers in remote areas.  We need to take collaboration between financial institutions and FinTech firms to a much broader level - through platforms for innovation and inclusion. </p><p>This is why the MAS, the ASEAN Bankers Association, and the World Bank's International Finance Corporation have teamed up to establish the ASEAN Financial Innovation Network, or AFIN in short. </p><p>AFIN aims to bring banks and FinTech firms from across the world to develop innovative solutions to penetrate hard-to-reach markets in a cost efficient way. </p><p>Last year, AFIN launched the API eXchange - the world's first cross-border, open architecture platform to enhance financial inclusion.   The API eXchange is a cloud-based platform that does two things:  - It is a marketplace, enabling financial institutions to discover and connect with FinTech partners through APIs on a globally curated platform. </p><p>- It also provides a sandbox environment for financial institutions and FinTech firms to design and test cross-border solutions. </p><p>I have spoken so far of how the two musketeers - Finance and Technology - can and must come together to bring value and convenience to customers. But for consumers to be part of this ecosystem, there needs to be Trust - the third musketeer. </p><p>Trust - the Musketeer who Binds Consumers to Finance </p><p>Trust is similar to Aramis, the third musketeer who is faithful and values friendship. </p><p>Trust is a key attribute for the success of a financial ecosystem. 9 </p><p>It is a shared responsibility among all the actors in the ecosystem.   Banks in particular must be trustworthy so that customers have faith that their money and data are safe with them.  As Finance adopts more Technology, it must pay close attention to three risks, so as to maintain the Trust of consumers. </p><p>First, cyber risk. </p><p>As more financial services move online and collaboration among banks and technology companies becomes more pervasive, a growing risk that financial institutions are facing is in cyber space. </p><p>The frequency, scale, and complexity of cyber-attacks are mounting.   Attackers can carry out sophisticated and prolonged attacks that can be difficult to identify and defend against.   According to a study by FireEye, the median time it takes to detect a cyber intrusion is 78 days.  We need some common risk management standards in cyber defence. </p><p>The risk management systems in financial institutions and regulatory and supervisory frameworks for cyber resilience are uneven and still evolving.   There is no international equivalent of the Basel Capital Accord in cyber risk management.   But given the clear and present danger that cyber risk poses, MAS has put in place a mix of mandatory requirements and best practice guidelines in this area.  Given their role as repositories of public monies and conduits for payments, banks in particular must meet higher cyber security standards. MAS expects banks to: </p><p>limit unscheduled system downtime of their critical IT systems to not more than 4 hours within a year;   conduct due diligence on third-party service providers' controls to safeguard customer information; and   report all significant cyber incidents to MAS within one hour.  But cyber risk management should go beyond banks. </p><p>The connectedness among participants in the financial system means that a cyber-attack on one party can potentially escalate into a more systemic problem.   We need to level up the cyber resilience of all financial institutions, not necessarily to the level of banks but at least to a basic level - what we call cyber hygiene.   Research has shown that the majority of cyber incidents can be avoided if some simple cyber hygiene practices are adopted.  MAS will soon issue a set of mandatory requirements on cyber hygiene that will apply to all financial institutions in Singapore. They include basic things like: 10 </p><p>securing administrative accounts;   controlling network access at the perimeter;   installing security patches promptly;   installing anti-virus software on their systems; and   implementing multi-factor authentication for users who access confidential information over the Internet.  In short, if we don't get cyber security right, financial institutions will be constrained in how much they can leverage on technology. </p><p>The second area financial institutions must address to ensure customer confidence is information security risk. </p><p>Information security is not the same as cyber security. </p><p>Information security is focused on protecting data, while cyber security is focused on protecting systems.   They are however closely related.   Data leaks can occur when a system is not properly secured.  In the financial ecosystem, information security risk is growing for two key reasons: </p><p>One, more data are becoming digitised.  The International Data Corporation has estimated that digital data will increase fivefold from 2018 to 2025. </p><p>Two, as banks begin to collaborate with FinTech and BigTech players, customer data that was traditionally within the inner sanctum of banks will increasingly be shared with third party service providers.  Banks have to exercise care for the data they hold, as well as those that they have shared with third parties. This means: </p><p>understanding at a granular level the data that are held, processed or shared;   assessing the criticality and sensitivity of all data sets;   putting in place targeted measures to safeguard data; and   taking swift recovery measures in the event of a data breach.  Besides their personal health data, people regard their personal financial data as most sensitive. Financial institutions have a particular responsibility to safeguard this data. </p><p>The third area to watch closely is risk from the misuse of data analytics and artificial intelligence. </p><p>Data analytics and artificial intelligence can help to uncover patterns which we are unaware of and to provide insights that we could not have gained from traditional analytical tools. 11 </p><p>But unless there is public trust that data analytics and artificial intelligence will be used responsibly, financial institutions will not get the social license they need to apply these technologies widely. </p><p>To gain this trust, we must address four areas in data analytics and artificial intelligence: </p><p>Privacy of data. How do we safeguard the confidentiality of personal data?   Explainability of results. How do we minimise the black box syndrome?   Accountability for decisions. How can we hold humans ultimately responsible for decisions made by self-learning machines?   Acceptability of outcomes. How do we minimise unconscious bias, social exclusion, and ethically unacceptable consequences?  MAS has co-created with the financial industry in Singapore a set of preliminary principles to guide the responsible use of data analytics and artificial intelligence in financial services. </p><p>The Principles are centred on four pillars - fairness, ethics, accountability, and transparency. Hence, the short-hand name FEAT Principles.   They are not prescriptive but represent an industry consensus that individual financial institutions take reference from when formulating their own data governance policies and practices.   We believe that the FEAT Principles will help to promote public confidence and trust in the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence in our financial sector.  Conclusion </p><p>Let me conclude. </p><p>Technology and Finance must come together. And they must do so in a manner that maintains Trust. </p><p>Finance, Technology and Trust are like the three musketeers of old. </p><p>Like Athos, Finance allocates resources to those who need it.   Like Porthos, Technology represents the aspiration for Finance to innovate.   Like Aramis, Trust engenders confidence in Finance.  The motto of the three musketeers is: Tous pour un, Un pour tous - One for all, All for one. </p><p>If Finance, Technology, and Trust can do the same, we can have innovation and dynamism with safety and stability.   We can benefit not only the financial industry, but society at large.   We can raise productivity, expand opportunity, and enrich the lives of our people.  Thank you.</p><p>(Government of Singapore)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Welcome to the world's largest FinTech festival.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">a) Our Festival is getting bigger. This year, we have about 40,000 participants - one-third more than last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">b) This year, we also hope that we've made your experience better - richer in content, and even higher in quality.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">c) We have also put greater focus on issues that will interest you more - ASEAN, Financial Inclusion, AI in finance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Encouraging Signs in Our Young FinTech Journey</p><p>2. FinTech is relatively new in Singapore, but we are on a promising journey, and the entire sector is bubbling with excitement in Singapore.</p><p>a) People coming together.</p><p>b) Ideas are hatched.</p><p>c) Companies are formed.</p><p>d) Jobs are created.</p><p>e) Solutions are found to solve real problems.</p><p>f) The entire FinTech Festival epitomises what is happening here.</p><p>3. Let me share the stories of three FinTech firms in Singapore:</p><p>a) M-DAQ - it is in the business of foreign exchange, helping enterprises pay and collect monies from their partners overseas, as well as manage FX risks</p><p>b) Silent Eight - it is using AI to fight financial crime and is working with several global financial institutions.</p><p>c) Thin Margin - it is changing the concept of money changing to give clients better rates and greater convenience</p><p>Let us take a look at what the founders have to say.</p><p>4. Wonderful, inspiring stories. Today I stand here facing quite tough competition. Because earlier this morning, PM Modi said \"Come to India\". And just now, the central bank governor from Kenya said \"Come to Kenya\". Now, I am telling you, \"Come to Singapore!\".</p><p>5. These are three companies, out of many, that have decided to come to Singapore. Why did they decide to build on their dreams in Singapore? I think there are three main reasons, which is what I want to talk about today.</p><p>First, Singapore is a Great Place</p><p>6. Singapore is not a place just for Crazy Rich Asians. You don't have to be rich, you can lead a fairly comfortable and affordable life here. It is a city for everybody.</p><p>a) The best way to think about Singapore, is to think of us geographically. We are at the crossroads of the world - the Eastern-most fringe of the Indian Ocean, the Western-most fringe of the Pacific Ocean. This is where the sea lanes of communication converge. We are a node in this convergence. This shapes how we think and who we are.</p><p>b) Here in Singapore, it is safe and things works.</p><p>i. Whether it is transport, healthcare, public education. Everything works well. If it doesn't work, we will fix it.</p><p>ii. Rule of law and security are taken very seriously.</p><p>iii. So much so that President Donald Trump and Chairman Kim Jong Un chose to meet here.</p><p>c) We have a diverse culture and you can see that in our food, art, entertainment and our people.</p><p>i. People from different religions, backgrounds and cultures truly respect each other. Every minority has its own space to practice their religion and culture. At the same time, people respect each other and the common space we have as Singaporeans.</p><p>ii. So much so that we decided in our early years of independence that we shall use English as our main mode of working communication.</p><p>d). We also understand this city is all we've got, so we have to cherish it</p><p>i. We are one of two rare cities where you find nature reserves in the middle of the city - the other is Rio de Janeiro. If you walk in our nature reserves, you will see more varieties of flora and fauna than the whole Europe combined.</p><p>ii. We reclaimed land to make part of the sea to become a reservoir - 1/6th the size of Singapore. Over time, salt water become fresh water.</p><p>iii. We turn our rubbish into dust by burning them and created an artificial island out of it, Pulau Semakau. Today, it is an island of greenery with flora and fauna.</p><p>7. Most importantly, this is a great place to start a business.</p><p>a) We are a node in Southeast Asia, a significant market- 650 million people, a rising middle class, fairly high mobile and Internet penetration, with a lot more headroom for growth. There is plenty of growth opportunities in the ASEAN market.</p><p>b) We are a great spring board to the region - there are 3,000 financial institutions and every major global bank operating in Singapore.</p><p>i. These FIs may be traditional players but they are also Fintech firms. They want to collaborate with fellow FinTech players and with start-ups, or be your customer.</p><p>ii. Take for example the three stories we just saw. Silent Eight and M-DAQ did well in Singapore because they first started working with traditional and established FIs.</p><p>iii. And there is also a supportive industry around FinTech- angel investors, venture capitalists, private equity, IT companies, management consultants and head-hunters. There is a whole ecosystem around FinTech.</p><p>c) Besides being a springboard to ASEAN, we are also a springboard to the world.</p><p>i. We have been busy forging free trade agreements for 20 years. This was before we had trade wars and uncertainties about the multilateral trading systems. We know that as a small country, we need trade to survive, and trade politics can be difficult.</p><p>ii. So Singapore makes sure that we have access to all our main markets. Today, we have FTAs within the ASEAN region and the bigger Asian region - China, Japan, India, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand. Further afield, the US, Canada, Mexico and soon, the EU once the FTA has been ratified.</p><p>iii. MAS has been developing connections through a network of 25 FinTech Co-operation Agreements with counterparts in UK, US, Japan and many of our ASEAN neighbours. Through these agreements, you can better enter these markets and navigate the regulatory landscape of these overseas markets.</p><p>d) Within this small space, we plan our city well. There will be space for you to set up here.</p><p>i. We have set aside 100,000 square feet in a FinTech Hub in the middle of the city on Robinson Road to ensure you have the physical space.</p><p>ii. Every University has incubator space and they will welcome you too.</p><p>Second, We Are Open to Ideas</p><p>8. Our whole existence as a city state boils down to that attitude: we are prepared to experiment, we are open to ideas, we try solutions that others may not have tried before.</p><p>a) This is how we built up our armed forces, ensure water sufficiency, control traffic congestion, forge racial harmony, provide public housing - we learn from others, build upon the lessons, and try new solutions. If it fails, we try again.</p><p>b) Experimentation is in our blood. This is why big tech companies are doing interesting things here.</p><p>i. Google is working on its Next Billion Users project in Singapore.</p><p>ii. Alibaba has many research centres in China. But when it decided to have its first research centre outside of China, they built two - one in Silicon Valley and the other in Singapore, with the Nanyang Technological University.</p><p>iii. Grab has its global innovation hub at the National University of Singapore.</p><p>iv. Mastercard is housing its largest innovation lab in the world in Singapore, to find the next digital payment breakthrough.</p><p>v. And still others - PayPal, Siemens, Dyson, HP and Amazon Prime - they are all building their research and innovation hubs here.</p><p>9. MAS is committed to support experimentation and innovation. Two examples of this at work:</p><p>a) One, MAS encouraging our FIs to use RegTech - using technology to help FIs overcome their regulatory pains</p><p>i. One of those pain points is submitting reports and providing data to the regulator.</p><p>ii. Last year, MAS announced that we will transform the way we collect data from FIs - data must be machine-readable, and in time, we want zero duplication of data requests.</p><p>iii. We are setting aside S$35 million to help smaller banks and insurers make use of RegTech. More details will be announced in the coming months.</p><p>b) Two, the longstanding regulatory philosophy of making good use of ex-post supervision vs ex-ante regulation. This means that when a new idea comes along, we want to say \"start first\". After you start, we will observe and see how we can optimise the regulation.</p><p>i. One good example of this is the regulatory sandbox. This is where regulations are suspended, and allows firms to test their ideas with real customers in a fixed period of time.</p><p>ii. This is a learning experience for both the FinTech companies and MAS.</p><p>iii. Some people have said the Sandbox is too hard to get in. We will push this approach further. Today, we will launch a public consultation to seek industry's views on the creation of the Sandbox Express.</p><p>iv. It will make it easier to get into the Sandbox. 21 days - that will be our target.</p><p>v. This will be for activities where the risks are low or well understood. We can relax the system and allow tests and experiments to happen more quickly.</p><p>vi. Some think maybe that is still not good enough and prefer something more laissez faire - but we are not that kind of regime. We regulate to harmonise concerns in the urban environment. That's why whatever works in Singapore, it most likely can work in most other urban environments. If it works here, it has credibility all over the world.</p><p>10. A good example is our ePayment system.</p><p>a) It did not go the way of certain laissez faire regimes - where the system can grow so fast, it takes over the entire financial system and bypasses traditional financial services. Although it is convenient, it gives rise to prudential concerns. They are close loop systems that do not encourage inter-operability and overtime, stifles competition.</p><p>b) So when it comes to ePayment, we decided very consciously to take a bit more time but make sure ePayment is open architecture. So ePayment in Singapore is rather unique.</p><p>i. First, it works like any other ePayment in the world, where you can transfer funds using mobile phone number or ID number of the recipient.</p><p>ii. But what is different is the backend - it rides on a national inter-bank funds transfer infrastructure called FAST.</p><p>iii. Which is opened up for non-banks to participate.</p><p>iv. On the front end - we have a common QR code regardless of payment modes and wallets. It is the first of its kind globally.</p><p>v. So one ePayment system with one common backbone, one common QR.</p><p>vi. We want to get it right because payment is fundamental - we all use payments and we use it in every sector of the economy.</p><p>vii. By ensuring open architecture and interoperability, we encourage competition, and over time, promote innovation.</p><p>viii. Therefore, laissez faire does not equal innovation in our context.</p><p>Third, We Believe in Skills and Talent</p><p>11. To innovate, create new jobs, in an area like FinTech, we need a broad range of talent.</p><p>a) Because FinTech is neither all Fin or all Tech.</p><p>b) Not all Fin - AI for security in FIs can be applied in a variety of sectors. ePayment functions ride and serve many other services, from games to retail to social networking.</p><p>c) Not all Tech - Beyond techies, you need people who can market, raise funds, anthropologists, psychologists, artists, designers, HR experts.</p><p>d) We need a whole talent ecosystem.</p><p>12. That's why the most important support is our education system, because that's how we develop our talent.</p><p>a) Education cannot just be about rote learning and acing exams.</p><p>b) We need to nurture curiosity and joy of learning, because how else are you going to keep learning your whole life to keep up with advancement of knowledge and technology? You need to have that passion and hunger.</p><p>c) Fortunately, since 1997, we have been moving education to an inquiry-based approach. You are required to work in teams, be hands-on and solve real problems. This is more likely to trigger joy and curiosity in our children.</p><p>d) Recently, we removed 1 out of every 4 examinations to make time for more inquiry-based and more hands-on applied learning, to nurture the interest and joy of learning.</p><p>e) We don't believe in forcing all our young to learn coding, because there is a chance that by the time they enter the workforce, the language becomes outdated. Instead, we focus on teaching them the fundamentals - values, literary, numeracy.</p><p>f) So in maths, our focus is on problem solving that exercise our young in computational, analytical and logical thinking.</p><p>i. Here's an example of a typical math problem that 12- year old student in Singapore will solve.</p><p>ii. Edwin has $190 less than Mary. After Edwin spent $20, the amount he left was 5/12 of Mary's money. How much money did Mary have? The problem sounds difficult but all our children are taught how to visualise the problem, decompose it, solve it step-by-step.</p><p>g) This is an open-source curriculum and is adopted by many countries. They improve upon it and we, in turn, learn from them. That is an open architecture.</p><p>h) Our students have done well. They came in first in all four domains of international PISA tests in 2015 - for 15-year olds, number one in maths, science, reading and collaborative problem solving.</p><p>13. Higher education is transforming as well.</p><p>a) More than 90% of our students progress to post-secondary education - in vocational institute (ITE), polytechnics or universities.</p><p>b) In some universities, computational thinking, digital literacy and quantitative reasoning have become compulsory modules.</p><p>c) The entire curriculum is changing. More inter-disciplinary learning, fewer lectures, fewer tutorials, more projects, prototyping, internship, overseas exposures, community immersion, entrepreneurship stints. Education is now more of an experience.</p><p>d) Hackathons are getting popular.</p><p>i. 5 polytechnics launched an API Hackathon this year. 130 students developed FinTech prototypes, best of which are showcased at this Festival.</p><p>ii. Tomorrow, PM Modi and I will witness the unveiling of winners of the Singapore-India Hackathon.</p><p>14. Because of that we are seeing interesting FinTech start-ups spinning offs from Universities.</p><p>a) One example is Zilliqa - a spin-off from NUS. It is founded by NUS Computing researchers and is transforming the world of blockchain through 'sharding', a concept developed at the university. 'Sharding' divides a blockchain network into \"shards\" that can process transactions at the same time, that way they can enhancing scalability and energy efficiency of cryptocurrency mining. They surpassed a US$1 billion market cap in May 2018.</p><p>b) Another company is Funding Societies - co-founded in 2015 by NUS alumnus Kelvin Teo. Today, it is the leading peer-to-peer financing platform in Southeast Asia. The company has crowdfunded more than S$285 million in loans. In 2018, the company was listed on KPMG's Fintech100 list.</p><p>15. Our young will no doubt be prepared well. But we are also upgrading all our adult workers, through a nation-wide movement called SkillsFuture.</p><p>a) Our universities are transforming themselves - not just education institutes for the young, but for everyone. They are transforming themselves into institutes of lifelong learning. NUS now enrols students not just for four years for a degree but for 20 years. Graduates are welcomed to come back and learn new skills.</p><p>b) Total training hours for adults have increased drastically- from 26.7 million in 2013 to 41.1 million in 2017.</p><p>c) A large part of increase is driven by tech training, including data analytics, cybersecurity, agile software development and more.</p><p>d) We are even going to the community, teaching IT illiterate citizens how to use digital tools.</p><p>e) This will not make them tech experts, but they can become smart users.</p><p>f) We are retooling an entire working population to support our economic transformation.</p><p>16. A final point on talent and skills - for a small country and small population, we will not have enough expertise in many areas of specialisations.</p><p>a) Hence we believe in complementing local with foreign expertise - grow our own timber, but also welcome experts from around the world.</p><p>b) And if there is a capability we do not possess, we welcome international experts to teach in our Polytechnics and Universities.</p><p>c) That way, we can better grow businesses, open up more opportunities and create jobs in Singapore.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>17. In summary, three answers to the question 'Why Singapore?'</p><p>a) Singapore is a great place.</p><p>b) We keep an open mind to ideas.</p><p>c) We believe in skills and talent.</p><p>18. These makes us a living lab. This is where you get things to work in a complex, sophisticated, well-regulated but business-friendly environment. If it works here, it can work elsewhere in the world.</p><p>19. I hope I have convinced you. If you are still not convinced - it's okay. I hope you enjoy your stay in Singapore. Take a look at our airport, try out SIA and eat some durians.</p><p>20. Have a good afternoon. Thank you.</p><p>Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0045623760</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRF-PBC1-JB5M-W1N7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2761\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 14, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DIYD</classCode><className>ASEAN COUNTRIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009HPF</classCode><className>EDUCATION SYSTEMS &amp;

Socialism (of some kind) is espoused by a growing number of Democratic politicians. A Harvard University study found 51 percent of 18- to 29-year-old Americans do not support capitalism. The business bashing is not solely from the political left; Donald Trump has tweet-attacked plenty of companies for offending his populist instincts. Voices demanding higher taxes and tougher regulations grow louder. Echoing the vigorous trust busting of the Progressive era, there are calls to break up Facebook and Google, the increasingly dominant tech platforms, while the titans of Silicon Valley are rebranded as 21st-century robber barons, heirs to what the Progressive president Teddy Roosevelt lambasted as \u201cmalefactors of great wealth.\u201d</p><p>Amid so much criticism, who would dare dispute that there is something rotten about the state of corporate America today? Enter Tyler Cowen, an economics professor who has written a determinedly positive book about business that he subtitles \u201cA Love Letter to an American Anti-Hero.\u201d Cowen did not become one of the world\u2019s most-read bloggers on economics without understanding the value of a well-timed contrarian blast. He showed this to great effect in 2011 in a best-selling e-book, \u201cThe Great Stagnation,\u201d arguing that the rate of increase in median income had slowed since the early 1970s as a direct consequence of a falling rate of innovation in the American economy, which was thus likely to continue to struggle to grow for the foreseeable future. Now he is back \u201cto speak up for business, to persuade you that it deserves more of your love and less hate.\u201d</p><p>If you are hoping for a billet-doux to set your heart aflutter, remember that the author is a practitioner of the dismal science; the romance in his love letter is less Harry Met Sally than Demand Meets Supply. Still, there is no shortage of passion from Cowen. His beloved is the source of \u201cmost of the stuff we enjoy and consume\u201d and gives \u201cmost of us jobs.\u201d Business may not be the face that launched a thousand ships, but it built them; indeed, he enthuses, without business we would not have ships, trains and cars; electricity, lighting and heating equipment; most of our food supply and lifesaving pharmaceuticals; clothes for our children; telephones and smartphones; books; and access to the world\u2019s online information. Cowen also argues, persuasively, that America tops the world in the quality of its corporate management \u2014 if Chinese firms were managed equally well, they would be up to 50 percent more productive. American business is also the leading innovator globally in many areas.</p><p>So, as Cowen poses in his concluding chapter, \u201cIf business is so good, why is it so disliked?\u201d He dismisses the familiar complaints made by critics of corporate America: that it is too corrupt and fraudulent to be trusted; that greedy executives are paid too much; that it hurts consumers by wielding too much monopoly power; that cronyism gives it too much influence in Washington; and so on.</p><p>Some of his defense of business is more nuanced and less certain than his positive headline message suggests. He devotes a chapter to refuting accusations that Big Tech companies are evil, only to confess to worrying about the threat they pose to personal privacy, which he fears will get dramatically worse as facial recognition and voice-recording technologies become ever more ubiquitous. (Still, perhaps business will rescue us even from this, he reassures himself: \u201cIn the future privacy-protecting technologies will outrace privacy-denying ones\u201d \u2014 well, maybe.) He argues that business should be trusted more, despite so many high-profile scandals, because it is less prone to lying and cheating than governments or nonprofits, or indeed than regular people going about their everyday lives. This could be read not as a ringing endorsement but as damning with faint praise.</p><p>For Cowen, the real reason business is so unpopular, despite all it does for us, is that we humans tend to anthropomorphize companies, turning corporations \u201cinto people in our minds, and also in our hearts\u201d (and even writing love letters to them). We take on this illusion, that business really cares about us, \u201cto make our lives feel bearable and to help us feel more in control.\u201d Companies play along in this charade, because it pays them to do so, branding themselves with human characteristics like being friendly and listening to our concerns. Inevitably, we feel let down when they turn out instead to be \u201cabstract, sharklike legal entities devoted to commercial profit.\u201d In reality, Cowen says, \u201cwe, as consumers or workers, are never really quite as much in control as we might like to think. And thus we are perpetually disappointed in corporations.\u201d Thus writes a man who knows, deep down, that his love is doomed to be unrequited.</p><p>Cowen\u2019s explanation is not particularly convincing. Nor is his two-part advice for clearing the current atmosphere of distrust. First, the public should accept that business will always fall short of our unreasonably high expectations, and get over it. Second, rather unexpectedly from a member of the famously libertarian and pro-capitalist economics faculty at George Mason University, he wants business to try harder at being socially responsible.</p><p>In 1970, The New York Times Magazine published an extraordinarily controversial article by Milton Friedman, titled \u201cThe Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its Profits.\u201d At the time, this shocked even much of corporate America, never mind the regular New York Times reader. The article was intended to defend business against heavy-handed government regulation, including of prices and wages, that threatened to squeeze dynamism and innovation out of corporate America. Yet over the years, as deregulation and market liberalization spread across America and then the world, Friedman\u2019s words were, I believe, twisted by many investors and business leaders into a simplistic justification for doing anything that increased profits \u2014 and their pay packets \u2014 regardless of the consequences for society and the planet.</p><p>Risking the ire of his colleagues at George Mason, Cowen rejects Friedman\u2019s definition, arguing instead that the \u201csocial responsibility of business is to come up with the magic of a vision that will help us trust it more, whether as consumers or workers.\u201d The great Nobel laureate\u2019s article reflected \u201csignificant ideological blinders,\u201d he says; \u201cgoals other than simple profit maximization often end up boosting both business and social profits.\u201d For Cowen, business at its best is a \u201cfundamentally ethical enterprise\u201d and (preserving his libertarian credentials by citing Ayn Rand in support of it) \u201ccan be a vehicle for the achievement of heroic goals.\u201d</p><p>This would have been a far better book had Cowen focused more on how to overcome the negative consequences of the spread of the Friedman Doctrine, which I believe has clearly helped socially irresponsible, greedy, unheroic business leaders flourish at the expense of the heroic kind. As a result, the rise of corporate profits to historic highs as a share of America\u2019s G.D.P. has been due not just to the much needed productivity improvements and innovations celebrated by Cowen, but also to shortsighted, selfish decisions that have harmed society and heated up the planet.</p><p>Happily a new generation of more socially responsible business leaders is emerging, like Marc Benioff of Salesforce, the Chobani founder Hamdi Ulukaya and Indra Nooyi (until recently at the helm of PepsiCo). If only Cowen had shown less unconditional love for corporate America as a whole and instead concentrated on its best bits, and on what needs to be done to ensure that being ethical and heroic becomes business as usual. That \u201clove letter\u201d would have left most readers hopeful that there might yet be a Happily Ever After.</p><p>Matthew Bishop was a writer for The Economist for 26 years, many of them as New York bureau chief.
