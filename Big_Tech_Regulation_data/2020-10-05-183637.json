The promise was to take all the world's information and make it useful to everyone -- almost like magic -- with just a single word, \"Search.\" Google and Facebook were both founded by mathematicians who promised to create a free flow of information. Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in 1998 while Ph.D. students at Stanford University in California. </p><p>Their site was named after a googol -- the name for the number 1 followed by 100 zeros -- found in the book \"Mathematics and the Imagination\" by Edward Kasner and James Newman. Facebook was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg, along with fellow Harvard College students and roommates The \"how\" of making money soon became an issue, which was solved through tracking individual's searches. Google could tell whether you were Republican or Democrat or gay or straight. Such information building blocks were used to construct individual profiles to sell on the Internet through targeted ads to the users. Google was able to convince people it was well meaning and not harmful. Google even adopted a corporateslogan in 2003, 'Don't be evil,\" but evil was never defined. After all, Google did have a clean homepage to convince users it was harmless; nevertheless, once people started going directly to websites so Google couldn't track them through searches, Google built a browser, Chrome, to track them wherever they were. Google also came up with an operating system (Android) for smartphones that tracks what you're doing   even when you're not online. Google likewise built apps like Google Docs and Google Maps and other platforms to collect even more data about people. Public Acquiesce Why are people so accepting that the data Google and Facebook collects isn'tgoing to be used to manipulate them.An unconscious mind is being built by Google and Facebook that is filtering the world for us as they control the portals to information which makes us easier to control and manipulate. People possibly tellGoogle more than they would tell their wives or close friends. Google reads emails in order to send you targeted ads. Google even tracks your drafts that you didn't send The reason lies in the fact that both Google and Facebook give people things they want and don't want to give up. Google offers quick web searches and free e-mails, while Facebook offers the ability to connect with others and then being able to say whatever they want. Algorithm filter and manipulate our thought Algorithms are behind the system of manipulating what we see by filtering out results and ranking them in order. You want the answer, not billions of webpages, so Google sorts through the hundreds of billions of webpages in its system to give back useful and relevant results in a fraction of a second. This creates a problem when it comes to political issues, because it will always favor one candidate over another, ensuring that a handful of people at the big technology companies will determine what a billion people think. Rarely do people go to the second page of search results, meaning that Google's Search EngineBias for one candidate can shift lots of votes. As stated by filmmaker, Andrew Marcus[1], 'What big tech has done to conservative and other undesirable publishers is nothing short of a digital Kristallnacht.\" As such, Facebook delivered for Democrats in the midterms by erasing two billion GOP page views, thereby eliminating conservative content to suburban females. While in 2016 suburban voters and women would checkFacebook pages and get conservative news, it's no longer true. These same voters went Democrat in the midterms. Facebook and Google say they are not legally responsible for things people say on their sites, claiming they operate on a neutral platform; however, the companies do take very aggressive editorial control and should not hide behind the law. As to why our government doesn't interfere? Bias exists as our federal government uses Google tools, including Gmail. In that the Federal government runs on Google, how could it regulate it? Then too, Google and Facebook regularly lobby state legislatures against passing stronger privacy legislation. Here is an excellent article by Tom Wu of 11/13/2018, detailing how big tech companies get by without regulation. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/book-excerpt-curse-of-bigness/\">https://www.wired.com/story/book-excerpt-curse-of-bigness/</url>[2] Google censorship and blacklisting Google maintains a very dangerous blacklist called the quarantine list. It contains millions of websites that Google doesn't want you to see. And there are no relevant regulations and no oversight. Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, a Canadian professor who appears in the documentary, had his videos censored on Google-owned YouTube, which had received millions of views, because in his videos he was critical of using certain pronouns when it comes to referring to people. Google also shut off his Gmail account. The company said he violated their policy. But no explanation was given. Dr. Epstein found out the hard way that Google can block a website through Firefox and Safari   even though those aren't his browsers. It happened to him a day after he wrote an article[3] about whether Google could tip an election. Epstein found that Google could influence elections by 10 percent through the top search results given by Google. The day after his article was published, Google blocked Dr. Epstein's website from the internet, claiming it had been hacked. As to Google's plans for the future, a recent article by Heather Kelly[4] of CNN Businessrelates how Google wants its virtual assistant in every room of your house. Google (GOOGL[5]) imagines people living, parenting and even sleeping surrounded by its products. Voice assistants may have started in a single room for playing music, but Google's house previews a future where almost every room has an always-listening microphone, a speaker, camera and a screen of some sort. Undermining Democracy Google and Facebook can be likened to 1930s fascism in Italy when the government fused with large corporations, but it's being done more cleverly now as we all opted into Google and Facebook, trusting them to make right and good decisions for us. An unconscious mind is being built by Google and Facebook that is filtering the world for us as they control the portals to information which makes us easier to control and manipulate and has the power to undermine democracy without us knowing it. We must be aware of what we are putting into our computers and what our computers are putting into us, since the entire Internet is based on surveillance. If action isn't taken soon it will be harder to fight back, as all large tech companies, as totalitarian forces, are trying to control more and more of our lives.

Within the note, the analysts called out the following commentary from their vendor checks:</p><p><br/><br/>\"The acquisition of MuleSoft was the right move by Salesforce.\" -- Partner <br/>\"The acquisition of MULE completes the CRM's vision for the '360 view of the customer,' allowing Salesforce to unify the disparate pieces of their customers' databases. The acquisition presents an opportunity for further Platform growth.\" -- Industry Contact <br/>\"Middleware and data is nothing without analytics. Having Einstein was critical.\" -- Partner <br/>\"MuleSoft also presents the opportunity for AppDev. They're able to address the market from this perspective as well, which is what makes Salesforce so hot right now.\" -- Industry Contact <br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>Another name that saw favorable mention from the analysts at Pivotal is Alphabet  , which was also upgraded to \"Buy\" from \"Hold\" as it remains dominant in the digital advertisement space. Importantly, regarding competition on this front, the analysts noted, \"data we see conveys that little is getting in the way of its position [in digital advertising] with either consumers or advertisers.\" Additionally, while there is some regulatory risk, with some fearing that Alphabet may be at risk of the same factors impacting Facebook  , the analysts noted that they see \"a real difference in that Google appears to be better managed.\"</p><p>We agree completely with this take on the differences in management and therefore continue to view GOOGL as one of our favorite plays in the tech sector thanks to its balance of growth and valuation, compounded by the avenues for growth provided by the company's dominance in artificial intelligence, which we continue to believe provides a significant competitive moat and will ultimately allow the company to increase its business (and revenue) diversity by expanding into other fields, something we are already seeing with Waymo (autonomous driving) and Verily (healthcare).</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>Also seeing a positive mention from analysts at Pivotal was Amazon  , which the firm initiated with a \"Buy\" rating stating \"despite its current massive size, we see Amazon's opportunities as mostly unconstrained based on a successful track record of capitalizing on consumer and IT department spending.\" We couldn't agree more as we continue to view Amazon's Flywheel as a key factor allowing the various components of Amazon's business segments to power and enhance the others.</p><p>We can clearly see this in action when we look at the company's e-commerce component as the platform allows Amazon to offer merchants competitive digital advertisements that targets buyers at the point of sale, thereby powering the rapidly growing ad business. We believe it is this Flywheel, compounded by the company's significant logistical capabilities, that will allow it to continue diversifying into new industries such as health care and potentially disrupt the shipping space as it looks to build out its own air delivery network.</p><p>Lastly, there is of course AWS, which, similar to the dynamic at Salesforce, benefits from the secular shift toward cloud computing. Recall, this is a trend we see as being resilient against a potential economic slowdown as companies, via a shift to the cloud, can convert fixed costs to variable ones and eliminate the need for extensive investments and long lead times associated with building out their own data centers, two strong reasons to continue investing on this front despite any macroeconomic pressures.</p><p>Backing this view, we would also note that the analysts at Pivotal called out that \"as of the end of 3Q18, the company had a $17.8bn revenue backlog associated with AWS for contracts whose terms exceed one year and which were not otherwise reflected in its financial statements, with an average contract life of 3.5 years (implying ~$5bn of revenues to be generated each of the next 3.5 years from sales activities which were already performed). Notably, the $17.8bn figure was up from $16.0bn in 2Q18 and $12.4bn in 1Q18.\"</p><p>Clearly there is plenty of room for continued growth in this high-margin business going forward.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSCJIM-14826532</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSCJIM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V50-KSX1-F00X-J3PX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420086</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><timeReceived>12:26 PM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TheStreet.com, Inc.

And that may well be all that Budget was about.</p><p>The Chancellor painted a rosy picture of the economy (the new reason/excuse he could give you some money) only for the Office for Budget Responsibility  to explain they were, in fact, more than optimistic with their numbers and the real economy is performing less than expected.</p><p>Echoed by many, however, is the fact that the UK economy and markets are likely on the turn, so those of you who have lowered your allocation to the UK market in your pensions and investments may well see this as an opportunity to reverse. </p><p>It is hard, but not inconceivable, to think they will allow a hard Brexit, but currently, by most valuations, the UK market is undervalued. </p><p>If a flicker of commonsense breaks out in UK politics, and they put in a mild shift of work and concentration on Brexit, undoubtedly the overseas investors who have shunned investment in the UK markets will see it as an immediate opportunity to return, bolstering investment returns in the process.</p><p>News that the big tech companies might pay their fair share of taxes was met with a bit of a damp squib as they are hit with a ... wait for it ... 2% tax on \"certain\" UK-generated revenues of search engines, online marketplaces and social-media platforms. </p><p>It then states that it is only if such organisations are profitable and make annual global revenues of at least \u00a3500 million that the tax will apply.</p><p>Poor guys! We are all fully aware how easily they can move profits around to avoid the above so quite how the tax will impact them is beyond me. Remember Facebook alone paid just \u00a35.1 million last year in tax on \u00a3842.4 million of revenue.</p><p>Online retailers have a considerable advantage both from a tax point of view as well as all the obvious business advantages, but the high street needs to survive. A town without shops and bars is just not a town, so taxes need to be fair for both. If shops on the high street were able to pay the same taxes as overseas companies, the country would collapse.</p><p>On the upside the point at which we pay higher-rate tax will be lifted to \u00a350,000 in April 2019, 12 months earlier than expected, and the first \u00a312,500 of earnings will be free of tax.</p><p>That's a boost of \u00a3130 for basic-rate taxpayers and \u00a3860 for higher-rate taxpayers. But just as it's given, it's taken away as alterations to National Insurance could bring the benefit to higher-rate taxpayers down to \u00a3500.</p><p>Drivers have a freeze on tax on fuel and those on Living Wage have an increase from \u00a37.83 per hour to \u00a38.21. Beer cider and spirits have all had their tax frozen but some high-strength drinks will have an increase as will the ongoing charge on tobacco of inflation plus 2%.</p><p>Those stretched by finances are given a bit more space. With interest rates on the rise and debts at records levels, it may not be enough as the Government has increased the time frame for those facing from legal action for debts from six weeks to 60 days and agreed to investigate a no interest loan scheme for the financially stretched.</p><p>If you would like any advice please call, 01872 222422, email <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@wwfp.net\">info@wwfp.net</email> or visit us on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wwfp.net\">www.wwfp.net</url></p><p>Peter McGahan is chief executive of independent financial adviser Worldwide Financial Planning, which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CORNGD-BR15518923</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CORNGD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TNH-YN81-DYY4-31D9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">370506</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"659\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Localworld All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Cornish Guardian</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31918\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 7, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In just a few clicks, users would be able to log in to other apps and sites with their <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>passwords.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The tool was adopted by thousands of other firms, from mom-and-pop publishing companies to high-profile tech outfits like Airbnb and Uber. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Now those outfits could have been exposed to the consequences of an attack on <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>computer systems. On Friday, the company said the account entry keys of at least 50 million <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users had been stolen in the largest hack in the company's 14-year history.</p><p>  But the impact could be significantly bigger since those stolen credentials could have been used to gain access to so many other sites. Companies that allow customers to log in with <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>Connect are scrambling to figure out whether their own user accounts have been compromised.</p><p>  The hack and its fallout underscore the lengths to which <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has cemented itself as the identity of the internet, and what happens when the security systems of one company -- trusted by so many -- fail.</p><p>  ''Just the sheer fact that this exists will magnify the scale of any hack,'' said Jason Polakis, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Chicago.</p><p>  In Europe, where tough new data privacy regulations went into effect in May, the authorities are preparing an investigation of the <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>breach. Ireland's Data Protection Commission, which is responsible for overseeing <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>in the region, said it was gathering information and establishing the scope of its inquiry.</p><p>  Tinder, the dating app, has found no evidence that accounts have been breached, based on the ''limited information <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has provided,'' Justine Sacco, a spokeswoman for Tinder and its parent company, the Match Group, said in a statement. Tinder, as well as other Match Group apps, rely on <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>Connect as a method of logging in.</p><p>  Ms. Sacco added that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>could do more to help by providing a specific list of users hit by the attack.</p><p>  Over the past decade, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has sold outside companies on <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>Connect with a simple proposition: Connect to our platform, and we'll make it faster and easier for people to use your apps.</p><p>  The Connect tool was about achieving ubiquity. Users would be more apt to sign up for new apps and sites if doing so was easier, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>argued. It also brought an added measure of security, since users wouldn't need to create and remember new passwords every time they signed up for a new app.</p><p>  But in July 2017, that measure of security fell short. By exploiting three software bugs, attackers forged ''access tokens,'' digital keys used to gain entry to a user's account. From there, the hackers were able to do anything users could do on their own <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>accounts, including logging in to third-party apps.</p><p>  In a blog post on Tuesday evening, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>said a continuing investigation of the close to 50 million accounts that were compromised ''has so far found no evidence that the attackers accessed any apps using <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>Login.''</p><p>  But there are still questions about an additional 40 million <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>accounts that may have been affected. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>forced those 40 million users to log out and reauthenticate their credentials. It was unclear whether these accounts used <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>to connect to outside apps.</p><p>  Citing ''an abundance of caution,'' <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>said it was building a tool to help outside developers identify users who were affected in the hack by pinpointing potentially compromised accounts on their services.</p><p>  In a conference call with reporters on Friday, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>said it had not assessed the scope of the breach, nor did the company discover who was responsible for the attack.</p><p>  The <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>breach is reminiscent of a catastrophic attack on Yahoo that was disclosed in 2016. Yahoo said attackers had gotten access to the company's code and used it to forge 32 million access tokens like those stolen from <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>  Hackers often target large databases of credentials, which can provide access to other accounts if users created the same password for multiple sites or have logged in to third-party accounts with their <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>account.</p><p>  Since Friday, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has held calls with developers at other companies to explain steps they can take to assess the damage at their own organizations.</p><p>  The security team at Uber, the ride-hailing giant, is logging some users out of their accounts to be cautious, said Melanie Ensign, a spokeswoman for Uber. It is asking them to log back in -- a preventive measure that would invalidate older, stolen access tokens.</p><p>Uber has reviewed its login data from the past year and hasn't found any indications that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>credentials were used improperly.</p><p>  ''But we still have to go through the investigation,'' Ms. Ensign said. ''For those that are most at risk, we have logged them out, so they'll have to log back in to the account.''</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>faces fallout from regulators both at home and abroad. On Friday, Senators Mark Warner of Virginia and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, both Democrats, used the occasion to renew their calls for legislation reining in large tech companies.</p><p>  The European Union's probe will be an early test of its new data-protection law, the General Data Protection Regulation. The law allows <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>to be fined up to 4 percent of its global revenue, though many consider such an outcome unlikely.</p><p>  ''G.D.P.R. was designed to address the big tech giants, who are enormous, have huge resources and do very complicated things with personal data,'' said James Castro-Edwards, the head of the data-protection practice at the London law firm Wedlake Bell.

Organizations risk becoming disoriented and losing their way in a maze of uncertainty as they grapple with complex technology, data proliferation, increased regulation and a debilitating skills shortage. By 2021, the world will be even more heavily digitized. Technology will enable innovative digital business models, and society will be critically dependent on technology to function. </p><p>This new hyperconnected digital era will create an impression of stability, security and reliability. However, it will prove to be an illusion that is shattered by new vulnerabilities, relentless attacks and disruptive cyber threats. The race to develop the next generation of super-intelligent machines will be in full swing, and technology will be intertwined with everyday life. Coupled with heightened global mistrust and rising geopolitical tensions, this will lead to a cyber threat that is relentless, targeted and disruptive. The operating environment for business will become increasingly volatile. Recent research from Information Security Forum revealed significant threats on the horizon for businesses in today's always-on, interconnected world. Let's take a quick look at these threats and what they mean for your organization:Threat #1: Digital Connectivity Exposes Hidden DangersVast webs of intelligent devices, combined with increased speeds, automation and digitization will create possibilities for businesses and consumers that were previously out of reach. The internet of things (IoT) will continue to develop at an astonishing rate, with sensors and cameras embedded into a range of devices across critical infrastructure. The resulting nexus of complex digital connectivity will prove to be a weakness as modern life becomes entirely dependent on connected technologies, amplifying existing dangers and creating new ones. 5G Technologies Broaden Attack Surfaces The emergence of the fifth generation of mobile networks and technologies (5G) will provide a game-changing platform for businesses and consumers alike. Colossal speeds, minimal latency and a range of newly available radio frequencies will connect previously unconnected devices, accelerate processes and change entire operating models - but with these changes comes a broader attack surface, as millions of telecommunication masts are built with varying levels of security. As organizations become heavily reliant on 5G to operate, new attack vectors will exploit weaknesses in this emerging technology. Manipulated Machine Learning Sows Confusion Machine learning, and neural networks in particular, will underpin processes such as image recognition, pricing analysis and logistics planning. As businesses become reliant upon machine learning and humans are taken out of the knowledge loop, machine learning will become a prime target for attackers. Confusion, obfuscation and deception will be used by attackers to manipulate these systems, either for financial gain or to cause as much damage and disruption as possible. Parasitic Malware Feasts on Critical Infrastructure Parasitic malware is a particular strain of malware designed to steal processing power, traditionally from computers and mobile devices. However, attackers will turn their attention to the vast interconnectivity and power consumption of industrial control systems (ICS), IoT devices and other critical infrastructure, which offer an enticing environment for this malware to thrive. All organizations will be threatened as this form of malware sucks the life out of systems, degrading performance and potentially shutting down critical services.Threat #2: Digital Cold War Engulfs BusinessBy 2021 a digital cold war will unfold, causing significant damage to business. The race to develop strategically important, next-generation technologies will provoke a period of intense, nation state-backed espionage - intellectual property (IP) will be targeted as the battle for economic and military dominance rages on. Cloud services will become a prime target for sabotage by those seeking to cause disruption to society and business. Drones will become both the weapon and target of choice as attackers turn their attention skyward. State-Backed Espionage Targets Next-Gen Tech A new wave of nation state-backed espionage will hit businesses as the battle for technological and economic supremacy intensifies. The target: the next generation of technology. History teaches us that at times of great technological change, targeted industrial espionage follows. Organizations developing technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, robotics and quantum computing, will find their IP systematically targeted by nation state-backed actors. Sabotaged Cloud Services Freeze Operations Popular cloud providers will have further consolidated their market share - organizations will be heavily, if not totally, dependent on cloud providers to operate. Attackers will aim to sabotage cloud services, causing disruption to critical national infrastructure (CNI), crippling supply chains and compromising vast quantities of data. Organizations and supply chains that are reliant on cloud services will become collateral damage when cloud services go down for extended periods of time. Drones Become Both Predator and Prey Drones will become predators controlled by malicious actors to carry out more targeted attacks on business. Developments in drone technologies, combined with the relaxation of aviation regulations, will amplify attackers' capabilities as the threat landscape takes to the skies. Conversely, drones used for commercial benefit will be preyed upon, hijacked and spoofed, with organizations facing disruption and loss of sensitive data.Threat #3: Digital Competitors Rip Up The RulebookCompeting in the digital marketplace will become increasingly difficult as businesses develop new strategies that challenge existing regulatory frameworks and social norms, enabling threats to grow in speed and precision. Vulnerabilities in software and applications will be frequently disclosed online with ever-decreasing time to fix them. Organizations will struggle when one or more of the big tech giants are broken up, plunging those reliant on their products and services into disarray. Organizations will rush to undertake overly ambitious digital transformations in a bid to stay relevant, leaving them less resilient and more vulnerable than ever. Digital Vigilantes Weaponize Vulnerability Disclosure Ethical vulnerability disclosure will descend into digital vigilantism. Attackers will weaponize vulnerability disclosure to undercut organizations, destroy corporate reputations or even manipulate stock prices. Organizations will find their resources drained as digital vigilantes reduce the timelines to fix vulnerabilities and apply patches, seriously threatening operations, reputations and endangering customers. Big Tech Break Up Fractures Business Models Calls for the breakup of big technology giants will reach their peak by 2021. By then, at least one of them will be broken up, significantly disrupting the availability of the products and services they provide to dependent organizations. From email to search engines, advertising, logistics and delivery, the entire operating environment will change. Malicious actors will also prey upon vulnerable, transitioning organizations. Rushed Digital Transformations Destroy Trust The demand for organizations to remain relevant in a technology-centric world will drive them to undertake rushed digital transformations. Organizations will deploy technologies such as blockchain, AI and robotics, expecting them to seamlessly integrate with aging systems. Organizations will be faced with significant disruption to services, as well as compromised data when digital transformations go wrong.Preparation Must Begin NowInformation security professionals are facing increasingly complex threats \u2014 some new, others familiar, but evolving. Their primary challenge remains unchanged: to help their organizations navigate mazes of uncertainty where, at any moment, they could turn a corner and encounter information security threats with severe business impact. In the face of mounting global threats, organizations must make methodical and extensive commitments to ensure practical plans are in place to adapt to major changes in the near future. Employees at all levels of the organization will need to be involved, from board members to managers in nontechnical roles. The three themes listed above could impact businesses operating in cyberspace at breakneck speeds, particularly as the use of connected devices spreads. Many organizations will struggle to cope as the pace of change intensifies. These threats should stay on the radar of every organization, both small and large, even if they seem distant. The future arrives suddenly, especially when you aren't prepared. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-CCOI1297141555416347879251761300219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CCOI-129714</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWX-60R1-F03R-N4YW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1538\"/><timeReceived>12:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Corporate Compliance Insights</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Risk</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>automation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Featured</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>cyber risk</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>information security</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>machine learning</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>artificial intelligence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>internet of things</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DMWD</classCode><className>MACHINE LEARNING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;

Tech of the Town    2020 WATCH: MICROSOFT WARNS OF FOREIGN ATTACKS ON U.S. ELECTION \u2014 Tech companies continue to be the bearers of bad news about 2020 election interference. In the most expansive public warning to date about adversaries\u2019 attempts to undermine the presidential race, Microsoft revealed Thursday that Russian, Chinese and Iranian hackers are orchestrating cyberattacks against the campaigns of both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, as well as other organizations involved in the election, POLITICO\u2019s cybersecurity reporter Tim Starks writes .   \u2014 The announcement came the week after Facebook  said it had removed a cluster of fake accounts trying to meddle with U.S. politics \u2014 accounts associated with the Russian Internet Research Agency, the group that used social media to rock the 2016 race.   FIRST IN MT : TECH WORLD PUSHES TO CLEAN UP ITS CODING  \u2014 Today marks the launch of an industry-wide push to eliminate racially insensitive terminology in coding that underlies information and communications tech. The Information Technology Industry Council \u2014 a tech trade group that counts Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and other leading tech and telecom giants as members \u2014 and INCITS, an industry standards-setting organization affiliated with ITI that includes many of the same members, are this morning announcing an effort to ban offensive, derogatory language often used in tech specifications.   \u2014 For example: Vocabulary like \u201cmaster\u201d and \u201cslave\u201d have been used in programming to describe technical relationships where one process or device controls another, the groups told MT. Terms like \u201cwhitelist\u201d and \u201cblacklist\u201d have also been used frequently to indicate actions and features that may or may not be permitted, the groups said. INCITS is directing members to update and replace such references in their coding and also calling on the American National Standards Institute to adopt these changes.   \u2014 Following NIST\u2019s lead: The new initiative comes in the wake of the National Institute of Standards and Technology deciding it would stop using these harmful terms with racist connotations. NIST made the call in June , as protests over the killing of George Floyd by Minnesota police swept the country.   \u2014 \u201cThe words we use to describe technology send messages that can bring people together or isolate and divide them ,\u201d said Intel\u2019s senior director of standards policy, Phil Wennblom, who is leading an INCITS working group on inclusive terminology. \u201cThe technology industry, led by INCITS, should take immediate steps to replace common and potentially offensive terms in industry standards with inclusive alternatives.\u201d     Competition Corner    WARREN WEIGHS IN ON GOOGLE \u2014 Sen. Elizabeth Warren called on the Justice Department to break-up Google in a series of tweets Thursday, saying \u201cthere\u2019s no question that DOJ should\u2019ve done something about Google\u2019s consolidation long ago.\u201d The former Democratic presidential candidate has long pushed for greater antitrust enforcement, particularly for major tech players. \u201cThe case against Google is clear. We can\u2019t let a desperate and reckless Attorney General undermine @TheJusticeDept\u2019s case. But we also can\u2019t let Big Tech\u2019s army of lawyers, lobbyists, &amp; consultants use Barr as an excuse to wriggle out of the law,\u201d she wrote.   \u2014  Google probe : The attorneys general of 48 states plus D.C. and Puerto Rico have been looking into Google since last September. The Justice Department, meanwhile, has spent 15 months zeroing in on the tech giant\u2019s conduct in the advertising and search markets. The New York Times reported earlier this month that Attorney General Bill Barr overruled staff attorneys who want more time to prepare a case against Google. And my colleague Leah Nylen highlighted how the DOJ and some state attorneys general are split over whether they should move forward with a suit before Election Day.   \u2014 Meanwhile, progressive advocacy groups are also pressing state attorneys general  to bring an antitrust suit against Google now , as Leah reports in a dispatch this morning. \u201cThe time for this enforcement action to proceed is now. In fact, it was long before now,\u201d the groups said in a letter to the National Association of State Attorneys General. \u201cAs days, weeks, months, and years, continue to pass, more and more companies go out of business as Google\u2019s dominance becomes more and more deeply entrenched.\u201d          On the Hill    SPEAKING OF GOOGLE \u2014 As the antitrust fight against Google looms, Congress is also taking a scalpel to the search giant. The Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee on Thursday announced witnesses for its Sept. 15 hearing that will probe whether Google has harmed competition in online advertising.   \u2014 This should be fun: Up first is Google\u2019s president of global partnerships and corporate development, Don Harrison, who oversees what companies and tech Google might want to invest in. That grilling will be followed by testimony from antitrust lawyer David Dinielli of the Omidyar Network, a foundation funded by eBay\u2019s co-founder that has advocated for U.S. antitrust cases against Google; Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel of NetChoice, which supports and counts Google as a member; and Adam Heimlich, CEO of Chalice Custom Algorithms, a firm that helps brands customize their ad strategy so they don\u2019t appear on Google.   OTHER FIREWORKS TO WATCH NEXT WEEK  \u2014 House Energy and Commerce Democrats aren\u2019t hiding their feelings in titling the newly announced telecom subcommittee oversight hearing of the Federal Communications Commission, set to happen virtually next Thursday: \u201cTrump FCC: Four Years of Lost Opportunities.\u201d   \u2014 Reps. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) and Mike Doyle (D-Pa.), who head the full and subcommittee respectively, issued a statement arguing the Republican-led agency has \u201cexacerbated the digital divide\u201d by not tackling broadband pricing and hasn\u2019t stepped up to properly tackle the pandemic. FCC chief Ajit Pai and his GOP colleagues would likely challenge these characterizations given their pride in a deregulatory agenda that they maintain has boosted U.S. broadband rollouts and kept Americans connected during Covid-19.   \u2014 And watch the O\u2019Rielly factor: Thursday\u2019s hearing will present an opportunity for lawmakers to question FCC commissioners about Trump\u2019s abrupt cancellation of the renomination of GOP veteran Mike O\u2019Rielly, who\u2019ll have to leave the commission later this year unless Trump reconsiders. The move followed O\u2019Rielly\u2019s critique of government regulation of social media, which some saw as a shot at Trump\u2019s attempts to crack down on tech companies like Twitter. The commissioner has said very little in public since his nomination was killed.   BLACKBURN BULLISH ON NEW SECTION 230 BILL \u2014 Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) says she\u2019s confident her new bill targeting the tech industry\u2019s liability shield will get taken up for consideration \u2014 despite it already drawing backlash from industry groups and at least one prominent Senate Democrat. Blackburn partnered with Senate Commerce Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to introduce on Wednesday the Online Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Act, S. 4534 (116) , legislation to narrow the protections shielding companies from lawsuits for taking down user-generated posts.   \u2014 Dueling assessments: \u201cWe\u2019re on the right track and I fully expect that we\u2019ll get a markup,\u201d Blackburn said in an interview, arguing the bill would provide \u201caccountability for bias in the virtual space.\u201d But Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who co-wrote the legal shield as a House member in the 1990s, torched the new legislation in a statement to MT, calling it \u201cyet another short-sighted bill to address the imaginary problem of anti-conservative bias.\u201d Wyden said that the bill would \u201cforce companies to host more misinformation, lies and slime.\u201d   \u2014 Here comes the \u2018but\u2019: Senate Commerce on Thursday didn't list either this latest bill targeting Section 230 nor a separate measure aimed at amending the law from Sens. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and John Thune (R-S.D.) \u2014 the PACT Act, S.4066 (116 ) \u2014 for consideration at their Sept. 16 markup.

ICYMI: \u201cTwitter said Thursday it will label or remove posts that prematurely declare victory in the upcoming U.S. election,\u201d Cristiano reports , \u201cmaking it the latest social media company to set out a plan for a prolonged vote count and a president who appears primed to dispute results if he does not win.\u201d     A message from Ericsson:    The deployment of reliable, secure 5G networks will provide the foundation for American economic growth. But that growth requires the right investments and policy decisions, including allocating more mid-band spectrum, expediting zoning and permitting, and creating a skilled workforce of 5G installers.

The rationale is that, 'Facial recognition technologies have been criticized for exhibiting built-in racial and ethnic biases and misidentifying African Americans and other people of color,' the June 11 issue of NBC News's Byers Market newsletter reported[1]. In short, Big Tech companies are claiming their own products can be potentially racist or used for racist purposes, and as a result are not allowing police to use them going forward.IBM CEO Arvind Krishna sent an open letter[2] to Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sen. </p><p>Kamala Harris (D-CA), Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA), Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) on June 8 about IBM's similar decision to withhold technology from police. Krishna implied that police were using such technology with nefarious aims: 'IBM no longer offers general purpose IBM facial recognition or analysis software. IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and Principles of Trust and Transparency.' Verge writer Jay Peters observed[3] that facial recognition technology, 'has been shown to suffer from bias along lines of age, race, and ethnicity, which can make the tools unreliable for law enforcement and security and ripe for potential civil rights abuses.'Amazon followed BLM's lead and declared the company will implement a 'one-year moratorium on police use of Rekognition' in a June 10 blog post[4]. This one year moratorium would end after the 2020 election.'We're implementing a one-year moratorium on police use of Amazon's facial recognition technology,' Amazon's blog post explained[5]. That said, Amazon will allow some organizations to continue using their services in order 'to help rescue human trafficking victims and reunite missing children with their families.'Amazon clarified that this is a political matter without using President Donald Trump's name a single time: 'We've advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, and in recent days, Congress appears ready to take on this challenge. We hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested.' Two-hundred and fifty Microsoft employees have called upon their CEO via a letter to cancel police contracts and support defunding Seattle police, Protocol reported.[6]OneZero[7] reportedly obtained a copy of the letter sent by Microsoft employees. The letter summarized that this is a case of activists rising up and attempting to force the hand of company leadership: 'The email to the Microsoft executives includes a list of requests, including increased leniency for Microsoft workers in performance reviews due to the coronavirus pandemic and protests; the company formally condemning the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and flashbangs; increasing Microsoft's employee donation matches; the cancellation of contracts with SPD and other law enforcement agencies; support for defunding the SPD; signing a petition for the resignation of Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan; and support for a list of demands from BLM Seattle.' Microsoft has since caved and also refused service to the police. 'Microsoft joined the list of tech giants who've decided to limit the use of its facial-recognition systems, announcing that it will not sell the controversial technology to police departments until there is a federal law regulating the technology,' The Washington Post[8] reported on the afternoon of June 11.Microsoft president Brad Smith proclaimed his company's commitment to social justice in an interview during a Post Live event[9]: 'We've decided that we will not sell facial recognition technology to police departments in the United States until we have a national law in place grounded in human rights that will govern this technology.' He later added,'The bottom line for us is to protect the human rights of people as this technology is deployed.'

The rationale is that, 'Facial recognition technologies have been criticized for exhibiting built-in racial and ethnic biases and misidentifying African Americans and other people of color,' the June 11 issue of NBC News's Byers Market newsletter reported[1]. In short, Big Tech companies are claiming their own products can be potentially racist or used for racist purposes, and as a result are not allowing police to use them going forward.IBM CEO Arvind Krishna sent an open letter[2] to Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sen. </p><p>Kamala Harris (D-CA), Rep. Karen Bass (D-CA), Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) on June 8 about IBM's similar decision to withhold technology from police. Krishna implied that police were using such technology with nefarious aims: 'IBM no longer offers general purpose IBM facial recognition or analysis software. IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and Principles of Trust and Transparency.' Verge writer Jay Peters observed[3] that facial recognition technology, 'has been shown to suffer from bias along lines of age, race, and ethnicity, which can make the tools unreliable for law enforcement and security and ripe for potential civil rights abuses.'Amazon followed BLM's lead and declared the company will implement a 'one-year moratorium on police use of Rekognition' in a June 10 blog post[4]. This one year moratorium would end after the 2020 election.'We're implementing a one-year moratorium on police use of Amazon's facial recognition technology,' Amazon's blog post explained[5]. That said, Amazon will allow some organizations to continue using their services in order 'to help rescue human trafficking victims and reunite missing children with their families.'Amazon clarified that this is a political matter without using President Donald Trump's name a single time: 'We've advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, and in recent days, Congress appears ready to take on this challenge. We hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested.' Two-hundred and fifty Microsoft employees have called upon their CEO via a letter to cancel police contracts and support defunding Seattle police, Protocol reported.[6]OneZero[7] reportedly obtained a copy of the letter sent by Microsoft employees. The letter summarized that this is a case of activists rising up and attempting to force the hand of company leadership: 'The email to the Microsoft executives includes a list of requests, including increased leniency for Microsoft workers in performance reviews due to the coronavirus pandemic and protests; the company formally condemning the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and flashbangs; increasing Microsoft's employee donation matches; the cancellation of contracts with SPD and other law enforcement agencies; support for defunding the SPD; signing a petition for the resignation of Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan; and support for a list of demands from BLM Seattle.' Microsoft has since caved and also refused service to the police. 'Microsoft joined the list of tech giants who've decided to limit the use of its facial-recognition systems, announcing that it will not sell the controversial technology to police departments until there is a federal law regulating the technology,' The Washington Post[8] reported on the afternoon of June 11.Microsoft president Brad Smith proclaimed his company's commitment to social justice in an interview during a Post Live event[9]: 'We've decided that we will not sell facial recognition technology to police departments in the United States until we have a national law in place grounded in human rights that will govern this technology.' He later added,'The bottom line for us is to protect the human rights of people as this technology is deployed.'

Actually, it's very remarkable but well that hold up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CAVUTO:  No, I hear you, I hear you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CASONE:  That is the question.  Neil Cavuto, thank you so much and --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CAVUTO:  You got it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CASONE:  Neil was just telling you.  Again, we are waiting to hear from  Senate leaders to talk more about what is happening with the fate of health  care, I mean reform at this point, looks really uncertain and particular at  this hour.</p><p> The Senate's effort for clean and repeal of Obamacare really is failing so  further receive enough support from Senate Republic and some big  (INAUDIBLE), you know him well.</p><p> Neil is just talking about the submarkets, you know, Dow is down about 71  points right now.  You know, we started the session with better numbers  than this.  So obviously investors are waiting to see, the more you delay  health care, the more you delay tax reform investors are going to, at some  point, maybe sooner rather than later say OK as enough of this.  But for  now, the market is not, we're holding on but the Dow is down 72.</p><p> Well, hello everybody I am Cheryl Casone.  And I'm in for Trish Regan  today.  I would like to welcome you to The Intelligence Report.  Boy, there  is a lot going on.  A source close to Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell has just told Fox News the Senator plans to go forward with a  vote to repeal Obamacare first even if that vote fails.</p><p> Right now, it appears McConnell is well short of the votes he needs to  debate, even debate the repeal bill after three Republican senators said  that they're not -- they are going to vote no.  So we're going to talk  about what is next for healthcare.  We are all over that story.  And again,  we're waiting for Mitch McConnell.</p><p> Also this today, we're watching President Trump getting back to his America  first agenda.  The administration just unveiling a new NAFTA plan aimed at  shrinking our trade deficit with Canada and with Mexico but how exactly is  this going to happen?  How is this going to work?  We've got the Intel for  you on that.</p><p> But first I want to go back to Washington with Adam Shapiro.  I think  boondoggle at this point might be the word in my head Adam, with regards to  what's going on with McConnell in the Senate right now.</p><p> ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it certainly raises the  question about how does leadership control its members.  I mean, you've got  the three Senators.  Let's show you the baseball cards of threes who  actually killed the effort to repeal.  You have Susan Collins of Maine.   She would have been a no vote, not only to debate but also on repeal.  She  did that in 2015.  But you also have Lisa Murkowski from Alaska.  She  wouldn't even vote to proceed to debate, so she is a no.  And then of  course there's Shelley Moore Capito from West Virginia, she was a no.  That  was all it took but as you said there's an effort to perhaps maneuver this  into a vote, just put everyone on the record and then move on.</p><p> It was President Trump though, who said, look, the Republicans are not  going to own this.  This is going to be on the Democrats.  Here is what he  said just about an hour ago.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES:  Let Obamacare fail, it will be a  lot easier.  And I think we're probably in that position where we'll just  let Obamacare fail.  We're not going to own it.  I'm not going to own it.   I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it.  We'll let  Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us and they're  going to say how do we fix it, how do we fix it or how do we come up with a  new plan.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAPIRO:  Well, the Democrats say they're open to working with Republicans  on a fix but it can't include a repeal.  So here is what Chuck Schumer, the  minority leader said just moments ago.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHUCK SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  Republicans propose surgery.  The  operation was a failure.  Now Republicans are proposing a second surgery  that will surely kill the patient.  Medicine is needed, bipartisan  medicine.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHAPIRO:  So there seems to be agreement that the Affordable Care Act,  Obamacare is not working, it needs to be fixed but getting these two sides  together to fix it, good luck.  Cheryl, back to you.</p><p> CASONE:  Well, luck is really needed especially if you're Mitch McConnell  right now.  And we're waiting to hear from him Adam.  Thank you for all the  details on that.</p><p> You know, let's bring in for more analysis on all of this Republican  Strategist, Ashley Hayek, Communications Director for Democracy in America  -- for America.  Excuse me, Neil Sroka and the Senior Writer at The Weekly  Standard, John McCormack is here as well.</p><p> Guys, thank you so much for your time.  So I mean this is, John, this is  pretty wild what we're seeing going on.  I mean, you talked about draining  the swamp but Mitch McConnell seems to be losing more and more support  every day.  Is what we're going to see happen with the President just said  just let it fail, let Obamacare fail, let it be done?</p><p> JOHN MCCORMACK, SENIOR WRITER OF THE WEEKLY STANDARD:  You know, that's  going to be really tough because what people seem to forget is that  Obamacare is basically now synonymous with the individual insurance market.   Remember, like your plan, you keep your plan, well that wasn't true.  So  people who are on the individual market, almost everyone in there have been  affected by these very costly, very burdensome regulations.  And, you know,  to see Obamacare kind of go on and on to death spiral.</p><p> Listen, if totally true that this is being caused by bad legislation's  passed by Democrats, but I think the voters are going to expect Republicans  to get their act together, to actually fix the problem.  And so I don't  think they can really move on -- they might want to move on from healthcare  but healthcare is not going to move on from them.</p><p> CASONE:  Well, I mean, you know, this was something, Ashley, that the  President wanted to see first.  Let's do health care then we move to tax  reform.  Obviously, you know, in this tax reform in jeopardy, that is one  question here but Ashley, at the same time, can they get anything done with  regards to reform?  If they can't even repeal it, does that mean that we  have nothing, Ashley, on the table?</p><p> ASHLEY HAYEK, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Well, here is the problem, first and  foremost, is the self-proclaimed conservatives.  When premiums go up, they  are going to cause a lot of things but these Republicans are not going to  be called conservatives.  And the next item absolutely tax reform.  And if  they can't get tax reform done, the base is going to lose.  They're going  to lose their stuff.</p><p> And one thing that dictates all of this is the market, the market, 17  percent, the market bought into -- in the economy and the market bought  into the idea that our economy will do better with the repeal of Obamacare,  cutting back on taxes.  And when we're not able to repeal Obamacare, you're  going to see effects long term.  And it will come down to the seats in  reelections.</p><p> CASONE:  Neil, what do you make of the Republicans basically at this point,  all signs reporting to failure to be able to do anything about Obamacare.   We're not even talking Trumpcare, we're talking nothing, no movement, even  if the repeal doesn't go anywhere, what does it point --</p><p> NEIL SROKA, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR OF DEMOCRACY FOR AMERICA:  I think what  you're seeing right now is that Republicans are fundamentally unable to  govern.  They were able to run for eight years on something and now they  can't even pull that together.  The fact to the matter is, is reason why  they can't vote to end Obamacare is because Obamacare is increasingly  popular with the American people.  You look at West Virginia and Alaska,  two of the states that just killed this repeal effort, even though Donald  Trump won handily in both of those states, both of those senators came out  of this repeal bill because in those states, especially the Medicaid  expansion portions of Obamacare are incredibly popular and needed.</p><p> CASONE:  John, you cover Washington, you know, as journalist, I mean, I'm  wondering if this is kind of, if politics as usual seems to be winning in  all of this.  And the reason I say that is because, you know, when  President Trump came into office there was this feeling that you know, he  was elected on wave of populism.  People wanted to put the country first,  repeal Obamacare, replace it, et cetera, get tax reform done.  It seems to  me that the politics seems to be overtaking policy in all of this today.</p><p> MCCORMACK:  Well, I think there is something to that, you know, there is a  lot of bias towards the status quo.  Remember, Democrats passed this bill  with 60 votes in the Senate, and overwhelmingly majority in the House and  President who won by very large margin.  Republicans come in with much  smaller majority and so it's a lot tougher to reverse this, once it's  already in effect.</p><p> And Republicans also, you got to remember, you know, the President didn't  run on the specific repeal and replace agenda, the House of Representatives  and the senators, they also didn't have really specific idea in mind what  they could come up with.  And so you basically have both conservatives and  moderates unhappy as well as all these procedural roadblocks.  You know,  there be special rules they have to abide by.  President Trump was right  when he said that it's much more difficult to pass this bill with these  special rules rather than getting 60 votes as Democrats did back in 2009  and 2010.</p><p> SROKA:  No.</p><p> CASONE:  Go ahead, Neil.</p><p> SROKA:  I'm sorry.  Donald Trump right now is an impotent as leader of the  Republican Party if he can't even get Republicans on board to repeal and  replace Obamacare, something that Republicans have been running on close to  a decade.  The reality is, is Republicans care far more about tax cuts for  millionaires and billionaires than they do about the lives of American  people.  And that's ultimately why they don't want to do anything on  Obamacare.</p><p> CASONE:  You know, Neil, I got to push back on that.  You can never  underestimate the power of Donald Trump.  I mean he was underestimated as  candidate.</p><p> SROKA:  Agreed.</p><p> CASONE:  He is -- he's when it comes to world politics or what's happening  here at home.  That's the thing, Ashley.  You know, this President, we know  he's going to barnstorm America, he has going to all across this country to  fight for tax reform.  Something many believe at least on Wall Street, he  should have done first.  But, you know, let's spilt milk at this point,  Ashley.  But he's going to go out and take it to the people for tax reform.   Is that his win, not health care?</p><p> HAYEK:  Tax reform is completely separate from healthcare.  I think he has  a huge opportunity here in that it's a fresh plate.  And he also has the  opportunity to expand tax credits that's going to help the middle and  working class.  It can help economic growth and is going to help small  businesses grow.  And that's going to ultimately help our economy.</p><p> SROKA:  There's a reason --</p><p> HAYEK:  They're going back to my initial point, is that yes, these senators  had seven years to come up with a new plan.  From day one President Trump  has said we have to repeal Obamacare.  And what the senators especially  those so self-proclaimed conservative senators have done is absolutely  nothing.  And it is on their hands.  They should have had something since  they have had seven years to complain about it.</p><p> CASONE:  Guys we're out of time but I think, you know, bipartisan way we  can all agree that this is pretty much a mess.  And that's a mess that the  blame does fall, you got to say on the Republicans.</p><p> And again, we're waiting for Mitch McConnell.  We'll see what he has to say  about all of this.  Maybe he can --he's got a trick up his he sleeve, we  don't know yet.  But at this point things aren't looking real good for  this.  Ashley, Neil, John, really appreciate your time today.</p><p> HAYEK:  Thank you.</p><p> MCCORMACK:  Thanks.</p><p> CASONE:  All right.  Well, joining me now with his thoughts on health care,  former Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary, and Former President of  Lilly USA, Alex Azar.  Alex, what do you make of what you're seeing in  Washington?  It seems to be a mess from those of us watching from the  sidelines right now?</p><p> ALEX AZAR, FORMER U.S. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPUTY SECRETARY:  Well,  it's an absolute mess, you're right.  I'm astonished to that.  It does  appear that the Republican House and Senate will not pass anything even  with the label repeal of Obamacare on it.  That's going to be a tough road  in 2018 as they go back to their core voters having to explain that.  Bit I  think McConnell may now still call a vote on straight repeal just as matter  of accountability with members of his caucus.</p><p> CASONE:  Sure.</p><p> AZAR:  Just make them put it on record, so it's not cost-free.  But I  really think that there is not going to be legislative action at this  point.</p><p> CASONE:  OK -- </p><p> AZAR:  I mean, the hot potato has landed in Secretary Tom Price's lap.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes, well, and that's -- here is the thing.  I'm curious, what can  Tom Price do?  That is the question, if he is going to be left with  Obamacare which the President and which many analysts say is failing, will  fail, what can Price do so that you don't have millions of Americans left  with nothing, sick Americans?  That's the concern I think from a human  perspective in all of this?</p><p> AZAR:  So let's separate the two programs.  On the Medicaid side you have  got Seema Verma running CMS who's one of the leaders in reinventing  Medicaid.  I think you see increasing state flexibility change, devolution  to states there on Medicaid.</p><p> On the individual insurance market side there's going to be a debate in the  administration right now.  The President said let it fail I don't know  fully what that means.  There -- this program is failing because of  inherently how the rate structure and the risk pooling was set up in it.   So it's going to keep going down.  The question is, does the administration  actually pull the plug on to patient or they put it in hospice and try to  make it a little better?  There are things the secretary can do to actually  save Obamacare from many of the very mistakes that Obama himself is and his  administration imposed on the program.</p><p> CASONE:  Would he -- we don't have a lot of time, but would he have the  power to deal with lawsuits?  And I say that because tort reform is  something that so many were screaming about back in 2008 when this, when  Obamacare was passed without half of Congress reading it, tort reform and  maybe state to state competition for insurance companies.  If you're going  to have people in states with no exchanges, no options, is that something  that Price can do from a legal perspective?  I honestly don't know?</p><p> AZAR:  I think very little the secretary can do in terms of tort reform  actually lead those efforts for President Bush in his administration.  Very  little the President can do unilaterally without legislation there.  And  also interstate sale of insurance also, I think little the secretary can do  but what he can do is grant waivers to states to create much more  flexibility in his exchanges.  I would do a top to bottom comprehensive  rewrite of the regulations of Obamacare, imposing as much free market,  localized flexibility as humanly possible.  Even then the rate structure is  just broken.  And that's in the statute and that's not -- that he can't  fix.</p><p> CASONE:  Alex, I agree with you 100 percent.  It's something I couldn't  believe it wasn't in the first bill and here we are today with this mess  that is these exchanges that are just falling apart.  Alex, thank you very  much.</p><p> AZAR:  Great, thank you.</p><p> CASONE:  Appreciate it.</p><p> Well, you know, the President has got a few things on the agenda.  He is  getting back to his America first agenda.  He has outlined a new plan for  renegotiating NAFTA.  That was -- remember, one of his biggest campaign  promises.  But can he do it?  We're going to talk about the legality of  that, coming up next.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  Are we going to allow other countries to break the rules, steal our  jobs and drain our wealth, and it has been drained, it has been drained.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CASONE:  Well, the White House unveiling its plan to update the decade old  NAFTA deal following through on one of President Trump's biggest campaign  promise.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  No longer are we going to allow other countries to break the rules,  steal our jobs and drain our wealth.  And it has been drained.  It has been  drained.</p><p> We're going to end up having a level playing field.  I don't want to say  anymore than a level but if the playing field we're slanted like a little  bit toward us I would accept that also, OK?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  OK, I want (INAUDIBLE) right now.  We want to take you live right  now to Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.  He is speaking.  Let's listen in.</p><p> RAND PAUL, (R) SENATOR, KENTUCKY:  You saw what happened around here six  years ago with the committee and that never worked up.  There have been  many ideas for how we get more people in our country insurance.  For  example, 27 million people don't have insurance right now under Obamacare.   The estimates are that 50 percent of those 27 million don't get it because  it's too expensive.  It's too expensive because of the Obamacare  regulations.  The death spiral of Obamacare is regulations, make insurance  expensive and then you say oh, but you can get it after you're sick.  That  is the real problem.  That has the whole problem we have.  It's the adverse  selection and the death spiral.  That's what we need to fix.  We don't have  enough votes to repeal all of that.  So we're going to have to move  forward.  And I'm favor in moving forward with partial repeal and  continuing to work on trying to get rid of the rest of the bad elements of  that Obamacare that have driven prices up.</p><p> Thanks, guys.</p><p> (OFF-MIC)</p><p> PAUL:  No, I'm for a vote that succeeds.  And I think those Republicans who  promised to repeal Obamacare ought to vote the same way they voted in 2015.   If you're not willing to vote the same way you voted in 2015, then you need  to go back home, you need to explain to Republicans why you're no longer  for repealing Obamacare.  Thanks.</p><p> CASONE:  OK.  So what he is saying basically, and this is what we learned  earlier today is that Senator Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell does intend to hold a vote to proceed on straight repeal.  OK,  that's the questions that the reporters were asking of Senator Rand Paul.   And he's -- that's what he has wanted entire time.  He has been on Fox  Business.  He says on air saying, repeal.  That is that, that is what he  promised his constituency.</p><p> He also says, remember back in 2015, there was a move by the Senate to try  and at least repeal some parts of Obamacare, do repeal President Barack  Obama at the time though of course vetoed that.  So it was kind of a  symbolic move if you will by the Republicans.</p><p> Senators at the time, he is saying, hey, if the way that you voted in 2015  is how you feel, that's how you vote now.  But remember, Senator Susan  Collins, Senator Lisa Murkowski, they are saying no.  They are not going to  vote for repeal.  They don't want to leave the American public with  nothing.  Many say though you repeal it, you give it couple of years,  Senator Rand Paul saying this is a death spiral.  The regulation,  regulatory burdens of Obamacare which many analysts agree with is  unacceptable for the American people.</p><p> I do want to bring in right now Nick Adams.  He is the Founder and  Executive Director of the Foundation for Liberty and American Greatness.   You know, here's the thing, Nick.  We're fighting back and forth about what  to do and it comes down to politics versus policy.  What we're seeing play  out right now with these U.S. senators, the Republican Party is to me,  politics as the midterms are approaching.  What see you about that?</p><p> NICK ADAMS, FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE FOUNDATION FOR LIBERTY  AND AMERICAN GREATNESS:  Cheryl, look, you summed it up very well.  It's  definitely is a battle between politics and policy.  There is absolutely no  reason that the Republicans shouldn't be able to pass this.  This is what  they ran on.  This is what they owe President Trump.  And I think it's  incredibly disappointing that we have so many Republicans that are just not  coming to the table and not getting this done.  And as a result I think  this will have ramifications for future elections if they're not able to  get together and do this.</p><p> CASONE:  Well, that's why Senator Paul, not just now but earlier on Fox  Business last week actually, had said, look, you know, I promised repeal.   I'm not go back to my constituents if I'm not supporting repeal.  The  problem is McConnell is going to hold this vote.  It's going to fail.  So  you're going to have the political backlash on the heads of these senators.</p><p> It would seem to me that at this point we're going to have nothing versus  something.  Now, politically that hurts the Republicans, yes?</p><p> ADAMS:  Yes, that's right.  And it's just amazing that it has come to this,  Cheryl.  I mean, they have had so long.  They have had so much time.   They've had such opportunity to prepare for this.  And here we are.  We  went through this earlier this year.  We're at this point again.  And it's  just tragic to see the Republicans perpetually snatch defeat from the jaws  of victory.  And I think the American people have every right to be  incredibly disappointed by the display that the Republicans are putting on.</p><p> They're showing themselves to be Lily Livered.  They're showing themselves  to have jellyfish backs and really President Trump has got to be absolutely  wringing his hands here because he's got some Republicans that were elected  really on back of his popularity that are just not doing the right thing.</p><p> CASONE:  You know, and it's true, and I think that the President is making  it very clear that it is on the shoulders of those they are failing to  support Republican efforts to repeal, replace or just repeal Obamacare.</p><p> Before I let you go, obviously, we are a business network.  And investors  have been -- these markets have been hitting record after record.  Twenty- five records I think now for the Dow.  I might be wrong.  I men, that is an  incredible streak for these markets.  But the fear now, that ends when we  finally see that the Trump agenda is in trouble.  At what point do you  think we hit that marker, Nick?</p><p> ADAMS:  Well, look, Cheryl, I wouldn't be too worried right now.  I think  it's still time to be popping champagne, corks and the like.  I think that  we've got a president here who's been the best President since Ronald  Reagan.  I think that we've got a president that's putting Americans first.   I think the markets are going to continue to respond to that.  I suspect  confidence, consumer confidence, constituent confidence, is all going to  continue to rise.  So I wouldn't be expecting any kind of change anytime  soon.</p><p> CASONE:  An Australian guy that believes in the American dream.  Nick, it's  always great to have you on the show.  Thank you.</p><p> ADAMS:  Always a pleasure, Cheryl Casone.</p><p> CASONE:  Nick Adams, of course, who we should say is an American citizen  now.  Thank you, Nick.  Great to have you on.</p><p> All right.  We'll talk about the markets.  You know, look, there are the  health care stocks that we're watching like United Health Group.  OK, they  came out with earnings this morning that they're out of the exchanges but,  you know, look, anything that happens with regards to health care,  Obamacare will affect all names we're seeing on your screen.  Aetna and  Cigna, Humana is down, United Health Group, low, bucking the trend but that  is piece we should say of earnings coming up this morning.</p><p> Take a look at Netflix, blowout quarter for that stock last night, jumped  10 percent.  Now, it's up 14 percent right now.  You just can't stop  Netflix.  Subscriber growth internationally, domestically really killing it  for Netflix.  This stock is on a roll, up more than 23 bucks right now.</p><p> We're going to be talking about your money when we come back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CASONE:  Turmoil over healthcare putting pressure on our markets.   Investors are concerned about what this all is going to mean for the Trump  administration's plans for tax reform and other pro-growth initiatives.   All of this as Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are dragging on the  markets after they reported earnings this morning, both of the banks  trading pressure, investment banking pressure of Goldman Sachs.  All of  that factoring in of course and then the Fed interest rates kind of help  Bank of America but not enough.</p><p> Let's bring in for analysis, Belpointe Asset Management Chief Strategist  David Nelson.  He is here in our studio, Lori Rothman down on the floor of  the New York Stock Exchange.  Lori, to you first, about the bank numbers.</p><p> LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.  OK.  So it's kind of a  surprise from Goldman Sachs, Cheryl.  So Financial is because of this  disappointing Goldman numbers are leading the S&amp;P lower at this hour.   Forty percent decline in trading revenue.  Now for Goldman Sachs, trading  will mean that's the bread and butter.  That's what they're known for,  right?  So, that kind of decline is pretty shocking.</p><p> Bank of America on the other hand, did OK.  Rising interest rates really  helping the Bank of America because, you know, they have a lot interest  rate sensitive, mortgage holdings also a lot of consumer deposits.  So  higher rates mean more profit for a company like Bank of America.  There,  you see those shares are down half a percent, likely being dragged lower by  brother (ph) weakness as I mentioned in Goldman Sachs.</p><p> And of course, the big picture today which this healthcare gridlock in  Washington.  All right here on the floor, zeroed in on the Trump  administration and what is going to happen next with healthcare.  And down  the road what it means for the Trump administration's plans for tax reform,  infrastructure spending.  I mean, it's very interesting, right?  You've got  materials names, energy names all lower because of that concerns that we  won't get this economic shot in the arm that the President had been talking  about with the latest hiccup in healthcare, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  And, you know, Lori, you bring up the point about growth,  you know, economic growth.  And David, that's the concern here.  You know,  you've got particularly Gary Cohn has been saying it very clear, you know,  we're going to get, you know, more than two percent growth, three percent  growth, you know, that GDP number that you're seeing from Gary Cohn, the  Economic Adviser to the President.</p><p> DAVID NELSON, ASSET MANAGEMENT CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE:  Yes.</p><p> CASONE:  But a lot are questioning if those growth, those projections can  be doable if you don't have, you know, what's happening in Congress if you  don't have healthcare or tax reform at all.</p><p> NELSON:  OK.  But on the other side of that, Cheryl, I think for a lot of  portfolio managers like myself, all the way back when the healthcare vote  failed in the House the first time.  We kind of understood that it was  going to be a long slog, and that the agenda from the administration was  going to take a lot longer than initially we had thought.</p><p> I kind of thought it was a mistake to leave with healthcare.  I thought tax  reform was the better way to go.  It certainly had some bipartisan support.   And even Jamie Dimon spoke about that on the conference call last Friday.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> NELSON:  How uncompetitive corporate rates are.  Well, basically,  offshoring or manufacturing or cash flow.  And in some cases, we're  actually are destroying the company themselves and with the financial  engineering like an inversion.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  But really quick, David, with Goldman Sachs, there is  movement.  We're going to talk about this later.</p><p> NELSON:  Sure.</p><p> CASONE:  There's movement in the House to put through at the budget  proposal</p><p> NELSON:  Yes.</p><p> CASONE:  But within it, there's some regulatory proposals that would  actually push through tax reform.  I don't want to get in the weeds because  I don't want to put our viewers to sleep.  It's incredibly boring.  But, I  mean, this could be the savior for tax reform.</p><p> NELSON:  It could be at least a start, and I think they're going to have to  approach this on an incremental level.  Look, the tax code is 77,000 pages.   Unwinding it in a broad sweeping bill, that's going to take some time.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  Bring on Paul Ryan.  More pressure for him, Lori.  But, you  know, that's the thing in investors and traders on the floor of they  exchange.  Obviously, if we get down to -- I don't know, maybe October,  November and we don't have anything pushing through on tax reform, I'm  wondering if that's when you're going to see the volume pick up and that's  going to be selling pressure.</p><p> ROTHMAN:  So, you know, don't forget, Cheryl, it's been months, right,  since Wall Street has been hinging so much of its confidence on what comes  out of the administration.  In the meantime, don't forget we have had some  pretty good earnings, some pretty good economic news, broader picture right  in the middle of earnings season.</p><p> You know, I was talking earlier about the mixed of report from the  Financials but, you know, we're going to hear from some of the big tech  heavyweights tonight on IBM.  Of course, I'm forgetting to even remind you  about Netflix blowing away the street last night, Netflix alone.</p><p> CASONE:  Oh, I'm all over it.</p><p> ROTHMAN:  It is keeping the Nasdaq in record territory.  I mean, Nasdaq is  poised supposed in the record.</p><p> CASONE:  I'm so sorry, Lori, we've got to go back to Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell speaking on Capitol Hill.  Let's listen to him.</p><p> MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  -- to vote for a  replacement for Obamacare.  Consequently, sometime in the near future,  we'll have a vote on repealing Obamacare, essentially, the same vote that  we had in 2015.</p><p> I would remind everyone that, in that proposal, there's a two-year delay, a  two-year delay, which would give us the opportunity to work out a complete  replacement on a bipartisan basis with our Democratic friends.</p><p> So, that's a vote I think we're very likely to have in the very near  future.</p><p> JOHN CORNYN III, (R) SENATOR, TEXAS:  We've got a sense of what the future  might look like if we are unsuccessful in repealing and replacing  Obamacare.  We saw for the second time in a few days, Democratic senators  coming to the floor asking for tens of billions of dollars and tax dollars  for insurance company bailouts.  No reform, no change in the status quo.   And after seven years I think we can safely conclude that the structure of  Obamacare is a failed experiment.</p><p> That's why we want to change the structure of the healthcare delivery  system as we stabilize markets, protect people from premium increases and  preexisting condition exclusions.  We're going to continue down that road  because the alternative, I fear, is going to be a Democratic effort  strictly to bail out insurance companies with no reform whatsoever.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  After seven years of Obamacare, the American public  knows what they have.  They have fewer choices.  They have higher premiums  and less control over their own healthcare.  Number of years ago, I voted  to do a repeal of the Obama health care law.  I'm ready to make that  complete repeal vote again.</p><p> But, of course, that's not enough, the people of Wyoming want more than  that.  They want to be able to buy the insurance that they want that works  right for them, not what the federal government in Washington, D.C. says  they have to buy.  So, I'm ready to vote to repeal.</p><p> We need a medical system not just as good as it was before Obamacare was  passed but we need a medical system and a healthcare system in the country  even better than that.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think the only thing I could add in this discussion  is at some point we need to figure out and find out where the votes are.   This is an important work to be done.  It affects families.  It affects  health care.  We need to find out where the votes are.  But there are other  things we need to do too.</p><p> The President this week is talking about manufacturing made in America, if  you could pay the utility bill, if the transportation system works.  Those  are the two boxes you check when you start talking about jobs.  We all know  the best place to get an insurance is still at work where somebody else  does negotiations, somebody else reads the policy.  Ways that more people  could get insurance at work is important.  Tax structure is important.</p><p> This has had a considerable amount of time spent on it, and sooner rather  than later we need to find out where the Senate is and move forward.</p><p> CORY GARDNER, (R) SENATOR, COLORADO:  There are a lot of people out there  today who seem to be spiking the football, trying to celebrate a moment.   But for now, it seems to leave the Affordable Care Act in place for today.   But let me tell you what happens if you continue to spike the football.  In  the State of Colorado last week, it was announced the average premium rate  increase for the next year will be 27 percent.  But that's if you're lucky  enough to live in the front range of Colorado.</p><p> If you live in the eastern plains or the western slope, you're going to pay  30 percent more.  You're going to pay 40 percent more.  That's spiking the  football on the American people who will continue to pay more under the  Affordable Care Act that is collapsing.</p><p> We will continue our work to get our job done to make sure that the status  quo no longer stands and instead we provide relief to the American people.</p><p> MCCONNELL:  Yes.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You went through an arrangement of your bill, and we've  heard from some your members that they were very critical to process, and  some were critical for Senator Johnson who was specifically critical so  that reach the process.  Do you feel that you and your leadership have been  damaged in this process and that now you can actually -- after this across  considering those criticisms that you heard?</p><p> MCCONNELL:  Well, you know, this has been a very, very challenging  experience for all of us.  It's pretty obvious that we don't have 50  members who can agree on a replacement.  A lot of people have been involved  in the discussion and very passionate discussions.</p><p> But everybody is giving it their best shot.  And as of today, we simply do  not have 50 senators who can agree on what ought to replace the existing  law.  What we do have is a vote that many of us made two years ago, at the  time when the President of the United States would not sign the legislation  that would repeal Obamacare.  And with a two-year delay give us an  opportunity to build something better on a bipartisan basis.  That's what I  sense most of our members would like to vote on now, and we'll be doing  that in the near future.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> (OFF-MIC)</p><p> MCCONNELL:  Nancy (ph).</p><p> NANCY:  You don't appear currently to have the vote for that repeal and  replace.  If that vote fails, will you then begin working with Democrats?</p><p> MCCONNELL:  Well, I think we'll have to see what happens.  We will have  demonstrated that Republicans by themselves are not prepared at this  particular point to do a replacement.  And that doesn't mean that the  problems all go away, and you'll have to look at our committee chairman and  their ranking members.</p><p> My suspicion is there will be hearings about the crisis that we have, and  we'll have to see what the way forward is.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE) and in seven months, that is wasted.  There  is no accomplishment.  How can we explain this to voters next year if we  don't do (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p> MCCONNELL:  Well, we have a new Supreme Court Justice.  We have 14 repeals  of regulations, and we're only six months into it.  Last time I looked,  Congress goes on for two years.  We'll be moving onto comprehensive tax  reform and the infrastructure.  There's much work left to be done for the  American people and we're ready to tackle it.  Thanks.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thanks a lot.</p><p> (OFF-MIC)</p><p> CASONE:  We don't have the votes.  That was Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell saying that they do not have 50 senators that can agree on what  to replace Obamacare with.  They all want to repeal it.  Well, most of them  do but the majority can't agree on the replacement.</p><p> In particular, he said -- and this is what Senator Cornyn said as well.   You know, many of these senators wanted repeal.  Cory Gardner is talking  about the crisis in Colorado with the healthcare exchanges that, you know,  each of the senators has to go home at some point in August and face  constituents that are dealing with these healthcare exchanges that are  frankly falling apart.</p><p> I want to say really quick here, and you mentioned tax reform when you look  at the Dow really quick, when McConnell started to talk, the Dow was down  more than 60 points.  We're backing up that just a little bit.  So, there's  a little bit of a pullback but markets certainly are watching every single  word that we get out of Washington.  The word is we don't have the votes.   Repeal and replace Obamacare is not going to happen.</p><p> All right.  Let's bring back with me Patrice Lee Onwuka.  She is a senior  policy analyst at the Independent Women's Forum.  David Nelson is still  with me.  Ashley Hayek and Neil Sroka are back as well.  Guys, thank you  very much for sticking around.  Patrice, I want to go to you first.  You  know, at least he said, OK, next is tax reform.</p><p> What alarmed me though that McConnell just said at some point we're going  to have hearings on Capitol Hill about the failure of Obamacare.  My first  reaction is was that going to cost the American taxpayer?  Don't we need to  just move on to tax reform?</p><p> PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  I  mean, it would be ideal, 61 percent of Americans want their middle class  tax break.  They want a tax cuts.  And so, I think it inspires confidence  in the markets, in businesses and the American people when we can deliver  something that going to stimulate the economy.</p><p> CASONE:  You know, Neil, you had Senator Barrasso saying it, Senator Blunt  saying it.  They've got to have a conversation.  They got to go back in  within their ranks and figure out, Neil, what went wrong?  But I know that  you think a lot has gone wrong with the Republicans.</p><p> SROKA:  Yes.  And what went wrong is they had no plan at all.  And let's be  serious here.  The tax reform plans that we're starting to hear come out of  House are not a middle-class tax cut.  They are a giant giveaway to  millionaires, billionaires.  And I think are going to cut social security,  Medicare and Medicaid benefits potentially for millions of Americans.</p><p> So, if you want to talk about a tax plan that's going to be disastrous but  they are overwhelming majority of American people.  That's exactly what  we're seeing, kind of --</p><p> CASONE:  I don't agree with that.  I know that David does not agree as  well.  I'm sorry, Neil.</p><p> NELSON:  Yes I think this is exactly what I would expect from the left.   It's an overreaction here.  I think from the health care package -- on the  health care package, look, Obamacare largely failed because it was owned  only by the Democrats.</p><p> This failed because it's only owned by the Republicans.  They're going to  have to actually talk to each other.  And I think that's what the American  people expect.  We going to have to sit down at the table and negotiate  this out.  Because just owning it on one side or the other isn't going to  do it.  Both sides need on.</p><p> SROKA:  They spent seven months trying to have a conversation about health  care.  And the fact of the matter is Republicans do not have a plan.</p><p> NELSON:  This was a plan.  Obamacare was passed in the middle of the night.   Give me a break.</p><p> CASONE:  And I think we have --</p><p> SROKA: -- four months in open forums.  I'm going to be really looking  forward to seeing what the open discussions are like.</p><p> CASONE:  OK.</p><p> SROKA:  All across the country --</p><p> NELSON:  So, let's hear it.</p><p> SROKA: --we got a brush fire of millions of Americans who hate everything  that the Republican Party is proposing.</p><p> ONWUKA:  Well, let me jump in and say here.</p><p> CASONE:  All right.  Well, I forgot.  I'm so sorry.  I want to listen to  Senator Chuck Schumer, he's at podium.  Stand by.</p><p> CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) SENATOR, NEW YORK:  Thank you.  And I'm proud to be  joined by Senators Klobuchar and Heinrich.</p><p> Now, it's getting clearer and clearer that Senate Republicans won't be able  to pass either their bill or a backup plan of repeal without replacement.</p><p> We Democrats believe that the time has finally come for our Republican  colleagues to take us up on our offer of working together to improve the  health care system rather than sabotage it.  Evidently, President Trump is  proposing a different path.  He wants to throw up his hands rather than  roll up his sleeves to work with us and solve the problem.  But let's be  very clear about what the President is proposing and where his path would  lead.</p><p> The President would not be, \"letting Obamacare collapse.\"  He is actively,  actively trying undermined the health care system in this country using  millions of Americans as political pawns in a cynical game.  By continuing  to deny the insurance markets their certainty that they need to function,  the President is playing a dangerous game with the health care of this  country.</p><p> So our Republican colleagues here in the Senate have a choice to make.   They can follow the President down a path that will lead to higher  premiums, less care, and millions of Americans losing coverage.  They can  join President Trump in trying to sabotage the system and hurt millions of  innocent Americans to try and make a political point that has failed  already, or they can start today working with Democrats.</p><p> We can work together to lower premiums.  We can work together to stabilize  the markets.  We can work together to improve the quality of health care.   This isn't a radical idea.  A group of 11 Republican and Democratic  governors called for exactly the kind of bipartisan cooperation that we are  calling for, a bipartisan group of governors.</p><p> We Democrats have held the door to bipartisanship open to our Republican  colleagues for months.  It's time for the Republicans to walk through it.   Senator Klobuchar?</p><p> AMY KLOBUCHAR, (D) SENATOR, MINNESOTA:  Thank you very much, Senator  Schumer, and thank you so much for the work you've done.</p><p> CASONE:  OK, we want to -- we break out really quick.  Just want to recap  here.  We just heard from Senator Schumer, the time has come, basically.   He's offering once again to work with the Republican leaders to come up  with something that will fix.  I mean there's one thing that we can see  between the Democrats and Republicans.  They both agree the exchanges are  failing.</p><p> But do you let those fail with nothing to back up the American people that  still require health care?  Wanted to get to Senator Schumer's comments, is  bipartisanship possible in all of this?</p><p> I want to back in our panel.  I got Patrice Lee Onwuka with me as well as  David Nelson is here, Ashley Hayek still with me, Neil Sroka is with me.   He's got have something to say I'm sure.  Also I want to bring in if we  can, Gregg Jarrett from the Fox News Channel to talk about the legalities  of all this.  And Gregg welcome to you.  First to you on this, what we're  saying now is another olive branch from Schumer.</p><p> GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL:  Right.</p><p> CASONE:  On, you know, on the surface, anyway.</p><p> JARRETT:  Well, he says the door is open, yes.  It's open, but for only one  thing.  Do it our way or we won't cooperate with anything you want to do.   So, it's not much of a door sort of like a doggie door you got to crawl  through.  And it's an impossibility for Republicans who are diametrically  opposed to Democrats.</p><p> So, you know, and this is Chuck, I'd walk a mile for a camera Schumer who  is, you know, doing his thing.  And it's a bit of a charade.</p><p> CASONE:  Well, Neil, I mean let's talk about the reality of this, because  what Senator Schumer says, is we're going to -- we're willing to come to  the table, willing to talk to you.  But what can he offer that's not going  to get rejected by the Republicans because even the Republicans came up  with a plan to replace Obamacare.  That the CBO said was more expensive  than what the House had proposed.</p><p> SROKA:  Yes.  Well, it's a good question, what can the Republicans meet at  Democrats in the middle of the table.  The fact of the matter is the way  that we actually fixed many of the problems that do exist with Obamacare is  by the very least providing a public option if not moving to Medicare for  all program overall which is actually the way that we're going to cut the  cost curve and bend that cost curve in health insurance.  And that provide  health insurance for millions of Americans.</p><p> In lieu of that, let's actually have real negotiation in an open  discussion.  If Republicans want to meet Democrats somewhere in the middle,  there is certain way to do that and that's called the public option.</p><p> CASONE:  Ashley, do you think after what we've seen play out in the last  hour in particular with the failure of McConnell to get the votes that the  Republican leaders are not going to realize that they do need to work in a  bipartisan way with Democrats?  Do you think that's possible?</p><p> HAYEK:  Let's see really clear.  The Democrats don't want a bipartisan  effort.  They've never wanted to buy bipartisan effort to try and work with  this President.  It's only criticisms critiques.  The hypocrisy that we've  seen from the left is absolutely unreal.  Premiums are going to continue to  go up under Obamacare.  People who are being, \"forced out\" of the health  care by not repealing Obamacare and people who are forced into a health  care plan that didn't work for their families.</p><p> So, what you're going to see is more people are going to hurt and  unfortunately because we weren't able to repeal the health care, Obamacare,  and we aren't able to help with anything right now, it's going to continue  to just hurt the American people.</p><p> CASONE:  David, what I'm concerned about right now is it's from the  investment side of this.</p><p> NELSON:  Sure.</p><p> CASONE:  I mean, these insurance companies, I mean, yes, like, I can do  some UnitedHealthcare today, great on the earnings.  They're not to be  exchanging.</p><p> NELSON:  But they got a plan.  Yes exactly.</p><p> CASONE:  They're not in Obamacare.  So, take them out of the problem.  You  got Aetna, Humana, these are companies that are -- they've clearly said we  can't afford to stay.  But we have nothing to fix it.</p><p> NELSON:  When you look line-item by line-item, you can see why companies  like UnitedHealthcare, they are not in the business of losing money.  And  Neil said it.  I mean, look at what this is all about in the first place.   It opened up a Pandora's box, the Affordable Care Act.  They always wanted  a single payer plan, that's where they're trying to go.</p><p> CASONE:  Do you think we're going single payer?</p><p> SROKA:  At Medicare for all programs is exactly what corporate America  wants.  If you actually look over in Canada, corporations love their  Medicare program that provides insurance at a much lower cost for everyone  else.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CASONE:  Neil, Neil, I disagree with that.  There are many -- we many CEO's  that come on to Fox Business and they want healthy employees and not  necessarily a single payer system actually.</p><p> HAYEH:  Exactly.</p><p> CASONE:  Do you disagree with that.  And I can totally disagree with that.</p><p> Patrice, Patrice I do want to bring you in.  I'm sorry Patrice.  But, you  know, come on in Patrice, I want to ask you about that because the single- payer system, we keep talking about that possibility.  Is that now though a  reality?</p><p> ONWUKA:  I mean it seems increasingly like we might be moving in that  direction.  But I hope we don't because when we look at Obamacare and the  expansion of Medicaid, we have people who have insurance cards but it's  putting pressure on a system by overloading the system.</p><p> And unfortunately the people who actually need -- the most vulnerable  people who need help are the ones who are not able to see the doctors in a  timely manner.  So to Medicare for our single-payer system is not the  solution to real quality care for people.</p><p> CASONE:  OK.  OK.  Gregg Jarrett I got about10 seconds, your final  thoughts.</p><p> JARRETT:  There's one other possibility.  Repeal Obamacare and then give  all of the money earmarked for Medicaid to the states to devise their own  plans state by state.  I talked to a veteran on Capitol Hill --</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.</p><p> JARRETT: -- over the weekend who said that is actually gaining some  strength, it's a real possibility.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CASONE:  And all of you, thank you so much.  We are going to take a quick  break, a lot of breaking news on the show.  We're going to take a quick  commercial break.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CASONE:  Well, turmoil over health care expected to only create more  gridlock in Washington.  And that is something that J.P. Morgan, CEO Jamie  Dimon is fed up with.  And he is blaming the media telling reporters, \"Why  you guys don't write about it every day is completely beyond me.\"  So, is  he right?  Well, let's bring in Howard Kurtz, Host of Media Buzz.  Howard,  you have written about his comment, great article by the way.  But --</p><p> HOWARD KURTZ, MEDIA BUZZ HOST:  Thank you.</p><p> CASONE:  -- is he right?</p><p> KURTZ:  Well, most Americans would say he's right.  Why can't we do  something about the partisan paralysis in Washington?  The reason it's not  written and talked about more is that it's been going on for 20 years, Bush  administration, Obama administration, Trump administration.  It's like  saying that Washington is a real human place in July.</p><p> And when you have all this polarization, more polarized parties, more  polarized members, more polarized districts, constituents, more polarized  media and social media now and you added to a subject that is difficult and  treaties as health care, the result is what we have today, nothing gets  done.</p><p> CASONE:  Well, here is the thing.  You've got so many story lines going on  right now.  A lot great in chaos, I'm thinking Donald Trump, Jr. for  instance about a meeting that happened a year ago that's, you know, now  we're talking hearings and appearances and thing.  I mean, does Jamie Dimon  have a point that the media needs to refocus on the actual policy debate in  Washington?  Which is what they voted on last year, which is tax reform  that is health care, and get away from the noise?</p><p> KURTZ:  He has an absolute point.  We are so addicted to scandal which is  not to say that some of these stories aren't legitimate and shouldn't be  covered.  But the -- a media oxygen consumed by the side shows, the silly  stuff, you know, good at handshake with the First Lady of France really  crowds out a lot of the more serious look at taxes infrastructure, things  that Americans really care about.  I think we are all guilty to some degree  about that on that point.  The others getting more ratings and clicks but  it can be frustrating.  I think a lot of people are kind of tuning us out  for that very reason.</p><p> CASONE:  It, you know, it's interesting as, you know, a journalist my self  and someone that's worked in different places, I mean, you have to kind of  wonder though, if some of our colleagues are making grave mistakes here by  focusing on what is a sexy story, and focusing on something that is  salacious but doesn't help the country.  Doesn't that feed into what Dimon  is saying that reporters are getting it wrong?</p><p> KURTZ:  I think that is true.  I also think that some news outlets are tend  to be more serious and some sort of don't necessarily put up the big  numbers.  You know the words there is an audience for this other stuff.</p><p> And I think sometimes this President who is obviously fighting on the  issues creates so many of the distractions.  He goes after, you know, Joe  Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, we all go crazy for three days.  So, when  you put all those things in the pot, it's very frustrating for me as a  lifelong journalist that we don't have more laser focus on the stuff that  really touches people's lives as opposed to the gridlock and the bread and  circuses aspects.  I guess you would say in Washington.</p><p> CASONE:  Well, that's the thing.  If you copies other networks that are --  and I'm not going to call them up by name, but that are covering again, you  know, just making basically a 24/7 affair out of attacking President Trump  and his daughter and both sons and his grand kids, isn't he?  These are  people that have to take responsibility for the fact that they're also  derailing what matters which is the American life, which is American -- the  people that are here.</p><p> KURTZ:  I think they do have to take some responsibility.  The dirty little  secret in cable news is you don't need a big mass audience if you can get a  million dedicated people to watch them, that's good for your business, not  necessarily good for the country.</p><p> CASONE:  Howard Kurtz, Media Buzz, every Sunday, 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on  Fox News.  Howard, thank you.  And we will be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CASONE:  Today, we have learned that the Senate Republican plan to repeal  and replace Obamacare just didn't have the votes.  And then later Senator  McConnell's plan for a vote for a straight repeal also didn't have the  votes.  Where are we going to go from here?  We're going to go Liz Claman  right now.  Liz over to you.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Actually, it's very remarkable but well that hold up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CAVUTO:  No, I hear you, I hear you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CASONE:  That is the question.  Neil Cavuto, thank you so much and --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CAVUTO:  You got it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CASONE:  Neil was just telling you.  Again, we are waiting to hear from  Senate leaders to talk more about what is happening with the fate of health  care, I mean reform at this point, looks really uncertain and particular at  this hour.</p><p>The Senate's effort for clean and repeal of Obamacare really is failing so  further receive enough support from Senate Republic and some big  (INAUDIBLE), you know him well.</p><p>Neil is just talking about the submarkets, you know, Dow is down about 71  points right now.  You know, we started the session with better numbers  than this.  So obviously investors are waiting to see, the more you delay  health care, the more you delay tax reform investors are going to, at some  point, maybe sooner rather than later say OK as enough of this.  But for  now, the market is not, we're holding on but the Dow is down 72.</p><p>Well, hello everybody I am Cheryl Casone.  And I'm in for Trish Regan  today.  I would like to welcome you to The Intelligence Report.  Boy, there  is a lot going on.  A source close to Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell has just told Fox News the Senator plans to go forward with a  vote to repeal Obamacare first even if that vote fails.</p><p>Right now, it appears McConnell is well short of the votes he needs to  debate, even debate the repeal bill after three Republican senators said  that they're not -- they are going to vote no.  So we're going to talk  about what is next for healthcare.  We are all over that story.  And again,  we're waiting for Mitch McConnell.</p><p>Also this today, we're watching President Trump getting back to his America  first agenda.  The administration just unveiling a new NAFTA plan aimed at  shrinking our trade deficit with Canada and with Mexico but how exactly is  this going to happen?  How is this going to work?  We've got the Intel for  you on that.</p><p>But first I want to go back to Washington with Adam Shapiro.  I think  boondoggle at this point might be the word in my head Adam, with regards to  what's going on with McConnell in the Senate right now.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it certainly raises the  question about how does leadership control its members.  I mean, you've got  the three Senators.  Let's show you the baseball cards of threes who  actually killed the effort to repeal.  You have Susan Collins of Maine.   She would have been a no vote, not only to debate but also on repeal.  She  did that in 2015.  But you also have Lisa Murkowski from Alaska.  She  wouldn't even vote to proceed to debate, so she is a no.  And then of  course there's Shelley Moore Capito from West Virginia, she was a no.  That  was all it took but as you said there's an effort to perhaps maneuver this  into a vote, just put everyone on the record and then move on.</p><p>It was President Trump though, who said, look, the Republicans are not  going to own this.  This is going to be on the Democrats.  Here is what he  said just about an hour ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES:  Let Obamacare fail, it will be a  lot easier.  And I think we're probably in that position where we'll just  let Obamacare fail.  We're not going to own it.  I'm not going to own it.   I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it.  We'll let  Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us and they're  going to say how do we fix it, how do we fix it or how do we come up with a  new plan.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  Well, the Democrats say they're open to working with Republicans  on a fix but it can't include a repeal.  So here is what Chuck Schumer, the  minority leader said just moments ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  Republicans propose surgery.  The  operation was a failure.  Now Republicans are proposing a second surgery  that will surely kill the patient.  Medicine is needed, bipartisan  medicine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO:  So there seems to be agreement that the Affordable Care Act,  Obamacare is not working, it needs to be fixed but getting these two sides  together to fix it, good luck.  Cheryl, back to you.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, luck is really needed especially if you're Mitch McConnell  right now.  And we're waiting to hear from him Adam.  Thank you for all the  details on that.</p><p>You know, let's bring in for more analysis on all of this Republican  Strategist, Ashley Hayek, Communications Director for Democracy in America  -- for America.  Excuse me, Neil Sroka and the Senior Writer at The Weekly  Standard, John McCormack is here as well.</p><p>Guys, thank you so much for your time.  So I mean this is, John, this is  pretty wild what we're seeing going on.  I mean, you talked about draining  the swamp but Mitch McConnell seems to be losing more and more support  every day.  Is what we're going to see happen with the President just said  just let it fail, let Obamacare fail, let it be done?</p><p>JOHN MCCORMACK, SENIOR WRITER OF THE WEEKLY STANDARD:  You know, that's  going to be really tough because what people seem to forget is that  Obamacare is basically now synonymous with the individual insurance market.   Remember, like your plan, you keep your plan, well that wasn't true.  So  people who are on the individual market, almost everyone in there have been  affected by these very costly, very burdensome regulations.  And, you know,  to see Obamacare kind of go on and on to death spiral.</p><p>Listen, if totally true that this is being caused by bad legislation's  passed by Democrats, but I think the voters are going to expect Republicans  to get their act together, to actually fix the problem.  And so I don't  think they can really move on -- they might want to move on from healthcare  but healthcare is not going to move on from them.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, I mean, you know, this was something, Ashley, that the  President wanted to see first.  Let's do health care then we move to tax  reform.  Obviously, you know, in this tax reform in jeopardy, that is one  question here but Ashley, at the same time, can they get anything done with  regards to reform?  If they can't even repeal it, does that mean that we  have nothing, Ashley, on the table?</p><p>ASHLEY HAYEK, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Well, here is the problem, first and  foremost, is the self-proclaimed conservatives.  When premiums go up, they  are going to cause a lot of things but these Republicans are not going to  be called conservatives.  And the next item absolutely tax reform.  And if  they can't get tax reform done, the base is going to lose.  They're going  to lose their stuff.</p><p>And one thing that dictates all of this is the market, the market, 17  percent, the market bought into -- in the economy and the market bought  into the idea that our economy will do better with the repeal of Obamacare,  cutting back on taxes.  And when we're not able to repeal Obamacare, you're  going to see effects long term.  And it will come down to the seats in  reelections.</p><p>CASONE:  Neil, what do you make of the Republicans basically at this point,  all signs reporting to failure to be able to do anything about Obamacare.   We're not even talking Trumpcare, we're talking nothing, no movement, even  if the repeal doesn't go anywhere, what does it point --</p><p>NEIL SROKA, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR OF DEMOCRACY FOR AMERICA:  I think what  you're seeing right now is that Republicans are fundamentally unable to  govern.  They were able to run for eight years on something and now they  can't even pull that together.  The fact to the matter is, is reason why  they can't vote to end Obamacare is because Obamacare is increasingly  popular with the American people.  You look at West Virginia and Alaska,  two of the states that just killed this repeal effort, even though Donald  Trump won handily in both of those states, both of those senators came out  of this repeal bill because in those states, especially the Medicaid  expansion portions of Obamacare are incredibly popular and needed.</p><p>CASONE:  John, you cover Washington, you know, as journalist, I mean, I'm  wondering if this is kind of, if politics as usual seems to be winning in  all of this.  And the reason I say that is because, you know, when  President Trump came into office there was this feeling that you know, he  was elected on wave of populism.  People wanted to put the country first,  repeal Obamacare, replace it, et cetera, get tax reform done.  It seems to  me that the politics seems to be overtaking policy in all of this today.</p><p>MCCORMACK:  Well, I think there is something to that, you know, there is a  lot of bias towards the status quo.  Remember, Democrats passed this bill  with 60 votes in the Senate, and overwhelmingly majority in the House and  President who won by very large margin.  Republicans come in with much  smaller majority and so it's a lot tougher to reverse this, once it's  already in effect.</p><p>And Republicans also, you got to remember, you know, the President didn't  run on the specific repeal and replace agenda, the House of Representatives  and the senators, they also didn't have really specific idea in mind what  they could come up with.  And so you basically have both conservatives and  moderates unhappy as well as all these procedural roadblocks.  You know,  there be special rules they have to abide by.  President Trump was right  when he said that it's much more difficult to pass this bill with these  special rules rather than getting 60 votes as Democrats did back in 2009  and 2010.</p><p>SROKA:  No.</p><p>CASONE:  Go ahead, Neil.</p><p>SROKA:  I'm sorry.  Donald Trump right now is an impotent as leader of the  Republican Party if he can't even get Republicans on board to repeal and  replace Obamacare, something that Republicans have been running on close to  a decade.  The reality is, is Republicans care far more about tax cuts for  millionaires and billionaires than they do about the lives of American  people.  And that's ultimately why they don't want to do anything on  Obamacare.</p><p>CASONE:  You know, Neil, I got to push back on that.  You can never  underestimate the power of Donald Trump.  I mean he was underestimated as  candidate.</p><p>SROKA:  Agreed.</p><p>CASONE:  He is -- he's when it comes to world politics or what's happening  here at home.  That's the thing, Ashley.  You know, this President, we know  he's going to barnstorm America, he has going to all across this country to  fight for tax reform.  Something many believe at least on Wall Street, he  should have done first.  But, you know, let's spilt milk at this point,  Ashley.  But he's going to go out and take it to the people for tax reform.   Is that his win, not health care?</p><p>HAYEK:  Tax reform is completely separate from healthcare.  I think he has  a huge opportunity here in that it's a fresh plate.  And he also has the  opportunity to expand tax credits that's going to help the middle and  working class.  It can help economic growth and is going to help small  businesses grow.  And that's going to ultimately help our economy.</p><p>SROKA:  There's a reason --</p><p>HAYEK:  They're going back to my initial point, is that yes, these senators  had seven years to come up with a new plan.  From day one President Trump  has said we have to repeal Obamacare.  And what the senators especially  those so self-proclaimed conservative senators have done is absolutely  nothing.  And it is on their hands.  They should have had something since  they have had seven years to complain about it.</p><p>CASONE:  Guys we're out of time but I think, you know, bipartisan way we  can all agree that this is pretty much a mess.  And that's a mess that the  blame does fall, you got to say on the Republicans.</p><p>And again, we're waiting for Mitch McConnell.  We'll see what he has to say  about all of this.  Maybe he can --he's got a trick up his he sleeve, we  don't know yet.  But at this point things aren't looking real good for  this.  Ashley, Neil, John, really appreciate your time today.</p><p>HAYEK:  Thank you.</p><p>MCCORMACK:  Thanks.</p><p>CASONE:  All right.  Well, joining me now with his thoughts on health care,  former Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary, and Former President of  Lilly USA, Alex Azar.  Alex, what do you make of what you're seeing in  Washington?  It seems to be a mess from those of us watching from the  sidelines right now?</p><p>ALEX AZAR, FORMER U.S. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPUTY SECRETARY:  Well,  it's an absolute mess, you're right.  I'm astonished to that.  It does  appear that the Republican House and Senate will not pass anything even  with the label repeal of Obamacare on it.  That's going to be a tough road  in 2018 as they go back to their core voters having to explain that.  Bit I  think McConnell may now still call a vote on straight repeal just as matter  of accountability with members of his caucus.</p><p>CASONE:  Sure.</p><p>AZAR:  Just make them put it on record, so it's not cost-free.  But I  really think that there is not going to be legislative action at this  point.</p><p>CASONE:  OK -- </p><p>AZAR:  I mean, the hot potato has landed in Secretary Tom Price's lap.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, well, and that's -- here is the thing.  I'm curious, what can  Tom Price do?  That is the question, if he is going to be left with  Obamacare which the President and which many analysts say is failing, will  fail, what can Price do so that you don't have millions of Americans left  with nothing, sick Americans?  That's the concern I think from a human  perspective in all of this?</p><p>AZAR:  So let's separate the two programs.  On the Medicaid side you have  got Seema Verma running CMS who's one of the leaders in reinventing  Medicaid.  I think you see increasing state flexibility change, devolution  to states there on Medicaid.</p><p>On the individual insurance market side there's going to be a debate in the  administration right now.  The President said let it fail I don't know  fully what that means.  There -- this program is failing because of  inherently how the rate structure and the risk pooling was set up in it.   So it's going to keep going down.  The question is, does the administration  actually pull the plug on to patient or they put it in hospice and try to  make it a little better?  There are things the secretary can do to actually  save Obamacare from many of the very mistakes that Obama himself is and his  administration imposed on the program.</p><p>CASONE:  Would he -- we don't have a lot of time, but would he have the  power to deal with lawsuits?  And I say that because tort reform is  something that so many were screaming about back in 2008 when this, when  Obamacare was passed without half of Congress reading it, tort reform and  maybe state to state competition for insurance companies.  If you're going  to have people in states with no exchanges, no options, is that something  that Price can do from a legal perspective?  I honestly don't know?</p><p>AZAR:  I think very little the secretary can do in terms of tort reform  actually lead those efforts for President Bush in his administration.  Very  little the President can do unilaterally without legislation there.  And  also interstate sale of insurance also, I think little the secretary can do  but what he can do is grant waivers to states to create much more  flexibility in his exchanges.  I would do a top to bottom comprehensive  rewrite of the regulations of Obamacare, imposing as much free market,  localized flexibility as humanly possible.  Even then the rate structure is  just broken.  And that's in the statute and that's not -- that he can't  fix.</p><p>CASONE:  Alex, I agree with you 100 percent.  It's something I couldn't  believe it wasn't in the first bill and here we are today with this mess  that is these exchanges that are just falling apart.  Alex, thank you very  much.</p><p>AZAR:  Great, thank you.</p><p>CASONE:  Appreciate it.</p><p>Well, you know, the President has got a few things on the agenda.  He is  getting back to his America first agenda.  He has outlined a new plan for  renegotiating NAFTA.  That was -- remember, one of his biggest campaign  promises.  But can he do it?  We're going to talk about the legality of  that, coming up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Are we going to allow other countries to break the rules, steal our  jobs and drain our wealth, and it has been drained, it has been drained.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, the White House unveiling its plan to update the decade old  NAFTA deal following through on one of President Trump's biggest campaign  promise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  No longer are we going to allow other countries to break the rules,  steal our jobs and drain our wealth.  And it has been drained.  It has been  drained.</p><p>We're going to end up having a level playing field.  I don't want to say  anymore than a level but if the playing field we're slanted like a little  bit toward us I would accept that also, OK?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  OK, I want (INAUDIBLE) right now.  We want to take you live right  now to Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky.  He is speaking.  Let's listen in.</p><p>RAND PAUL, (R) SENATOR, KENTUCKY:  You saw what happened around here six  years ago with the committee and that never worked up.  There have been  many ideas for how we get more people in our country insurance.  For  example, 27 million people don't have insurance right now under Obamacare.   The estimates are that 50 percent of those 27 million don't get it because  it's too expensive.  It's too expensive because of the Obamacare  regulations.  The death spiral of Obamacare is regulations, make insurance  expensive and then you say oh, but you can get it after you're sick.  That  is the real problem.  That has the whole problem we have.  It's the adverse  selection and the death spiral.  That's what we need to fix.  We don't have  enough votes to repeal all of that.  So we're going to have to move  forward.  And I'm favor in moving forward with partial repeal and  continuing to work on trying to get rid of the rest of the bad elements of  that Obamacare that have driven prices up.</p><p>Thanks, guys.</p><p>(OFF-MIC)</p><p>PAUL:  No, I'm for a vote that succeeds.  And I think those Republicans who  promised to repeal Obamacare ought to vote the same way they voted in 2015.   If you're not willing to vote the same way you voted in 2015, then you need  to go back home, you need to explain to Republicans why you're no longer  for repealing Obamacare.  Thanks.</p><p>CASONE:  OK.  So what he is saying basically, and this is what we learned  earlier today is that Senator Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell does intend to hold a vote to proceed on straight repeal.  OK,  that's the questions that the reporters were asking of Senator Rand Paul.   And he's -- that's what he has wanted entire time.  He has been on Fox  Business.  He says on air saying, repeal.  That is that, that is what he  promised his constituency.</p><p>He also says, remember back in 2015, there was a move by the Senate to try  and at least repeal some parts of Obamacare, do repeal President Barack  Obama at the time though of course vetoed that.  So it was kind of a  symbolic move if you will by the Republicans.</p><p>Senators at the time, he is saying, hey, if the way that you voted in 2015  is how you feel, that's how you vote now.  But remember, Senator Susan  Collins, Senator Lisa Murkowski, they are saying no.  They are not going to  vote for repeal.  They don't want to leave the American public with  nothing.  Many say though you repeal it, you give it couple of years,  Senator Rand Paul saying this is a death spiral.  The regulation,  regulatory burdens of Obamacare which many analysts agree with is  unacceptable for the American people.</p><p>I do want to bring in right now Nick Adams.  He is the Founder and  Executive Director of the Foundation for Liberty and American Greatness.   You know, here's the thing, Nick.  We're fighting back and forth about what  to do and it comes down to politics versus policy.  What we're seeing play  out right now with these U.S. senators, the Republican Party is to me,  politics as the midterms are approaching.  What see you about that?</p><p>NICK ADAMS, FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE FOUNDATION FOR LIBERTY  AND AMERICAN GREATNESS:  Cheryl, look, you summed it up very well.  It's  definitely is a battle between politics and policy.  There is absolutely no  reason that the Republicans shouldn't be able to pass this.  This is what  they ran on.  This is what they owe President Trump.  And I think it's  incredibly disappointing that we have so many Republicans that are just not  coming to the table and not getting this done.  And as a result I think  this will have ramifications for future elections if they're not able to  get together and do this.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, that's why Senator Paul, not just now but earlier on Fox  Business last week actually, had said, look, you know, I promised repeal.   I'm not go back to my constituents if I'm not supporting repeal.  The  problem is McConnell is going to hold this vote.  It's going to fail.  So  you're going to have the political backlash on the heads of these senators.</p><p>It would seem to me that at this point we're going to have nothing versus  something.  Now, politically that hurts the Republicans, yes?</p><p>ADAMS:  Yes, that's right.  And it's just amazing that it has come to this,  Cheryl.  I mean, they have had so long.  They have had so much time.   They've had such opportunity to prepare for this.  And here we are.  We  went through this earlier this year.  We're at this point again.  And it's  just tragic to see the Republicans perpetually snatch defeat from the jaws  of victory.  And I think the American people have every right to be  incredibly disappointed by the display that the Republicans are putting on.</p><p>They're showing themselves to be Lily Livered.  They're showing themselves  to have jellyfish backs and really President Trump has got to be absolutely  wringing his hands here because he's got some Republicans that were elected  really on back of his popularity that are just not doing the right thing.</p><p>CASONE:  You know, and it's true, and I think that the President is making  it very clear that it is on the shoulders of those they are failing to  support Republican efforts to repeal, replace or just repeal Obamacare.</p><p>Before I let you go, obviously, we are a business network.  And investors  have been -- these markets have been hitting record after record.  Twenty- five records I think now for the Dow.  I might be wrong.  I men, that is an  incredible streak for these markets.  But the fear now, that ends when we  finally see that the Trump agenda is in trouble.  At what point do you  think we hit that marker, Nick?</p><p>ADAMS:  Well, look, Cheryl, I wouldn't be too worried right now.  I think  it's still time to be popping champagne, corks and the like.  I think that  we've got a president here who's been the best President since Ronald  Reagan.  I think that we've got a president that's putting Americans first.   I think the markets are going to continue to respond to that.  I suspect  confidence, consumer confidence, constituent confidence, is all going to  continue to rise.  So I wouldn't be expecting any kind of change anytime  soon.</p><p>CASONE:  An Australian guy that believes in the American dream.  Nick, it's  always great to have you on the show.  Thank you.</p><p>ADAMS:  Always a pleasure, Cheryl Casone.</p><p>CASONE:  Nick Adams, of course, who we should say is an American citizen  now.  Thank you, Nick.  Great to have you on.</p><p>All right.  We'll talk about the markets.  You know, look, there are the  health care stocks that we're watching like United Health Group.  OK, they  came out with earnings this morning that they're out of the exchanges but,  you know, look, anything that happens with regards to health care,  Obamacare will affect all names we're seeing on your screen.  Aetna and  Cigna, Humana is down, United Health Group, low, bucking the trend but that  is piece we should say of earnings coming up this morning.</p><p>Take a look at Netflix, blowout quarter for that stock last night, jumped  10 percent.  Now, it's up 14 percent right now.  You just can't stop  Netflix.  Subscriber growth internationally, domestically really killing it  for Netflix.  This stock is on a roll, up more than 23 bucks right now.</p><p>We're going to be talking about your money when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CASONE:  Turmoil over healthcare putting pressure on our markets.   Investors are concerned about what this all is going to mean for the Trump  administration's plans for tax reform and other pro-growth initiatives.   All of this as Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are dragging on the  markets after they reported earnings this morning, both of the banks  trading pressure, investment banking pressure of Goldman Sachs.  All of  that factoring in of course and then the Fed interest rates kind of help  Bank of America but not enough.</p><p>Let's bring in for analysis, Belpointe Asset Management Chief Strategist  David Nelson.  He is here in our studio, Lori Rothman down on the floor of  the New York Stock Exchange.  Lori, to you first, about the bank numbers.</p><p>LORI ROTHMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.  OK.  So it's kind of a  surprise from Goldman Sachs, Cheryl.  So Financial is because of this  disappointing Goldman numbers are leading the S&amp;P lower at this hour.   Forty percent decline in trading revenue.  Now for Goldman Sachs, trading  will mean that's the bread and butter.  That's what they're known for,  right?  So, that kind of decline is pretty shocking.</p><p>Bank of America on the other hand, did OK.  Rising interest rates really  helping the Bank of America because, you know, they have a lot interest  rate sensitive, mortgage holdings also a lot of consumer deposits.  So  higher rates mean more profit for a company like Bank of America.  There,  you see those shares are down half a percent, likely being dragged lower by  brother (ph) weakness as I mentioned in Goldman Sachs.</p><p>And of course, the big picture today which this healthcare gridlock in  Washington.  All right here on the floor, zeroed in on the Trump  administration and what is going to happen next with healthcare.  And down  the road what it means for the Trump administration's plans for tax reform,  infrastructure spending.  I mean, it's very interesting, right?  You've got  materials names, energy names all lower because of that concerns that we  won't get this economic shot in the arm that the President had been talking  about with the latest hiccup in healthcare, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  And, you know, Lori, you bring up the point about growth,  you know, economic growth.  And David, that's the concern here.  You know,  you've got particularly Gary Cohn has been saying it very clear, you know,  we're going to get, you know, more than two percent growth, three percent  growth, you know, that GDP number that you're seeing from Gary Cohn, the  Economic Adviser to the President.</p><p>DAVID NELSON, ASSET MANAGEMENT CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE:  Yes.</p><p>CASONE:  But a lot are questioning if those growth, those projections can  be doable if you don't have, you know, what's happening in Congress if you  don't have healthcare or tax reform at all.</p><p>NELSON:  OK.  But on the other side of that, Cheryl, I think for a lot of  portfolio managers like myself, all the way back when the healthcare vote  failed in the House the first time.  We kind of understood that it was  going to be a long slog, and that the agenda from the administration was  going to take a lot longer than initially we had thought.</p><p>I kind of thought it was a mistake to leave with healthcare.  I thought tax  reform was the better way to go.  It certainly had some bipartisan support.   And even Jamie Dimon spoke about that on the conference call last Friday.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>NELSON:  How uncompetitive corporate rates are.  Well, basically,  offshoring or manufacturing or cash flow.  And in some cases, we're  actually are destroying the company themselves and with the financial  engineering like an inversion.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  But really quick, David, with Goldman Sachs, there is  movement.  We're going to talk about this later.</p><p>NELSON:  Sure.</p><p>CASONE:  There's movement in the House to put through at the budget  proposal</p><p>NELSON:  Yes.</p><p>CASONE:  But within it, there's some regulatory proposals that would  actually push through tax reform.  I don't want to get in the weeds because  I don't want to put our viewers to sleep.  It's incredibly boring.  But, I  mean, this could be the savior for tax reform.</p><p>NELSON:  It could be at least a start, and I think they're going to have to  approach this on an incremental level.  Look, the tax code is 77,000 pages.   Unwinding it in a broad sweeping bill, that's going to take some time.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Bring on Paul Ryan.  More pressure for him, Lori.  But, you  know, that's the thing in investors and traders on the floor of they  exchange.  Obviously, if we get down to -- I don't know, maybe October,  November and we don't have anything pushing through on tax reform, I'm  wondering if that's when you're going to see the volume pick up and that's  going to be selling pressure.</p><p>ROTHMAN:  So, you know, don't forget, Cheryl, it's been months, right,  since Wall Street has been hinging so much of its confidence on what comes  out of the administration.  In the meantime, don't forget we have had some  pretty good earnings, some pretty good economic news, broader picture right  in the middle of earnings season.</p><p>You know, I was talking earlier about the mixed of report from the  Financials but, you know, we're going to hear from some of the big tech  heavyweights tonight on IBM.  Of course, I'm forgetting to even remind you  about Netflix blowing away the street last night, Netflix alone.</p><p>CASONE:  Oh, I'm all over it.</p><p>ROTHMAN:  It is keeping the Nasdaq in record territory.  I mean, Nasdaq is  poised supposed in the record.</p><p>CASONE:  I'm so sorry, Lori, we've got to go back to Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell speaking on Capitol Hill.  Let's listen to him.</p><p>MITCH MCCONNELL, (R-KY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  -- to vote for a  replacement for Obamacare.  Consequently, sometime in the near future,  we'll have a vote on repealing Obamacare, essentially, the same vote that  we had in 2015.</p><p>I would remind everyone that, in that proposal, there's a two-year delay, a  two-year delay, which would give us the opportunity to work out a complete  replacement on a bipartisan basis with our Democratic friends.</p><p>So, that's a vote I think we're very likely to have in the very near  future.</p><p>JOHN CORNYN III, (R) SENATOR, TEXAS:  We've got a sense of what the future  might look like if we are unsuccessful in repealing and replacing  Obamacare.  We saw for the second time in a few days, Democratic senators  coming to the floor asking for tens of billions of dollars and tax dollars  for insurance company bailouts.  No reform, no change in the status quo.   And after seven years I think we can safely conclude that the structure of  Obamacare is a failed experiment.</p><p>That's why we want to change the structure of the healthcare delivery  system as we stabilize markets, protect people from premium increases and  preexisting condition exclusions.  We're going to continue down that road  because the alternative, I fear, is going to be a Democratic effort  strictly to bail out insurance companies with no reform whatsoever.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  After seven years of Obamacare, the American public  knows what they have.  They have fewer choices.  They have higher premiums  and less control over their own healthcare.  Number of years ago, I voted  to do a repeal of the Obama health care law.  I'm ready to make that  complete repeal vote again.</p><p>But, of course, that's not enough, the people of Wyoming want more than  that.  They want to be able to buy the insurance that they want that works  right for them, not what the federal government in Washington, D.C. says  they have to buy.  So, I'm ready to vote to repeal.</p><p>We need a medical system not just as good as it was before Obamacare was  passed but we need a medical system and a healthcare system in the country  even better than that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think the only thing I could add in this discussion  is at some point we need to figure out and find out where the votes are.   This is an important work to be done.  It affects families.  It affects  health care.  We need to find out where the votes are.  But there are other  things we need to do too.</p><p>The President this week is talking about manufacturing made in America, if  you could pay the utility bill, if the transportation system works.  Those  are the two boxes you check when you start talking about jobs.  We all know  the best place to get an insurance is still at work where somebody else  does negotiations, somebody else reads the policy.  Ways that more people  could get insurance at work is important.  Tax structure is important.</p><p>This has had a considerable amount of time spent on it, and sooner rather  than later we need to find out where the Senate is and move forward.</p><p>CORY GARDNER, (R) SENATOR, COLORADO:  There are a lot of people out there  today who seem to be spiking the football, trying to celebrate a moment.   But for now, it seems to leave the Affordable Care Act in place for today.   But let me tell you what happens if you continue to spike the football.  In  the State of Colorado last week, it was announced the average premium rate  increase for the next year will be 27 percent.  But that's if you're lucky  enough to live in the front range of Colorado.</p><p>If you live in the eastern plains or the western slope, you're going to pay  30 percent more.  You're going to pay 40 percent more.  That's spiking the  football on the American people who will continue to pay more under the  Affordable Care Act that is collapsing.</p><p>We will continue our work to get our job done to make sure that the status  quo no longer stands and instead we provide relief to the American people.</p><p>MCCONNELL:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You went through an arrangement of your bill, and we've  heard from some your members that they were very critical to process, and  some were critical for Senator Johnson who was specifically critical so  that reach the process.  Do you feel that you and your leadership have been  damaged in this process and that now you can actually -- after this across  considering those criticisms that you heard?</p><p>MCCONNELL:  Well, you know, this has been a very, very challenging  experience for all of us.  It's pretty obvious that we don't have 50  members who can agree on a replacement.  A lot of people have been involved  in the discussion and very passionate discussions.</p><p>But everybody is giving it their best shot.  And as of today, we simply do  not have 50 senators who can agree on what ought to replace the existing  law.  What we do have is a vote that many of us made two years ago, at the  time when the President of the United States would not sign the legislation  that would repeal Obamacare.  And with a two-year delay give us an  opportunity to build something better on a bipartisan basis.  That's what I  sense most of our members would like to vote on now, and we'll be doing  that in the near future.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(OFF-MIC)</p><p>MCCONNELL:  Nancy (ph).</p><p>NANCY:  You don't appear currently to have the vote for that repeal and  replace.  If that vote fails, will you then begin working with Democrats?</p><p>MCCONNELL:  Well, I think we'll have to see what happens.  We will have  demonstrated that Republicans by themselves are not prepared at this  particular point to do a replacement.  And that doesn't mean that the  problems all go away, and you'll have to look at our committee chairman and  their ranking members.</p><p>My suspicion is there will be hearings about the crisis that we have, and  we'll have to see what the way forward is.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE) and in seven months, that is wasted.  There  is no accomplishment.  How can we explain this to voters next year if we  don't do (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>MCCONNELL:  Well, we have a new Supreme Court Justice.  We have 14 repeals  of regulations, and we're only six months into it.  Last time I looked,  Congress goes on for two years.  We'll be moving onto comprehensive tax  reform and the infrastructure.  There's much work left to be done for the  American people and we're ready to tackle it.  Thanks.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thanks a lot.</p><p>(OFF-MIC)</p><p>CASONE:  We don't have the votes.  That was Senate Majority Leader Mitch  McConnell saying that they do not have 50 senators that can agree on what  to replace Obamacare with.  They all want to repeal it.  Well, most of them  do but the majority can't agree on the replacement.</p><p>In particular, he said -- and this is what Senator Cornyn said as well.   You know, many of these senators wanted repeal.  Cory Gardner is talking  about the crisis in Colorado with the healthcare exchanges that, you know,  each of the senators has to go home at some point in August and face  constituents that are dealing with these healthcare exchanges that are  frankly falling apart.</p><p>I want to say really quick here, and you mentioned tax reform when you look  at the Dow really quick, when McConnell started to talk, the Dow was down  more than 60 points.  We're backing up that just a little bit.  So, there's  a little bit of a pullback but markets certainly are watching every single  word that we get out of Washington.  The word is we don't have the votes.   Repeal and replace Obamacare is not going to happen.</p><p>All right.  Let's bring back with me Patrice Lee Onwuka.  She is a senior  policy analyst at the Independent Women's Forum.  David Nelson is still  with me.  Ashley Hayek and Neil Sroka are back as well.  Guys, thank you  very much for sticking around.  Patrice, I want to go to you first.  You  know, at least he said, OK, next is tax reform.</p><p>What alarmed me though that McConnell just said at some point we're going  to have hearings on Capitol Hill about the failure of Obamacare.  My first  reaction is was that going to cost the American taxpayer?  Don't we need to  just move on to tax reform?</p><p>PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM:  I  mean, it would be ideal, 61 percent of Americans want their middle class  tax break.  They want a tax cuts.  And so, I think it inspires confidence  in the markets, in businesses and the American people when we can deliver  something that going to stimulate the economy.</p><p>CASONE:  You know, Neil, you had Senator Barrasso saying it, Senator Blunt  saying it.  They've got to have a conversation.  They got to go back in  within their ranks and figure out, Neil, what went wrong?  But I know that  you think a lot has gone wrong with the Republicans.</p><p>SROKA:  Yes.  And what went wrong is they had no plan at all.  And let's be  serious here.  The tax reform plans that we're starting to hear come out of  House are not a middle-class tax cut.  They are a giant giveaway to  millionaires, billionaires.  And I think are going to cut social security,  Medicare and Medicaid benefits potentially for millions of Americans.</p><p>So, if you want to talk about a tax plan that's going to be disastrous but  they are overwhelming majority of American people.  That's exactly what  we're seeing, kind of --</p><p>CASONE:  I don't agree with that.  I know that David does not agree as  well.  I'm sorry, Neil.</p><p>NELSON:  Yes I think this is exactly what I would expect from the left.   It's an overreaction here.  I think from the health care package -- on the  health care package, look, Obamacare largely failed because it was owned  only by the Democrats.</p><p>This failed because it's only owned by the Republicans.  They're going to  have to actually talk to each other.  And I think that's what the American  people expect.  We going to have to sit down at the table and negotiate  this out.  Because just owning it on one side or the other isn't going to  do it.  Both sides need on.</p><p>SROKA:  They spent seven months trying to have a conversation about health  care.  And the fact of the matter is Republicans do not have a plan.</p><p>NELSON:  This was a plan.  Obamacare was passed in the middle of the night.   Give me a break.</p><p>CASONE:  And I think we have --</p><p>SROKA: -- four months in open forums.  I'm going to be really looking  forward to seeing what the open discussions are like.</p><p>CASONE:  OK.</p><p>SROKA:  All across the country --</p><p>NELSON:  So, let's hear it.</p><p>SROKA: --we got a brush fire of millions of Americans who hate everything  that the Republican Party is proposing.</p><p>ONWUKA:  Well, let me jump in and say here.</p><p>CASONE:  All right.  Well, I forgot.  I'm so sorry.  I want to listen to  Senator Chuck Schumer, he's at podium.  Stand by.</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) SENATOR, NEW YORK:  Thank you.  And I'm proud to be  joined by Senators Klobuchar and Heinrich.</p><p>Now, it's getting clearer and clearer that Senate Republicans won't be able  to pass either their bill or a backup plan of repeal without replacement.</p><p>We Democrats believe that the time has finally come for our Republican  colleagues to take us up on our offer of working together to improve the  health care system rather than sabotage it.  Evidently, President Trump is  proposing a different path.  He wants to throw up his hands rather than  roll up his sleeves to work with us and solve the problem.  But let's be  very clear about what the President is proposing and where his path would  lead.</p><p>The President would not be, \"letting Obamacare collapse.\"  He is actively,  actively trying undermined the health care system in this country using  millions of Americans as political pawns in a cynical game.  By continuing  to deny the insurance markets their certainty that they need to function,  the President is playing a dangerous game with the health care of this  country.</p><p>So our Republican colleagues here in the Senate have a choice to make.   They can follow the President down a path that will lead to higher  premiums, less care, and millions of Americans losing coverage.  They can  join President Trump in trying to sabotage the system and hurt millions of  innocent Americans to try and make a political point that has failed  already, or they can start today working with Democrats.</p><p>We can work together to lower premiums.  We can work together to stabilize  the markets.  We can work together to improve the quality of health care.   This isn't a radical idea.  A group of 11 Republican and Democratic  governors called for exactly the kind of bipartisan cooperation that we are  calling for, a bipartisan group of governors.</p><p>We Democrats have held the door to bipartisanship open to our Republican  colleagues for months.  It's time for the Republicans to walk through it.   Senator Klobuchar?</p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR, (D) SENATOR, MINNESOTA:  Thank you very much, Senator  Schumer, and thank you so much for the work you've done.</p><p>CASONE:  OK, we want to -- we break out really quick.  Just want to recap  here.  We just heard from Senator Schumer, the time has come, basically.   He's offering once again to work with the Republican leaders to come up  with something that will fix.  I mean there's one thing that we can see  between the Democrats and Republicans.  They both agree the exchanges are  failing.</p><p>But do you let those fail with nothing to back up the American people that  still require health care?  Wanted to get to Senator Schumer's comments, is  bipartisanship possible in all of this?</p><p>I want to back in our panel.  I got Patrice Lee Onwuka with me as well as  David Nelson is here, Ashley Hayek still with me, Neil Sroka is with me.   He's got have something to say I'm sure.  Also I want to bring in if we  can, Gregg Jarrett from the Fox News Channel to talk about the legalities  of all this.  And Gregg welcome to you.  First to you on this, what we're  saying now is another olive branch from Schumer.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL:  Right.</p><p>CASONE:  On, you know, on the surface, anyway.</p><p>JARRETT:  Well, he says the door is open, yes.  It's open, but for only one  thing.  Do it our way or we won't cooperate with anything you want to do.   So, it's not much of a door sort of like a doggie door you got to crawl  through.  And it's an impossibility for Republicans who are diametrically  opposed to Democrats.</p><p>So, you know, and this is Chuck, I'd walk a mile for a camera Schumer who  is, you know, doing his thing.  And it's a bit of a charade.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, Neil, I mean let's talk about the reality of this, because  what Senator Schumer says, is we're going to -- we're willing to come to  the table, willing to talk to you.  But what can he offer that's not going  to get rejected by the Republicans because even the Republicans came up  with a plan to replace Obamacare.  That the CBO said was more expensive  than what the House had proposed.</p><p>SROKA:  Yes.  Well, it's a good question, what can the Republicans meet at  Democrats in the middle of the table.  The fact of the matter is the way  that we actually fixed many of the problems that do exist with Obamacare is  by the very least providing a public option if not moving to Medicare for  all program overall which is actually the way that we're going to cut the  cost curve and bend that cost curve in health insurance.  And that provide  health insurance for millions of Americans.</p><p>In lieu of that, let's actually have real negotiation in an open  discussion.  If Republicans want to meet Democrats somewhere in the middle,  there is certain way to do that and that's called the public option.</p><p>CASONE:  Ashley, do you think after what we've seen play out in the last  hour in particular with the failure of McConnell to get the votes that the  Republican leaders are not going to realize that they do need to work in a  bipartisan way with Democrats?  Do you think that's possible?</p><p>HAYEK:  Let's see really clear.  The Democrats don't want a bipartisan  effort.  They've never wanted to buy bipartisan effort to try and work with  this President.  It's only criticisms critiques.  The hypocrisy that we've  seen from the left is absolutely unreal.  Premiums are going to continue to  go up under Obamacare.  People who are being, \"forced out\" of the health  care by not repealing Obamacare and people who are forced into a health  care plan that didn't work for their families.</p><p>So, what you're going to see is more people are going to hurt and  unfortunately because we weren't able to repeal the health care, Obamacare,  and we aren't able to help with anything right now, it's going to continue  to just hurt the American people.</p><p>CASONE:  David, what I'm concerned about right now is it's from the  investment side of this.</p><p>NELSON:  Sure.</p><p>CASONE:  I mean, these insurance companies, I mean, yes, like, I can do  some UnitedHealthcare today, great on the earnings.  They're not to be  exchanging.</p><p>NELSON:  But they got a plan.  Yes exactly.</p><p>CASONE:  They're not in Obamacare.  So, take them out of the problem.  You  got Aetna, Humana, these are companies that are -- they've clearly said we  can't afford to stay.  But we have nothing to fix it.</p><p>NELSON:  When you look line-item by line-item, you can see why companies  like UnitedHealthcare, they are not in the business of losing money.  And  Neil said it.  I mean, look at what this is all about in the first place.   It opened up a Pandora's box, the Affordable Care Act.  They always wanted  a single payer plan, that's where they're trying to go.</p><p>CASONE:  Do you think we're going single payer?</p><p>SROKA:  At Medicare for all programs is exactly what corporate America  wants.  If you actually look over in Canada, corporations love their  Medicare program that provides insurance at a much lower cost for everyone  else.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  Neil, Neil, I disagree with that.  There are many -- we many CEO's  that come on to Fox Business and they want healthy employees and not  necessarily a single payer system actually.</p><p>HAYEH:  Exactly.</p><p>CASONE:  Do you disagree with that.  And I can totally disagree with that.</p><p>Patrice, Patrice I do want to bring you in.  I'm sorry Patrice.  But, you  know, come on in Patrice, I want to ask you about that because the single- payer system, we keep talking about that possibility.  Is that now though a  reality?</p><p>ONWUKA:  I mean it seems increasingly like we might be moving in that  direction.  But I hope we don't because when we look at Obamacare and the  expansion of Medicaid, we have people who have insurance cards but it's  putting pressure on a system by overloading the system.</p><p>And unfortunately the people who actually need -- the most vulnerable  people who need help are the ones who are not able to see the doctors in a  timely manner.  So to Medicare for our single-payer system is not the  solution to real quality care for people.</p><p>CASONE:  OK.  OK.  Gregg Jarrett I got about10 seconds, your final  thoughts.</p><p>JARRETT:  There's one other possibility.  Repeal Obamacare and then give  all of the money earmarked for Medicaid to the states to devise their own  plans state by state.  I talked to a veteran on Capitol Hill --</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>JARRETT: -- over the weekend who said that is actually gaining some  strength, it's a real possibility.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE:  And all of you, thank you so much.  We are going to take a quick  break, a lot of breaking news on the show.  We're going to take a quick  commercial break.  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, turmoil over health care expected to only create more  gridlock in Washington.  And that is something that J.P. Morgan, CEO Jamie  Dimon is fed up with.  And he is blaming the media telling reporters, \"Why  you guys don't write about it every day is completely beyond me.\"  So, is  he right?  Well, let's bring in Howard Kurtz, Host of Media Buzz.  Howard,  you have written about his comment, great article by the way.  But --</p><p>HOWARD KURTZ, MEDIA BUZZ HOST:  Thank you.</p><p>CASONE:  -- is he right?</p><p>KURTZ:  Well, most Americans would say he's right.  Why can't we do  something about the partisan paralysis in Washington?  The reason it's not  written and talked about more is that it's been going on for 20 years, Bush  administration, Obama administration, Trump administration.  It's like  saying that Washington is a real human place in July.</p><p>And when you have all this polarization, more polarized parties, more  polarized members, more polarized districts, constituents, more polarized  media and social media now and you added to a subject that is difficult and  treaties as health care, the result is what we have today, nothing gets  done.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, here is the thing.  You've got so many story lines going on  right now.  A lot great in chaos, I'm thinking Donald Trump, Jr. for  instance about a meeting that happened a year ago that's, you know, now  we're talking hearings and appearances and thing.  I mean, does Jamie Dimon  have a point that the media needs to refocus on the actual policy debate in  Washington?  Which is what they voted on last year, which is tax reform  that is health care, and get away from the noise?</p><p>KURTZ:  He has an absolute point.  We are so addicted to scandal which is  not to say that some of these stories aren't legitimate and shouldn't be  covered.  But the -- a media oxygen consumed by the side shows, the silly  stuff, you know, good at handshake with the First Lady of France really  crowds out a lot of the more serious look at taxes infrastructure, things  that Americans really care about.  I think we are all guilty to some degree  about that on that point.  The others getting more ratings and clicks but  it can be frustrating.  I think a lot of people are kind of tuning us out  for that very reason.</p><p>CASONE:  It, you know, it's interesting as, you know, a journalist my self  and someone that's worked in different places, I mean, you have to kind of  wonder though, if some of our colleagues are making grave mistakes here by  focusing on what is a sexy story, and focusing on something that is  salacious but doesn't help the country.  Doesn't that feed into what Dimon  is saying that reporters are getting it wrong?</p><p>KURTZ:  I think that is true.  I also think that some news outlets are tend  to be more serious and some sort of don't necessarily put up the big  numbers.  You know the words there is an audience for this other stuff.</p><p>And I think sometimes this President who is obviously fighting on the  issues creates so many of the distractions.  He goes after, you know, Joe  Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, we all go crazy for three days.  So, when  you put all those things in the pot, it's very frustrating for me as a  lifelong journalist that we don't have more laser focus on the stuff that  really touches people's lives as opposed to the gridlock and the bread and  circuses aspects.  I guess you would say in Washington.</p><p>CASONE:  Well, that's the thing.  If you copies other networks that are --  and I'm not going to call them up by name, but that are covering again, you  know, just making basically a 24/7 affair out of attacking President Trump  and his daughter and both sons and his grand kids, isn't he?  These are  people that have to take responsibility for the fact that they're also  derailing what matters which is the American life, which is American -- the  people that are here.</p><p>KURTZ:  I think they do have to take some responsibility.  The dirty little  secret in cable news is you don't need a big mass audience if you can get a  million dedicated people to watch them, that's good for your business, not  necessarily good for the country.</p><p>CASONE:  Howard Kurtz, Media Buzz, every Sunday, 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on  Fox News.  Howard, thank you.  And we will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CASONE:  Today, we have learned that the Senate Republican plan to repeal  and replace Obamacare just didn't have the votes.  And then later Senator  McConnell's plan for a vote for a straight repeal also didn't have the  votes.  Where are we going to go from here?  We're going to go Liz Claman  right now.  Liz over to you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

So obviously investors are waiting to see, the more you delay health care, the more you delay tax reform investors are going to, at some point, maybe sooner rather than later say OK as enough of this. But for now, the market is not, we're holding on but the Dow is down 72.</p><p>Well, hello everybody I am Cheryl Casone. And I'm in for Trish Regan today. I would like to welcome you to The Intelligence Report. Boy, there is a lot going on. A source close to Senate Majority Leader <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell </nameText></person>has just told <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>the Senator plans to go forward with a vote to repeal Obamacare first even if that vote fails.</p><p>Right now, it appears McConnell is well short of the votes he needs to debate, even debate the repeal bill after three Republican senators said that they're not -- they are going to vote no. So we're going to talk about what is next for healthcare. We are all over that story. And again, we're waiting for <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell.</nameText></person></p><p>Also this today, we're watching <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>getting back to his America first agenda. The administration just unveiling a new NAFTA plan aimed at shrinking our trade deficit with Canada and with Mexico but how exactly is this going to happen? How is this going to work? We've got the Intel for you on that.</p><p>But first I want to go back to Washington with Adam Shapiro. I think boondoggle at this point might be the word in my head Adam, with regards to what's going on with McConnell in the Senate right now.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, it certainly raises the question about how does leadership control its members. I mean, you've got the three Senators. Let's show you the baseball cards of threes who actually killed the effort to repeal. You have Susan Collins of Maine. She would have been a no vote, not only to debate but also on repeal. She did that in 2015. But you also have Lisa Murkowski from Alaska. She wouldn't even vote to proceed to debate, so she is a no. And then of course there's Shelley Moore Capito from West Virginia, she was a no. That was all it took but as you said there's an effort to perhaps maneuver this into a vote, just put everyone on the record and then move on.</p><p>It was <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>though, who said, look, the Republicans are not going to own this. This is going to be on the Democrats. Here is what he said just about an hour ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: Let Obamacare fail, it will be a lot easier. And I think we're probably in that position where we'll just let Obamacare fail. We're not going to own it. I'm not going to own it. I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it. We'll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us and they're going to say how do we fix it, how do we fix it or how do we come up with a new plan.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO: Well, the Democrats say they're open to working with Republicans on a fix but it can't include a repeal. So here is what Chuck Schumer, the minority leader said just moments ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER, SENATE MINORITY LEADER: Republicans propose surgery. The operation was a failure. Now Republicans are proposing a second surgery that will surely kill the patient. Medicine is needed, bipartisan medicine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO: So there seems to be agreement that the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare is not working, it needs to be fixed but getting these two sides together to fix it, good luck. Cheryl, back to you.</p><p>CASONE: Well, luck is really needed especially if you're <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell </nameText></person>right now. And we're waiting to hear from him Adam. Thank you for all the details on that.</p><p>You know, let's bring in for more analysis on all of this Republican Strategist, Ashley Hayek, Communications Director for Democracy in America -- for America. Excuse me, Neil Sroka and the Senior Writer at The Weekly Standard, John McCormack is here as well.</p><p>Guys, thank you so much for your time. So I mean this is, John, this is pretty wild what we're seeing going on. I mean, you talked about draining the swamp but <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell </nameText></person>seems to be losing more and more support every day. Is what we're going to see happen with the President just said just let it fail, let Obamacare fail, let it be done?</p><p>JOHN MCCORMACK, SENIOR WRITER OF THE WEEKLY STANDARD: You know, that's going to be really tough because what people seem to forget is that Obamacare is basically now synonymous with the individual insurance market. Remember, like your plan, you keep your plan, well that wasn't true. So people who are on the individual market, almost everyone in there have been affected by these very costly, very burdensome regulations. And, you know, to see Obamacare kind of go on and on to death spiral.</p><p>Listen, if totally true that this is being caused by bad legislation's passed by Democrats, but I think the voters are going to expect Republicans to get their act together, to actually fix the problem. And so I don't think they can really move on -- they might want to move on from healthcare but healthcare is not going to move on from them.</p><p>CASONE: Well, I mean, you know, this was something, Ashley, that the President wanted to see first. Let's do health care then we move to tax reform. Obviously, you know, in this tax reform in jeopardy, that is one question here but Ashley, at the same time, can they get anything done with regards to reform? If they can't even repeal it, does that mean that we have nothing, Ashley, on the table?</p><p>ASHLEY HAYEK, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Well, here is the problem, first and foremost, is the self-proclaimed conservatives. When premiums go up, they are going to cause a lot of things but these Republicans are not going to be called conservatives. And the next item absolutely tax reform. And if they can't get tax reform done, the base is going to lose. They're going to lose their stuff.</p><p>And one thing that dictates all of this is the market, the market, 17 percent, the market bought into -- in the economy and the market bought into the idea that our economy will do better with the repeal of Obamacare, cutting back on taxes. And when we're not able to repeal Obamacare, you're going to see effects long term. And it will come down to the seats in reelections.</p><p>CASONE: Neil, what do you make of the Republicans basically at this point, all signs reporting to failure to be able to do anything about Obamacare. We're not even talking Trumpcare, we're talking nothing, no movement, even if the repeal doesn't go anywhere, what does it point --</p><p>NEIL SROKA, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR OF DEMOCRACY FOR AMERICA: I think what you're seeing right now is that Republicans are fundamentally unable to govern. They were able to run for eight years on something and now they can't even pull that together. The fact to the matter is, is reason why they can't vote to end Obamacare is because Obamacare is increasingly popular with the American people. You look at West Virginia and Alaska, two of the states that just killed this repeal effort, even though <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>won handily in both of those states, both of those senators came out of this repeal bill because in those states, especially the Medicaid expansion portions of Obamacare are incredibly popular and needed.</p><p>CASONE: John, you cover Washington, you know, as journalist, I mean, I'm wondering if this is kind of, if politics as usual seems to be winning in all of this. And the reason I say that is because, you know, when <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>came into office there was this feeling that you know, he was elected on wave of populism. People wanted to put the country first, repeal Obamacare, replace it, et cetera, get tax reform done. It seems to me that the politics seems to be overtaking policy in all of this today.</p><p>MCCORMACK: Well, I think there is something to that, you know, there is a lot of bias towards the status quo. Remember, Democrats passed this bill with 60 votes in the Senate, and overwhelmingly majority in the House and President who won by very large margin. Republicans come in with much smaller majority and so it's a lot tougher to reverse this, once it's already in effect.</p><p>And Republicans also, you got to remember, you know, the President didn't run on the specific repeal and replace agenda, the House of Representatives and the senators, they also didn't have really specific idea in mind what they could come up with. And so you basically have both conservatives and moderates unhappy as well as all these procedural roadblocks. You know, there be special rules they have to abide by. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>was right when he said that it's much more difficult to pass this bill with these special rules rather than getting 60 votes as Democrats did back in 2009 and 2010.</p><p>SROKA: No.</p><p>CASONE: Go ahead, Neil.</p><p>SROKA: I'm sorry. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>right now is an impotent as leader of the Republican Party if he can't even get Republicans on board to repeal and replace Obamacare, something that Republicans have been running on close to a decade. The reality is, is Republicans care far more about tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires than they do about the lives of American people. And that's ultimately why they don't want to do anything on Obamacare.</p><p>CASONE: You know, Neil, I got to push back on that. You can never underestimate the power of <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>I mean he was underestimated as candidate.</p><p>SROKA: Agreed.</p><p>CASONE: He is -- he's when it comes to world politics or what's happening here at home. That's the thing, Ashley. You know, this President, we know he's going to barnstorm America, he has going to all across this country to fight for tax reform. Something many believe at least on Wall Street, he should have done first. But, you know, let's spilt milk at this point, Ashley. But he's going to go out and take it to the people for tax reform. Is that his win, not health care?</p><p>HAYEK: Tax reform is completely separate from healthcare. I think he has a huge opportunity here in that it's a fresh plate. And he also has the opportunity to expand tax credits that's going to help the middle and working class. It can help economic growth and is going to help small businesses grow. And that's going to ultimately help our economy.</p><p>SROKA: There's a reason --</p><p>HAYEK: They're going back to my initial point, is that yes, these senators had seven years to come up with a new plan. From day one <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has said we have to repeal Obamacare. And what the senators especially those so self-proclaimed conservative senators have done is absolutely nothing. And it is on their hands. They should have had something since they have had seven years to complain about it.</p><p>CASONE: Guys we're out of time but I think, you know, bipartisan way we can all agree that this is pretty much a mess. And that's a mess that the blame does fall, you got to say on the Republicans.</p><p>And again, we're waiting for <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell. </nameText></person>We'll see what he has to say about all of this. Maybe he can --he's got a trick up his he sleeve, we don't know yet. But at this point things aren't looking real good for this. Ashley, Neil, John, really appreciate your time today.</p><p>HAYEK: Thank you.</p><p>MCCORMACK: Thanks.</p><p>CASONE: All right. Well, joining me now with his thoughts on health care, former Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary, and Former President of Lilly USA, Alex Azar. Alex, what do you make of what you're seeing in Washington? It seems to be a mess from those of us watching from the sidelines right now?</p><p>ALEX AZAR, FORMER U.S. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPUTY SECRETARY: Well, it's an absolute mess, you're right. I'm astonished to that. It does appear that the Republican House and Senate will not pass anything even with the label repeal of Obamacare on it. That's going to be a tough road in 2018 as they go back to their core voters having to explain that. Bit I think McConnell may now still call a vote on straight repeal just as matter of accountability with members of his caucus.</p><p>CASONE: Sure.</p><p>AZAR: Just make them put it on record, so it's not cost-free. But I really think that there is not going to be legislative action at this point.</p><p>CASONE: OK --</p><p>AZAR: I mean, the hot potato has landed in Secretary Tom Price's lap.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, well, and that's -- here is the thing. I'm curious, what can Tom Price do? That is the question, if he is going to be left with Obamacare which the President and which many analysts say is failing, will fail, what can Price do so that you don't have millions of Americans left with nothing, sick Americans? That's the concern I think from a human perspective in all of this?</p><p>AZAR: So let's separate the two programs. On the Medicaid side you have got Seema Verma running CMS who's one of the leaders in reinventing Medicaid. I think you see increasing state flexibility change, devolution to states there on Medicaid.</p><p>On the individual insurance market side there's going to be a debate in the administration right now. The President said let it fail I don't know fully what that means. There -- this program is failing because of inherently how the rate structure and the risk pooling was set up in it. So it's going to keep going down. The question is, does the administration actually pull the plug on to patient or they put it in hospice and try to make it a little better? There are things the secretary can do to actually save Obamacare from many of the very mistakes that Obama himself is and his administration imposed on the program.</p><p>CASONE: Would he -- we don't have a lot of time, but would he have the power to deal with lawsuits? And I say that because tort reform is something that so many were screaming about back in 2008 when this, when Obamacare was passed without half of Congress reading it, tort reform and maybe state to state competition for insurance companies. If you're going to have people in states with no exchanges, no options, is that something that Price can do from a legal perspective? I honestly don't know?</p><p>AZAR: I think very little the secretary can do in terms of tort reform actually lead those efforts for President Bush in his administration. Very little the President can do unilaterally without legislation there. And also interstate sale of insurance also, I think little the secretary can do but what he can do is grant waivers to states to create much more flexibility in his exchanges. I would do a top to bottom comprehensive rewrite of the regulations of Obamacare, imposing as much free market, localized flexibility as humanly possible. Even then the rate structure is just broken. And that's in the statute and that's not -- that he can't fix.</p><p>CASONE: Alex, I agree with you 100 percent. It's something I couldn't believe it wasn't in the first bill and here we are today with this mess that is these exchanges that are just falling apart. Alex, thank you very much.</p><p>AZAR: Great, thank you.</p><p>CASONE: Appreciate it.</p><p>Well, you know, the President has got a few things on the agenda. He is getting back to his America first agenda. He has outlined a new plan for renegotiating NAFTA. That was -- remember, one of his biggest campaign promises. But can he do it? We're going to talk about the legality of that, coming up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Are we going to allow other countries to break the rules, steal our jobs and drain our wealth, and it has been drained, it has been drained.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Well, the White House unveiling its plan to update the decade old NAFTA deal following through on one of <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>biggest campaign promise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: No longer are we going to allow other countries to break the rules, steal our jobs and drain our wealth. And it has been drained. It has been drained.</p><p>We're going to end up having a level playing field. I don't want to say anymore than a level but if the playing field we're slanted like a little bit toward us I would accept that also, OK?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: OK, I want (INAUDIBLE) right now. We want to take you live right now to Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. He is speaking. Let's listen in.</p><p>RAND PAUL, (R) SENATOR, KENTUCKY: You saw what happened around here six years ago with the committee and that never worked up. There have been many ideas for how we get more people in our country insurance. For example, 27 million people don't have insurance right now under Obamacare. The estimates are that 50 percent of those 27 million don't get it because it's too expensive. It's too expensive because of the Obamacare regulations. The death spiral of Obamacare is regulations, make insurance expensive and then you say oh, but you can get it after you're sick. That is the real problem. That has the whole problem we have. It's the adverse selection and the death spiral. That's what we need to fix. We don't have enough votes to repeal all of that. So we're going to have to move forward. And I'm favor in moving forward with partial repeal and continuing to work on trying to get rid of the rest of the bad elements of that Obamacare that have driven prices up.</p><p>Thanks, guys.</p><p>(OFF-MIC)</p><p>PAUL: No, I'm for a vote that succeeds. And I think those Republicans who promised to repeal Obamacare ought to vote the same way they voted in 2015. If you're not willing to vote the same way you voted in 2015, then you need to go back home, you need to explain to Republicans why you're no longer for repealing Obamacare. Thanks.</p><p>CASONE: OK. So what he is saying basically, and this is what we learned earlier today is that Senator <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell, </nameText></person>Senate Majority Leader <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell </nameText></person>does intend to hold a vote to proceed on straight repeal. OK, that's the questions that the reporters were asking of Senator Rand Paul. And he's -- that's what he has wanted entire time. He has been on Fox Business. He says on air saying, repeal. That is that, that is what he promised his constituency.</p><p>He also says, remember back in 2015, there was a move by the Senate to try and at least repeal some parts of Obamacare, do repeal President Barack Obama at the time though of course vetoed that. So it was kind of a symbolic move if you will by the Republicans.</p><p>Senators at the time, he is saying, hey, if the way that you voted in 2015 is how you feel, that's how you vote now. But remember, Senator Susan Collins, Senator Lisa Murkowski, they are saying no. They are not going to vote for repeal. They don't want to leave the American public with nothing. Many say though you repeal it, you give it couple of years, Senator Rand Paul saying this is a death spiral. The regulation, regulatory burdens of Obamacare which many analysts agree with is unacceptable for the American people.</p><p>I do want to bring in right now Nick Adams. He is the Founder and Executive Director of the Foundation for Liberty and American Greatness. You know, here's the thing, Nick. We're fighting back and forth about what to do and it comes down to politics versus policy. What we're seeing play out right now with these U.S. senators, the Republican Party is to me, politics as the midterms are approaching. What see you about that?</p><p>NICK ADAMS, FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE FOUNDATION FOR LIBERTY AND AMERICAN GREATNESS: Cheryl, look, you summed it up very well. It's definitely is a battle between politics and policy. There is absolutely no reason that the Republicans shouldn't be able to pass this. This is what they ran on. This is what they owe <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>And I think it's incredibly disappointing that we have so many Republicans that are just not coming to the table and not getting this done. And as a result I think this will have ramifications for future elections if they're not able to get together and do this.</p><p>CASONE: Well, that's why Senator Paul, not just now but earlier on Fox Business last week actually, had said, look, you know, I promised repeal. I'm not go back to my constituents if I'm not supporting repeal. The problem is McConnell is going to hold this vote. It's going to fail. So you're going to have the political backlash on the heads of these senators.</p><p>It would seem to me that at this point we're going to have nothing versus something. Now, politically that hurts the Republicans, yes?</p><p>ADAMS: Yes, that's right. And it's just amazing that it has come to this, Cheryl. I mean, they have had so long. They have had so much time. They've had such opportunity to prepare for this. And here we are. We went through this earlier this year. We're at this point again. And it's just tragic to see the Republicans perpetually snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. And I think the American people have every right to be incredibly disappointed by the display that the Republicans are putting on.</p><p>They're showing themselves to be Lily Livered. They're showing themselves to have jellyfish backs and really <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has got to be absolutely wringing his hands here because he's got some Republicans that were elected really on back of his popularity that are just not doing the right thing.</p><p>CASONE: You know, and it's true, and I think that the President is making it very clear that it is on the shoulders of those they are failing to support Republican efforts to repeal, replace or just repeal Obamacare.</p><p>Before I let you go, obviously, we are a business network. And investors have been -- these markets have been hitting record after record. Twenty- five records I think now for the Dow. I might be wrong. I men, that is an incredible streak for these markets. But the fear now, that ends when we finally see that the Trump agenda is in trouble. At what point do you think we hit that marker, Nick?</p><p>ADAMS: Well, look, Cheryl, I wouldn't be too worried right now. I think it's still time to be popping champagne, corks and the like. I think that we've got a president here who's been the best President since Ronald Reagan. I think that we've got a president that's putting Americans first. I think the markets are going to continue to respond to that. I suspect confidence, consumer confidence, constituent confidence, is all going to continue to rise. So I wouldn't be expecting any kind of change anytime soon.</p><p>CASONE: An Australian guy that believes in the American dream. Nick, it's always great to have you on the show. Thank you.</p><p>ADAMS: Always a pleasure, Cheryl Casone.</p><p>CASONE: Nick Adams, of course, who we should say is an American citizen now. Thank you, Nick. Great to have you on.</p><p>All right. We'll talk about the markets. You know, look, there are the health care stocks that we're watching like United Health Group. OK, they came out with earnings this morning that they're out of the exchanges but, you know, look, anything that happens with regards to health care, Obamacare will affect all names we're seeing on your screen. Aetna and Cigna, Humana is down, United Health Group, low, bucking the trend but that is piece we should say of earnings coming up this morning.</p><p>Take a look at Netflix, blowout quarter for that stock last night, jumped 10 percent. Now, it's up 14 percent right now. You just can't stop Netflix. Subscriber growth internationally, domestically really killing it for Netflix. This stock is on a roll, up more than 23 bucks right now.</p><p>We're going to be talking about your money when we come back.</p><p>CASONE: Turmoil over healthcare putting pressure on our markets. Investors are concerned about what this all is going to mean for the Trump administration's plans for tax reform and other pro-growth initiatives. All of this as Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are dragging on the markets after they reported earnings this morning, both of the banks trading pressure, investment banking pressure of Goldman Sachs. All of that factoring in of course and then the Fed interest rates kind of help Bank of America but not enough.</p><p>Let's bring in for analysis, Belpointe Asset Management Chief Strategist David Nelson. He is here in our studio, Lori Rothman down on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Lori, to you first, about the bank numbers.</p><p>LORI ROTHMAN, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CONTRIBUTOR: Right. OK. So it's kind of a surprise from Goldman Sachs, Cheryl. So Financial is because of this disappointing Goldman numbers are leading the S&amp;P lower at this hour. Forty percent decline in trading revenue. Now for Goldman Sachs, trading will mean that's the bread and butter. That's what they're known for, right? So, that kind of decline is pretty shocking.</p><p>Bank of America on the other hand, did OK. Rising interest rates really helping the Bank of America because, you know, they have a lot interest rate sensitive, mortgage holdings also a lot of consumer deposits. So higher rates mean more profit for a company like Bank of America. There, you see those shares are down half a percent, likely being dragged lower by brother (ph) weakness as I mentioned in Goldman Sachs.</p><p>And of course, the big picture today which this healthcare gridlock in Washington. All right here on the floor, zeroed in on the Trump administration and what is going to happen next with healthcare. And down the road what it means for the Trump administration's plans for tax reform, infrastructure spending. I mean, it's very interesting, right? You've got materials names, energy names all lower because of that concerns that we won't get this economic shot in the arm that the President had been talking about with the latest hiccup in healthcare, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. And, you know, Lori, you bring up the point about growth, you know, economic growth. And David, that's the concern here. You know, you've got particularly Gary Cohn has been saying it very clear, you know, we're going to get, you know, more than two percent growth, three percent growth, you know, that GDP number that you're seeing from Gary Cohn, the Economic Adviser to the President.</p><p>DAVID NELSON, ASSET MANAGEMENT CHIEF STRATEGIST, BELPOINTE: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: But a lot are questioning if those growth, those projections can be doable if you don't have, you know, what's happening in Congress if you don't have healthcare or tax reform at all.</p><p>NELSON: OK. But on the other side of that, Cheryl, I think for a lot of portfolio managers like myself, all the way back when the healthcare vote failed in the House the first time. We kind of understood that it was going to be a long slog, and that the agenda from the administration was going to take a lot longer than initially we had thought.</p><p>I kind of thought it was a mistake to leave with healthcare. I thought tax reform was the better way to go. It certainly had some bipartisan support. And even <person><nameText>Jamie Dimon </nameText></person>spoke about that on the conference call last Friday.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>NELSON: How uncompetitive corporate rates are. Well, basically, offshoring or manufacturing or cash flow. And in some cases, we're actually are destroying the company themselves and with the financial engineering like an inversion.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. But really quick, David, with Goldman Sachs, there is movement. We're going to talk about this later.</p><p>NELSON: Sure.</p><p>CASONE: There's movement in the House to put through at the budget proposal</p><p>NELSON: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: But within it, there's some regulatory proposals that would actually push through tax reform. I don't want to get in the weeds because I don't want to put our viewers to sleep. It's incredibly boring. But, I mean, this could be the savior for tax reform.</p><p>NELSON: It could be at least a start, and I think they're going to have to approach this on an incremental level. Look, the tax code is 77,000 pages. Unwinding it in a broad sweeping bill, that's going to take some time.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. Bring on Paul Ryan. More pressure for him, Lori. But, you know, that's the thing in investors and traders on the floor of they exchange. Obviously, if we get down to -- I don't know, maybe October, November and we don't have anything pushing through on tax reform, I'm wondering if that's when you're going to see the volume pick up and that's going to be selling pressure.</p><p>ROTHMAN: So, you know, don't forget, Cheryl, it's been months, right, since Wall Street has been hinging so much of its confidence on what comes out of the administration. In the meantime, don't forget we have had some pretty good earnings, some pretty good economic news, broader picture right in the middle of earnings season.</p><p>You know, I was talking earlier about the mixed of report from the Financials but, you know, we're going to hear from some of the big tech heavyweights tonight on IBM. Of course, I'm forgetting to even remind you about Netflix blowing away the street last night, Netflix alone.</p><p>CASONE: Oh, I'm all over it.</p><p>ROTHMAN: It is keeping the Nasdaq in record territory. I mean, Nasdaq is poised supposed in the record.</p><p>CASONE: I'm so sorry, Lori, we've got to go back to Senate Majority Leader <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell </nameText></person>speaking on Capitol Hill. Let's listen to him.</p><p><person><nameText>MITCH MCCONNELL, </nameText></person>(R-KY) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: -- to vote for a replacement for Obamacare. Consequently, sometime in the near future, we'll have a vote on repealing Obamacare, essentially, the same vote that we had in 2015.</p><p>I would remind everyone that, in that proposal, there's a two-year delay, a two-year delay, which would give us the opportunity to work out a complete replacement on a bipartisan basis with our Democratic friends.</p><p>So, that's a vote I think we're very likely to have in the very near future.</p><p>JOHN CORNYN III, (R) SENATOR, TEXAS: We've got a sense of what the future might look like if we are unsuccessful in repealing and replacing Obamacare. We saw for the second time in a few days, Democratic senators coming to the floor asking for tens of billions of dollars and tax dollars for insurance company bailouts. No reform, no change in the status quo. And after seven years I think we can safely conclude that the structure of Obamacare is a failed experiment.</p><p>That's why we want to change the structure of the healthcare delivery system as we stabilize markets, protect people from premium increases and preexisting condition exclusions. We're going to continue down that road because the alternative, I fear, is going to be a Democratic effort strictly to bail out insurance companies with no reform whatsoever.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: After seven years of Obamacare, the American public knows what they have. They have fewer choices. They have higher premiums and less control over their own healthcare. Number of years ago, I voted to do a repeal of the Obama health care law. I'm ready to make that complete repeal vote again.</p><p>But, of course, that's not enough, the people of Wyoming want more than that. They want to be able to buy the insurance that they want that works right for them, not what the federal government in Washington, D.C. says they have to buy. So, I'm ready to vote to repeal.</p><p>We need a medical system not just as good as it was before Obamacare was passed but we need a medical system and a healthcare system in the country even better than that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think the only thing I could add in this discussion is at some point we need to figure out and find out where the votes are. This is an important work to be done. It affects families. It affects health care. We need to find out where the votes are. But there are other things we need to do too.</p><p>The President this week is talking about manufacturing made in America, if you could pay the utility bill, if the transportation system works. Those are the two boxes you check when you start talking about jobs. We all know the best place to get an insurance is still at work where somebody else does negotiations, somebody else reads the policy. Ways that more people could get insurance at work is important. Tax structure is important.</p><p>This has had a considerable amount of time spent on it, and sooner rather than later we need to find out where the Senate is and move forward.</p><p>CORY GARDNER, (R) SENATOR, COLORADO: There are a lot of people out there today who seem to be spiking the football, trying to celebrate a moment. But for now, it seems to leave the Affordable Care Act in place for today. But let me tell you what happens if you continue to spike the football. In the State of Colorado last week, it was announced the average premium rate increase for the next year will be 27 percent. But that's if you're lucky enough to live in the front range of Colorado.</p><p>If you live in the eastern plains or the western slope, you're going to pay 30 percent more. You're going to pay 40 percent more. That's spiking the football on the American people who will continue to pay more under the Affordable Care Act that is collapsing.</p><p>We will continue our work to get our job done to make sure that the status quo no longer stands and instead we provide relief to the American people.</p><p>MCCONNELL: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You went through an arrangement of your bill, and we've heard from some your members that they were very critical to process, and some were critical for Senator Johnson who was specifically critical so that reach the process. Do you feel that you and your leadership have been damaged in this process and that now you can actually -- after this across considering those criticisms that you heard?</p><p>MCCONNELL: Well, you know, this has been a very, very challenging experience for all of us. It's pretty obvious that we don't have 50 members who can agree on a replacement. A lot of people have been involved in the discussion and very passionate discussions.</p><p>But everybody is giving it their best shot. And as of today, we simply do not have 50 senators who can agree on what ought to replace the existing law. What we do have is a vote that many of us made two years ago, at the time when the President of the United States would not sign the legislation that would repeal Obamacare. And with a two-year delay give us an opportunity to build something better on a bipartisan basis. That's what I sense most of our members would like to vote on now, and we'll be doing that in the near future.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(OFF-MIC)</p><p>MCCONNELL: Nancy (ph).</p><p>NANCY: You don't appear currently to have the vote for that repeal and replace. If that vote fails, will you then begin working with Democrats?</p><p>MCCONNELL: Well, I think we'll have to see what happens. We will have demonstrated that Republicans by themselves are not prepared at this particular point to do a replacement. And that doesn't mean that the problems all go away, and you'll have to look at our committee chairman and their ranking members.</p><p>My suspicion is there will be hearings about the crisis that we have, and we'll have to see what the way forward is.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) and in seven months, that is wasted. There is no accomplishment. How can we explain this to voters next year if we don't do (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>MCCONNELL: Well, we have a new Supreme Court Justice. We have 14 repeals of regulations, and we're only six months into it. Last time I looked, Congress goes on for two years. We'll be moving onto comprehensive tax reform and the infrastructure. There's much work left to be done for the American people and we're ready to tackle it. Thanks.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thanks a lot.</p><p>(OFF-MIC)</p><p>CASONE: We don't have the votes. That was Senate Majority Leader <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell </nameText></person>saying that they do not have 50 senators that can agree on what to replace Obamacare with. They all want to repeal it. Well, most of them do but the majority can't agree on the replacement.</p><p>In particular, he said -- and this is what Senator Cornyn said as well. You know, many of these senators wanted repeal. Cory Gardner is talking about the crisis in Colorado with the healthcare exchanges that, you know, each of the senators has to go home at some point in August and face constituents that are dealing with these healthcare exchanges that are frankly falling apart.</p><p>I want to say really quick here, and you mentioned tax reform when you look at the Dow really quick, when McConnell started to talk, the Dow was down more than 60 points. We're backing up that just a little bit. So, there's a little bit of a pullback but markets certainly are watching every single word that we get out of Washington. The word is we don't have the votes. Repeal and replace Obamacare is not going to happen.</p><p>All right. Let's bring back with me Patrice Lee Onwuka. She is a senior policy analyst at the Independent Women's Forum. David Nelson is still with me. Ashley Hayek and Neil Sroka are back as well. Guys, thank you very much for sticking around. Patrice, I want to go to you first. You know, at least he said, OK, next is tax reform.</p><p>What alarmed me though that McConnell just said at some point we're going to have hearings on Capitol Hill about the failure of Obamacare. My first reaction is was that going to cost the American taxpayer? Don't we need to just move on to tax reform?</p><p>PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: I mean, it would be ideal, 61 percent of Americans want their middle class tax break. They want a tax cuts. And so, I think it inspires confidence in the markets, in businesses and the American people when we can deliver something that going to stimulate the economy.</p><p>CASONE: You know, Neil, you had Senator Barrasso saying it, Senator Blunt saying it. They've got to have a conversation. They got to go back in within their ranks and figure out, Neil, what went wrong? But I know that you think a lot has gone wrong with the Republicans.</p><p>SROKA: Yes. And what went wrong is they had no plan at all. And let's be serious here. The tax reform plans that we're starting to hear come out of House are not a middle-class tax cut. They are a giant giveaway to millionaires, billionaires. And I think are going to cut social security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits potentially for millions of Americans.</p><p>So, if you want to talk about a tax plan that's going to be disastrous but they are overwhelming majority of American people. That's exactly what we're seeing, kind of --</p><p>CASONE: I don't agree with that. I know that David does not agree as well. I'm sorry, Neil.</p><p>NELSON: Yes I think this is exactly what I would expect from the left. It's an overreaction here. I think from the health care package -- on the health care package, look, Obamacare largely failed because it was owned only by the Democrats.</p><p>This failed because it's only owned by the Republicans. They're going to have to actually talk to each other. And I think that's what the American people expect. We going to have to sit down at the table and negotiate this out. Because just owning it on one side or the other isn't going to do it. Both sides need on.</p><p>SROKA: They spent seven months trying to have a conversation about health care. And the fact of the matter is Republicans do not have a plan.</p><p>NELSON: This was a plan. Obamacare was passed in the middle of the night. Give me a break.</p><p>CASONE: And I think we have --</p><p>SROKA: -- four months in open forums. I'm going to be really looking forward to seeing what the open discussions are like.</p><p>CASONE: OK.</p><p>SROKA: All across the country --</p><p>NELSON: So, let's hear it.</p><p>SROKA: --we got a brush fire of millions of Americans who hate everything that the Republican Party is proposing.</p><p>ONWUKA: Well, let me jump in and say here.</p><p>CASONE: All right. Well, I forgot. I'm so sorry. I want to listen to Senator Chuck Schumer, he's at podium. Stand by.</p><p>CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) SENATOR, NEW YORK: Thank you. And I'm proud to be joined by Senators Klobuchar and Heinrich.</p><p>Now, it's getting clearer and clearer that Senate Republicans won't be able to pass either their bill or a backup plan of repeal without replacement.</p><p>We Democrats believe that the time has finally come for our Republican colleagues to take us up on our offer of working together to improve the health care system rather than sabotage it. Evidently, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is proposing a different path. He wants to throw up his hands rather than roll up his sleeves to work with us and solve the problem. But let's be very clear about what the President is proposing and where his path would lead.</p><p>The President would not be, \"letting Obamacare collapse.\" He is actively, actively trying undermined the health care system in this country using millions of Americans as political pawns in a cynical game. By continuing to deny the insurance markets their certainty that they need to function, the President is playing a dangerous game with the health care of this country.</p><p>So our Republican colleagues here in the Senate have a choice to make. They can follow the President down a path that will lead to higher premiums, less care, and millions of Americans losing coverage. They can join <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>in trying to sabotage the system and hurt millions of innocent Americans to try and make a political point that has failed already, or they can start today working with Democrats.</p><p>We can work together to lower premiums. We can work together to stabilize the markets. We can work together to improve the quality of health care. This isn't a radical idea. A group of 11 Republican and Democratic governors called for exactly the kind of bipartisan cooperation that we are calling for, a bipartisan group of governors.</p><p>We Democrats have held the door to bipartisanship open to our Republican colleagues for months. It's time for the Republicans to walk through it. Senator Klobuchar?</p><p>AMY KLOBUCHAR, (D) SENATOR, MINNESOTA: Thank you very much, Senator Schumer, and thank you so much for the work you've done.</p><p>CASONE: OK, we want to -- we break out really quick. Just want to recap here. We just heard from Senator Schumer, the time has come, basically. He's offering once again to work with the Republican leaders to come up with something that will fix. I mean there's one thing that we can see between the Democrats and Republicans. They both agree the exchanges are failing.</p><p>But do you let those fail with nothing to back up the American people that still require health care? Wanted to get to Senator Schumer's comments, is bipartisanship possible in all of this?</p><p>I want to back in our panel. I got Patrice Lee Onwuka with me as well as David Nelson is here, Ashley Hayek still with me, Neil Sroka is with me. He's got have something to say I'm sure. Also I want to bring in if we can, Gregg Jarrett from the <person><nameText>Fox News </nameText></person>Channel to talk about the legalities of all this. And Gregg welcome to you. First to you on this, what we're saying now is another olive branch from Schumer.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, <person><nameText>FOX NEWS </nameText></person>CHANNEL: Right.</p><p>CASONE: On, you know, on the surface, anyway.</p><p>JARRETT: Well, he says the door is open, yes. It's open, but for only one thing. Do it our way or we won't cooperate with anything you want to do. So, it's not much of a door sort of like a doggie door you got to crawl through. And it's an impossibility for Republicans who are diametrically opposed to Democrats.</p><p>So, you know, and this is Chuck, I'd walk a mile for a camera Schumer who is, you know, doing his thing. And it's a bit of a charade.</p><p>CASONE: Well, Neil, I mean let's talk about the reality of this, because what Senator Schumer says, is we're going to -- we're willing to come to the table, willing to talk to you. But what can he offer that's not going to get rejected by the Republicans because even the Republicans came up with a plan to replace Obamacare. That the CBO said was more expensive than what the House had proposed.</p><p>SROKA: Yes. Well, it's a good question, what can the Republicans meet at Democrats in the middle of the table. The fact of the matter is the way that we actually fixed many of the problems that do exist with Obamacare is by the very least providing a public option if not moving to Medicare for all program overall which is actually the way that we're going to cut the cost curve and bend that cost curve in health insurance. And that provide health insurance for millions of Americans.</p><p>In lieu of that, let's actually have real negotiation in an open discussion. If Republicans want to meet Democrats somewhere in the middle, there is certain way to do that and that's called the public option.</p><p>CASONE: Ashley, do you think after what we've seen play out in the last hour in particular with the failure of McConnell to get the votes that the Republican leaders are not going to realize that they do need to work in a bipartisan way with Democrats? Do you think that's possible?</p><p>HAYEK: Let's see really clear. The Democrats don't want a bipartisan effort. They've never wanted to buy bipartisan effort to try and work with this President. It's only criticisms critiques. The hypocrisy that we've seen from the left is absolutely unreal. Premiums are going to continue to go up under Obamacare. People who are being, \"forced out\" of the health care by not repealing Obamacare and people who are forced into a health care plan that didn't work for their families.</p><p>So, what you're going to see is more people are going to hurt and unfortunately because we weren't able to repeal the health care, Obamacare, and we aren't able to help with anything right now, it's going to continue to just hurt the American people.</p><p>CASONE: David, what I'm concerned about right now is it's from the investment side of this.</p><p>NELSON: Sure.</p><p>CASONE: I mean, these insurance companies, I mean, yes, like, I can do some UnitedHealthcare today, great on the earnings. They're not to be exchanging.</p><p>NELSON: But they got a plan. Yes exactly.</p><p>CASONE: They're not in Obamacare. So, take them out of the problem. You got Aetna, Humana, these are companies that are -- they've clearly said we can't afford to stay. But we have nothing to fix it.</p><p>NELSON: When you look line-item by line-item, you can see why companies like UnitedHealthcare, they are not in the business of losing money. And Neil said it. I mean, look at what this is all about in the first place. It opened up a Pandora's box, the Affordable Care Act. They always wanted a single payer plan, that's where they're trying to go.</p><p>CASONE: Do you think we're going single payer?</p><p>SROKA: At Medicare for all programs is exactly what corporate America wants. If you actually look over in Canada, corporations love their Medicare program that provides insurance at a much lower cost for everyone else.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: Neil, Neil, I disagree with that. There are many -- we many CEO's that come on to Fox Business and they want healthy employees and not necessarily a single payer system actually.</p><p>HAYEH: Exactly.</p><p>CASONE: Do you disagree with that. And I can totally disagree with that.</p><p>Patrice, Patrice I do want to bring you in. I'm sorry Patrice. But, you know, come on in Patrice, I want to ask you about that because the single- payer system, we keep talking about that possibility. Is that now though a reality?</p><p>ONWUKA: I mean it seems increasingly like we might be moving in that direction. But I hope we don't because when we look at Obamacare and the expansion of Medicaid, we have people who have insurance cards but it's putting pressure on a system by overloading the system.</p><p>And unfortunately the people who actually need -- the most vulnerable people who need help are the ones who are not able to see the doctors in a timely manner. So to Medicare for our single-payer system is not the solution to real quality care for people.</p><p>CASONE: OK. OK. Gregg Jarrett I got about10 seconds, your final thoughts.</p><p>JARRETT: There's one other possibility. Repeal Obamacare and then give all of the money earmarked for Medicaid to the states to devise their own plans state by state. I talked to a veteran on Capitol Hill --</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>JARRETT: -- over the weekend who said that is actually gaining some strength, it's a real possibility.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CASONE: And all of you, thank you so much. We are going to take a quick break, a lot of breaking news on the show. We're going to take a quick commercial break. Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>CASONE: Well, turmoil over health care expected to only create more gridlock in Washington. And that is something that J.P. Morgan, CEO <person><nameText>Jamie Dimon </nameText></person>is fed up with. And he is blaming the media telling reporters, \"Why you guys don't write about it every day is completely beyond me.\" So, is he right? Well, let's bring in Howard Kurtz, Host of Media Buzz. Howard, you have written about his comment, great article by the way. But --</p><p>HOWARD KURTZ, MEDIA BUZZ HOST: Thank you.</p><p>CASONE: -- is he right?</p><p>KURTZ: Well, most Americans would say he's right. Why can't we do something about the partisan paralysis in Washington? The reason it's not written and talked about more is that it's been going on for 20 years, Bush administration, Obama administration, Trump administration. It's like saying that Washington is a real human place in July.</p><p>And when you have all this polarization, more polarized parties, more polarized members, more polarized districts, constituents, more polarized media and social media now and you added to a subject that is difficult and treaties as health care, the result is what we have today, nothing gets done.</p><p>CASONE: Well, here is the thing. You've got so many story lines going on right now. A lot great in chaos, I'm thinking <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>Jr. for instance about a meeting that happened a year ago that's, you know, now we're talking hearings and appearances and thing. I mean, does <person><nameText>Jamie Dimon </nameText></person>have a point that the media needs to refocus on the actual policy debate in Washington? Which is what they voted on last year, which is tax reform that is health care, and get away from the noise?</p><p>KURTZ: He has an absolute point. We are so addicted to scandal which is not to say that some of these stories aren't legitimate and shouldn't be covered. But the -- a media oxygen consumed by the side shows, the silly stuff, you know, good at handshake with the First Lady of France really crowds out a lot of the more serious look at taxes infrastructure, things that Americans really care about. I think we are all guilty to some degree about that on that point. The others getting more ratings and clicks but it can be frustrating. I think a lot of people are kind of tuning us out for that very reason.</p><p>CASONE: It, you know, it's interesting as, you know, a journalist my self and someone that's worked in different places, I mean, you have to kind of wonder though, if some of our colleagues are making grave mistakes here by focusing on what is a sexy story, and focusing on something that is salacious but doesn't help the country. Doesn't that feed into what Dimon is saying that reporters are getting it wrong?</p><p>KURTZ: I think that is true. I also think that some news outlets are tend to be more serious and some sort of don't necessarily put up the big numbers. You know the words there is an audience for this other stuff.</p><p>And I think sometimes this President who is obviously fighting on the issues creates so many of the distractions. He goes after, you know, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, we all go crazy for three days. So, when you put all those things in the pot, it's very frustrating for me as a lifelong journalist that we don't have more laser focus on the stuff that really touches people's lives as opposed to the gridlock and the bread and circuses aspects. I guess you would say in Washington.</p><p>CASONE: Well, that's the thing. If you copies other networks that are -- and I'm not going to call them up by name, but that are covering again, you know, just making basically a 24/7 affair out of attacking <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and his daughter and both sons and his grand kids, isn't he? These are people that have to take responsibility for the fact that they're also derailing what matters which is the American life, which is American -- the people that are here.</p><p>KURTZ: I think they do have to take some responsibility. The dirty little secret in cable news is you don't need a big mass audience if you can get a million dedicated people to watch them, that's good for your business, not necessarily good for the country.</p><p>CASONE: Howard Kurtz, Media Buzz, every Sunday, 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on <person><nameText>Fox News. </nameText></person>Howard, thank you. And we will be right back.</p><p>CASONE: Today, we have learned that the Senate Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare just didn't have the votes. And then later Senator McConnell's plan for a vote for a straight repeal also didn't have the votes. Where are we going to go from here? We're going to go Liz Claman right now. Liz over to you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTELR-2017071801cb232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P27-9C11-DXH2-63GH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437067</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>INTELLIGENCE REPORT</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 18, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

It's full of the intended and unintended biases of those who write it. The same is true of our forecasts, our future projections. They say as much about our fears and hopes today as they say about what we really think lies ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There's a lot of concern expressed about the rise of China and what its increasing strength might mean for the West. But framing every discussion in that way, through the prism of rivalry, risks losing sight of the significance of China's development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we'll soon hear, in some areas, China is arguably more forward looking and progressive than we might imagine.</p><p>Hello, Antony Funnell here. Welcome to the first in our 2018 series of podcasts and programs.</p><p>Today on the show, we take a look at three sectors in which China is likely to have massive influence over the next decade or more; in energy, trade and artificial intelligence. In Beijing-speak, let's call them the Three Great Potentials.</p><p>We'll begin with trade, and the much vaunted, and oddly named Belt and Road initiative. Here's Nick Bisley, Professor of International Relations at La Trobe University. So, what is the Belt and Road initiative?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nick Bisley</emphasis>: The simple answer is that it's a vast infrastructure and connectivity program in which China is seeking to significantly enhance the capacity for China to access markets, both in terms of energy, goods, commodities, pretty much everything you can think of, between itself and all points West. It's focused both on over-land connectivity, so building pipelines, highways, bridges, tunnels, roads, rail infrastructure, the whole package, as well as connectivity overseas, so building ports and terminals and the like.</p><p>The basic idea that China has is that the links between itself and the West, particularly Europe, the Middle East and Africa, especially over land, are badly overdeveloped, and that it needs, for its own economic development purposes and also for the region as a whole, it needs that connectivity to be significantly enhanced and certainly by all measures you see figures thrown around that are eye-watering in their scale, that Asia as a whole (and that's that broader Eurasian concept of Asia) needs between $9- and $15 trillion worth of infrastructure and investment to get things to where they need to be over the next 20 or 30 years.</p><p>So China is seeing itself as being, and it rightly is, the only country that can provide the sort of capacity and skill and of course experience...you know, this is a country that has got good experience at building this kind of stuff. But what China has done so far in terms of its economic development has been focused very much on its eastern seaboard. And so where it sees an external need for infrastructure, it also sees it in its western peripheries, it sees an opportunity to provide a kind of Keynesian economic development program that will have benefits both to itself and improving the prosperity of its western peripheries and western provinces, as well as building that connectivity to the outside world. There's a whole bunch of strategic ambitions that come from that, but that's the basic story. It's an infrastructure story, it's the biggest infrastructure story in the world, quite possibly the biggest infrastructure story the world will have ever seen by the time it's done.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: So it's potentially massive but it's also still a work in progress, isn't it, even though it was initially launched in 2013.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nick Bisley</emphasis>: Yes, so it began with these two speeches, one in Kazakhstan and one in Indonesia in 2013 in which Xi Jinping laid out a vision for maritime connectivity and then over-land connectivity, the over land being in Kazakhstan and sea in Indonesia. But at that stage it was really just a couple of speeches and everyone looked and thought what does this mean. And over time they've built up this program which remains still pretty general in the sense that it's not got a clear charter and 55 different programs yet affiliated with it, but it's essentially a statement that says China wants to provide this infrastructure and connectivity, it's open pretty much to anyone who wants to join. And at the 19th party Congress which was held in November 2017, it has become the signature international policy initiative and is being written into the party constitution. So it says this is a priority, number one priority of the party and number one priority of Xi Jinping, but also if you want to get anything done in terms of infrastructure development within China, you have to put it in terms of the Belt and Road initiative. So it's sort of about signalling domestic priorities as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: And 68 countries, as I understand it, has now signalled that they want to be part of this initiative in some way or form. But unlike one of the Beijing's other major international initiatives, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, this Belt and Road initiative is not constituted yet, is it, as a multilateral project, it's very much being led by Beijing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nick Bisley</emphasis>: It's absolutely a Beijing-led initiative. The 68 countries that have signed up to date have signed memorandums of understanding which are essentially pretty general, saying we are committed to this, but nothing in specific terms. There's a couple of big projects that are in train already. The China-Pakistan economic corridor is a pretty large program that is already fairly far down the path. But there is not an 'it' in some respects, there isn't a headquarters, there isn't a set of institutions, there isn't a set of principles or agreements or a charter yet. I wouldn't be surprised if over time you end up with a World Bank type central fund that is managing all of these sorts of projects that has got principles around it about how loans and the like to do with the infrastructure investment are managed, but as yet it's not there and it's because it's still pretty much in its infancy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: Now, of course, as with almost everything to do with China's development these days there are suspicions about this project and where it will head, aren't there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nick Bisley</emphasis>: So if you are suspicious of China, so if you see in everything that China does threats, risk and vulnerabilities, then boy, this is worrying because it is so vast, and because what it is trying to do potentially involves countries all around its borders but also pretty far-flung countries, from Europe, Africa and even Latin America being tied economically into China's orbit and increasingly having their country's economic interests aligned with Beijing's. From a geopolitical point of view that's just a worrisome thing, if you are someone who thinks that China is a threat and a risk.</p><p>But there is also ambitions that China has to I think not only, as I said earlier, develop its western peripheries, it also wants through this program to develop countries in its border land. So it wants Pakistan not just to be a thoroughfare through which hydrocarbons can come from the Arabian Sea to Xinjiang, or Chinese goods travel out to market. More importantly, what it wants out of this program is a Pakistan that's more economically developed, and it wants that...and that's true in Kazakhstan and elsewhere, and it wants that because it wants these countries to be more stable, a fairly classic liberal idea in some respects that an economically developed country is one that is less susceptible to terrorism, it's less susceptible to extremism. And it's also likely (and Pakistani is a big country) to be a market that can consume Chinese manufactured goods, particularly if, as China wants, it moves up the technological sophistication scale and becomes a country that is exporting not just cheap white goods or clothes but is producing its own cars and mid and high-tech kit. So it's very much in its interests to have it as a kind of infrastructure development program. And so it's got these multiple layers to it.</p><p>The problem is...not the problem but the challenge is if you look at this thing and ago I think there's economic opportunity in it, whether you are an infrastructure company or whether you are the Pakistani government, that's true, but if you also see this as a geopolitical risk, that is also a perfectly reasonable conclusion to reach, because one of China's big ambitions from a geopolitical point of view with this program is to reduce its vulnerability to maritime predation. The moment China's economic development and growth depends on its inputs and outputs being able to travel without any challenge to its eastern seaboards, what that means is at the moment China is vulnerable, if the US Seventh Fleet wants to, to basically choke off its economic growth. Now, why it would want to do that given the interdependence between the US and China is a separate issue, but that vulnerability is real. What it is seeking to do in building this infrastructure out to its west is to reduce that vulnerability. Not to get rid of it altogether. It knows that it is never going to be able to reduce that to zero. But if you can get your energy supplier, whether it's oil or gas, if you can get a fair chunk of the commodity inflows from Africa and you can get a fair amount of the commodity outflows to western Europe and the Middle East without having to go through the eastern seaboard, then you strengthen your position in relation to the US. So there is a big geopolitical gain there, and if you are in Canberra or Tokyo or Washington, if this comes off (and it's a big if) then China's relative position in the region is going to be increased and consequently Washington's will be decreased. So there's potentially a transformative geopolitical consequence of this initiative.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: And what about China's capacity to actually see this through? Because there are those who doubt that China really does have the economic might to guarantee at least the sort of loans that would be involved in this type of development.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nick Bisley</emphasis>: Yes, there's two issues here that worry people, not so much from that strategic point of view but from a practical economic point of view which is this is a top-down initiative, which is saying to Chinese banks who've got a lot of capital sitting around on their balance sheets and trying to figure out what to do with it, to say thou shalt go and invest in infrastructure projects. And of course the issue with infrastructure projects is they are high risk, low yield propositions, which is the reverse of what you want. And a lot of people think what you're going to see is some pretty serious misallocation of capital in China, where best case scenario is you've got banks and others putting money into what are effectively white elephants in which the return on capital is poor and that money would be much better spent invested in other things, so building at vast expense hydrocarbon pipelines over geologically unstable, extraordinarily challenging terrain in Kazakhstan or in Pakistan. The engineering of this stuff is astonishing. They are at 6,000 and 7,000 metres above sea level. So that's one problem.</p><p>The other problem is to do with the potential economic millstone around the neck of the recipient countries, where China, because it can dictate terms, may well succumb to the temptation to put punitive loan conditions on this sort of stuff, in which countries then, not dissimilar to the loan crises of the 1980s where Latin American countries and others found themselves in a very bad situation because of punitive interest rates with infrastructure loans that they can't possibly pay off. So you could see across China's periphery not only misallocation of capital leading to bad use of resources, but all these countries being economically much worse off than they would otherwise be because they are chained to these white elephant investments that seem like a good idea and that they can't possibly pay off. And the consequence of that we know economically in Latin America was 10 to 15 years of really bad economic growth. So just because China has got this big grand plan and it has pulled it off in the past, I think the jury is still out on whether it will be able to deliver what it wants on this project because it's so damn big.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: And that was Nick Bisley, Professor of International Relations at La Trobe University.</p><p>Moving on now to artificial intelligence and to Will Knight, the senior editor for AI at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">MIT Technology Review</emphasis>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Knight</emphasis>: There is an incredible boom going on in China. There's a huge economic boom that has been going on for a while, and there are lots of companies and industries that are booming, and the technology industry there is at the forefront of that. At the same time the academic world in China is really coming on leaps and bounds. Most recently there was a very big commitment by the Chinese government to put a huge sum, like a staggering amount of money, like tens of billions of dollars into AI, and there's a real desire to see that industry, which has been identified as one of the most important ones, rightly so I think, really boom more and more.</p><p>And the rate at which things develop are pretty extraordinary. I have been travelling to China for the last couple of years, and I think that the picture has changed even in that amount of time, and it's only...compared to, say, a decade ago it's really amazing how many AI start-ups there are and how many start-ups that are doing really cutting-edge work...you know, there are a lot of companies out there that people haven't heard of outside of China that are producing some research which is really cutting-edge, which is really up there, matching the likes of Google and Facebook and Microsoft in certain areas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: There is a tendency to look at China and to see it as a country that follows the trends that others set, but from what you're saying there with AI, that is happening but China is also innovating.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Knight</emphasis>: Absolutely, yes. I think it's worth recognising that in the past few years in the technology scene some companies have started to lead, and there are definitely cases where technology companies in the West are now copying Chinese companies, and that's not to say that...I think the likes of Google and Facebook, they are leading the way in terms of absolutely cutting-edge research, but in some areas Chinese companies are going their own way, and partly it's because they have this unique market, it's very mobile first, they have an enormous number of people, the way people buy stuff is kind of different. So you have these new opportunities where companies are really carving out their own niche, being much more original.</p><p>But yes, I think you're absolutely right, maybe 10, 15 years ago it was purely a case of copycat, or even five years ago, companies just literally copying the business model, maybe innovating a little bit, and that has definitely changed. I think what I've also discovered from visiting these companies is there's a real appetite to change that even more, and AI is seen as one of the ways to do that. You know, if you want to be innovative, if you want to genuinely I guess be one of the biggest companies there is, you have to do your own thing, and AI is right at the forefront of being original in technology and in technological research.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: And the sheer amount of data that is available in China...I mean, China has a massive population, it has a massive usage of social media technology, of the internet in general, that has to be a plus I would imagine for the Chinese in developing AI.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Knight</emphasis>: Yes, it's not just a plus, it's arguably a really huge advantage or even a game changer because today's AI algorithms are very much data fed, they really depend on your data. And if you have much more data, maybe a few times more data in some cases, you potentially can develop much better algorithms. And I have seen people argue that that access to data is really a huge allure for researchers. And it's true that people want to get their hands on the biggest dataset they can possibly get because then you can do extraordinary new things with it. So the ability to do amazingly accurate face recognition and voice recognition depended on having enough examples. So having all these examples of other kinds of data may prove really important, for sure.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: Many of the AI experts, as I understand it, who are working in China, have a background with the US tech giants. And as you just alluded to there, there are Chinese organisations like Sinovation Ventures that are actively recruiting now in the US, aren't they.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Knight</emphasis>: Yes, and it's become...this kind of fight for talent which is already incredibly fierce in the US but AI talent has become international, and the biggest players are really the companies from in China and the US. And it's starting to shift, you get more and more Chinese companies coming and setting up operations. Like Baidu and Tencent have research labs, at least one in Silicon Valley and in some cases more than one where they are trying to tap into the talent there. And increasingly people are trying to lure researchers back to China. I remember visiting SenseTime, which is a start-up in the China, as some of the researchers there had been working for Microsoft in the US and said, you know, I actually came back because it just seemed like the opportunity was so huge. One thing was the data. And it was just the business moves so quickly there, the ideas that you can see get off the ground very quickly, there's an excitement around it. And you can see that there is a pull for a lot of people to return perhaps.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: You believe that it's not correct to view this development simply in terms of competition with the West, which is the sort of narrative that often comes up when talking about China and its development. What sort of potential do you see for the AI push in China to have a positive influence in the rest of the world?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Knight</emphasis>: That's a great question. I mean, it's much too simplistic to look at it purely in terms of rivalry and competition. Obviously there is competition for example in the case of trying to get talent, but it's also the case that as with a lot of big technological shifts, it's not necessarily a zero sum game. So if China reboots its entire energy industry with AI, it doesn't mean that the US can't do that. And so just as the research coming out of the US has had a big impact on general knowledge and application of AI around the world, it's quite possible, certainly at the moment, because Chinese researchers are publishing their work, that it could have a similar effect in moving the technology forward.</p><p>There certainly is a lot of competition between these big tech companies, but in some ways that can be good for the new technologies that emerge out of it, and that's one thing that I certainly think is a legitimate hope for what will happen.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: As you mentioned, the Chinese government has promised significant investment in AI technology. They do have a lot on their plate, they've got a lot of priority, and the country itself has a lot of pressing problems to deal with. Is there a sense that they will have the capacity to follow through on their big AI vision?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Knight</emphasis>: There is that sense, for sure, because they tend to follow through when they make really big pronouncements. There have been other examples, like when they wanted to build a big high speed rail network they absolutely made that happen. When they promised to put money into the chip industry there they really have put a lot of that capital in and they are yet to see the results of that but they certainly backed it up. And I think that the idea is that AI just has so much potential to transform a lot of industries, and that is exactly the sort of thing that the Chinese government I believe would look at or any government should look at and say that's really critical to invest in. So my sense is that...and certainly based on this big plan, that they have identified it as a very important priority. And one thing is it can help increase the productivity of your economy, which is very important, and something that every country needs to really think of. So they have a lot of stuff on their plate, but I think that this is maybe one key way to manage the transitions that are ahead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: Will Knight, senior editor for AI at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">MIT Technology Review</emphasis>, thank you very much for joining us.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Knight</emphasis>: Thank you for having me.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tim Buckley</emphasis>: China is absolutely dominating the global landscape for energy market transformation, and late last year the IEA put out their World Energy Outlook 2017 and they openly acknowledged as an upfront conclusion; China is changing and that changes everything.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: Tim Buckley is the director of Energy Finance Studies Australasia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tim Buckley</emphasis>: China in 2017 absolutely dominated the energy market transformation trends. And maybe to throw a couple of numbers out, I think China is likely to have represented 36% of world wind turbine installations, they would have represented possibly 40% of world hydro installations, and 50% or nearly 50% of all solar installs globally in 2017. Those are staggering numbers. So China is absolutely leading the world in adopting, embracing and driving trends in new energy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: And again, in terms of perspective, is it correct that Chinese global investment in clean energy is twice what the US, the biggest economy in the world, is investing?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tim Buckley</emphasis>: That's in the right ballpark, correct, and China has been expanding very aggressively. Probably the only reason why that number hasn't been higher is the magnitude of deflation evident in the renewable energy sector means that in 2017 you invest $100, you'd probably get 20% or 30% more bang for your buck than you would have a year or two earlier in terms of installed capacity. So you are seeing absolute double-digit deflation in the cost of renewable energy, and that is one of the reasons, one of the many reasons why China is absolutely embracing the move to a low emissions energy profile.</p><p>If you had to identify probably the two key drivers, one in almost all circumstances in any country is energy security as a key driver. The second one for China is the environment, and that is a massive change on where we were maybe five years ago were China was growing its economy at 10% annually, it was growing its energy consumption 10% annually and they needed more of absolutely everything.</p><p>The change that we saw in 2015, 2016 and again in 2017 was that they've invested aggressively in low emissions technologies such as wind, solar, hydro, energy efficiency, and even nuclear, and that is very much driven by, as the President said in his People's Congress opening speech back three or four months ago, he talked about the critical need to return China to blue skies, and pollution was an absolute imperative on the Chinese leadership.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: So they dominate in investment in solar, wind and hydroelectric power and nuclear power, as you were saying, they also have the lion's share of investment in the global lithium market, don't they.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tim Buckley</emphasis>: Absolutely. We've recently released a report titled New Energy Outbound Investment Trends 2018 for China, and we identify that China is looking at the entire supply chain, and so when we talk about that it's not just lithium iron but it's cobalt, it's copper, it is rare earth, it's the actual battery manufacturing, it's electric vehicles, as well as, as you said, wind, hydro, solar and so on. So they are looking to dominate all sorts of aspects of investment. Sorry, I didn't mention the grid is a huge area of investment, it's probably 40% of global investment in the electricity sector annually, and China looks to be the absolute world leader in grid investments as yet another example where they are looking to dominate massive industries of the future, and they are doing it for all sorts of reasons. They're doing it because they now have the best technologies in the world, they are driving investment and financing of those investments globally, they are doing it for employment reasons, they are doing it because it's environmental, they want to be an industry leader for all sorts of reasons as well as, as you mentioned, pollution and so on.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: And in terms of their international push, leaving aside the domestic needs that they are meeting, where they focusing, what countries?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tim Buckley</emphasis>: China is somewhat agnostic as to where they go with their investments, particularly in the renewable energy. For the last two or three decades China has dominated inbound investment into Africa, for example, which is a higher risk, more longer term investment program that they've taken. It's coupled with their foreign aid but ultimately it's about securing resources of Africa. But increasingly they are investing in new domestic infrastructure, energy infrastructure across Africa. But they are very focused in their One Belt, One Road initiative in outbound investment in numerous countries. Pakistan over 2017 announced $50 billion of investment intent in Pakistan across wind, coal, import coal facilities, hydro, nuclear, solar, the grid itself, building railways and highways. So Pakistan is probably the single biggest country destination for outbound investment from China, but it is not just neighbours to China, whether it's Bangladesh or Pakistan, it's also Africa, it is Latin America, it's Europe and America and Australia, to the extent that they have regulatory approval to expand in each of those markets. So they are expanding virtually in all markets around the world and cementing their global leadership in technology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: Tim Buckley from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, thank you very much.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tim Buckley</emphasis>: Thank you very much for your time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: So there we are, the Three Great Potentials for China over the next decade; energy, international trade and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Thanks also to Will Knight from the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">MIT Technology Review</emphasis>, and Professor Nick Bisley the executive director of La Trobe Asia and also a Professor of International Relations at La Trobe University.</p><p>Coming up next week on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Future Tense</emphasis>, dominance of another kind, the rise in influence of the GIF, the Graphics Interchange Format, in other words those little video loops that more and more people are using in their digital communication.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unknown</emphasis>: If you look back at the history of writing, there hasn't always been the kind of complete divorce between the written word and the picture that we think of as normal for writing. If you look back at the mediaeval monks, the early illuminated manuscripts with all of this hand written, hand copied manuscripts, they often drew these very ornate drawings around the first letter of a manuscript or around the titles or around in the margins of all the different types of things. There's always been this kind of interplay between pictures and even between letters and the linguistic side, and I think that's something...it's more of a return to the marriage of pictures and writing than it is this wholesale shift to pictures only, which...I don't think we are going to end up at only pictures, we're going to have more of a balance between the two.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unknown</emphasis>: They are incredibly widely used. They are kind of a lingua franca of the social Web. So GIFs are kind of inescapable. They were resisted for a long time by popular social media platforms, so Twitter and Facebook didn't support GIFs from the start, they only came on board later on. And for news organisations as well, having a GIF that distils a key moment of the story or a key aspect of the story is also useful for readers on their mobile devices, for instance. They don't have to load a two-minute video, they can just see the moment of interest on repeat.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unknown</emphasis>: I find on Twitter you have a shortened character limit, you only have a small amount of space to say what you have to say, and GIFs can be a really effective way of communicating. So I think it's that idea of a picture says a thousand words.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antony Funnell</emphasis>: That's the rise of the GIF, next on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Future Tense</emphasis>.</p><p>Karin Zsivanovits is my co-producer. The sound engineer was Steve Fieldhouse. I'm Antony Funnell.

View original post here[2]. Although there are no autonomous vehicles for sale to the public at the moment, the American people remain skeptical of these Silicon Valley cars that are currentlybeing testedacross the country. Take, for example, Elaine Herzberg, shewas walking her bicycle across a Tempe, Arizona street when an autonomous Uber ran her over. The story was widely publicized, along with other incidents. </p><p>The latest consumer report shows that recent negative press concerning self-driving vehicles has incited fear among the vast majority of Americans.  The American Automobile Association's (AAA) annual automated vehicle survey[3] found that 71% of people are terrified to ride in self-driving vehicles. That's about a 13% increase in fear levels rom April 2018 after the Tempe fatality. Before the incident, fear of self-driving cars was at 63%.  The survey revealed that only 19% of respondents said they were comfortable with self-driving cars. AAA believes there is much work to be done to improve consumers' perception of self-driving vehicles. 'Automated vehicle technology is evolving on a very public stage and, as a result, it is affecting how consumers feel about it,' said Greg Brannon, AAA's director of Automotive Engineering and Industry Relations. 'Having the opportunity to interact with partially or fully automated vehicle technology will help remove some of the mystery for consumers and open the door for greater acceptance.' 'Despite fears still running high, AAA's study also shows that Americans are willing to take baby steps toward incorporating this type of technology into their lives,' continued Brannon. 'Hands-on exposure in more controlled, low-risk environments coupled with stronger education will play a key role in easing fears about self-driving cars.' AAA Northern California, Nevada ...ah, in partnership with the city of Las Vegas, Keolis North Americaand the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada,tested the first and largest self-driving metro bus for public consumption,all to sway public opinion that self-driving vehiclesare safe.  The self-driving bus was the first in the country to be used in a city environment. The public had a voluntary opportunity to participate in a survey about their post-ride experience. Of those who responded, many described their overall mood improved towards the self-driving vehicles. Play Video[4] More than half of Americans (55%) believe by the end of the next decade, mostcars willbe outfittedwithautonomousfeatures. Those who are skeptical that autonomous vehicles will be driving on roads in the nearterm,cite reasons such as technology not being fullymatured and government regulation. While experts agree that self-driving vehicles could arrive by the mid-2020s, Silicon Valley and big tech are behind the curve in convincing the American people that this new form of transportation is safe.

Representatives from FIs, big tech, fintechs, global news outlets, academics and international organisations, all joined together to debate some of the critical themes facing the industry - How will big tech firms entering financial services impact the market? How can new technologies such as AI, machine learning and quantum computing transform our services? And, how can we use these technologies to deliver intuitive applications that work for us as humans, not machines?</p><p><br/><br/>SWIFT Business Forum New York 2018<br/><br/>Below we have pulled-out three key insights to take away from these discussions:<br/><br/>Learn from the big tech - facilitate user platforms  ecosystems<br/><br/>Based on the sheer scale of the number of users on the their platforms, companies such as Facebook, Google, Apple and others should be thought of more as countries than tech companies, said Rana Foroohar, Global Business Columnist, The Financial Times and Global Economic Analyst, CNN, in her opening keynote on Re-imagining Financial Services.<br/><br/>Rana Foroohar - Global Business Columnist, The Financial Times and Global Economic Analyst, CNN<br/><br/>These platforms have disrupted and transformed sectors across the globe, and now they are entering financial services, noted Foroohar. They have the power, not only to compete in the market, but become the market, and there is nothing to stop a company like Google or Amazon coming into this space in the US and globally. Tech platform players can sit in the middle of a commerce market and take a percentage of every transaction, similarly to the traditional financial services model, she continued.<br/><br/>FIs need to adopt a whole new world-view in order to thrive in this world, she said, by studying the business model that is challenging them, and identify how they themselves can facilitate user platforms and ecosystems.<br/><br/>Foroohar underlined the power of data in this quest. 'Data is dollars,' she said. The tech firms have grown through a number of reasons - one of which is the power of data. The personal data that we are willing give them is essentially the new oil, she said. Yet, sounding a positive note, she said that banks are sitting on a tremendous amount of data that is not currently being monetised - and when you have the data, you can enhance it into smart data by applying technologies such as machine learning. Now is the time to understand how that can work in the financial sector, said Foroohar, not just to better know your customers' needs, but to understand how to service them in a way that they want.<br/><br/>Trust is fundamental, she stressed. Banks have long protected their customers' data and become their trusted advisor. To compete with the coming challenge from big tech in financial services, she concluded, FIs need to build ecosystems, leverage their data and deliver trust, transparency and value to their customers.<br/><br/>Seize the opportunities new technologies can offer - now!<br/><br/>It was clear from discussions throughout the day that we now sit on the cusp of a technological wave that will transform financial services as we know them today. As such, there was a general consensus that FIs should already be embracing new technologies - from quantum computing to AI, machine learning, cloud edge computing and beyond - to ensure they are the first to offer their users the financial services of the future.<br/><br/>The session, Technology Enabling Digital Transformation, brought together a multi-disciplinary panel of speakers from big tech, fintech and banking to discuss how their organisations are already deploying these technologies and what the financial industry can learn from their experiences.<br/><br/>Asked how AI could change the landscape, Mike Blalock, General Manager, Financial Services Industry Vertical at Intel said it will usher in a much better world, solving real-world problems in a fraction of the time. Financial services is a data business, he said, and we are going from a person-based ecosystem to a machine-based ecosystem, which massively ramps up the amount of data being generated. We are in the early stages of AI, Blalock said, and are only leveraging 1% of the data we possess, so there is a huge opportunity to grow this.<br/><br/>Saket Sharma , Chief Information Officer, Treasury Services Technology, BNY Mellon, agreed that AI is still in its infancy. Noting the current move from predictive to prescriptive data analytics, he said we still don't know what it will mean from a risk perspective when machines make assumptions on a prescriptive model.<br/><br/>Amar Parikh, Customer Engineer at Google Cloud said that financial services companies generate so much data, and if they have the ability to add real-time analytics and machine learning to this they could benefit and create new revenue streams. Yet Parikh noted that with the high regulatory and compliance requirements in financial services, a business like Google Cloud needs the capabilities to respond to this. Security is also vital at every layer, he said, and customers need to understand how they can use the tools available to have the best controls possible.<br/><br/>Blalock concluded by summoning the theme of the forum, saying that FIs need to 'seize the opportunity' of new technologies right away. A lot of banks have AI projects, he said, but they need to move faster to have an institution-wide view of AI in order to take the opportunity that now exists, before third-parties beat them to the punch.<br/><br/>Never forget your users are humans, not machines<br/><br/>While the potential for deploying new technologies in financial services was a key theme of the forum, Amber Case, Cyborg Anthropologist  Harvard Fellow, reminded us in the closing plenary that, whatever the technology deployed, applications must be designed for humans, not machines.<br/><br/>Amber Case - Cyborg Anthropologist  Harvard Fellow<br/><br/>The core of Case' argument was the need for 'calm technology' - technology that sits in the background, requiring the least possible amount of attention to solve a problem, and thus becoming a part of the user's life rather than a distraction from it. Technology should amplify the best of humanity by blending tech seamlessly with our everyday lives, she said.<br/><br/>It is possible to have 'too much tech', she said. For example, 'smart' watches that notify you to the exactly same information as your phone, or 'smart' fridges that ping you with unnecessary alerts about the condition of your vegetables. Humans need applications that are fun to look at and intuitive, she said, only alerting you to the things you care about, by learning about your individual needs.<br/><br/>More devices, features and functionalities are not necessarily the answer, she said. We should design products that work well, launch well, are easy to support, easy to use, and remain unobtrusive, she said. When applying this sentiment to B2B, FIs should deliver 'calm financial services' with low impact, light footprint that require as little time, energy and cost as possible for end-customers to run and maintain.<br/><br/>For additional coverage of the event, visit the Finextra live blog, or the wrap up article.<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDR-0841-F0K1-N22C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1227\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 5, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

KEY FACTS     So far, 424 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported second quarter earnings with 82% beating Wall Street expectations\u2014the highest rate on record dating back to 1994, according to Refinitiv data.       As earnings season winds down, investors are now closely watching for more updates on the next round of coronavirus stimulus from Congress, which remains deadlocked over key provisions like extending federal unemployment benefits.       While both Democratic and Republican leaders have expressed optimism that an agreement will eventually be reached, various market experts have warned that if the next bill continues to be delayed that could result in a market sell-off.      The other outstanding issue for markets is the November 2020 presidential election : Although Joe Biden surged in the polls since March, his lead has diminished somewhat in the last several weeks as the number of national coronavirus cases declines.      \u201cThe country seems too polarized for a \u2018landslide\u2019 election and investors should look for polls to tighten in the coming weeks and months,\u201d says Vital Knowledge founder Adam Crisafulli, adding that there are also rising market fears about disputed election results given the large number of mail-in ballots this year.      \u201cThe [presidential] debates this year will be crucial\u2026 and the country will be watching these events very closely\u201d given the lack of traditional campaigning amid the pandemic, he says, which could lead to further volatility in the polls.      A potential upside for the market could come from more positive vaccine data, which could arrive as early as this fall, however: Several companies are leading the way in finding a treatment for coronavirus, including Moderna, Pfizer and Novavax.     Key background   While the consensus among many investors is that stocks will decline if Biden defeats Trump for the presidency, some experts disagree : \u201cI think people will view it as the storm being over and that will help restore confidence in the markets,\u201d says Lewis Altfest, chief investment officer of Altfest Personal Wealth Management. Though Wall Street remains apprehensive about a tax hike under Biden\u2014who has pledged to rollback Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts and business deregulation\u2014\u201cwe\u2019re past that, we have too much debt and we\u2019re going to have to raise taxes regardless\u201d in order to pay for all of the coronavirus stimulus, Altfest says.   What to watch for   Rising U.S.-China tensions, which some experts have dubbed a \u201c new Cold War .\u201d Diplomatic relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies have continued to deteriorate, with disputes over a range of matters including trade, Hong Kong, Huawei, Taiwan, the South China Sea and several human rights issues. The latest disagreement stems from Chinese technology companies like TikTok, which the U.S. claims is collecting data on Americans for the Chinese government. After initially threatening to ban the social media app, President Trump said earlier this week that he would give tech giant Microsoft the go-ahead to pursue an acquisition if a \u201cvery substantial\u201d portion of the proceeds go to the U.S. Treasury. That sparked outrage in China, with several state-run media outlets calling it an \u201copen robbery\u201d of a Chinese tech company. \u201cAlongside the other fronts of U.S.-China tensions, the growing tech confrontation further troubles the viability of the phase one trade deal,\u201d Evan Rees, Asia Pacific Analyst with Stratfor, a RANE company, recently told Forbes .   Tangent   Big Tech companies, which are among the best-performing stocks so far this year, also continue to be in the regulatory crosshairs of Washington.

With so much going on, marketers can struggle to keep track of developments that are likely to impact their work. So what do marketers need to know?</p><h>1 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sampling Becomes Programmatic</emphasis></h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The data and insights industry is part innovator and part magpie, constantly adopting technology to transform data collection and analysis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One example is programmatic, which has revolutionized the way digital advertising is bought and sold, as well as changed the buying and selling of research samples.</p><p>Traditionally, a market research agency or brand would go to a panel provider to buy samples for interviews. This sample might come from the provider's propriety panel, but often it would be made up of a mixture of samples from numerous providers, with a variable mix of quality standards. However, taking inspiration from the marketing industry, some companies are providing programmatic samples using automated technologies and filters. This allows the buyer to work with one platform to access multiple suppliers, improving speed, consistency and transparency at a lower cost.</p><p>This doesn't mean that traditional panel providers are obsolete. Programmatic is ideal for tactical projects that require quick turnaround. But the expertise of a recognized panel provider is necessary for in-depth projects or niche, hard-to-reach or B2B audiences where a proprietary managed panel is more appropriate.</p><h>2 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Poor Data Practices and Consumer Trust</emphasis></h><p>It has recently come to light that Facebook paid human contractors to transcribe customers' Facebook Messenger calls. This may not be surprising; there have been plenty of conspiracy theories about Facebook listening to calls and adjusting advertising to fit. Alas, those theories are now based on fact. Add the $5 billion fine the Federal Trade Commission imposed on the company earlier in the year and you'd be forgiven for thinking that Facebook's days are numbered. So why did Facebook stock improve the day after news broke of the largest-ever FTC fine?</p><p>Facebook profits were $5 billion in the first three months of 2018 alone, so the FTC fine was a weak slap on the wrist, showing investors that even the worst behavior will not affect company revenues too badly. Even if the data may have been acquired in an underhand way, it nevertheless made the company enormously data-rich.</p><p>Increasing data privacy in the U.S. may come back to bite Facebook in the derriere. A joint study from ESOMAR, HERE Technologies, BuzzBack and Cint that was carried out this summer shows that trust in Facebook is particularly low compared to its Big Tech peers. We explored attitudes toward data collection practices across 12 countries and 12,000 people. Our results show that 62% of Americans don't trust Facebook with their personal data. That may still seem low, but when you compare it to Google (31%), Apple (32%) and Amazon (20%), the negative impact of Facebook's actions is clear.</p><p>The study found that 71% of people would be more likely to share personal data if they understood how it's used. More than 40% of U.S. consumers are more likely to buy a product or service from a company that they know handles personal data responsibly.</p><p>There is a tendency for brands-particularly those in tech or who collect data from mobile applications-to do it surreptitiously. Personal data is often collected without companies being transparent with the data subject. There's a fear that if consumers have a choice, then they won't provide their data. But our new research tells a different story: Be open, honest and transparent and not only will people share, but you'll start to rebuild trust.</p><h>3 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Impact of the EU Copyright Directive</emphasis></h><p>For those international marketers who work in or around the EU, or the eagle-eyed individuals who keep track of EU legislation as a harbinger of what might come to the U.S., you may have encountered the EU copyright directive.</p><p>After the General Data Protection Regulation, the copyright directive has been the most significant development in recent months. It generated vast speculation about memes being banned. This was primarily due to Draft Article 13, which was designed to protect artists and content creators. This article was and remains strongly opposed by companies such as Google and YouTube and by some content creators, as it would potentially limit the freedom of the internet. But a casual glance at Twitter suggests it has done little to affect the social currency of memes.</p><p>There's more to the directive than Article 13. It also does much to improve the bargaining position of authors and performers, and is positive for traditional media publishers such as newspapers and non-aggregated commercial content platforms. This is because they've always had to prove or validate sources when reporting a story or publicizing a campaign. Digital media (to date) has not had to do so. Many would consider this a prime reason for the rise of fake news and unregulated personal targeting. If you're considering running marketing or creative campaigns in Europe, be aware that digital platforms are now obligated to meet the same standards as traditional ones when it comes to licensed materials and ethical boundaries.</p><p>From the data side comes further positive news. Prior to the drafting of the legislation, my own organization, ESOMAR, formed a coalition with several other associations to ensure any new copyright frameworks did not affect the area of text and digital data mining. Although the framework was initially only intended to benefit academic research, a broader exemption has now been achieved that enables any market or social researcher the right to mine text and data. This exemption can be summarized as \"the right to read is the right to mine,\" meaning that if you have lawful access to the data, you have the right to mine it without having to obtain further permission or licenses.</p><p>Given the vast amount of text-based data now available, the EU has taken the opportunity to open this up for research. The ability to mine text data is crucial for artificial intelligence, where huge amounts of real-world, text-based data are needed to train the algorithms. Without this exemption, machine-learning projects would have only been sustainable by cash-rich organizations. Now it's available to all, and we've managed to defend a key source of consumer insight.</p><p>In an increasingly global world, the impact of new technologies is felt everywhere. Whether using programmatic to simplify research sample buying, maintain consumer trust in brands or simply protect creatives, the contract of the marketer with the consumer must be one of mutual honesty and transparency. Brands are increasingly realizing that it's important to make sales and behave ethically while doing so. Those that build honest connections will benefit in the long-run.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MKNEWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MKNEWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFB-7M41-DYRW-V0M8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11635</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1158\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 American Marketing Association All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Marketing News TM</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Cupertino giant Apple was also hit, slipping 12.4pc, less than two weeks after chief executive Tim Cook sold $131.7m worth of stock in the company.</p><p>Google and Facebook dropped 5pc and 2.6pc respectively while Amazon-the white knight of lockdown-fell by 6.4pc. Early US trading on Friday also pointed to continued sell-offs with many of the world's biggest tech firms nursing sizeable knocks to their valuations.</p><p>The downward trend continued as The Financial Times reported on Friday that SoftBank was the \"Nasdaq whale\" that has driven high levels of price inflation among tech stocks. It is believed the Japanese investment giant has poured billions of dollars into tech options that may have led much of the rally in prices in recent months. When pressed on the claims SoftBank said it had no comment on the matter.</p><p>But in a year that has seen many investors made considerably more wealthy thanks to their bets on tech, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/01/18/twenty-years-three-lessons-learn-dotcom-bubble/\">the ongoing sell off looks more like profit taking than a throwback to the crash</url> that wiped out 78pc of the value of the Nasdaq. Here are three reasons why:</p><p>                     Tech's outperformance of the market is nowhere near as outlandish as in 1999                   </p><p>Throughout the 1990s investors to its name, insisting that the internet was the future. To one extent, they were right.</p><p>But the outperformance of tech in 1999 is still multiples of what has been reported this year, despite strong growth from tech stocks.</p><p>The tech sector's price to earnings (PE) ratio-which is a measure of how much a company earns compared to its share price-is high this year. Currently it's around 90pc greater the average of the rest of the market, according to figures from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/01/18/twenty-years-three-lessons-learn-dotcom-bubble/\">Capital Economics</url>.</p><p>While that may raise some eyebrows it still remains far below the dreaded run up to 2000. Back then the PE ratio was almost 250pc that of the rest of the market. Below is the overall share price performance of tech stocks against the rest of the S&amp;P 500. While they are outperforming the market, they have not bubbled up in the same manner as 2000. </p><p>\"Big tech's valuation has risen steadily for a few years and it's quite big now, but it's clearly not in the same league as the IT sector when the dot com mania was in full swing,\" says Oliver Jones, an economist at Capital Economics. \"This is one reason why we remain wary of the idea that big tech firms' share prices will soon collapse under their own weight.\"</p><p>To some, the sell-off could have been sparked by those viewing the stocks as overvalued. </p><p>Helal Miah, an analyst at The Share Centre, says that some stocks could have been dumped for more \"old economy\" bets that had taken a beating during the pandemic. </p><p>\"The big question is whether this is just a mini correction or something more significant,\" he says. \"A more material correction may be on the way but I am inclined to think that this is just a modest and healthy adjustment, the main reason being that nothing has fundamentally changed in the last few days.\"</p><p>                     Tech's 2020 rally is backed up by outsized earnings                   </p><p>Perhaps one of the biggest differences between this year's run on tech and the craze at the turn of the millennium is the fundamentals of the businesses involved.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/01/18/twenty-years-three-lessons-learn-dotcom-bubble/\">Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google all report enormous profits</url> and boast extremely strong balance sheets. In the case of Apple, it had more than $200bn in cash on hand at the start of the year. Its profits are huge. Apple reported more than $11bn in profit in the second quarter, Microsoft $11.6bn, Amazon $5.2bn.</p><p>In the case of many of the biggest stocks they also hold massive market shares that border on near-monopolies in many cases. </p><p>When you look at the current price-to-earnings ratios of Big Tech giants now, relative to what was happening during the dot com era, the difference is clear. This chart from Capital Economics shows that while Big Tech's price-to-earnings has grown, it is still relatively stable.</p><p>And fundamentally, most of these technology giants have had extremely robust profits for years. Unlike in 2000, when almost all internet stocks were minnows, many of them with no revenues or profits to speak of.</p><p>The coronavirus has also driven a lot of growth in tech companies as more and more people began working remotely. Companies like messaging app Slack and videoconferencing software Zoom became even more popular as tools that kept working life alive shot to prominence.</p><p>Big Tech's fundamentals were undoubtedly a key driver for SoftBank's decision to jump in on options. There were suggestions that the investment giant had a large hand in the sterling year for tech that caused tech stocks to balloon. SoftBank's oversized bid in a way may have been in keeping with tech's oversized profits.</p><p>                     Markets are expecting even more stimulus from central banks                   </p><p>Dropping a motherload of cash has been the go to for many financial regulators across the world in the hope of getting economies back on track.</p><p>On Thursday, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/01/18/twenty-years-three-lessons-learn-dotcom-bubble/\">French government unveiled a (EURO)100bn, four-year stimulus package</url> in an effort to boost the economy and keep the recovery moving. In the US this week, the S&amp;P 500 index was boosted by suggestions that Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin was in talks over the extension of its support scheme for the unemployed.</p><p>The European Central Bank has also indicated its desire to help lift the region's economy with massive bond purchases.</p><p>In a post, ForexLive's Adam Button was bullish about the continuation of the tech rally due to the varying stimulus measures that are likely to be introduced. \"The bottom line is this: the pandemic will end in 2021 but easy money policies from central banks and governments won't,\" he says.</p><p>Around 2000, there had been similar stimulus injections due to fears over the Y2K bug. However, this abruptly trailed off, leaving overvalued tech stocks caught in the open.</p><p>Richard Windsor, an independent analyst at RadioFreeMobile, agrees. He says: \"The Fed still has its pedal to the metal in terms of stoking the market and while this is going on a full blown reassertion of reality remains unlikely.\"</p><p>All of this means that Wednesday's sell-off looks more like investors de-risking and cashing in their chips rather than identifying fundamental flaws with the world's largest tech businesses.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-65714365</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60S0-19V1-JCJY-G2MK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1147\"/><timeReceived>1:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 4, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

GREENE Tribune Hi-Line Bureau</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Three Republicans are vying for the state House of Representatives seat left open by Rep. Sam Kitzenberg, R-Glasgow, who will switch to the state Senate after an uncontested campaign this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lee Humbert and Timothy Tharp, both of Scobey, and Karl Waitschies of Peerless want their party's nomination for House District 96 and the chance to face Democrat Todd Wagner of Glasgow in the November general election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HD96 is an agriculture-based, 2,462-square-mile region that covers Valley and Daniels counties in northeast Montana.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Republican primary race has been relatively low key.</p><p>Humbert and Waitschies, both farmers, say their spring farm obligations have prevented them from doing much door-to-door campaigning.</p><p>They're hoping their reputations as responsible farm operators and local advertising in the two-county district will carry them.</p><p>Tharp, a public high school teacher, is counting on his education expertise.</p><p>Humbert claims Montana's most pressing need is an economic revival and, as he says, \"it's time for the state government to become part of the solution.\"</p><p>\"We've got to open Montana up for business and do something to stimulate it so there is a future for people here,\" Humbert said. \"Everybody gets so excited about the big tech companies. But I think a lot of our growth is going to be in small companies. You've got to make it so the five- and 20-employee companies can make a go of it.\"</p><p>In addition to having an efficient tax code that competes with neighboring states, Humbert would like the state to provide 70 percent of public school funding to ease the burdens of local property owners.</p><p>\"We have some pretty competent school boards, and I'd like to see them get that money and not get a bunch more state regulations or mandates,\" Humbert said.</p><p>Tharp contends his top priority is to protect small school districts around the state that have struggled with tight budgets and shrinking student numbers.</p><p>He'd like to alter the school funding formula so money isn't dependent solely on enrollment.</p><p>\"Schools are the heart of the community, and if the school loses, the community loses,\" said Tharp, who wants the state to provide base funds each year so districts know in advance how much they're getting.</p><p>On economic development, Tharp said he'd work to lower property taxes further and cut red tape for businesses that might add value to the state's agriculture industry.</p><p>He also said he'd like to see more cash grants and low-interest loans awarded to value-added companies.</p><p>Waitschies noted the steps toward economic development taken last month by the state Legislature were healthy, but didn't go far enough.</p><p>He suggests increasing the pot of money for low-interest business loans and implementing a tax-credit system for startup companies.</p><p>\"We just need to sell the state. If you get out of this area, what we're known for is Freemen and mad bombers, and it's kind of hard to have a corporation come in here unless we do sell the image of a good state,\" Waitschies said.</p><p>On other issues, Waitschies would like to use budget surpluses to fund education and cut property taxes.</p><p>He'd also like to impose a 10 percent tax on mineral rights, which currently are not taxed, and reduce property taxes for land owners who do not control their mineral rights.</p><p>Lee Humbert</p><p>Party: Republican.</p><p>Seeking: House District 96.</p><p>Age: 48, born July 16, 1951, in Scobey.</p><p>Home: Lives 23 miles northwest of Scobey.</p><p>Employment: A farmer and a stockman, Humbert raises and markets Angus cattle.</p><p>Education: Bachelor's degree in agriculture production from MSU-Bozeman, 1976.</p><p>Political experience: None.</p><p>Military: Served in the U.S. Army from 1971 to 1973 in Panama.</p><p>Family: Single.</p><p>Timothy Tharp</p><p>Party: Republican.</p><p>Seeking: House District 96.</p><p>Age: 29, born July 3, 1970, in Sidney.</p><p>Home: Scobey.</p><p>Employment: Government and math teacher at Scobey High School.

In his responses, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>was competent but notably did not reveal much that was new about how <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>will respond to its enormous challenges.</p><p>On balance, the hearing probably leaves <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and its peers on the back foot in three important ways.</p><p>Legislation to rein in social media companies is now a possibility. Lawmakers now seem much more aware of how much power large technology companies have. This was encapsulated in questions posed by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. He framed <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>as a monopoly and brought up the possibility of regulating <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>asking Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>: \u201cBut you as a company welcome regulation?\u201d Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>gave a response often heard from C.E.O.s: \u201cI think if it\u2019s the right regulation, then yes.\u201d Senator Graham then secured something of a commitment from Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to work with the Senate on what regulations are necessary.</p><p>A Senate with a Republican majority may be less likely to pass legislation, but if the Democrats gain control, top senators from that party might push for new laws ahead of a potential run in 2020. Some of the most penetrating questions on Tuesday came from <person><nameText>Kamala Harris, </nameText></person>Democrat of California, and Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey.</p><p>Recidivism may now be taken more seriously. One of the reasons that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is under scrutiny is that it has been the source of several scandals. Patience has apparently worn thin in the Senate. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has not convincingly explained why it took so long to reveal Cambridge Analytica\u2019s misuse of the data of 87 million users. Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, sounded bewildered by that misstep: \u201cYou apologized for it. But you didn\u2019t notify them. And do you think that you have an ethical obligation to notify 87 million <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users?\u201d <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>may now only be one big scandal away from a stringent government response.</p><p>Large technology companies sense an economic threat. Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>made an intriguing comment that suggested <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>could, in theory, offer a paid version, presumably to users who do not want ads or to share certain data with <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>He said: \u201cThere will always be a version of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>that will be free.\u201d This suggests that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has begun to think about how it can adapt to a situation in which it gets access to less data from users. In other words, it may be taking a threat to its business model seriously.</p><p>The fact that <person><nameText>Facebook</nameText></person>\u2019s stock rose through the hearing should not be taken as a sign that the company is in the clear.</p><p>\u2014 Peter Eavis</p><p>Wall Street likes <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>\u2019s performance</p><p>Investors certainly liked <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg</nameText></person>\u2019s testimony on Capitol Hill Tuesday.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook</nameText></person>\u2019s shares rose 4.5 percent on the day. It was the strongest single-day performance for the stock since April 2016.</p><p>After being down as much as 24 percent this year, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is steadily clawing back ground. Tuesday\u2019s gain left it down only 11.4 percent in 2018.</p><p>\u2014 Matt Phillips</p><p>To regulate, or not to regulate</p><p>Among the dominant themes of the hearing, and the past few weeks, has been whether <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>needs to be regulated. In fact, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said he open to <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>being regulated during his first interview after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>But some lawmakers expressed skepticism toward regulation during the hearing. Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, raised an important point about the impact of regulation: That it often benefits the biggest companies, at the expense smaller firms and startups.</p><p>Here\u2019s Senator Sullivan\u2019s question to Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>:</p><p>\u201cRegulations can also cement the dominant power. Do you think that that\u2019s a risk, given your influence, that if we regulate we\u2019re actually going to regulate you into a position of cemented authority?\u201d</p><p>In other words, if the government decides to crack down on <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>could that end up holding back the next <person><nameText>Facebook?</nameText></person></p><p>Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>conceded that that would be a risk.</p><p>Is <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>a monopoly?</p><p>That\u2019s the question that Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina hit on and its a sensitive one for <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>In the weeks since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/facebook-cant-be-fixed-it-needs-to-be-broken-up\">many have said that Facebook can\u2019t be fixed and needs to be broken up</url>.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr.Graham asked Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to name <person><nameText>Facebook</nameText></person>\u2019s biggest competitor. Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>responded that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has a lot of competitors.</p><p>Then Mr. Graham pointed out that if a customer has a problem with the Ford they bought, they can buy a car from another auto maker. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2018-04-04/mark-zuckerberg-testifies-on-facebook-data-before-house-panel#5ACD151A68C80000\">Here\u2019s their back-and-forth</url>.</p><p>Mr. Graham asked: \u201cIs there an alternative to <person><nameText>Facebook?</nameText></person>\u201d</p><p>Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>: \u201cWell, we provide a number of diff...\u201d</p><p>Mr. Graham: \u201cYou don\u2019t think that you have a monopoly?\u201d</p><p>Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>: \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t feel like that to me.\u201d</p><p>Generations collide</p><p>The gap in knowledge about how <person><nameText>Facebook</nameText></person>\u2019s business works was on display at times during Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>\u2019s testimony.</p><p>The company has faced questions about the possibility of creating a paid service that would allow users to opt-out of sharing their data or seeing advertisements.</p><p>Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>insisted on Tuesday that there would always be a free version of <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>so that anyone in the world can afford to be part of its online community.</p><p>At that point, Sentor Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican, asked Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>how he could sustain a business without charging anything for it.</p><p>\u201cSir, we run ads,\u201d Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>explained.</p><p>Mr. Hatch replied: \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u2014 Alan Rappeport</p><p>Regulation ahead?</p><p>Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and its role in society \u201cextraordinary\u201d and began the hearing by explaining why <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is being singled out and why Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>was asked to appear alone.</p><p>He said the Cambridge Analytica situation underscored how <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>can be used for nefarious reasons, saying it appeared \u201cto be the result of people exploiting the tools you created to manipulate users\u2019 information.\u201d</p><p>In an indication that he may support legislation for internet companies, Mr. Thune said, \u201cIn the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been willing to defer to tech companies\u2019 efforts to regulate themselves. But this may be changing.\u201d</p><p>Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said the tech industry \u201chas a responsibility\u201d to protect its users and said \u201cthe status quo no longer works.\u201d</p><p>\u2014 Cecilia Kang</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>as a proxy for Silicon Valley</p><p>Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is the only technology chief in the room, but it is clear that members of Congress are treating him as a stand-in for the entirety of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Mr. Grassley called the entire tech industry to account, saying \u201cthe tech industry has an obligation to\u2026restore the public\u2019s trust.\u201d Mr. Nelson put it even more bluntly: \u201cIf you and other social media companies do not get your act in order, none of us are going to have any privacy.\u201d</p><p>In his opening statement, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>who is 33, made a point to remind Congress that he was young when this all began.</p><p>\u201cI started <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>when I was in college,\u201d Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said. This is a recurring theme for Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>\u2014in many recent interviews, he has referred to starting <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>in his Harvard dorm room. And perhaps it\u2019s wise to keep bringing up the fact that Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is much younger than most of the business executives who come before Congress.</p><p>But the strategy could also backfire. After all, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is a long way from his dorm room\u2014on paper, he has been a billionaire for more than a decade\u2014and by reminding lawmakers of his youth, he could also lead them to question whether he\u2019s mature enough to handle such enormous responsibilities and whether Silicon Valley needs more adult supervision in the way of additional federal regulation.</p><p>\u2014 Kevin Roose</p><p>The must-watch <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>hearings start at 2:15 p.m. E.T.</p><p>That\u2019s when <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>will testify before the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees; <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/facebook-social-media-privacy-and-the-use-and-abuse-of-data?dlbk\">you can watch here</url>.

Shares in T-Mobile were up 5.7 percent as well.</p><p>Let\u2019s recap the tortured history of the telecom merger that hasn\u2019t quite been able to cross the finish line (which I\u2019ve covered multiple times over the years):</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2011/03/14/sprint-t-mobile-ugly-deal-better-than-no-deal/?dlbk\">Sprint pursued T-Mobile</url> in 2011, but lost out in the end to AT&amp;T \u2014 which failed to complete the deal after the Justice Department sued to block that combination.</p><p> In 2014, Sprint, now owned by Masayoshi Son\u2019s SoftBank, held talks with T-Mobile, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/sprint-and-softbank-said-to-abandon-bid-for-t-mobile-us/?dlbk\">eventually broke off the discussions</url> after Washington regulators hinted strongly that they would move to block a union.</p><p> The two companies tried again in 2017, but this time the talks \u2014 which culminated over dinner at Mr. Son\u2019s home in Tokyo \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/dealbook/sprint-and-t-mobile-end-merger-discussions.html?dlbk\">fell apart</url> because of disagreements about control over the combined company.</p><p>But there\u2019s little surprise that the companies wouldn\u2019t give up on a deal. Mr. Son pursued Sprint in the first place with the idea of merging it with T-Mobile, creating a stronger competitor to Verizon and AT&amp;T.</p><p>But since SoftBank\u2019s acquisition, Sprint has continued to labor under an enormous debt load and has struggled to catch up to T-Mobile as the most popular low-cost carrier.

Cohen raises a host of issues about how prosecutors might be able to review those materials. One challenge will be dealing with the attorney-client privilege, which shields communications between lawyers and clients from any outside review.</p><p>Under Justice Department <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-13000-obtaining-evidence#9-13.420\">guidelines</url>, when a lawyer\u2019s office is search there must be procedures in place \u201cto ensure that privileged materials are not improperly viewed, seized or retained.\u201d One means to deal with privilege issues is to put in place a \u201ctaint team,\u201d consisting of agents and government attorneys who are not part of the underlying investigation to review the seized materials to determine what is arguably privileged.</p><p>Once that determination is made, Mr. Cohen can argue that privileged materials should be returned because they are protected.</p><p>Despite President Trump\u2019s tweet that \u201cthe attorney-client privilege is dead,\u201d the protection remains in place. But there is an important way around the privilege that the Justice Department may pursue. Under a doctrine called the crime-fraud exception, communications between a client and lawyer designed to assist the client to engage in a pending or future crime are not protected by the privilege.</p><p>The government would not have to prove a crime to avoid the privilege, only that there is enough evidence to support a reasonable belief that an otherwise privileged communication was for the purpose of committing a criminal or fraudulent act. In fact, <url normalizedValue=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/491/554/case.html\">under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Zolin</url>, prosecutors could ask a judge to review the communications privately to decide whether they may yield evidence of a potential crime or fraud.</p><p>This is a slow process, likely to drag out for months. But don\u2019t be surprised to see the Justice Department claiming that communications with Mr. Cohen were made for a criminal or fraudulent purpose \u2013 whatever that might be.</p><p>\u2014 Peter J. Henning</p><p>An interesting dissenter: One critic of Mr. Trump\u2019s contention that the Cohen raids violated attorney-client privilege is <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wlrk.com/GTConway/\">George Conway</url>, who\u2019s of counsel at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz \u2014 and the husband of Kellyanne Conway.</p><p>(For non-lawyers: Mr. Conway\u2019s link points to the Justice Department\u2019s policies for conducting searches of lawyers.)</p><p>The C.B.O. is still underestimating how bad the deficit is going to be.</p><p>The Congressional Budget Office now says that by 2027, the United States\u2019 budget deficit will be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/federal-deficit-tax-cuts-spending-trump.html\">$1.6 trillion larger than it previously expected, thanks in part to President Trump\u2019s tax overhaul, which sharply cuts revenues</url>.

Here's what we're watching:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>first Congressional hearing is here. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sprint and T-Mobile have restarted merger talks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">   Wall Street continues to wade into the gun control debate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">   The raid on Michael Cohen's office and residence raises a number of issues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">   The C.B.O. is still underestimating how bad the deficit is going to be.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here.</p><p>  That wasn't a waste of time.</p><p>  Congressional hearings focusing on corporate missteps often reveal little, in part because lawmakers lack the expertise and the executives taking questions are good at stone-walling.</p><p>  Still, Tuesday's hearing turned out to be a serious attempt to grapple with the growing influence of a powerful company that is entwined in the lives of millions of Americans.</p><p>  Lawmakers, it became clear, no longer see <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and other large tech companies as mostly benign forces for innovation. In his responses, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>was competent but notably did not reveal much that was new about how <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>will respond to its enormous challenges.</p><p>  On balance, the hearing probably leaves <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and its peers on the back foot in three important ways.</p><p>  Legislation to rein in social media companies is now a possibility. Lawmakers now seem much more aware of how much power large technology companies have. This was encapsulated in questions posed by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. He framed <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>as a monopoly and brought up the possibility of regulating <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>asking Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>: ''But you as a company welcome regulation?'' Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>gave a response often heard from C.E.O.s: ''I think if it's the right regulation, then yes.'' Senator Graham then secured something of a commitment from Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to work with the Senate on what regulations are necessary.</p><p>  A Senate with a Republican majority may be less likely to pass legislation, but if the Democrats gain control, top senators from that party might push for new laws ahead of a potential run in 2020. Some of the most penetrating questions on Tuesday came from Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, and Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey.</p><p>  Recidivism may now be taken more seriously. One of the reasons that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is under scrutiny is that it has been the source of several scandals. Patience has apparently worn thin in the Senate. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has not convincingly explained why it took so long to reveal Cambridge Analytica's misuse of the data of 87 million users. Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida, sounded bewildered by that misstep: ''You apologized for it. But you didn't notify them. And do you think that you have an ethical obligation to notify 87 million <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users?'' <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>may now only be one big scandal away from a stringent government response.</p><p>  Large technology companies sense an economic threat. Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>made an intriguing comment that suggested <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>could, in theory, offer a paid version, presumably to users who do not want ads or to share certain data with <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>He said: ''There will always be a version of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>that will be free.'' This suggests that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has begun to think about how it can adapt to a situation in which it gets access to less data from users. In other words, it may be taking a threat to its business model seriously.</p><p>  The fact that <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>stock rose through the hearing should not be taken as a sign that the company is in the clear.</p><p>  -- Peter Eavis</p><p>  Wall Street likes <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>performance</p><p>  Investors certainly liked <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>testimony on Capitol Hill Tuesday.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>shares rose 4.5 percent on the day. It was the strongest single-day performance for the stock since April 2016.</p><p>  After being down as much as 24 percent this year, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is steadily clawing back ground. Tuesday's gain left it down only 11.4 percent in 2018.</p><p>  -- Matt Phillips</p><p>  To regulate, or not to regulate</p><p>  Among the dominant themes of the hearing, and the past few weeks, has been whether <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>needs to be regulated. In fact, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said he open to <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>being regulated during his first interview after the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>  But some lawmakers expressed skepticism toward regulation during the hearing. Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, raised an important point about the impact of regulation: That it often benefits the biggest companies, at the expense smaller firms and startups.</p><p>  Here's Senator Sullivan's question to Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>:</p><p>  ''Regulations can also cement the dominant power. Do you think that that's a risk, given your influence, that if we regulate we're actually going to regulate you into a position of cemented authority?''</p><p>  In other words, if the government decides to crack down on <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>could that end up holding back the next <person><nameText>Facebook?</nameText></person></p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>conceded that that would be a risk.</p><p>  Is <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>a monopoly?</p><p>  That's the question that Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina hit on and its a sensitive one for <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>  In the weeks since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, many have said that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>can't be fixed and needs to be broken up.</p><p>  On Tuesday, Mr.Graham asked Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to name <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>biggest competitor. Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>responded that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has a lot of competitors.</p><p>  Then Mr. Graham pointed out that if a customer has a problem with the Ford they bought, they can buy a car from another auto maker. Here's their back-and-forth.</p><p>  Mr. Graham asked: ''Is there an alternative to <person><nameText>Facebook?</nameText></person>''</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>: ''Well, we provide a number of diff...''</p><p>  Mr. Graham: ''You don't think that you have a monopoly?''</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>: ''It certainly doesn't feel like that to me.''</p><p>  Generations collide</p><p>  The gap in knowledge about how <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>business works was on display at times during Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>testimony.</p><p>  The company has faced questions about the possibility of creating a paid service that would allow users to opt-out of sharing their data or seeing advertisements.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>insisted on Tuesday that there would always be a free version of <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>so that anyone in the world can afford to be part of its online community.</p><p>  At that point, Sentor Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican, asked Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>how he could sustain a business without charging anything for it.</p><p>  ''Sir, we run ads,'' Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>explained.</p><p>  Mr. Hatch replied: ''I see.''</p><p>  -- Alan Rappeport</p><p>  Regulation ahead?</p><p>  Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, called <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and its role in society ''extraordinary'' and began the hearing by explaining why <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is being singled out and why Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>was asked to appear alone.</p><p>  He said the Cambridge Analytica situation underscored how <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>can be used for nefarious reasons, saying it appeared ''to be the result of people exploiting the tools you created to manipulate users' information.''</p><p>  In an indication that he may support legislation for internet companies, Mr. Thune said, ''In the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been willing to defer to tech companies' efforts to regulate themselves. But this may be changing.''</p><p>  Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, said the tech industry ''has a responsibility'' to protect its users and said ''the status quo no longer works.''</p><p>  -- Cecilia Kang</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>as a proxy for Silicon Valley</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is the only technology chief in the room, but it is clear that members of Congress are treating him as a stand-in for the entirety of Silicon Valley.</p><p>  Mr. Grassley called the entire tech industry to account, saying ''the tech industry has an obligation to...restore the public's trust.'' Mr. Nelson put it even more bluntly: ''If you and other social media companies do not get your act in order, none of us are going to have any privacy.''</p><p>  In his opening statement, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>who is 33, made a point to remind Congress that he was young when this all began.</p><p>  ''I started <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>when I was in college,'' Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said. This is a recurring theme for Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>--in many recent interviews, he has referred to starting <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>in his Harvard dorm room. And perhaps it's wise to keep bringing up the fact that Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is much younger than most of the business executives who come before Congress.</p><p>  But the strategy could also backfire. After all, Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is a long way from his dorm room--on paper, he has been a billionaire for more than a decade--and by reminding lawmakers of his youth, he could also lead them to question whether he's mature enough to handle such enormous responsibilities and whether Silicon Valley needs more adult supervision in the way of additional federal regulation.</p><p>  -- Kevin Roose</p><p>  The must-watch <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>hearings start at 2:15 p.m. E.T.</p><p>  That's when <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>will testify before the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees; you can watch here. In his prepared testimony, published yesterday, he apologized for not doing more to stop fake news. Here's where lawmakers are likely to press him:</p><p>   Privacy, and whether 2 billion <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users can consider their data safe.</p><p>   The reach of Russia's election chicanery, and how slow the company was to publicize it. (According to a Columbia researcher, Peter Eavis notes, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is still understating that reach. The company disagrees.)</p><p>   The F.T.C.'s 2011 consent decree with the company, and whether it was violated in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. (<person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>says not.)</p><p>   Political bias and violent radicalization (an especially big topic in countries like Myanmar).</p><p>  The bigger point: Andrew writes in his latest column that, however harshly lawmakers question Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>the public still seems willing to be hand <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>personal information.</p><p>  More from the column:</p><p>  The problem is that Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has been apologizing for years for all sorts of breaches of trust with his ''community.'' And guess what? After each mea culpa, the <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>community has grown.</p><p>  Elsewhere in <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>news: Wildlife preservation advocates complained to the S.E.C. that the company is serving ads on the pages of wildlife traffickers.</p><p>  Wall Street continues to wade into the gun control debate</p><p>Bank of America will stop lending money to gun manufacturers that make military-inspired firearms for civilian use, such as the AR-15-style rifles that have been used in multiple mass shootings, a company executive said Tuesday.</p><p>  ''We want to contribute in any way we can to reduce these mass shootings,'' Anne M. Finucane, vice chairwoman at the Bank of America, said on Bloomberg TV.</p><p>  The bank works with ''just a handful of manufacturers,'' with whom it has had ''intense conversations over the last few months,'' Ms. Finucane said. Their reactions to the new policy have been ''mixed,'' she said.</p><p>Bank of America would not name any of the gun manufacturers it works with, but its clients include well-known, publicly held brands. The bank will wind down its relationships with the companies that choose to continue making AR-15-style rifles and similar guns.</p><p>  For now, Bank of America will continue to offer banking services to firearms retailers. Asking gun shops to stop selling certain types of handguns or long guns ''gets into civil liberties'' and is ''a ways off,'' Ms. Finucane said.</p><p>  Last month Citigroup announced that it would require business customers to restrict certain types of firearms sales. And earlier this month BlackRock said it plans to offer new funds that exclude gun makers or sellers is the latest prominent step by a financial firm to offer some support to gun control.</p><p>  -- Tiffany Hsu</p><p>  It's that time again</p><p>  Shares in Sprint leapt 17 percent on Tuesday after the WSJ reported on the restarted talks. Shares in T-Mobile were up 5.7 percent as well.</p><p>  Let's recap the tortured history of the telecom merger that hasn't quite been able to cross the finish line (which I've covered multiple times over the years):</p><p>Sprint pursued T-Mobile in 2011, but lost out in the end to AT&amp;T -- which failed to complete the deal after the Justice Department sued to block that combination.</p><p>   In 2014, Sprint, now owned by Masayoshi Son's SoftBank, held talks with T-Mobile, but eventually broke off the discussions after Washington regulators hinted strongly that they would move to block a union.</p><p>   The two companies tried again in 2017, but this time the talks -- which culminated over dinner at Mr. Son's home in Tokyo -- fell apart because of disagreements about control over the combined company.</p><p>  But there's little surprise that the companies wouldn't give up on a deal. Mr. Son pursued Sprint in the first place with the idea of merging it with T-Mobile, creating a stronger competitor to Verizon and AT&amp;T.</p><p>  But since SoftBank's acquisition, Sprint has continued to labor under an enormous debt load and has struggled to catch up to T-Mobile as the most popular low-cost carrier. Sprint's operating income declined over the course of last year to $648 million in its fourth quarter. It also has reported losses in all but two quarters since 2015 (its $7.2 billion profit in the fourth quarter arose from the Republican tax overhaul).</p><p>T-Mobile, by contrast, has done better, having gained customers by emphasizing its low prices and network improvements. Its operating income in the fourth quarter came to $950 million, while its net income totaled $2.7 billion (another beneficiary of the tax cuts).</p><p>  -- Michael J. de la Merced</p><p>  Piercing the attorney-client privilege</p><p>  The report in The New York Times that the F.B.I. seized records from the office of President Trump's longtime lawyer Michael D. Cohen raises a host of issues about how prosecutors might be able to review those materials. One challenge will be dealing with the attorney-client privilege, which shields communications between lawyers and clients from any outside review.</p><p>  Under Justice Department guidelines, when a lawyer's office is search there must be procedures in place ''to ensure that privileged materials are not improperly viewed, seized or retained.'' One means to deal with privilege issues is to put in place a ''taint team,'' consisting of agents and government attorneys who are not part of the underlying investigation to review the seized materials to determine what is arguably privileged.</p><p>  Once that determination is made, Mr. Cohen can argue that privileged materials should be returned because they are protected.</p><p>  Despite President Trump's tweet that ''the attorney-client privilege is dead,'' the protection remains in place. But there is an important way around the privilege that the Justice Department may pursue. Under a doctrine called the crime-fraud exception, communications between a client and lawyer designed to assist the client to engage in a pending or future crime are not protected by the privilege.</p><p>  The government would not have to prove a crime to avoid the privilege, only that there is enough evidence to support a reasonable belief that an otherwise privileged communication was for the purpose of committing a criminal or fraudulent act. In fact, under the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Zolin, prosecutors could ask a judge to review the communications privately to decide whether they may yield evidence of a potential crime or fraud.</p><p>  This is a slow process, likely to drag out for months. But don't be surprised to see the Justice Department claiming that communications with Mr. Cohen were made for a criminal or fraudulent purpose -- whatever that might be.</p><p>  -- Peter J. Henning</p><p>  An interesting dissenter: One critic of Mr. Trump's contention that the Cohen raids violated attorney-client privilege is George Conway, who's of counsel at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz -- and the husband of Kellyanne Conway.</p><p>  (For non-lawyers: Mr. Conway's link points to the Justice Department's policies for conducting searches of lawyers.)</p><p>  The C.B.O. is still underestimating how bad the deficit is going to be.</p><p>  The Congressional Budget Office now says that by 2027, the United States' budget deficit will be $1.6 trillion larger than it previously expected, thanks in part to President Trump's tax overhaul, which sharply cuts revenues. But close observers of the Treasury bond market -- where Uncle Sam will have to turn to borrow the money it needs to cover those budget gaps -- say it will doubtless be much higher.</p><p>Goldman Sachs economists point out that the C.B.O.'s projections only extrapolate discretionary spending increases through 2019 fiscal year, whereas the bank's analysis points to more spending through 2021 fiscal year, raising the Goldman's deficit projections higher.</p><p>  Elsewhere, Jefferies economists noted that the analysis from the C.B.O. doesn't take into account the Federal Reserve's gradual reduction of the amount of government bonds it is holding, which means that the Treasury has to replace the Fed as a buyer.</p><p>  All else equal, the disappearance of a buyer like the Fed -- which can create as much money as it needs -- along with surging supply of Treasury borrowing needed to cover deepening deficits should add up one thing: Sharply higher interest rates.</p><p>  -- Matt Phillips</p><p>  Critics' corner:  The Peterson Foundation said, ''It's clear that lawmakers have added significantly more debt on top of an already unsustainable trajectory.'' Harm Bandholz of UniCredit said, ''The C.B.O. strongly contradicts the administration's claim that the stimulus will pay for itself.''</p><p>  The political flyaround</p><p>   A year before Apollo Global Management lent millions of dollars to Kushner Companies, Jared Kushner reportedly approached its co-founder Josh Harris about leading the Office of Management and Budget.

'He acts like a visionary, but at heart he's still a salesman,' one manager told me.''</p><p>   Novogratz is said to consider himself ''halfway between center-left and progressive,'' and ''During my lunch with him at the Mercer Kitchen, he told me, 'I've always said I'd run for office if I had a five-year period in my life where really I felt, like, Hey, my behavior is laudable.'''</p><p>  Where do CBS and Viacom go from here?</p><p>  Public negotiations between the corporate siblings have intensified. Viacom's counterproposal -- 0.68 of a CBS share for every Viacom share, or $14.7 billion; CBS had offered 0.55, or $11.9 billion -- is likely to be rejected.</p><p>  Price may be less of a sticking point, however, than CBS's insistence on keeping its chief operating officer, Joe Ianniello, in the No. 2 spot after a merger. That's the job Viacom wants for its C.E.O., Bob Bakish.

Submitted by Huw van Steenis, senior adviser to the CEO of UBS, and formerly senior adviser to Bank of England Governor Mark Carney.    Three things I learned in Washington  As the world's central banks and economic policymakers convened in Washington over the weekend for the annual meetings of the IMF, IIF and World Bank, there was a distinct lack of conviction in the air.  \"Globally synchronised slowdown\", trade wars, political uncertainty and persistent ultralow interest rates have ground down most investors and policymakers' belief in the prevailing economic or market narratives. </p><p> So the most interesting conversations were about transitions and tail risks. What are the long term implications of negative rates? How disruptive is digital money? And what does the greening of the financial system mean in practice?  Central banks are wrestling with a major challenge: are negative rates starting to do more harm than good? Professor Charles Goodhart of the LSE and I fear we may have already have this 'reversal rate' in the Eurozone.  Like steroids, unconventional policy, such as negative rates, can be highly effective in limited dosages but long term usage starts to weaken the skeletal system. Given that negative rates have been in place for over a quarter of the time that the euro has existed, policymakers are starting to worry about the negative consequences \u2014 like impaired banking systems and asset bubbles.  I sensed an inflection in the level of concern from two distinct groups: Anglo-Saxon policy makers who simply never want to open the Pandora's box of negative rates, and European policy makers growing increasingly concerned about the toolkit to break out of the 'Japanification' of the eurozone.  What's more, the penny is dropping that negative rates are hampering the ability of many eurozone banks, aside from the market leaders, to invest confidently in digital technology to serve clients better and fend off the risks from disruptive new entrants. I came away feeling the bar is now incredibly high for any further negative rate cuts.  Second, technology is rapidly changing the way we pay for things. Investors know this well from the huge growth in value of Mastercard, Visa, Paypal and Amex, or new firms like Stripe and Ant Financial.  Little wonder that payments has become the battleground between Big Tech, existing payments firms and banks. The size of the prize can be huge. Alipay and WeChatPay represent 90% of mobile payments in China.  Facebook's audacious moonshot, Libra, has raised the stakes.[3] Whilst not a single financial boss I met thinks Libra will succeed unless it pivots to a local currency model \u2014 think PayTM or Alipay \u2014 it has rattled the policy world.  One former central banker highlighted that counterfeiting currency has been a capital offence in many countries over the centuries, and they sounded keen to bring this level of disapproval \u2014 if not the actual punishment \u2014 to the digital age.  If nothing else, Libra is likely to prompt a flurry of initiatives to improve the plumbing and regulation of payments. But I sensed little appetite for major central banks to create their own blockchain digital currencies \u2014 as Fed Governor Brainard argued compellingly, at the Peterson Institute's 'Future of Money[4]' summit.  But the overwhelming theme, if there was one, was the greening of the financial system. Many central banks are following the lead set by Governor Mark Carney that climate change is a legitimate concern for financial regulators.  The transition to a lower-carbon economy will require large scale re-allocation of capital and new investments. Without high quality comparable data, investors, lenders and insurers wont be able to price climate risks and opportunities effectively. That was a key theme of my Future of Finance report. [5]  2019 has been a pivotal year: Japanese firms who have agreed to disclose their climate change footprint according to the standards set by the G20's Task Force for Climate-related Disclosures (TCFD) have gone from 9 to 199 in just one year. Today four-fifths of the top 1100 companies in the world have now voluntarily signed up. And pressure will grow in the remainder to report, I heard at the World Economic Forum roundtable.  I see a similar upswing in investor interest. Some two-thirds of new institutional asset management mandates in Europe have sustainable criteria, albeit with massive variation in what clients want.  Taking these new TCFD disclosures and turning them into something decision-useful for portfolios and firms is no small undertaking. And let us be in no doubt, there is a healthy debate about the materiality of these issues amongst policy makers. But this is where the puck is going.  Low conviction meant investors at Washington were largely taking their cue from the late-cycle investing playbook. Seeking to dial up quality across their portfolios and testing the dependability and sustainability of earnings. And thinking about how these transitions and tail risks will play out.

He is squaring up against John McDonnell and Andrew O'Callaghan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The firm's 90-plus partners will convene a partner's meeting in the coming weeks to grill the three candidates on their leadership credentials. A ballot will then be held, with the winning partner being announced on December 19, it is understood.</p><p>An earlier contender, Paul Tuite, is believed to have pulled out at this point, leaving three candidates in the race.</p><p>PwC is a giant global tax and advisory business employing 2,800 people in Ireland. The position of senior partner is one of the most influential in Irish corporate life, and involves dealing with the country's biggest banks, state bodies and corporations.</p><p>It will be the first time that a large number of the firm's partners have voted in a leadership ballot, with a number of recent candidates being elected unopposed. The winning partner will succeed Ronan Murphy and will take over on July 1 next year.</p><p>The three candidates to replace Murphy - O'Rourke, McDonnell and O'Callaghan - will have prepared finely honed presentation pitches, and have been canvassing support in recent weeks ahead of the ballot.</p><p>**The candidates**</p><p>It's a diverse trio, with different skillsets. O'Rourke is by far the most high profile, with links to the world of politics and multinationals. A rugby fan, he also has an avid interest in American politics and cult TV series such as Breaking Bad.</p><p>He is generally press friendly and voluble, coming from a political family (he is former Fianna F\u00e1il TD Mary O'Rourke's son and first cousin of the late former finance minister Brian Lenihan). He eschewed politics opting to be an accountant instead, and became a partner at PwC in 1996 at 31.</p><p>O'Rourke oversees PwC's massive tax practice and its team of 500 tax and legal experts in Ireland, the US and London.</p><p>He was on the board at science and technology body Forf\u00e1s on a voluntary basis for many years where he encouraged the government to introduce a programme of innovation-boosting tax credits that were attractive to multinationals, like those in his stable of big tech clients.</p><p>He has been forthright in fighting his clients' and Ireland's corner on the country's sometimes controversial tax policy.</p><p>He is accustomed to dealing with powerbrokers and has regularly acted as an informal counsel to government politicians.</p><p>Andy O'Callaghan is a much less high-profile figure, but also well connected. He has worked with top IFSC-based global fund management players for close to 20 years, advising them on structuring their products in Ireland's welcoming fund back office environment.

As US politicians and regulators circle the industry, a once unthinkable idea is starting to be voiced more widely: whether a forced break-up of some of the world's most powerful companies will soon be on the agenda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The idea was first thrust into the headlines in March by Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and presidential hopeful, who promised to break up Big Tech if she is elected to the White House.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week, the shadow of drastic regulatory action was cast again over Silicon Valley after it emerged that the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission had divided up responsibility for potential antitrust investigations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the same time, the House judiciary committee announced its own inquiry into whether US antitrust laws need to be tightened up to deal with the tech giants.</p><p>The flurry of interest has emboldened the industry's critics and prompted executives and analysts to start asking a question that until recently seemed inconceivable: What form should any forced break-ups take?</p><p>The possibilities raised most frequently include declaring some markets off-limits to the biggest tech companies; carving out their most powerful platforms to become separate regulated utilities; and unwinding past acquisitions that raised few concerns at the time they were completed.</p><p>But even cutting the tech giants down to size and scattering their operations between a group of successor companies might not be enough to silence all the concerns.</p><p>'All it's going to do is distribute the problem, not solve it. If you bust up Google into 10 parts, you still have 10 people' assembling detailed data profiles of internet users, said Roger McNamee, a veteran Silicon Valley investor and critic of Big Tech.</p><p>The chances of a forced unbundling of the leading tech companies are hard to handicap. Ms Warren's call for drastic action was nothing more than 'a rhetorical way of getting attention politically', one Washington critic of Google said. 'It shows you're serious, kicking ass and taking names in antitrust. But her people know that getting there is hard.'</p><p>For regulators, meanwhile, antitrust cases seeking the ultimate sanction of a break-up are 'horrifically expensive to bring, and the remedies are always disappointing', said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>He pointed to Microsoft's successful appeal against a 2001 court order to separate its Windows business from everything else as one reason why US regulators were likely to be wary of pursuing similar action now.</p><p>But that has not prevented growing debate about what form forced break-ups or other structural limits on the tech industry might take.</p><p>Restrict the markets they can enter</p><p>One approach would be to restrict the number of markets in which the companies can operate. That would mark a throwback to an older way of looking at the economy in which large areas of commercial activity were limited to a prescribed set of companies, said Michael Cusumano, a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>There was a precedent for such a move, said Mr McNamee: a 1956 US consent decree involving AT and T. The intervention restricted the telecoms monopolist to only operating in regulated markets, reducing the risk that it would throw its weight around more broadly.</p><p>A similar arrangement could be used to restrain the tech companies. Obvious examples of businesses they could be shut out of, according to Mr McNamee, are transport and financial services, where they are already starting to make a mark. Drawing lines like this would also force the companies to shed any operations they already have in these areas.</p><p>Split off their platform businesses</p><p>A second idea that has gained growing support among tech's critics would involve splitting off monopolistic digital platforms. Supporters of this idea, such as Ms Warren, say it would address a common problem: the winner-takes-all phenomenon, where network effects produce dominant platforms.</p><p>For today's biggest tech companies, the platforms range from Google's search engine and the mobile app stores of Apple and Google to Amazon's ecommerce marketplace.</p><p>Trying to carve out the big tech platforms into standalone companies, however, would not be as simple as it sounds. One complication comes from the different business models that tech companies have built around their platforms.</p><p>For instance, Google doesn't charge for its Android mobile operating system, instead using it to draw users to its advertising-supported services.</p><p>'Pull all that apart, and it would ruin the company,' said Mr Cusumano. 'It's the free Android business that enables things like Maps and Gmail.'</p><p>Deciding what constitutes a platform, and how to carve up the many functions in the tech giants' digital operations, would also turn out to be a complex and contentious process.</p><p>Reverse past acquisitions</p><p>A third option for restructuring Big Tech would involve unwinding past acquisitions, such as Facebook's purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram, and Google's of YouTube.</p><p>These operations remain distinct inside both companies, making a split easier to achieve. However, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said recently that he planned to tie Facebook's various services more tightly together - interpreted by some as a pre-emptive move to make it harder to break up the company.</p><p>Even some analysts generally opposed to breaking up big tech companies concede that some acquisitions may have gone too far.</p><p>Mark Mahaney, an internet analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said that the tech companies had brought considerable benefits for their consumers - but Google's acquisition of DoubleClick, the display advertising business, might be one deal that could be unwound, even though it was cleared by both the FTC and European regulators at the time.</p><p>How would the tech companies fare?</p><p>How future break-ups would affect the companies is hard to judge. Some argue that they would be an unmitigated disaster for investors. Amazon's retail business, split from Amazon Web Services (AWS), would be exposed as a chronic lossmaker, said Bill Smead, head of Smead Capital Management, a value investor based in Seattle, leaving it 'selling at a loss and shipping for free'.</p><p>Similarly, if Apple were forced to spin off its apps and services, cutting it back to its low-growth software and hardware platforms, it would strip the company of its best prospects for growth. 'If you remove the ability of Apple to sell services, it's devastating,' said Mr Cusumano.</p><p>But in other cases, break-ups might actually benefit shareholders. Businesses such as Instagram or YouTube, for instance, might be able to step out from the shadow cast by their corporate parents and go on to become tech giants in their own right. 'I would argue the sum of the parts is worth more than the whole,' said Youssef Squali, an analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.</p><p>Some analysts also point to conflicts of interest inside today's tech groups that, while not raising regulatory concerns, could hamper their business prospects, making spin-offs desirable.</p><p>AWS's dominance of the cloud computing market, for instance, has left other retail companies with a difficult choice: should they rely on a rival to supply their essential computing needs? As an independent company, AWS would stir less fear among potential customers, said Dave Bartoletti, an analyst at Forrester Research.</p><p>'There's a ton of logic in them being standalone businesses,' said Mr Squali. He compared the potential of spin-offs with the performance of PayPal, the payments business whose market value has more than tripled since it was spun out of eBay in 2015.</p><p>With the battle lines only just being drawn over Big Tech's future, however, the prospects for any significant corporate restructuring are likely to take years to become clear.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSDAY-BUSSDAY070620190000503</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSDAY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W95-TTX1-JCH9-G21F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436445</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1309\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Business Day All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Day</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 7, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He's been used against his will as the actual frontman for many scams.</p><p>If you've ever had the misfortune to spend any time on the website they call Facebook, you may even have seen one such ad - they have Martin's face on them, with a fake quote from him promising you'll be rich if you buy into the scheme that will be revealed to you when you click on kindly and trustworthy Martin's face.</p><p>Obviously, once you've bought into the scheme, you never see your money again or the promised riches.</p><p>And there's not much you can do about it.</p><p>Anyway, Martin had enough of all this - despite his repeated assertions whenever he got the chance that he \"didn't do ads\".</p><p>The ads didn't stop and people continued to get ripped off.</p><p>And so Martin decided to sue Facebook. The case was eventually settled out of court, with Facebook agreeing to donate \u00a33m to a scheme of Martin's choosing to help stop the scammers, and to add tools to Facebook itself to help users report scammy ads.</p><p>This week, the fruits of those two labours went live.</p><p>Firstly, the Citizens Advice Bureau, the institution Martin chose to work with to get the message out, has revealed its new dedicated Scam Action project - funded by Facebook's \u00a33m.</p><p>It will now offer dedicated one-to-one advice to anyone who thinks they may have fallen victim to a scam.</p><p>It will also undertake scam prevention activity - spreading the word so more people are aware of what a scam looks like, and how to avoid falling into the trap.</p><p>The other side of the attack on the scammers comes from Facebook itself - built into each ad is a new facility to report the ad as a potential scam, so Facebook can investigate.</p><p>You access the tool by clicking the three dots in the top right-hand corner of any ad - when you select the \"report ad\" option, there is now a button you can press to mark it as a potential scam.</p><p>Martin himself said: \"The UK faces an epidemic of online scam ads - they're everywhere.

The aim is to tap the power of what I'm dubbing 'social policing' to fight these scams. Millions of people know a scam when they see it, and millions of others don't.</p><p>\"During the lawsuit negotiations I approached Citizens Advice and asked if it'd be willing to help in the fight against scam ads.</p><p>\"I was delighted that it was so eager to do it, and that it'd have a couple of years of resources to try to tackle and repair the damage caused by the scourge of scams.\"</p><p>\u00a6 IF you think you've fallen victim to an scam online, you can contact the Citizens Advice Scams Action by calling 0300 330 3003 for one-on-one help, or visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scamsaction\">www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scamsaction</url> for more information or help via a web chat.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Martin Lewis, founder of the site <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com\">www.moneysavingexpert.com</url>, sued Facebook over ads that used his image as a front for online scams</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYPST-151251525</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYPST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WM2-WS21-JCBW-N0YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">245286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"555\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Trinity Mirror plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Post (North Wales)</publicationName><edition>Edition 1, </edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 20, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He's been used against his will as the actual frontman for many scams.</p><p>If you've ever had the misfortune to spend any time on the website they call Facebook, you may even have seen one such ad - they have Martin's face on them, with a fake quote from him promising you'll be rich if you buy into the scheme that will be revealed to you when you click on kindly and trustworthy Martin's face.</p><p>Obviously, once you've bought into the scheme, you never see your money again or the promised riches.</p><p>And there's not much you can do about it.</p><p>Anyway, Martin had enough of all this - despite his repeated assertions whenever he got the chance that he \"didn't do ads\".</p><p>The ads didn't stop and people continued to get ripped off.</p><p>And so Martin decided to sue Facebook. The case was eventually settled out of court, with Facebook agreeing to donate \u00a33m to a scheme of Martin's choosing to help stop the scammers, and to add tools to Facebook itself to help users report scammy ads.</p><p>This week, the fruits of those two labours went live.</p><p>Firstly, the Citizens Advice Bureau, the institution Martin chose to work with to get the message out, has revealed its new dedicated Scam Action project - funded by Facebook's \u00a33m.</p><p>It will now offer dedicated one-to-one advice to anyone who thinks they may have fallen victim to a scam.</p><p>It will also undertake scam prevention activity - spreading the word so more people are aware of what a scam looks like, and how to avoid falling into the trap.</p><p>The other side of the attack on the scammers comes from Facebook itself - built into each ad is a new facility to report the ad as a potential scam, so Facebook can investigate.</p><p>You access the tool by clicking the three dots in the top right-hand corner of any ad - when you select the \"report ad\" option, there is now a button you can press to mark it as a potential scam.</p><p>Martin himself said: \"The UK faces an epidemic of online scam ads - they're everywhere.
