The complaint is based on claims that Apple has introduced certain rules in recent years that put rival developers in an economic and competitive disadvantage, to the expense of not only other streaming companies but to the user and their experience too. Spotify said that it had attempted to resolve the issue directly with Apple to no avail, which is why it approached the EC, the regulatory body responsible for maintaining fair competition, for some authority on the matter.The complaint focusses on the 30% tax Apple charges developers for using its in-app purchasing system (IAP) which includes upgrading from the Free Spotify version to its paid, subscription-based 'Premium' account which gives users an ad-free experience. </p><p>Charging the tax forced Spotify to raise its subscription fee from its initial price of \u20ac9.99, to \u20ac12.99 just as Apple Music launched for Spotify's initial \u20ac9.99 price, according to Spotify's general counsel Horacio Gutierrez. He also said that the company was pressured into using Apple's billing system in 2014 but then detached itself from the program so users can only upgrade through indirect means, such as through Spotify's web page accessed by a laptop. 'We aren't seeking special treatment,\" said Daniel Ek, founder and CEO of Spotify in a blog post[1]. 'We simply want the same treatment as numerous other apps on the App Store, like Uber or Deliveroo, who aren't subject to the Apple tax and therefore don't have the same restrictions.' Apple also has a contingency plan for those, like Spotify, which are considering leaving its IAP. According to Ek, forgoing Apple's IAP leads to the limitation of communications with customers by the tech giant. Ek also claims that Apple has blocked its 'experience-enhancing upgrades' which has resulted in Spotify being excluded from integration with Siri, HomePod and Apple Watch. Spotify is requesting three changes to Apple's operations:First, apps should be able to compete fairly on the merits, and not based on who owns the App Store. We should all be subject to the same fair set of rules and restrictions--including Apple Music. Second, consumers should have a real choice of payment systems, and not be \"locked in\" or forced to use systems with discriminatory tariffs such as Apple's. Finally, app stores should not be allowed to control the communications between services and users, including placing unfair restrictions on marketing and promotions that benefit consumers.'Competition pushes us to evolve and improve both the customer and creator experience,' said Ek. 'It's not something we ever have, or will, shy away from. So, let me be clear that this is not a Spotify-versus-Apple issue. We want the same fair rules for companies young and old, large and small. It is about supporting and nurturing the healthy ecosystem that made our two companies successful in the first place.' IT Pro has approached Apple for comment but the company has yet to reply. The news couldn't come in a more timely manner, at least that's what Senator Warren could be thinking. Earlier this week we reported on how Warren seeks to break up big tech companies from monopolising their markets and stifling innovation from rivals. She made proposals for the restructuring of companies such as Google, Amazon and Facebook, but the one she made against Apple seems quite fitting. She opined that Apple should not be allowed to both host its App Store while also hosting its own apps on the platform. A day after her proposals were reported, Facebook was caught red-handed[2]blocking Warren's campaign posts made on the platform, the same site that she suggested should be disbanded from its WhatsApp and Instagram arms. Facebook restored her posts, but not before she took to Twitter to vent her annoyance.If Warren gets her way, cases like the one Spotify has brought to Apple could be a thing of the past and there could be a rise in smaller companies coming to the fore with exciting products before the bigger firms are able to swallow them in antitrust mergers[3].

The Coalition for App Fairness, a Washington-based ...</p><p>WASHINGTON -- Spotify and the makers of Fortnite and Tinder are taking on Apple and Google as part of a newly formed coalition calling for \"fair treatment\" in the way the tech giants run their app stores.   The Coalition for App Fairness, a Washington-based non-profit, launched Thursday and will advocate for legal and regulatory changes, such as measures that could block Apple and Google from favouring their own apps in the iPhone and Android operating systems they control. The activism from smaller rivals adds to scrutiny the tech giants are facing from U.S. and European regulators and lawmakers.    The group aims to be the \"voice of app and game developers in the effort to protect consumer choice and create a level playing field for all,\" said a statement from Horacio Gutierrez, head of global affairs and chief legal officer for music-streaming pioneer Spotify.    Apple is the group's main target, though Google's app store policies are also on its radar. Both companies this summer dropped the popular game Fortnite from their app stores after the game's developer introduced a direct payment plan that bypasses their platforms.    Apple and Google both take a 30% cut from in-app revenue purchases, which has long been a sore spot with developers.    Fortnite's developer, Epic Games, responded by suing the companies over what it sees as anti-competitive behaviour. Epic is backing the new coalition along with Spotify, online dating app maker Match Group, and other members including Tile, Basecamp, ProtonMail and European media industry associations.    In addition to the app stores, Big Tech is facing fresh scrutiny from antitrust regulators. As the Trump administration moves toward antitrust action against search giant Google, it's campaigning to enlist support from sympathetic state attorneys general across the country.    The anticipated lawsuit against Google by the Justice Department could be the government's biggest legal offensive to protect competition since the ground-breaking case against Microsoft almost 20 years ago.    Lawmakers and consumer advocates accuse Google of abusing its dominance in online search and advertising to stifle competition and boost its profits.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43154655071</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XC-9XY1-F07F-8365-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"412\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>BNN Bloomberg</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It's a bold move for a company whose market cap is 32 times smaller than Apple's. But Spotify has bloodied Apple's nose before when it circumvented App Store fees. It's bad news for Apple that some of its most popular app makers keep challenging the App Store's economics. Spotify's complaint comes as there's never been greater political will to regulate big tech firms. </p><p>Spotify has gone to war against Apple, filing a legal complaint with European antitrust authorities over what it claims is anti-competitive behaviour. Spotify's beef is about the 30% fee that Apple charges on App Store subscriptions. Apple makes life extremely difficult for services that try and avoid that fee, Spotify argues, meaning the company will have to raise its prices to account for the levy. That would make Spotify more expensive than Apple's in-house streaming service, Apple Music, which doesn't have to pay the same 30% levy. That, Spotify says, is anti-competitive behaviour because Apple wins either way. You can read more about the complaint here[1].Read more: Spotify is going to war with Apple, filing an antitrust complaint over fears it is crushing competitors[2]Fighting Apple is a bold move, given Spotify is a comparative minnow. The Swedish service operates a single business \u2014 music streaming \u2014 while Apple is a major player covering mobile, the cloud, media and entertainment, and computing. Apple, with a market cap of $853 billion, is 32 times more valuable than Spotify, with its $26 billion market cap. With this in mind, it is hard to see that Apple will be overly worried about the complaint. Indeed, it is yet to even comment on the proceedings filed with the European Commission. But that is only when the complaint is viewed in isolation. It should worry Apple that some of the biggest and most popular app makers are willing to challenge the economics of the App Store, which CEO Tim Cook keeps billing as a driver of Apple's future growth.App makers like Netflix are challenging App Store feesApple is suffering from peak iPhone and must look to its services division for continued growth. That includes businesses like iCloud, the App Store, and Apple Music. But that growth faces a challenge if popular third-party developers keep challenging the App Store's main source of revenue \u2014 its 30% levy. And there are indications that Apple will feel the pain. Take the example of Netflix. The streaming service is the biggest app maker to date to circumvent App Store billing[3], asking iPad and iPhone users to pay for its subscription service through its site rather than through Apple. According to Sensor Tower data, Netflix is the top-grossing app for Apple in the US and the billing change could deprive the iPhone maker of as much as $256 million a year in subscription fees. The Netflix move was widely seen as a blow to Apple's narrative that its services division would be the driver of future revenue. We also know that Apple will already be feeling the impact from Spotify pulling a similar stunt a few years ago.Spotify used to make Apple an awful lot of moneyLook at these two side-by-side charts from Sensor Tower. They show that Spotify was Apple's top-grossing app both in the US and globally in November 2015.2015 is an important date in this dogfight \u2014 it was the last year Spotify billed every premium subscriber through iTunes, meaning it paid up to 30% of all subscription fees to Apple. The upshot was that Spotify was incredibly lucrative for Apple. That changed in 2016, when Spotify wouldn't allow new app users on iPhone or iPad upgrade to its paid Premium service through iTunes. Instead, it directed people to its website. That meant it could keep subscription revenue for itself, instead of handing a chunk over to Apple. The impact was immediate, as shown by the Nomura chart below. The graph compares how much revenue Spotify and Netflix make through the App Store. Look at the red line denoting Spotify \u2014 and what happened in 2016 when the firm altered its billing process. You can see there's a big dropoff:That's a pretty sharp decline! We can see from the grey line that the dropoff for Netflix will be even more severe. Both Spotify and Netflix through their separate actions have paved the way for other big app makers, who have to fork out lots of money to Apple, to also take a stand. We've seen a similar story with Google, where the maker of \"Fortnite\" decided to circumvent Google's Play Store[4] for the Android release.Can Apple just keep creating its own competing services?One answer to all of the above, of course, is that Apple has built its own perfectly serviceable music streaming service which is gaining in popularity. It is also about to launch a Netflix competitor. As it currently stands, Apple wins if both Spotify and Netflix have reduced access to the App Store, because that would drive more people to download and subscribe to Apple Music. As Spotify's CEO acknowledged in his statement on Apple, the App Store is the \"gateway\" to the internet[5] for the billion people who own an iOS device. It's a huge marketing tool for any app developer. Apple can't mimic every popular app that decides to avoid the App Store levy though, not least because the regulators might step in. And there has never been greater appetite to regulate the major Silicon Valley firms, both in the Europe and the US. Given the political risk, it might just be easier to bow before this minnow after all.NOW WATCH: A drone builder claims he invented the smallest flying car in the world \u2014 the Koncepto

That was a time when relative amateurs and inquisitive people could rise up through the world of independent blogging, then a small niche, and have their world eventually exposed to millions. An astonishingly large portion of reporters and columnists were once bloggers; those who got in early could make a name for themselves.That ended once Facebook and Google took advertising dollars away from blogs, and Facebook (and to a lesser extent Twitter) took the eyeballs. They did this largely through acquisitions: Google bought YouTube and DoubleClick, a leading advertising technology provider; Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp, and they added on dozens of other back-end companies and competitors to dominate the space. Antitrust enforcers did next to nothing to stop it.As a result, the manner in which I became known as a political writer has been completely shut off. </p><p>Younger journalists are shouting into the wilderness, with thin hopes for advancement. It damages the entire media ecosystem. And we're seeing this cycle tragically repeat itself again in podcasting.More from David Dayen[1]There as well, a vibrant community of independent hosts, with a variety of styles and niche audiences, has exploded over the past several years. A lot of content is available for free, much of it with live advertising reads. Google and Facebook haven't dominated the ad space because it's not totally programmatic; listeners respond better to the podcasters they like supporting the products. Another source of revenue has been listener subscription services like Patreon; some podcasts combine free episodes with special 'bonus' ones behind a paywall.The multiple revenue streams have allowed podcasts to maintain and thrive, and the relative ease of distribution through numerous syndication channels bolsters that. As Matt Stoller points out[2], no one actor controls the content, the advertising, and the distribution, similar to the blogosphere in the mid-2000s.But here as well, a giant is intruding on the space, with visions of pulling all the listeners their way and aggregating all the money available for themselves and their handpicked stable. This came to a head last week when Spotify announced a $100 million deal with Joe Rogan[3], which would put his popular podcast and archives exclusively on their site by the end of the year.This comes after a series of acquisitions by Spotify, including the Bill Simmons sports site The Ringer, a series of podcast networks like Gimlet and Parcast, and ancillary companies that provide ad tools and data analytics, among other things. Spotify is already the largest podcasting platform[4] in the world. The Rogan deal is just for exclusive content. So distribution would then be centralized on Spotify along with content, and they're growing the ad tech to dominate that part of the market too.These elements build on one another: Once Spotify grows its share of the podcasting network, it will have the data to target advertising. Spotify has an ad-supported 'free' version of its service, and a subscription-based one at $10 a month, combining the multiple podcasting revenue streams. The ad-supported version is necessarily programmatic and can therefore be targeted to user profiles. Regardless of what listeners opt into, it helps Spotify: They get the user data either way, and can target ads or collect monthly fees. Your donation keeps this site free and open for all to read. Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT Fans of Rogan or The Ringer's assortment of podcasts or the others Spotify is sure to snap up will have to use the service to find their favorites. They're building the dominant channel for audio content, in an attempt to muscle everyone else out. Simmons actually identified this as the main attraction to selling The Ringer. In an interview with Vulture[5], Simmons explained that he wasn't looking to sell, but he saw Spotify's various purchases of podcasting networks and supporting companies. 'When they made the Gimlet move[6], and Parcast[7] I was like, 'I like everything I've read about these moves that you're making and how you're thinking about stuff, and I think it's worth us talking a little more seriously.'' In other words, he wasn't interested in hooking up with Spotify, but now that Spotify was becoming a budding monopolist, it sounded great.We see how this has worked in other contexts. If you get some attention, you get sucked up by the giants: Witness The Office star John Krasinski's video series Some Good News, which he sold to Viacom[8] after a bidding war. Those not fortunate enough to have a pre-existing sitcom before hosting a show will fade into obscurity, as the audience travels to the monopolists. Podcasting will no longer become a place to capture a following, just like blogs in previous years.To win, Spotify will eventually have to fend off Apple, Amazon, and Google, all of which offer their own audio services. Of course, they all make money off Spotify to one degree or another, charging it to sell its app in phone- or smart-speaker-based app stores. But Spotify won't just have to battle the platform giants\u2014it can learn from them.Spotify is for the most part following the successful efforts of Google in search, Facebook in social, and Amazon in e-commerce. Right now, we're having a debate about free speech on social media[9], with President Trump signing a largely meaningless executive order because he got mad about being fact-checked on Twitter. How the tech giants handle censorship and user-generated content will inform Spotify's conduct toward its podcasters. We learned this week that Facebook has been wooing state law enforcers[10] through years of influence peddling[11] and relationship building. Spotify will watch the impact of that campaign and how it affects antitrust enforcement against Facebook, and take up similar strategies if it faces resistance to monopolizing the podcast world.Spotify is for the most part following the successful efforts of Google in search, Facebook in social, and Amazon in e-commerce. It now knows the path, how Big Tech got in trouble in Washington and how they got out of it, how to work the system to get free rein to consolidate.The thing is, policymakers know that path as well. And they can choose not to fall for the same traps. Last week, Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) proposed limits on political ad targeting[12], to prevent disinformation campaigns directly pitched at specific groups on social media. This is a quarter-step to simply banning targeted ads entirely, which I proposed two years ago[13]. Targeted ads serve little productive purpose while compromising our privacy, destroying unique web and media outlets, and facilitating extreme concentration, leading to other bad outcomes for consumers and media producers. It would largely solve the Spotify problem by keeping advertising networks out of its hands. And it would allow the creators of media to get funding based on their uniqueness, not whether they happen to attract the attention of a platform giant.

That's good news for the Joe Rogans of the world, but for younger, less experienced, more diverse voices, it's another hurdle to being heard.

Spotify's complaint looks legitimate and is similar to those successfully made against Microsoft and Google. European regulators have been much tougher in recent years in cracking down on tech companies anti-competitive moves than American antitrust regulators. Should they find Apple guilty of abusing its market power, the company could face big fines and restrictions that could thwart its burgeoning services business. </p><p>The complaint comes amid growing complaints in the US about the market power of big-tech companies and could spur a parallel investigation here. Apple could see its reputation tarnished by such investigations, which could be the biggest danger of all. Spotify's decision to file a complaint[3] against Apple with the European Commission alleging unfair competition should worry the folks in Cupertino. At first glance, the streaming music company would seem to have a legitimate complaint. In fact, what Apple is alleged to be doing isn't all that different from what got Microsoft in trouble with antitrust authorities[4] 20 years ago and what led to a $5 billion fine against Google[5] just last year. If history is any guide, Spotify's complaint could lead to a similarly large fine against the iPhone maker. It might also lead to restrictions that could hamper Apple's services business, which the electronics giant has been touting as its future. And the complaint could spur a parallel antitrust investigation here in the US. But perhaps more importantly, Spotify's allegations \u2014 any investigation that truly digs into them \u2014 could sully Apple's reputation with consumers. That could be extraordinarily costly for a company that has long benefited from public adulation and the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of free publicity[6] that's come hand-in-hand with it. Read this: Spotify is going to war with Apple, filing an antitrust complaint over fears that it is crushing competitors[7]Those targeting the big tech firms haven't been aiming at AppleUntil now, Apple has been fairly lucky. Although there have been growing calls to address the market dominance of the big-tech companies, advocates have generally focused on Facebook, Google, and Amazon[8]. Apple has often been left out of the list of potential targets. It's not hard to understand why. Apple has a huge number of fans, and 20 years after it nearly went bankrupt, it's still viewed by many as an underdog. And while the iPhone maker is currently the second most valuable public company in the world, it doesn't appear to dominate markets in the same way that the other big-tech firms do. Facebook is the dominant social network. Google owns the search market and the vast majority of smartphones worldwide run its Android operating system. Between the two of them, the companies are expected to account for more than half of the global digital ad market this year[9]. Meanwhile, about half of all US e-commerce purchases are made through Amazon[10]. And Microsoft still dominates the PC operating system market[11]. By contrast, Apple wouldn't seem to control any notable industries. Its Mac computers have long had only a small portion of the overall PC market. The iPhone may be one of most popular lines of smartphones in the world, but Samsung sells more phones overall[12] and Huawei has nearly overtaken Apple in market share. Apple Music may have raised Spotify's ire, but it's still a distant second to Spotify[13] in terms of subscribers. But such high-level views understate Apple's actual market power.Apple has monopoly control over the iPhone app marketplaceDepending on which research firm you believe, around 35% to 40%[14] of the smartphones sold in recent months in the US were iPhones. And, again, depending on which firm you believe, around 45% to 55% of the smartphones currently in use[15] in the US were made by Apple. In either case, the number of Americans with iPhones is a huge number. Regardless of its overall market share in smartphones, Apple's operating system runs on 100% of the iPhones in use in the US and worldwide. You basically can't run an operating system other than Apple's iOS on an iPhone and you can't run iOS on any devices but iPhones. What's more, Apple controls the distribution of apps to iPhone users. While there are a few exceptions, iPhone users generally have to get their apps from Apple's App Store. Apple's control over the operating system and app store on iPhones is akin to a railroad that serves as the only rail link for a section of the country, said Matt Stoller, a fellow with the Open Markets Institute, a research and advocacy group that focuses on the dangers of corporate concentration. That railroad may not dominate the entire nationwide market, but for the area in which it operates, it's a monopoly. Spotify and other app makers \"can't get to their customers who use iPhones except through Apple's App Store,\" Stoller said, adding that the App Store \"is a monopoly, at least to an important set of Spotify customers.\"Apple seems to be abusing its powerApple, arguably, has been abusing that monopoly. Unlike Spotify's music app, or Google's Chrome browser, Apple's rival apps \u2014 Apple Music and Safari \u2014 are built into iOS and come pre-installed on the iPhone. On the iPhone, users can't chose alternate apps to be their defaults; generally if they click on a web link, it will open in Safari, even if they have Chrome installed. According to Spotify, Apple's Siri still won't play songs in its music app, but has no problems playing songs in Apple Music. And Spotify says[16] Apple has been doing much worse than that[17]. Apple requires that apps listed in its App Store that offer subscriptions use its payment service, for which Apple charges a 30% commission. The company forbids developers from pointing users to their web sites to sign up for subscriptions there instead. So, developers face a choice \u2014 they can pay Apple's tax to make it easy for users to sign up for subscriptions, or they can save money and offer a worse experience. The fee Apple charges can make competing services uncompetitive. To recoup its costs for paying Apple's commission, Spotify used to charge its iPhone users $12.99 a month \u2014 $3 more than it charged those who signed up through its website. By contrast, Apple Music didn't have to pay those charges and iPhone users were able to sign up for subscriptions inside its app for just $9.99, Spotify says. What's more, Spotify says Apple has barred it from advertising or offering promotional rates for its service inside its app. It's also repeatedly delayed approving Spotify's app updates, the streaming music service said. And for years, according to Spotify, Apple blocked it from offering an Apple Watch app and still bars it from offering an app for Apple's HomePod smart speaker.Apple's actions appear similar to Microsoft's and Google'sThose kinds of alleged actions are reminiscent of the anti-competitive \u2014 and illegal \u2014 moves that Microsoft and Google were found to have perpetrated. In both cases, the companies were found to have used their dominance over an operating system to give an unfair advantage to their own apps or services. In Microsoft's case, it famously used Windows to promote Internet Explorer and thwart Netscape's rival Navigator browser. In Google, it used its control of Android and the Google Play store to force smartphone makers to make its search engine and its Chrome browser default apps on their devices. In a similar way, Apple has \"dominant power over what is a vital artery of commerce,\" Stoller said. Spotify's complaint is only the beginning of what could end up being a years-long investigation by the EC's competition regulators. But even the possibility of such an investigation should be worrisome to Apple CEO Tim Cook and his crew. While US antitrust regulators have been lax about their duties in recent years, the EC has been much more aggressive. The competition authority has twice[18] fined Google for illegally abusing its market power, most recently this past summer levying a $5 billion fine as part of the investigation into Google forcing smartphone makers to install its Android apps. It also fined Microsoft more than a billion dollars[19] in total for abusing its Windows monopoly. With more than $200 billion in the bank, Apple could easily afford such a fine. What might be more painful for it, though, are restrictions the EC could place on its business. As part of its decision against Google, the EC ordered it to stop forcing smartphone makers to install its apps as a condition of using Android and gaining access to the Google Play Store. Regulators could similarly order Apple to stop giving preferential treatment to its own apps.Warren's call could prove costly to AppleAnd if Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has her way and gets US regulators involved, they could do much more than that. Warren has called for an end to the practice of companies both owning a platform and participating in that platform. She's specifically named Apple[20] as a company that's in violation of that principle. In Apple's case, such a rule would mean is that it wouldn't be allowed to both operate an app store and offer apps that compete against apps listed within it. So, the company could choose to operate the App Store or offer Apple Music, but not both. While Warren's no shoo-in to become president, she's only part of a growing chorus on this side of the Atlantic calling on regulators here to break up the tech giants. Even if she doesn't reach the White House, her ideas on what to do about them could well influence whomever is elected next year[21]. The kinds of prohibitions Warren is calling for could stymie Apple's burgeoning services business[22]. Much of the revenue garnered by that segment comes from Apple's commissions off App Store sales and from subscription revenue from Apple Music. Later this month, it's expected to launch a subscription streaming video service that will compete with Netflix and bring in additional services dollars[23]. As Apple's iPhone sales have started to decline, it's been banking on its services business[24] to drive future growth. But regulators could undermine that effort.Apple could suffer more than most from bad PRBut the bigger danger to Apple from the Spotify complaint could be the public-relations hit it could cause. In the mid-1990s, before the antitrust trial, Microsoft was one of the most respected companies in the US and Bill Gates was one of the most widely admired business leaders. But that case, which brought to light Microsoft's cutthroat tactics and Gates' seemingly disdainful attitude toward government oversight, damaged the reputations of both[25]. That negative PR arguably encouraged both consumers and corporate customers to seek alternatives to Microsoft and opened up space in the market for products from Google, Mozilla, and, yes, Apple. Today, Apple ranks among the most admired companies in the world. And the largely positive feelings and excitement it engenders among its many fans has brought the company millions, perhaps billions, of dollars worth of free and largely positive publicity over the years. Thanks to that, the iPhone maker's marketing budget has been a fraction of the size of other consumer companies. An antitrust complaint could transform the public perception of Apple from being the cool, consumer-friendly alternative company to just another ruthless bottom-line focused corporation. You can bet that Apple really doesn't want to face that music.

It might also lead to restrictions that could hamper Apple's services business, which the electronics giant has been touting as its future. And the complaint could spur a parallel antitrust investigation here in the US.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But perhaps more importantly, Spotify's allegations - any investigation that truly digs into them - could sully Apple's reputation with consumers. That could be extraordinarily costly for a company that has long benefited from public adulation and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/03/09/apple-king-free-publicity/tGj9aR3WrX4B0iC8wY0MFN/story.html\">hundreds of millions of dollars worth of free publicity</url> that's come hand-in-hand with it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Read this: Spotify is going to war with Apple, filing an antitrust complaint over fears that it is crushing competitors</emphasis></p><h>Those targeting the big tech firms haven't been aiming at Apple</h><p>Until now, Apple has been fairly lucky.

Google owns the search market and the vast majority of smartphones worldwide run its Android operating system. Between the two of them, the companies <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/global-ad-spending-update\">are expected to account for more than half of the global digital ad market this year</url>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/12/amazon-to-take-almost-50-percent-of-us-e-commerce-market-by-years-end.html\">about half of all US e-commerce purchases are made through Amazon</url>.

Its Mac computers have long had only a small portion of the overall PC market. The iPhone may be one of most popular lines of smartphones in the world, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.strategyanalytics.com/press-release/devices/strategy-analytics-global-smartphone-shipments-declined-full-year-basis-first\">Samsung sells more phones overall</url> and Huawei has nearly overtaken Apple in market share. Apple Music may have raised Spotify's ire, but it's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://musicindustryblog.wordpress.com/2018/09/13/mid-year-2018-streaming-market-shares/\">still a distant second to Spotify</url> in terms of subscribers.</p><p>But such high-level views understate Apple's actual market power.</p><h>Apple has monopoly control over the iPhone app marketplace</h><p>Depending on which research firm you believe, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.extremetech.com/mobile/274215-apple-gained-market-share-in-q2-as-ios-dominates-us-smartphone-sales\">around 35% to 40%</url> of the smartphones sold in recent months in the US were iPhones. And, again, depending on which firm you believe, around       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vertoanalytics.com/chart-week-smartphone-market-share/\">45% to 55% of the smartphones currently in use</url> in the US were made by Apple. In either case, the number of Americans with iPhones is a huge number.</p><p>Regardless of its overall market share in smartphones, Apple's operating system runs on 100% of the iPhones in use in the US and worldwide. You basically can't run an operating system other than Apple's iOS on an iPhone and you can't run iOS on any devices but iPhones.</p><p>What's more, Apple controls the distribution of apps to iPhone users. While there are a few exceptions, iPhone users generally have to get their apps from Apple's App Store.</p><p>Apple's control over the operating system and app store on iPhones is akin to a railroad that serves as the only rail link for a section of the country, said Matt Stoller, a fellow with the Open Markets Institute, a research and advocacy group that focuses on the dangers of corporate concentration. That railroad may not dominate the entire nationwide market, but for the area in which it operates, it's a monopoly.</p><p>Spotify and other app makers \"can't get to their customers who use iPhones except through Apple's App Store,\" Stoller said, adding that the App Store \"is a monopoly, at least to an important set of Spotify customers.\"</p><h>Apple seems to be abusing its power</h><p>Apple, arguably, has been abusing that monopoly. Unlike Spotify's music app, or Google's Chrome browser, Apple's rival apps - Apple Music and Safari - are built into iOS and come pre-installed on the iPhone. On the iPhone, users can't chose alternate apps to be their defaults; generally if they click on a web link, it will open in Safari, even if they have Chrome installed. According to Spotify, Apple's Siri still won't play songs in its music app, but has no problems playing songs in Apple Music.</p><p>GettyAnd <url normalizedValue=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-03-13/consumers-and-innovators-win-on-a-level-playing-field/\">Spotify says</url>Apple       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-spotify-european-competition-complaint-about-apple-not-google-2019-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">has been doing much worse than that</url>. Apple requires that apps listed in its App Store that offer subscriptions use its payment service, for which Apple charges a 30% commission.</p><p>The company forbids developers from pointing users to their web sites to sign up for subscriptions there instead.</p><p>So, developers face a choice - they can pay Apple's tax to make it easy for users to sign up for subscriptions, or they can save money and offer a worse experience.</p><p>The fee Apple charges can make competing services uncompetitive. To recoup its costs for paying Apple's commission, Spotify used to charge its iPhone users $12.99 a month - $3 more than it charged those who signed up through its website. By contrast, Apple Music didn't have to pay those charges and iPhone users were able to sign up for subscriptions inside its app for just $9.99, Spotify says.</p><p>What's more, Spotify says Apple has barred it from advertising or offering promotional rates for its service inside its app. It's also repeatedly delayed approving Spotify's app updates, the streaming music service said.</p><p>And for years, according to Spotify, Apple blocked it from offering an Apple Watch app and still bars it from offering an app for Apple's HomePod smart speaker.</p><h>Apple's actions appear similar to Microsoft's and Google's</h><p>Those kinds of alleged actions are reminiscent of the anti-competitive - and illegal - moves that Microsoft and Google were found to have perpetrated. In both cases, the companies were found to have used their dominance over an operating system to give an unfair advantage to their own apps or services.</p><p>In Microsoft's case, it famously used Windows to promote Internet Explorer and thwart Netscape's rival Navigator browser. In Google, it used its control of Android and the Google Play store to force smartphone makers to make its search engine and its Chrome browser default apps on their devices.</p><p>In a similar way, Apple has \"dominant power over what is a vital artery of commerce,\" Stoller said.</p><p>Spotify's complaint is only the beginning of what could end up being a years-long investigation by the EC's competition regulators. But even the possibility of such an investigation should be worrisome to Apple CEO Tim Cook and his crew.</p><p>While US antitrust regulators have been lax about their duties in recent years, the EC has been much more aggressive.</p><p>The competition authority has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/eu-fines-google-record-breaking-antitrust-shopping-case-2017-6?r=UK?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">twice</url> fined Google for illegally abusing its market power, most recently this past summer levying a $5 billion fine as part of the investigation into Google forcing smartphone makers to install its Android apps. It also       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/27/the-largest-fines-dished-out-by-the-eu-commission-facebook-google.html\">fined Microsoft more than a billion dollars</url> in total for abusing its Windows monopoly.</p><p>With more than $200 billion in the bank, Apple could easily afford such a fine. What might be more painful for it, though, are restrictions the EC could place on its business. As part of its decision against Google, the EC ordered it to stop forcing smartphone makers to install its apps as a condition of using Android and gaining access to the Google Play Store. Regulators could similarly order Apple to stop giving preferential treatment to its own apps.</p><h>Warren's call could prove costly to Apple</h><p>And if Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has her way and gets US regulators involved, they could do much more than that. Warren has called for an end to the practice of companies both owning a platform and participating in that platform. She's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-wants-to-break-up-apple-over-antitrust-concerns-2019-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">specifically named Apple</url> as a company that's in violation of that principle.</p><p>Scott Olson/GettyIn Apple's case, such a rule would mean is that it wouldn't be allowed to both operate an app store and offer apps that compete against apps listed within it. So, the company could choose to operate the App Store or offer Apple Music, but not both.</p><p>While Warren's no shoo-in to become president, she's only part of a growing chorus on this side of the Atlantic calling on regulators here to break up the tech giants. Even if she doesn't reach the White House, her ideas on what to do about them <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-call-to-break-up-amazon-google-is-a-real-threat-2019-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">could well influence whomever is elected next year</url>.</p><p>The kinds of prohibitions Warren is calling for could <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-apple-trust-complaint-risk-2019-3?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">stymie Apple's burgeoning services business</url>. Much of the revenue garnered by that segment comes from Apple's commissions off App Store sales and from subscription revenue from Apple Music. Later this month, it's expected to launch a subscription streaming video service that will compete with Netflix and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wedbushs-dan-ives-says-apple-must-acquire-hollywood-studio-2019-2?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">bring in additional services dollars</url>.</p><p>As Apple's iPhone sales have started to decline, it's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/wedbush-daniel-ives-bullish-on-apple-services-business-2018-11?r=tgw?utm_source=lexisnexis&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">been banking on its services business</url> to drive future growth.

Instead of an initial public offering, it's trying a direct listing, which essentially lets private stakeholders start trading their shares on a public exchange. That avoids underwriting fees and restrictions on stock sales by current owners, and doesn't dilute the holdings of executives and investors.</p><p>Spotify, which has been valued at about US$15 billion, would be the most prominent company by far to attempt a direct listing, a method that until now has been used by small issuers and real estate investment trusts. It would also be a first for the New York Stock Exchange, which has sought permission from the Securities &amp;; Exchange Commission to change its rules for the occasion.</p><p>Spotify sent confidential documents to the SEC in late December with the aim of listing its shares in the first quarter of this year, said the person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Axios reported the filing earlier Wednesday.</p><p>Non-public filings have become more common since July, when the SEC began letting all companies file early IPO or stock-listing regulatory documents confidentially - a perk previously reserved for smaller businesses. The initial privacy is meant to make the listing process more efficient and encourage more companies to go public. Spotify may be able to keep the documents private until at least 15 days before the share offering is effective.</p><p>If the operation is successful, it could pave the way for other big tech firms, such as Airbnb and Uber, if they decide to go public and current investors don't want their stakes diluted.</p><p>The move has its risks.</p><p>Without underwriters, Spotify shares won't debut with a price based on investor feedback, with buyers lined up. An unusual format can also cause unforeseen problems, as Google discovered in its 2004 Dutch-auction IPO.</p><p>Investors have few opportunities to invest directly in the music business, which is in the early stages of a recovery from years ravaged by piracy and a steep decline in CD sales. Online radio service Pandora Media Inc. has struggled to grow in recent years, a red flag for potential investors. But unlike Pandora, Spotify has persuaded tens of millions of people to pay a monthly fee.</p><p>While the company is the market leader in music streaming, it faces growing competition from tech giants Apple Inc., Amazon. com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.

Instead of an initial public offering, it's trying a direct listing, which essentially lets private stakeholders start trading their shares on a public exchange. That avoids underwriting fees and restrictions on stock sales by current owners, and doesn't dilute the holdings of executives and investors.</p><p>Spotify, which has been valued at about US$15 billion, would be the most prominent company by far to attempt a direct listing, a method that until now has been used by small issuers and real estate investment trusts. It would also be a first for the New York Stock Exchange, which has sought permission from the Securities &amp;; Exchange Commission to change its rules for the occasion.</p><p>Spotify sent confidential documents to the SEC in late December with the aim of listing its shares in the first quarter of this year, said the person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Axios reported the filing earlier Wednesday.</p><p>Non-public filings have become more common since July, when the SEC began letting all companies file early IPO or stock-listing regulatory documents confidentially - a perk previously reserved for smaller businesses. The initial privacy is meant to make the listing process more efficient and encourage more companies to go public. Spotify may be able to keep the documents private until at least 15 days before the share offering is effective.</p><p>If the operation is successful, it could pave the way for other big tech firms, such as Airbnb and Uber, if they decide to go public and current investors don't want their stakes diluted.</p><p>The move has its risks.</p><p>Without underwriters, Spotify shares won't debut with a price based on investor feedback, with buyers lined up. An unusual format can also cause unforeseen problems, as Google discovered in its 2004 Dutch-auction IPO.</p><p>Investors have few opportunities to invest directly in the music business, which is in the early stages of a recovery from years ravaged by piracy and a steep decline in CD sales. Online radio service Pandora Media Inc. has struggled to grow in recent years, a red flag for potential investors. But unlike Pandora, Spotify has persuaded tens of millions of people to pay a monthly fee.</p><p>While the company is the market leader in music streaming, it faces growing competition from tech giants Apple Inc., Amazon. com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

Instead of an initial public offering, it's trying a direct listing, which essentially lets private stakeholders start trading their shares on a public exchange. That avoids underwriting fees and restrictions on stock sales by current owners, and doesn't dilute the holdings of executives and investors.</p><p>Spotify, which has been valued at about US$15 billion, would be the most prominent company by far to attempt a direct listing, a method that until now has been used by small issuers and real estate investment trusts. It would also be a first for the New York Stock Exchange, which has sought permission from the Securities &amp;; Exchange Commission to change its rules for the occasion.</p><p>Spotify sent confidential documents to the SEC in December with the aim of listing its shares in the first quarter of 2018, said the person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Axios reported the filing earlier Wednesday.</p><p>Non-public filings have become more common since July, when the SEC began letting all companies file early IPO or stock-listing regulatory documents confidentially - a perk previously reserved for smaller businesses. The initial privacy is meant to make the listing process more efficient and encourage more companies to go public. Spotify may be able to keep the documents private until at least 15 days before the share offering is effective.</p><p>If the operation is successful, it could pave the way for other big tech firms, such as Airbnb and Uber, if they decide to go public and current investors don't want their stakes diluted. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2018 Postmedia Network Inc.

The company warned the price could be volatile.</p><p>As part of the unusual launch, the company is not selling any new shares.

The most recent private trades in the Swedish company have taken place at above $4,000 per share according to sources. </p><p>One of the sources said the recent trades were at a record-high of $4,200, valuing the firm at $19 billion or more. That compares to around $16 billion earlier this autumn. Spotify is aiming to file its intention to float with U.S. regulators toward the end of this year, sources said. Also supporting perceptions of Spotify's increasing value, Tencent's purchase of new Spotify shares implies a valuation of $5,000 per share, one of the sources said. Spotify and the music arm of China's Tencent Holdings Ltd said last week they would buy minority stakes in each other, but gave no financial details. Spotify did not immediately respond to inquiries about valuation and listing. The private market for shares prior to a public listing allows employees and founders of private companies such as Spotify to cash in on some of their paper wealth, while letting other investors get a head start on the listing. Spotify's valuation when it lists - expected to be within 90 days after filing - is forecast to be a few billion dollars higher than current trades as illiquidity risk tends to depress the value ahead of listing, the sources said. While several big tech firms have struggled to enter China, Spotify has with the Tencent deal secured an exposure to the growing Chinese music streaming market. Spotify is the biggest global music streaming company and counts tech giants Apple and Amazon as its main rivals. The timing for its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in December is roughly in line with what has been previously suggested by sources. Spotify aims to pursuing a so-called direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange, allowing existing investors to sell shares without raising money from new ones, sources have previously told Reuters. The move is also aimed at saving hundreds of millions of dollars in underwriting fees from investment banks. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-VNTR1079881513290776263251762900096</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VNTR-6695</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R5Y-W301-JCMN-Y354-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"389\"/><timeReceived>10:32 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>VentureBeat</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 14, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFJT</classCode><className>SPOTIFY LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC0009CXY</classCode><className>TENCENT HOLDINGS LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The decision comes as week after it announced a tie-up with Samsung that will see it pre-installed on Samsung devices as of March 8 this year.Spotify Founder and CEO <person><nameText>Daniel Ek </nameText></person>wrote today: \u201cApple operates a platform that, for over a billion people around the world, is the gateway to the internet.\u201d\u201cApple is both the owner of the iOS platform and the App Store\u2014and a competitor to services like Spotify. In theory, this is fine. </p><p>But in Apple\u2019s case, they continue to give themselves an unfair advantage at every turn.\u201dThe complaint comes after US Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren called for a breakup of Apple, Facebook and Google, saying: \u201cMany big tech companies own a marketplace?\u2014?where buyers and sellers transact?\u2014?while also participating on the marketplace. This can create a conflict of interest that undermines competition.\u201dSpotifyApple Complaint: \u201cNot a \u2018Spotify-versus-Apple\u2019 Issue\u201dEk added: \u201cApple requires that Spotify and other digital services pay a 30% tax on purchases made through Apple\u2019s payment system, including upgrading from our Free to our Premium service. If we pay this tax, it would force us to artificially inflate the price of our Premium membership well above the price of Apple Music. And to keep our price competitive for our customers, that isn\u2019t something we can do.\u201dEk said \u201cnumerous\u201d other apps on the App Store, like Uber or Deliveroo, aren\u2019t subject to the Apple tax and therefore don\u2019t have the same restrictions.He said: \u201cWhat we are asking for is the following: \u201cFirst, apps should be able to compete fairly on the merits, and not based on who owns the App Store. We should all be subject to the same fair set of rules and restrictions\u2014including Apple Music. Second, consumers should have a real choice of payment systems, and not be \u201clocked in\u201d or forced to use systems with discriminatory tariffs such as Apple\u2019s. Finally, app stores should not be allowed to control the communications between services and users, including placing unfair restrictions on marketing and promotions that benefit consumers.\u201dSpotify has filed a complaint against Apple with the European Commission (EC), the regulatory body responsible for keeping competition fair and nondiscriminatory, as a result.

Shtilman was a keynote speaker at \"The Future of Money\" conference held in the Israeli coastal city of Tel Aviv on Monday. The conference was organized by the leading Israeli financial newspaper Calcalist in collaboration with Israel's Bank Hapoalim. </p><p>There were about 800 participants, among them entrepreneurs, investors, senior executives of the finance industry, venture capital funds, insurance companies, and financial technology companies. The keynote speakers at the event emphasized the global transition of the money system from the physical world into the computers' reality, where the possibilities for innovation are enormous. The technological companies became a significant player in the realm of financial institutions, and they even have the potential to overcome the traditional banking system. Banks from the other side are joining power with financial technology start-ups and becoming themselves kind of technological companies. The boundaryless virtual world could enable the traditional local banks to become international scaled up players on the global stage. New cooperations between banks, credit card companies, start-ups, and technology companies introduce innovative services, platforms, and applications for the consumers. Big technology companies are replacing the more traditional ways of payment, paving the way to the future without the need for real money made of real-world materials. Although people are becoming more connected to money applications than banks, the last ones still will be needed to move the money safely around the world, Shtilman told Xinhua. \"The regulation in every country is different, and the regulators want to control how money moves, especially because of taxes and money laundering aspects,\" stressed Shtilman. This is the main reason why the money movement is not simple, because \"money movement has a lot of negative effects also, and governments want to control it,\" said Shtilman. While private ventures are trying to make dominating digital currencies, Shtilman predicts that governments are going to issue their internal digital money, which is going to replace the old currencies. Ilanit Madmoni, head of innovation in the financial technology unit at Bank of Israel, said there would be many changes in the banking system in the coming future. There will be much more variety of payment methods, and the big tech companies would probably offer their apps in Israel, \"I'm sure that everything can change here,\" Madmoni told Xinhua. Banks are afraid of the big technology companies, who have all the technology, money which makes them able to compete with the banks on the same level, said Madmoni. The vision of Madmoni is that will be a constant reduction of the use of cash and plastic credit cards, \"which is better for the economy,\" however, the system behind it will remain just in the virtual world. Saar Zacharish, chief digital officer of Israeli Bank Hapoalim, said that the new payment applications have been adopted fast and expected to move into more fields of daily life. Israeli banks in recent years launched digital wallets, which are applications on the cellphones that enable the user to transfer money to each other with a few clicks on the phone. \"Banks will have a very significant role in the future, and the banks already have a relationship with the customers. Assuming we can deliver on a very convenient experience, we will be there and lead the revolution,\" said Zacharish. Nowadays, the banks are competing with high tech over the same talented workers, \"the biggest challenge for us as banks is to recruit the best talent,\" Zacharish told Xinhua and added. \"We're turning into a technology company, and the key success factors in terms of delivering these products is having the best people work with us,\" Zacharish said. But all the progress is also coming with challenges, said Michael Reitblat, CEO and co-founder of Forter. \"Almost every new system that's developed a new currency or new platform attracts first enthusiasts and fraudsters, and only if it survives, it starts to attract other people.\" Reitblat is managing a fraud prevention company, and according to him, the new payment technologies scale up the amounts of money criminals could potentially steal if it is not protected good enough. Another fraud prevention start-up that participated at the convention was Paygilant, whose CEO, Ziv Cohen, told Xinhua that its services detect the biometrical behavior of the customers. Applications that use Paygilant products could identify when somebody else instead of their costumers trying to send money or do some other sensitive action without permission. In the virtual world, our biometrical parameters and individual behavior leave a unique digital signature that probably even we would not recognize. Still, our digital guards could do that for us.

We've entered a gold bull market.A key question: Whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and more funding for enforcement are needed. Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. With other Democrats, Cicilline has floated the idea of an antitrust moratorium that would block big corporations from acquiring smaller companies during the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans call the idea misguided and socialistic.  The tech companies now face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies' practices, including the earlier acquisitions of smaller firms. Facebook's fiercest critics in Congress, including liberal Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren and conservative Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, have put breaking up Big Tech companies on the table. And presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said breakups of the giants should be considered. Short of breakup, the scrutiny of the companies across the U.S. and abroad points toward possible new restrictions on their power. The four CEOs are poised to follow the conventional playbook for finessing congressional 'star chamber' hearings. 'You act humble and you make your case,' says Gene Grabowski, a crisis communications expert at public relations firm kglobal.  Bezos, the world's richest individual presiding over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal 'smart\" tech, groceries and beyond, initially declined to testify unless he could appear with the other CEOs. He'll likely face questioning over a Wall Street Journal report that found Amazon employees used sensitive and confidential data collected from sellers on its online marketplace to develop competing products. At a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied such accusations. Lawmakers from both parties suggested Amazon's earlier statements could be misleading and might even constitute perjury. Bezos has said, 'We don't use individual seller data to directly compete with them.' Amazon says it doesn't believe the Journal allegations are accurate, but has started an internal investigation. Zuckerberg is a Capitol Hill pro by this point. He endured over five hours of grilling last fall by another House committee on hate speech, privacy, misinformation and Facebook's widely-criticized plan for a new digital currency. He also met privately with key lawmakers and with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized the tech companies and asserted without evidence that they are biased against him.  In the wake of George Floyd's death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook's handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after Facebook's refusal to take action on inflammatory Trump posts that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, critics said, encouraged violence against protesters. Zuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harms or damage. Pichai faced his own congressional interrogation in 2018 over online privacy and data protection, the danger of digital monopolies, alleged bias against conservative viewpoints and censorship by China. He acknowledged some points but avoided the yes or no answers that lawmakers demanded. EU regulators already have concluded that Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the e-commerce market, and fined Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., a record $2.7 billion. Google has disputed the findings and is appealing.  Attorneys general from both parties in 50 states and territories, led by Texas, launched an antitrust investigation of Google in September, focused on its online advertising business.  Apple, whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world, faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and technical limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay. Cook is expected to lay out the case that the fees Apple charges apps to sell services and other goods are reasonable, especially compared with what other tech companies collect.  ___ AP Technology Writer Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this report.

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, few Americans knew what the initials PPE stood for. Today, virtually anyone knows that PPE stands for personal protective equipment. At the onset of the mitigation policies, the goal of flattening the curve was being done to prevent our health care system from becoming overwhelmed. Part of that concern stemmed from a shortage of personal protective equipment. These are the masks, gloves, goggles and gowns that help protect medical workers against viral or bacterial infections. As the novel coronavirus became labeled a global pandemic, the global mantra became to 'flatten the curve' in an effort to prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed. The United States is being referred to as being on a war time footing. Manufacturers that were already producing PPE have significantly ramped up capacity. And many companies are converting their excess manufacturing capacity to produce personal protective equipment. In fairness, this may only be a reason for some of these companies to 'keep the lights on' right now. But many of these companies have a good story to tell. And it's that story that can make them solid investments in the future. View the \"6 Stocks to Help You Profit Off the Coronavirus PPE Boom\"[2].

He also met privately with key lawmakers and with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized the tech companies and asserted without evidence that they are biased against him.</p><p>In the wake of George Floyd's death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook\u2019s handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after Facebook\u2019s refusal to take action on <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/0ab4b82c113f4d4fd8171f9838ceca10\">inflammatory Trump posts</url> that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, critics said, encouraged violence against protesters. Zuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harms or damage.</p><p>Pichai faced his own congressional interrogation in 2018 over online privacy and data protection, the danger of digital monopolies, alleged bias against conservative viewpoints and censorship by China.

EU regulators already have concluded that Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the e-commerce market, and fined Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., a record $2.7 billion. Google has disputed the findings and is appealing.</p><p>Attorneys general from both parties in 50 states and territories, led by Texas, launched an antitrust investigation of Google in September, focused on its online advertising business.</p><p>Apple, whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world, faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and technical limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay. Cook is expected to lay out the case that the fees Apple charges apps to sell services and other goods are reasonable, especially compared with what other tech companies collect.</p><p>___</p><p>AP

One of them is the world\u2019s richest individual; another is the fourth-ranked billionaire. Their industry has transformed society, linked people around the globe, mined and commercialized users\u2019 personal data, and infuriated critics on both the left and right over speech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook of Apple will answer for their companies\u2019 practices before Congress for the first time as a group. Summoned for a House hearing, they\u2019ll raise a hand (remotely) and swear to tell the truth, in the manner of tycoons of Wall Street or the tobacco industry in earlier high-octane televised shamings. It will be Bezos\u2019 first-ever appearance before Congress.</p><p>The House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust is capping its yearlong investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance with Wednesday\u2019s teleconferenced hearing spotlighting the four CEOs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mostly theater. There are few genuine facts left to gather,\u201d says Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on antitrust.</p><p>Still, the CEOs\u2019 approaches to the questioning are important, Crane notes. \u201cAre they willing to admit that there\u2019s a problem with Big Tech\u2019s market power, or is it denial mode? Will they recommend innovative private solutions, or retreat into defending themselves as champions of consumer interests who play it fair?\"</p><p>The bipartisan probe stands out in a capital steeped in partisanship, where Republicans and Democrats are now arguing over the size of <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/6708316e6654607abaf65641e474d87e\">new federal pandemic relief</url>. It\u2019s the first such congressional review of an industry that for over a decade has enjoyed haloed status and a light touch from federal regulators.</p><p>Critics question whether the companies stifle competition and innovation and pose a danger to society. The Judiciary panel collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies.</p><p>A key question: Whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and more funding for enforcement are needed.</p><p>Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. With other Democrats, Cicilline has floated the idea of an antitrust moratorium that would block big corporations from acquiring smaller companies during the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">coronavirus pandemic</url>. Republicans call the idea misguided and socialistic.</p><p>The tech companies now face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices, including the earlier acquisitions of smaller firms.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s fiercest critics in Congress, including liberal Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren and conservative Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, have put breaking up Big Tech companies on the table. And presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said breakups of the giants should be considered.</p><p>Short of breakup, the scrutiny of the companies across the U.S. and abroad points toward possible new restrictions on their power.</p><p>The CEOs could follow the conventional playbook for congressional \u201cstar chamber\u201d hearings, making their case while showing some humility.</p><p>Beyond that, each company has a distinct profile, and each tech titan has his own approach and story to tell.</p><p>Bezos, the world's richest individual presiding over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal \u201csmart\" tech and beyond, initially declined to testify unless he could appear with the other CEOs. He'll likely face questioning over a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015\">Wall Street Journal report</url> that found Amazon employees used confidential data collected from sellers on its online marketplace to develop competing products. At a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied such accusations.</p><p>Lawmakers from both parties suggested Amazon\u2019s earlier statements could be misleading and might even constitute perjury. Bezos has said, \u201cWe don\u2019t use individual seller data to directly compete with them.\u201d Amazon says it doesn\u2019t believe the Journal allegations are accurate, but has started an internal investigation.</p><p>Zuckerberg is a Capitol Hill pro by this point. He endured over five hours of grilling last fall by another House committee on hate speech, privacy, misinformation and Facebook\u2019s widely-criticized plan for a new digital currency. He also met privately with key lawmakers and with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized the tech companies and asserted without evidence that they are biased against him.</p><p>In the wake of George Floyd's death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook\u2019s handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after Facebook\u2019s refusal to take action on <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/0ab4b82c113f4d4fd8171f9838ceca10\">inflammatory Trump posts</url> that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, critics said, encouraged violence against protesters. Zuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harms or damage.</p><p>Pichai faced his own congressional interrogation in 2018 over online privacy and data protection, the danger of digital monopolies, alleged bias against conservative viewpoints and censorship by China. He acknowledged some points but avoided the yes or no answers that lawmakers demanded. EU regulators already have concluded that Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the e-commerce market, and fined Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., a record $2.7 billion. Google has disputed the findings and is appealing.</p><p>Attorneys general from both parties in 50 states and territories, led by Texas, launched an antitrust investigation of Google in September, focused on its online advertising business.</p><p>Apple, whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world, faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and technical limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay. Cook is expected to lay out the case that the fees Apple charges apps to sell services and other goods are reasonable, especially compared with what other tech companies collect.</p><p>___</p><p>AP

One of them is the world\u2019s richest individual; another is the fourth-ranked billionaire. Their industry has transformed society, linked people around the globe, mined and commercialized users\u2019 personal data, and infuriated critics on both the left and right over speech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook of Apple will answer for their companies\u2019 practices before Congress for the first time as a group. Summoned for a House hearing, they\u2019ll raise a hand (remotely) and swear to tell the truth, in the manner of tycoons of Wall Street or the tobacco industry in earlier high-octane televised shamings. It will be Bezos\u2019 first-ever appearance before Congress.</p><p>The House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust is capping its yearlong investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance with Wednesday\u2019s teleconferenced hearing spotlighting the four CEOs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s mostly theater. There are few genuine facts left to gather,\u201d says Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on antitrust.</p><p>Still, the CEOs\u2019 approaches to the questioning are important, Crane notes. \u201cAre they willing to admit that there\u2019s a problem with Big Tech\u2019s market power, or is it denial mode? Will they recommend innovative private solutions, or retreat into defending themselves as champions of consumer interests who play it fair?\"</p><p>The bipartisan probe stands out in a capital steeped in partisanship, where Republicans and Democrats are now arguing over the size of <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/6708316e6654607abaf65641e474d87e\">new federal pandemic relief</url>. It\u2019s the first such congressional review of an industry that for over a decade has enjoyed haloed status and a light touch from federal regulators.</p><p>Critics question whether the companies stifle competition and innovation and pose a danger to society. The Judiciary panel collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies.</p><p>A key question: Whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and more funding for enforcement are needed.</p><p>Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. With other Democrats, Cicilline has floated the idea of an antitrust moratorium that would block big corporations from acquiring smaller companies during the <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak\">coronavirus pandemic</url>. Republicans call the idea misguided and socialistic.</p><p>The tech companies now face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices, including the earlier acquisitions of smaller firms.</p><p>Facebook\u2019s fiercest critics in Congress, including liberal Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren and conservative Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, have put breaking up Big Tech companies on the table. And presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said breakups of the giants should be considered.</p><p>Short of breakup, the scrutiny of the companies across the U.S. and abroad points toward possible new restrictions on their power.</p><p>The CEOs could follow the conventional playbook for congressional \u201cstar chamber\u201d hearings, making their case while showing some humility.</p><p>Beyond that, each company has a distinct profile, and each tech titan has his own approach and story to tell.</p><p>Bezos, the world's richest individual presiding over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal \u201csmart\" tech and beyond, initially declined to testify unless he could appear with the other CEOs. He'll likely face questioning over a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015\">Wall Street Journal report</url> that found Amazon employees used confidential data collected from sellers on its online marketplace to develop competing products. At a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied such accusations.</p><p>Lawmakers from both parties suggested Amazon\u2019s earlier statements could be misleading and might even constitute perjury. Bezos has said, \u201cWe don\u2019t use individual seller data to directly compete with them.\u201d Amazon says it doesn\u2019t believe the Journal allegations are accurate, but has started an internal investigation.</p><p>Zuckerberg is a Capitol Hill pro by this point. He endured over five hours of grilling last fall by another House committee on hate speech, privacy, misinformation and Facebook\u2019s widely-criticized plan for a new digital currency. He also met privately with key lawmakers and with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized the tech companies and asserted without evidence that they are biased against him.</p><p>In the wake of George Floyd's death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook\u2019s handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after Facebook\u2019s refusal to take action on <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/0ab4b82c113f4d4fd8171f9838ceca10\">inflammatory Trump posts</url> that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, critics said, encouraged violence against protesters. Zuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harms or damage.</p><p>Pichai faced his own congressional interrogation in 2018 over online privacy and data protection, the danger of digital monopolies, alleged bias against conservative viewpoints and censorship by China. He acknowledged some points but avoided the yes or no answers that lawmakers demanded. EU regulators already have concluded that Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the e-commerce market, and fined Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., a record $2.7 billion. Google has disputed the findings and is appealing.</p><p>Attorneys general from both parties in 50 states and territories, led by Texas, launched an antitrust investigation of Google in September, focused on its online advertising business.</p><p>Apple, whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world, faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and technical limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay. Cook is expected to lay out the case that the fees Apple charges apps to sell services and other goods are reasonable, especially compared with what other tech companies collect.</p><p>___</p><p>AP

One of them is the world's richest individual; another is the fourth-ranked billionaire. Their industry has transformed society, linked people around the globe, mined and commercialized users' personal data, and infuriated critics on both the left and right over speech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook of Apple will answer for their companies' practices before Congress for the first time as a group. Summoned for a House hearing, they'll raise a hand (remotely) and swear to tell the truth, in the manner of tycoons of Wall Street or the tobacco industry in earlier high-octane televised shamings. It will be Bezos' first-ever appearance before Congress.</p><p>The House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust is capping its yearlong investigation of Big Tech's market dominance with Wednesday's teleconferenced hearing spotlighting the four CEOs.</p><p>\"It's mostly theater. There are few genuine facts left to gather,\" says Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on antitrust.</p><p>Still, the CEOs' approaches to the questioning are important, Crane notes. \"Are they willing to admit that there's a problem with Big Tech's market power, or is it denial mode? Will they recommend innovative private solutions, or retreat into defending themselves as champions of consumer interests who play it fair?\"</p><p>The bipartisan probe stands out in a capital steeped in partisanship, where Republicans and Democrats are now arguing over the size of new federal pandemic relief. It's the first such congressional review of an industry that for over a decade has enjoyed haloed status and a light touch from federal regulators.</p><p>Critics question whether the companies stifle competition and innovation and pose a danger to society. The Judiciary panel collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies.</p><p>A key question: Whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and more funding for enforcement are needed.</p><p>Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. With other Democrats, Cicilline has floated the idea of an antitrust moratorium that would block big corporations from acquiring smaller companies during the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans call the idea misguided and socialistic.</p><p>The tech companies now face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies' practices, including the earlier acquisitions of smaller firms.</p><p>Facebook's fiercest critics in Congress, including liberal Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren and conservative Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, have put breaking up Big Tech companies on the table. And presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said breakups of the giants should be considered.</p><p>Short of breakup, the scrutiny of the companies across the U.S. and abroad points toward possible new restrictions on their power.</p><p>The four CEOs are poised to follow the conventional playbook for finessing congressional \"star chamber\" hearings. \"You act humble and you make your case,\" says Gene Grabowski, a crisis communications expert at public relations firm kglobal.</p><p>Bezos, the world's richest individual presiding over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal \"smart\" tech, groceries and beyond, initially declined to testify unless he could appear with the other CEOs. He'll likely face questioning over a Wall Street Journal report that found Amazon employees used sensitive and confidential data collected from sellers on its online marketplace to develop competing products. At a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied such accusations.</p><p>Zuckerberg is a Capitol Hill pro by this point. He endured over five hours of grilling last fall by another House committee on hate speech, privacy, misinformation and Facebook's widely criticized plan for a new digital currency. He also met privately with key lawmakers and with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly asserted without evidence that they are biased against him.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p> Bezos  Cook  Pichai  Zuckerberg </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLPD-1003510733</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLPD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G4-B8P1-JBM5-C4H7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"771\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Inc.

Th...</p><p>WASHINGTON \u2013 They command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them is the world\u2019s richest individual; another is the fourth-ranked billionaire. Their industry has transformed society, linked people around the globe, mined and commercialized users\u2019 personal data, and infuriated critics on both the left and right over speech.   Now Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook of Apple will answer for their companies\u2019 practices before Congress for the first time as a group. Summoned for a House hearing, they\u2019ll raise a hand (remotely) and swear to tell the truth, in the manner of tycoons of Wall Street or the tobacco industry in earlier high-octane televised shamings. It will be Bezos\u2019 first-ever appearance before Congress.   The House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust is capping its yearlong investigation of Big Tech\u2019s market dominance with Wednesday\u2019s teleconferenced hearing spotlighting the four CEOs.   \u201cIt\u2019s mostly theater. There are few genuine facts left to gather,\u201d says Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on antitrust.   Still, the CEOs\u2019 approaches to the questioning are important, Crane notes. \u201cAre they willing to admit that there\u2019s a problem with Big Tech\u2019s market power, or is it denial mode? Will they recommend innovative private solutions, or retreat into defending themselves as champions of consumer interests who play it fair?\"   The bipartisan probe stands out in a capital steeped in partisanship, where Republicans and Democrats are now arguing over the size of new federal pandemic relief . It\u2019s the first such congressional review of an industry that for over a decade has enjoyed haloed status and a light touch from federal regulators.   Critics question whether the companies stifle competition and innovation and pose a danger to society. The Judiciary panel collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies.   A key question: Whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and more funding for enforcement are needed.   Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. With other Democrats, Cicilline has floated the idea of an antitrust moratorium that would block big corporations from acquiring smaller companies during the coronavirus pandemic . Republicans call the idea misguided and socialistic.   The tech companies now face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices, including the earlier acquisitions of smaller firms.   Facebook\u2019s fiercest critics in Congress, including liberal Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren and conservative Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, have put breaking up Big Tech companies on the table. And presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said breakups of the giants should be considered.   Short of breakup, the scrutiny of the companies across the U.S. and abroad points toward possible new restrictions on their power.   The four CEOs are poised to follow the conventional playbook for finessing congressional \u201cstar chamber\u201d hearings. \u201cYou act humble and you make your case,\u201d says Gene Grabowski, a crisis communications expert at public relations firm kglobal.   Bezos, the world's richest individual presiding over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal \u201csmart\" tech, groceries and beyond, initially declined to testify unless he could appear with the other CEOs. He'll likely face questioning over a Wall Street Journal report that found Amazon employees used sensitive and confidential data collected from sellers on its online marketplace to develop competing products. At a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied such accusations.   Lawmakers from both parties suggested Amazon\u2019s earlier statements could be misleading and might even constitute perjury. Bezos has said, \u201cWe don\u2019t use individual seller data to directly compete with them.\u201d Amazon says it doesn\u2019t believe the Journal allegations are accurate, but has started an internal investigation.   Zuckerberg is a Capitol Hill pro by this point. He endured over five hours of grilling last fall by another House committee on hate speech, privacy, misinformation and Facebook\u2019s widely-criticized plan for a new digital currency. He also met privately with key lawmakers and with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized the tech companies and asserted without evidence that they are biased against him.   In the wake of George Floyd's death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook\u2019s handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after Facebook\u2019s refusal to take action on inflammatory Trump posts that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, critics said, encouraged violence against protesters. Zuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harms or damage.   Pichai faced his own congressional interrogation in 2018 over online privacy and data protection, the danger of digital monopolies, alleged bias against conservative viewpoints and censorship by China. He acknowledged some points but avoided the yes or no answers that lawmakers demanded. EU regulators already have concluded that Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the e-commerce market, and fined Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., a record $2.7 billion. Google has disputed the findings and is appealing.   Attorneys general from both parties in 50 states and territories, led by Texas, launched an antitrust investigation of Google in September, focused on its online advertising business.   Apple, whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world, faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and technical limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay. Cook is expected to lay out the case that the fees Apple charges apps to sell services and other goods are reasonable, especially compared with what other tech companies collect.   ___   AP Technology Writer Michael Liedtke in San Francisco contributed to this report.

One of them is the world's richest individual; another is the fourth-ranked billionaire. Their industry ...</p><p>They command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them is the world's richest individual; another is the fourth-ranked billionaire. Their industry has transformed society, linked people around the globe, mined and commercialized users' personal data, and infuriated critics on both the left and right over speech.   Now Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook of Apple will answer for their companies' practices before Congress for the first time as a group. Summoned for a House hearing, they'll raise a hand (remotely) and swear to tell the truth, in the manner of tycoons of Wall Street or the tobacco industry in earlier high-octane televised shamings. It will be Bezos' first-ever appearance before Congress.   The House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust is capping its yearlong investigation of Big Tech's market dominance with Wednesday's teleconferenced hearing spotlighting the four CEOs.  What to expect  \"It's mostly theater. There are few genuine facts left to gather,\" says Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on antitrust.   Still, the CEOs' approaches to the questioning are important, Crane notes. \"Are they willing to admit that there's a problem with Big Tech's market power, or is it denial mode? Will they recommend innovative private solutions, or retreat into defending themselves as champions of consumer interests who play it fair?\"   The bipartisan probe stands out in a capital steeped in partisanship, where Republicans and Democrats are now arguing over the size of new federal pandemic relief. It's the first such congressional review of an industry that for over a decade has enjoyed haloed status and a light touch from federal regulators.   Broadbanned: Still no affordable fix for a broadband internet connection just out of reach   Critics question whether the companies stifle competition and innovation and pose a danger to society. The Judiciary panel collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies.   A key question: Whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and more funding for enforcement are needed.   Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. With other Democrats, Cicilline has floated the idea of an antitrust moratorium that would block big corporations from acquiring smaller companies during the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans call the idea misguided and socialistic.   WFH: Google extends remote work policy through next summer   The tech companies now face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies' practices, including the earlier acquisitions of smaller firms.   Facebook's fiercest critics in Congress, including liberal Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren and conservative Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, have put breaking up Big Tech companies on the table. And presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said breakups of the giants should be considered.   Short of breakup, the scrutiny of the companies across the U.S. and abroad points toward possible new restrictions on their power.  The CEO playbook  The CEOs could follow the conventional playbook for congressional \"star chamber\" hearings, making their case while showing some humility.   Beyond that, each company has a distinct profile, and each tech titan has his own approach and story to tell.   Bezos, the world's richest individual presiding over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal \"smart\" tech and beyond, initially declined to testify unless he could appear with the other CEOs. He'll likely face questioning over a Wall Street Journal report that found Amazon employees used confidential data collected from sellers on its online marketplace to develop competing products. At a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied such accusations.

Bezos has said, \"We don't use individual seller data to directly compete with them.\" Amazon says it doesn't believe the Journal allegations are accurate, but has started an internal investigation.   Zuckerberg is a Capitol Hill pro by this point. He endured over five hours of grilling last fall by another House committee on hate speech, privacy, misinformation and Facebook's widely-criticized plan for a new digital currency. He also met privately with key lawmakers and with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized the tech companies and asserted without evidence that they are biased against him.   In the wake of George Floyd's death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook's handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after Facebook's refusal to take action on inflammatory Trump posts that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, critics said, encouraged violence against protesters. Zuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harms or damage.   Pichai faced his own congressional interrogation in 2018 over online privacy and data protection, the danger of digital monopolies, alleged bias against conservative viewpoints and censorship by China. He acknowledged some points but avoided the yes or no answers that lawmakers demanded. EU regulators already have concluded that Google manipulated its search engine to gain an unfair advantage over other online shopping sites in the e-commerce market, and fined Google, whose parent is Alphabet Inc., a record $2.7 billion. Google has disputed the findings and is appealing.   Attorneys general from both parties in 50 states and territories, led by Texas, launched an antitrust investigation of Google in September, focused on its online advertising business.   Apple, whose iPhone is the third-largest seller in the world, faces EU investigations over the fees charged by its App Store and technical limitations that allegedly shut out competitors to Apple Pay. Cook is expected to lay out the case that the fees Apple charges apps to sell services and other goods are reasonable, especially compared with what other tech companies collect.

One of them is the world's richest individual; another is the fourth-ranked billionaire. Their industry has transformed society, linked people around the globe, mined and commercialised users' personal data, and infuriated critics on both the left and right over speech.</p><p><br/>Now Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook of Apple will answer for their companies' practices before Congress for the first time as a group. Summoned for a House hearing, they'll raise a hand (remotely) and swear to tell the truth, in the manner of tycoons of Wall Street or the tobacco industry in earlier high-octane televised shamings. It will be Bezos' first-ever appearance before Congress.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust is capping its yearlong investigation of Big Tech's market dominance with Wednesday's teleconferenced hearing spotlighting the four CEOs. \"It's mostly theater. There are few genuine facts left to gather,\" says Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on antitrust.<br/>Still, the CEOs' approaches to the questioning are important, Crane notes. \"Are they willing to admit that there's a problem with Big Tech's market power, or is it denial mode? Will they recommend innovative private solutions, or retreat into defending themselves as champions of consumer interests who play it fair?\"<br/>The bipartisan probe stands out in a capital steeped in partisanship, where Republicans and Democrats are now arguing over the size of new federal pandemic relief. It's the first such congressional review of an industry that for over a decade has enjoyed haloed status and a light touch from federal regulators.<br/>Critics question whether the companies stifle competition and innovation and pose a danger to society. The Judiciary panel collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies.<br/>\u00a0<br/>A key question: Whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and more funding for enforcement are needed. Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. With other Democrats, Cicilline has floated the idea of an antitrust moratorium that would block big corporations from acquiring smaller companies during the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans call the idea misguided and socialistic.<br/>The tech companies now face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies' practices, including the earlier acquisitions of smaller firms.<br/>Facebook's fiercest critics in Congress, including liberal Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren and conservative Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, have put breaking up Big Tech companies on the table. And presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said breakups of the giants should be considered. Short of breakup, the scrutiny of the companies across the U.S. and abroad points toward possible new restrictions on their power.<br/>The CEOs could follow the conventional playbook for congressional \u201cstar chamber\u201d hearings, making their case while showing some humility. Beyond that, each company has a distinct profile, and each tech titan has his own approach and story to tell.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Bezos, the world's richest individual presiding over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal \"smart\" tech and beyond, initially declined to testify unless he could appear with the other CEOs. He'll likely face questioning over a Wall Street Journal report that found Amazon employees used confidential data collected from sellers on its online marketplace to develop competing products. At a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied such accusations.<br/>Lawmakers from both parties suggested Amazon's earlier statements could be misleading and might even constitute perjury. Bezos has said, \"We don't use individual seller data to directly compete with them.\" Amazon says it doesn't believe the Journal allegations are accurate, but has started an internal investigation.<br/>Zuckerberg is a Capitol Hill pro by this point. He endured over five hours of grilling last fall by another House committee on hate speech, privacy, misinformation and Facebook's widely-criticized plan for a new digital currency. He also met privately with key lawmakers and with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized the tech companies and asserted without evidence that they are biased against him.<br/>In the wake of George Floyd's death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook's handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after Facebook's refusal to take action on inflammatory Trump posts that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, critics said, encouraged violence against protesters. Zuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harms or damage.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDMED-M1272863</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDMED2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-8B41-JBYT-H53G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428672</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"912\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Media news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them is the world's richest individual; another is the fourth-ranked billionaire. Their industry has transformed society, linked people around the globe, mined and commercialised users' personal data, and infuriated critics on both the left and right over speech.   Now Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook of Apple will answer for their companies' practices before Congress for the first time as a group. Summoned for a House hearing, they'll raise a hand (remotely) and swear to tell the truth, in the manner of tycoons of Wall Street or the tobacco industry in earlier high-octane televised shamings. It will be Bezos' first-ever appearance before Congress.    The House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust is capping its yearlong investigation of Big Tech's market dominance with Wednesday's teleconferenced hearing spotlighting the four CEOs. \"It's mostly theater. There are few genuine facts left to gather,\" says Daniel Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on antitrust.   Still, the CEOs' approaches to the questioning are important, Crane notes. \"Are they willing to admit that there's a problem with Big Tech's market power, or is it denial mode? Will they recommend innovative private solutions, or retreat into defending themselves as champions of consumer interests who play it fair?\"   The bipartisan probe stands out in a capital steeped in partisanship, where Republicans and Democrats are now arguing over the size of new federal pandemic relief. It's the first such congressional review of an industry that for over a decade has enjoyed haloed status and a light touch from federal regulators.   Critics question whether the companies stifle competition and innovation and pose a danger to society. The Judiciary panel collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies.    A key question: Whether existing competition policies and century-old antitrust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and more funding for enforcement are needed. Subcommittee chairman Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. With other Democrats, Cicilline has floated the idea of an antitrust moratorium that would block big corporations from acquiring smaller companies during the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans call the idea misguided and socialistic.   The tech companies now face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies' practices, including the earlier acquisitions of smaller firms.   Facebook's fiercest critics in Congress, including liberal Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren and conservative Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, have put breaking up Big Tech companies on the table. And presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said breakups of the giants should be considered. Short of breakup, the scrutiny of the companies across the U.S. and abroad points toward possible new restrictions on their power.   The CEOs could follow the conventional playbook for congressional star chamber hearings, making their case while showing some humility. Beyond that, each company has a distinct profile, and each tech titan has his own approach and story to tell.    Bezos, the world's richest individual presiding over an e-commerce empire and ventures in cloud computing, personal \"smart\" tech and beyond, initially declined to testify unless he could appear with the other CEOs. He'll likely face questioning over a Wall Street Journal report that found Amazon employees used confidential data collected from sellers on its online marketplace to develop competing products. At a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied such accusations.   Lawmakers from both parties suggested Amazon's earlier statements could be misleading and might even constitute perjury. Bezos has said, \"We don't use individual seller data to directly compete with them.\" Amazon says it doesn't believe the Journal allegations are accurate, but has started an internal investigation.   Zuckerberg is a Capitol Hill pro by this point. He endured over five hours of grilling last fall by another House committee on hate speech, privacy, misinformation and Facebook's widely-criticized plan for a new digital currency. He also met privately with key lawmakers and with President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized the tech companies and asserted without evidence that they are biased against him.   In the wake of George Floyd's death and protests against racial injustice, Facebook's handling of hate speech has recently drawn more fire than issues of competition and privacy, especially after Facebook's refusal to take action on inflammatory Trump posts that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, critics said, encouraged violence against protesters. Zuckerberg has said the company aims to allow as much free expression as possible unless it causes imminent risk of specific harms or damage.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42705815243</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G1-1941-F07F-84M5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"990\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>News18.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It hit a purple patch from day one. ...</p><p>The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), the first and only umbrella entity to operate retail payment and settlement system, has earned many a plaudit for itself and the country in its stellar 11-year journey. It hit a purple patch from day one. Starting with the NFS (National Financial Switch) \u2014 the ATM switch \u2014 during 2009, it now boasts of a highly innovative and exponentially growing suite of 20 products/services, including the widely successful UPI (Unified Payments Interface), which has caught the attention and interest of global Big Tech. It is the largest tech platform ever built in India.    Seamless and frictionless high-value customer experience through active engagement with Fintech and trust and reliability of settlement through banks are the hallmarks of its operating model. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has helped create this organisation. It was benevolent and thoughtful at the same time.    During FY 19-20, it clocked a transaction volume of 30 billion (both financial and non-financial) with a value of Rs 53 lakh crore. Exponential growth has been the NPCI\u2019s mantra.    Despite its not-for-profit status (Section 8 company), the NPCI has been earning profits consistently of a couple of hundreds of crores. But given its not-for-profit status, it has not been distributing dividends and reinvesting. It is not listed either.   Citizen Scale Opportunity   The progress of NPCI notwithstanding, the Nandan Nilekani committee report (though it has not recommended explicitly new umbrella entity), brings out a lot of gaps and huge opportunities to broaden and deepen digital payments at a much larger scale, ie, Citizen Scale.    It particularly points out that there are only about 100 million unique digital customers. There is an opportunity to bring another 600-700 million customers into the digital payments fold. The UPI is highly smartphone-centric and enabling it on feature phone would unleash the genie.    It also points out that there is a considerable gap between issuance infrastructure and acceptance infrastructure. Against one billion debit cards, we have hardly fewer than four million PoS (Point of Sale), and this acceptance infrastructure needs to be ramped up at scale. Unique PoS is much lower. QR code adoption is slow. Lots technology developments are taking place in acceptance infrastructure like offline and Internet of Things.    There is a huge gap between digital credit and digital debit (cash withdrawals) relating to AEPS (Aadhaar Enabled Payment System) and there are around 200 million cash withdrawals. Bridging this gap would save a lot of time wasted in long queues. This last mile digitisation improves productivity for all stakeholders.    Moreover, the per capita digital transactions are quite low at about 22 against Singapore\u2018s 782 and less than 10% when compared with many other countries. The NPCI may have to pivot to retain and improve its premier position.   Advantage New Players?   The RBI has recently issued guidelines to license a New Umbrella Entity (NUE) to be interoperable with the NPCI, ostensibly to create competition, foster innovation, broaden and deepen digital payments, accelerate financial inclusion and mitigate single point of failure. Given the huge opportunity, one would expect significant interest from new players with deep pockets.    Most importantly, the RBI has also clarified that the new organisation may also be in for-profit format unlike the not-for-profit format of the NPCI. This appears to signal a departure from the Public Good policy.    Secondly, the new framework provides for \u201ccarrying on any other business suitable to further strengthen retail payment ecosystem in the country\u201d. One may infer that the NUE may also undertake activities in the lucrative B2C space and even adjunct financial markets and ecommerce than merely the current B2B format of the NPCI. E-commerce and digital payments feed each other. Of course, clarity from the RBI may guide the prospective players.    In terms of ownership and control, it restricts the entry of players to resident Indians. But it welcomes FDI/FPI within the present FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) framework. It would be interesting to see how the big Chinese/Japanese/players and Big Tech of the US respond and work around the ownership and control requirements.      Good Space for Deep Pockets   Digital payments are not viable business on a standalone model before huge capital burn happens. Many of these pure-play payment companies, including Payments banks in India, are bleeding huge cash. However, the motivation is not just about foray into the huge digital payment markets but payments as a building block and a gateway to entry into other lucrative financial services like insurance, mutual funds, lending and pension products.    Despite huge losses, digital payment businesses command huge valuation. For instance, Paytm has been incurring losses over the years and during the last two years alone, burnt around Rs 4,200 crore and Rs 2,900 crore. But the last round of funding was done on valuation of $16 billion. PhonePe, an app provider that rides on UPI platform, had incurred a loss of Rs 1,900 crore and is reportedly seeking a valuation of $7-10 billion. Huge customer acquisition costs and massive incentives/cash backs contributed largely to these losses and, of course, it is a norm in startups. This space is a good place to bet for deep pocket players who can sustain cash burn for initial years.   Juicy Valuation   Come to think of it, what would be the valuation of the NPCI, which has been raking in modest profits consistently over the last several years and has built and runs the largest tech platform in India? Besides, it has over 1,200 banks on its platform, with over monthly financial transaction volume run rate of over 4.02 billion, 2.4 lakh ATMs, 5 million PoS, 650 million Aadhaar mapper, etc.    It could be in tens of billions of US$. The NPCI may have to explore avenues to change its status to for-profit, even list on stock exchanges and monetise value. This is essential to rearm itself to brace for the competition. Even the State Bank of India (SBI) claims $40 billion valuation for its YONO digital platform.    On a different note, ANT Financials in China (affiliate of Alibaba), started in 2004, is launching its IPO with a valuation of $225-300 billion. Its rival, Tencent, is valued at $500 billion. PayPal commands a valuation of about $190 billion. They started off as digital payment players but transformed into highly profitable financial services aggregator behemoths. They operate in the B2C space with full suite of citizen services, including financial, non-financial areas like ecommerce, medical, advertising and technology.    This business model contributes to huge valuation. Their SuperApp platforms are more convenient than mere mobile payments. These attracted huge FDI and India\u2019s market size is nearly as big as China. This offers insights both for the NPCI as well as prospective players.   Brace for Big Tech   UPI/digital payments is hotting up as a battleground for global Big Tech. Will they kill innovation and even competition by the small as alleged by US Congress in recent hearings or spur further innovation? Would they do what they have done to the advertising business? Would it be a kiss of death for Indian Fintech or happy marriage with fat dowry? Leveraging and navigating them is a huge challenge. It would be interesting to watch how this pans out.    The NUE is not just about digital payments but about a billion consumers market that is up for grabs. The Big Tech may dump capital to gain access to customers/data through their apps or otherwise, and create huge monopolies in payments as they have done in other sectors. They can burn huge capital for long periods of time and drive out most other players and we may get into a typical winner takes it all. Government\u2019s price prescription in a wicked way suits capital dumpers. The minimum requirement of Rs 500 crore capital is small change for the Big Tech and the initial cash burn needs much more capital.    Can Indian regulators/government do what the US counterparts are unable to do in tackling the monopolies? Amidst all this, where does the Indian Central Bank Digital Currency stand? WhatsApp\u2019s sibling, LIBRA (Facebook\u2019s own digital currency), is round the corner. Mastercard reportedly launched virtual payment rails for digital currency for issuance, distribution and even government.    This is far ahead of the much celebrated UPI. Basking in UPI glory, does NPCI run the risk of trailing behind in this high impact innovation?   Smart Regulation   Right doses of regulation would determine the scale, scope, nature and value of digital financial markets, including payments. Hopefully, the experience of telecom and Payments banks will not be lost. This is the right opportunity for the NPCI to pivot.    Philosophically speaking, scale and scope at some level is a mirror image of concentration of not just economic but social and political power. Not properly handled, digital utopia turns dystopia.

With good reason. Only a swivel-eyed libertarian could fail to be angered by the brazen antics of Google and Facebook, which shuffle revenues from Britain via Dublin and Amsterdam to the sun-kissed tax havens of the Caribbean.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tax, let us remember, is a zero-sum game. Every pound of tax that a multinational corporation avoids adds to the burden that ordinary taxpayers and businesses must bear. When big tech wins, the rest of us suffer - in the form of bigger tax bills or cuts to public services.</p><p>As is becoming abundantly clear, the traditional ways of raising tax do not work well in an economy where more and more activity takes place on the internet. Philip Hammond admitted as much last week. In his budget speech, the chancellor declared that over the \"medium term\" Britain would have to find a \"better way of taxing the digital part of the economy\". </p><p>That's a statement of the blindingly obvious, rather than the call to action needed to rein in the beasts of the internet.</p><p>Hammond's comment was intended as a sop to the legions of companies that will see their business rates soar from next month. High street retailers have long complained that the tax puts them at a huge disadvantage to online rivals.</p><p>Rates are based on the value of business premises, and the likes of Amazon, Boohoo and Asos pay less than traditional retailers because they are not based in shopping centres or on high streets.</p><p>The levy - which traces its roots to the time of Elizabeth I - is recalculated every five years, though the latest overhaul was delayed. It will heap pain on retailers in London, southeast England and other affluent metropolitan areas. The surge in property prices in those areas has pushed up the rental value of retail premises, and with it business rates liabilities.</p><p>By contrast, Amazon is expected to enjoy rates cuts at six of its nine vast warehouses in Britain, set in areas where property values have lagged behind.</p><p>On one level, this is an example of tax policy helping to achieve a laudable social goal. Amazon has built distribution centres in Swansea and Doncaster - areas that hardly enjoy a surfeit of thriving industry.</p><p>On another level, however, the distortions created by the business rates regime are perverse. Amazon is, after all, a $410bn (\u00a3340bn) global goliath; it scarcely needs a subsidy from the taxman.</p><p>If business rates are not fit for purpose, what is the best and fairest way to tax companies in the internet era?</p><p>When the rates system was first introduced in the 1572 Poor Law Act, it was an efficient means of redistributing income from property owners to the needy. For the taxman, it continues to have merit. Rates are simple to collect and all but impossible to avoid. But it no longer makes sense to base businesses' bills on the rental value of their premises.</p><p>If the problem is easy to diagnose, the cure is less straightforward to discern. One radical solution floated by the British Retail Consortium is to create a new tax based on the amount of energy used by businesses. That would penalise virtual retailers that deliver goods to customers hundreds of miles away using fleets of delivery vans and motorcycle couriers.</p><p>This idea is unlikely to see the light of day, however, because of the pain it would inflict on other heavy energy users, such as manufacturers.</p><p>Another possible way to level the playing field would be to vary business rates according to industry. However, few tax experts view this as a credible reform; the danger would be that companies become enmeshed in thickets of bureaucracy. On top of that, it would be nigh on impossible to implement in the retail sector, given the increasingly blurred lines between physical and online purchases.</p><p>An internet sales tax is, perhaps, the most plausible solution. This would, in effect, place an additional surcharge on goods sold online. It would be relatively difficult for consumers or retailers to dodge, and easy for HM Revenue &amp; Customs to collect.</p><p>So why has the government not introduced a change that, on the surface, makes so much sense? Blame Brussels. The European Union regulations on VAT preclude member nations from applying different rates to goods sold online and in stores.</p><p>Come 2019, Spreadsheet Phil will have no excuses if he fails to rein in the internet retailers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-33781675</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N2N-S6F1-JCJY-G371-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"761\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 12, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Contrast this with the Bank of England's predictions (made only last month <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/mar/13/spring-statement-philip-hammond-growth-borrowing-spending-live-updates?page=with:block-5c88fb4ee4b0eff8e0fc2172#block-5c88fb4ee4b0eff8e0fc2172\">by the Bank's February 2019 Inflation Report</url> ) of 1.2% in 2019, 1.5% in 2020 and 1.9% in 2021. Why is OBR so much more pessimistic than the Bank of England for 2020 and 2021?</p><p>In fact, under the assumption of lower Brexit-related uncertainty (let's call this the 'deal dividend effect') the Bank predicts even higher  GDP growth rates of 2.2% in 2020 and 2.3% in 2021.</p><p>If the Bank is correct and the OBR is wrong in its assessment, then the Chancellor appears to be underestimating the benefits of a deal dividend at a very critical time with further parliamentary voting taking place both today and tomorrow. Alternatively, the cynical reader might conclude that the OBR has already taken into account the adverse ('sledgehammer') effects of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/mar/13/spring-statement-philip-hammond-growth-borrowing-spending-live-updates?page=with:block-5c88fb4ee4b0eff8e0fc2172#block-5c88fb4ee4b0eff8e0fc2172\">the tariffs announced today</url>...</p><p>block-time published-time 5.35pm GMT </p><p> This char shows how the UK's government's borrowing requirements have fallen, giving more headroom to borrow within the fiscal rules. </p><p>    The Office for Budget Responsibilities new forecasts for government borrowing Photograph: OBR   </p><p>Melanie Baker, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, explains how this boosts the war chest that can be opened if no-deal Brexit is avoided.</p><p> That largely reflects projections of higher income tax receipts (higher earnings growth assumptions) and lower debt interest spending (reflecting lower market expectations of rate rises). The amount of 'headroom' in the fiscal numbers therefore rose (i.e. the extra net spending the Chancellor could engage in before breaking the fiscal mandate) from \u00a315.4bn to \u00a326.6bn.</p><p>The OBR did warn though that, in the event smooth Brexit is achieved, market interest rates and debt interest payment projections may rise again, i.e. reducing that headroom.</p><p>block-time published-time 5.03pm GMT </p><p> Extending Article 50 by a few months would have a damaging impact on the UK's economy, and erode the chancellor's headroom to borrow and spend more. </p><p>So argues Danielle Haralambous, UK analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit:</p><p>Even though the OBR has slashed its economic growth forecast for 2019, there's been a marked improvement in the UK's fiscal ratios, creating more headroom for the Chancellor to loosen fiscal policy if required and allowing him to stick to his declaration of an \"end to austerity\". However, there's a big cloud hanging over these projections, as they all are all conditional on a smooth end-March Brexit transition that parliament pretty much ruled out last night.</p><p>Mr Hammond expressed a hope that the negotiated Brexit deal will still be passed in the coming weeks, but that is unrealistic. We don't expect a \"no deal\" scenario, but an extension of Article 50 that will compound the current uncertainty associated with Brexit and probably mean a deterioration in the forecasts and slightly less fiscal room for manoeuvre by the Autumn Budget.</p><p>block-time published-time 4.52pm GMT </p><p>My colleague <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/mar/13/spring-statement-philip-hammond-growth-borrowing-spending-live-updates?page=with:block-5c88fb4ee4b0eff8e0fc2172#block-5c88fb4ee4b0eff8e0fc2172\">Aditya Chakrabortty</url> says Philip Hammond's spring statement had one large flaw -- a massive vacuum where the chancellor should have put some new policies.</p><p>Ah, but what about Brexit uncertainty pinning Hammond in? Not good enough....</p><p>You would not have guessed from listening to him that the economy is on the brink of recession, that local councils are going bust, that schools across the land are sending parents begging letters for cash. Analysis by the TUC shows that by 2024, spending on public services will still be \u00a3500 lower per person than it was in 2009.</p><p>Hammond claims that all he needs is a deal on Brexit to open the sluice gates and get spending, but there is no logical connection between the two. The UK has its own currency, and interest rates are barely off the floor. Now is the time for a government to spend on public housing, on schools and on a welfare system that doesn't treat claimants as scammers and idlers.

That allocates their funds on the basis of need (particularly for Wales), their geographic challenges and population, and it also shares out extra cash if there is a major England-only spending decision such as the Crossrail project in London.</p><p>The Treasury said Crossrail was \"local\" funding, so handed out \u00a3500m to all three devolved areas. The NAO wondered why it then ruled the HS2 high speed rail line to Birmingham was \"national\" infrastructure, which triggered payments to the administrations in Edinburgh and Belfast, but not Cardiff.</p><p>Then there was the notorious decision to give Northern Ireland \u00a3410m for 2018/19 under Theresa May's deal with the Democratic Unionist party, but no extra money went to Scotland or Wales. Conversely, if the Treasury awards special one-off funding to devolved nations, there is no consequential extra cash for England. </p><p> The Scottish government said these funding disparities needed to be addressed by the Chancellor in today's spring statement. </p><p>It said Scotland should have had \u00a33.3bn extra if the Barnett formula had been properly applied to May's sweetheart deal with the DUP. </p><p>\"We have urged the UK government to use the spring statement to provide a proportionate amount of additional finance and flexibility to Scotland in line with the Barnett formula,\" a spokesman said. </p><p>The Barnett formula, which has no legislative basis, has other unexpected quirks, the NAO said. </p><p>Its calculations showed Northern Ireland got \u00a32,110 per capita more than the \u00a39,080 spent in England last year, Scotland \u00a31,801 more and Wales \u00a31,317 more. However, the Barnett formula does not seem sensitive enough to reflect the fact that because England's population is rising faster than in the devolved nations, their per capita share was growing at England's expense. </p><p>Alan Bermingham, government policy manager for the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, said the NAO's findings justified Cipfa long-standing criticisms of Barnett. </p><p>Bermingham says:</p><p>\"In light of this investigation, we call on government to consider the long-term future of the formula, and to consider an independent needs-based funding system covering all regions of the UK.\".</p><p>The Treasury denied there was a problem, insisting its funding rules were \"clearly set out in the published statement of funding policy, the Scottish government fiscal framework, and the Welsh government fiscal framework. </p><p> \"The Treasury works closely with all three devolved administrations to ensure they understand how these arrangements have been applied.\"</p><p>block-time published-time 9.26am GMT </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/mar/13/spring-statement-philip-hammond-growth-borrowing-spending-live-updates?page=with:block-5c88fb4ee4b0eff8e0fc2172#block-5c88fb4ee4b0eff8e0fc2172\">The Financial Times says</url> Philip Hammond will launch a consultation into new ways to fund Britain's infrastructure. </p><p>This follows Hammond's decision to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/mar/13/spring-statement-philip-hammond-growth-borrowing-spending-live-updates?page=with:block-5c88fb4ee4b0eff8e0fc2172#block-5c88fb4ee4b0eff8e0fc2172\">end the discredited PFI scheme in last October's Budget</url>.

The prediction that growth will only be 1.2% this year, the improved borrowing figures, the \u00a326.6bn war chest which the chancellor is itching to open... they could all evaporate if Britain crashes out of the EU in 16 days. Hammond's call for MPs across the house to come together to find a Brexit solution fell on stony ground -- Parliament looks more divided than ever. Business leaders will reaching the final strands of the end of their very frayed tether, while cash-strapped families will be desperate for austerity to be eased. As Miles Celic, Chief Executive Officer, TheCityUK, puts it: \"MPs have said 'no to no deal,' but without an agreement between the UK and the EU, this vote sadly delivers very little. A constructive and practical way forward must be found. Unless the Withdrawal Agreement or some other realistic course of action is agreed very soon, the UK will still crash out, regardless of MPs' wishes. Brexit is speeding towards the end of the road and there is still no bridge to get to the other side.\" That's all for today. Thanks for reading and commenting. We'll be back tomorrow to cover reaction to the spring statement, and our politics blog will be covering the Brexit crisis again. Goodnight! GW There's big drama in the House of Commons right now -- MPs have narrowly voted for an amendment rejecting the idea of Britain leaving the EU without a deal, by just four votes. That's a fresh blow to Theresa May, and possibly makes a Brexit extension even more likely. It's also creating quite a lot of chaos in Westminster, as the government's plans take another hit... although this vote doesn't, on its own, prevent Britain crashing out on teh 29th. Andy Sparrow has all the action here: The Independent highlights several campaign groups who have condemned the government for not ending the benefits freeze early, by tapping into its fiscal headroom. Campbell Robb, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said: \"The government should have shown today that it is serious about tackling the rising tide of poverty in the UK. \"Instead they chose not to end the freeze on benefits, leaving families in poverty to face rising costs and bear all the risks of economic uncertainty, especially if we leave the EU without a deal.\" Child Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said: \"The chancellor could have sent a lifeline to low-income families. \"That he didn't is evidence of ministers' refusal to confront the reality that families have been left with too little money to live on after three long years of stagnant incomes and rising price Independent: Spring statement: Philip Hammond accused of failing to ease austerity despite \u00a327bn spending boost The Financial Times points out that Philip Hammond has pledged to spend more, if a Brexit deal is reached: Mr Hammond said leaving the EU with an agreement would give the UK real choices on how much of a \"deal dividend\" could be spent on public services or tax cuts. \"That is what I mean by an end to austerity,\" he added. After a near-decade of austerity and severe cuts in local authority spending, the UK's services are showing the strain through crises in the social care system, schools asking parents to donate and a visible rise in rough sleeping. FT: Spring Statement: Hammond pledges end to austerity if Brexit deal is reached But, don't forget that economic outlook has weakened. The Daily Telegraph says: Rarely has a Chancellor faced such a grim outlook with such little cover. Britain's economy is in for a beating: growth forecasts for this year were slashed by a quarter. GDP will grow by a mere 1.2pc this year, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), down 0.4 percentage points from its previous update in October. It puts the economy on course for its weakest year since 2009. Trade will drag on growth. Employment will rise, but by around 100,000 less than hoped in the years ahead, despite the Chancellor hailing the forecasts. There's real anger tonight that Hammond didn't take the opportunity to end the freeze on working age benefits. By keeping the welfare payments unchanged in cash terms, recipients will actually get less once inflation is taken into account. That can be a serious blow to poor families. Resolution Foundation explains: The final year of the freeze on working age benefits, which takes effect next month, will leave a low-income couple with children \u00a3200 worse off next year, rising to \u00a3580 once the full effect of the freeze is included. Overall tax and benefit changes being introduced this April will take \u00a3100 from families in the bottom fifth of the income distribution and give \u00a3280 to those in the top 10 per cent. Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University reckons the Chancellor may actually have more flexibility to spend and borrow than the OBR has estimated. The OBR predicts annual GDP growth rates of 1.2% in 2019, 1.4% in 2020 and 1.6% in 2021. Contrast this with the Bank of England's predictions (made only last month by the Bank's February 2019 Inflation Report) of 1.2% in 2019, 1.5% in 2020 and 1.9% in 2021. Why is OBR so much more pessimistic than the Bank of England for 2020 and 2021? In fact, under the assumption of lower Brexit-related uncertainty (let's call this the 'deal dividend effect') the Bank predicts even higher GDP growth rates of 2.2% in 2020 and 2.3% in 2021. If the Bank is correct and the OBR is wrong in its assessment, then the Chancellor appears to be underestimating the benefits of a deal dividend at a very critical time with further parliamentary voting taking place both today and tomorrow. Alternatively, the cynical reader might conclude that the OBR has already taken into account the adverse ('sledgehammer') effects of the tariffs announced today... This char shows how the UK's government's borrowing requirements have fallen, giving more headroom to borrow within the fiscal rules. Melanie Baker, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, explains how this boosts the war chest that can be opened if no-deal Brexit is avoided. That largely reflects projections of higher income tax receipts (higher earnings growth assumptions) and lower debt interest spending (reflecting lower market expectations of rate rises). The amount of 'headroom' in the fiscal numbers therefore rose (i.e. the extra net spending the Chancellor could engage in before breaking the fiscal mandate) from \u00a315.4bn to \u00a326.6bn. The OBR did warn though that, in the event smooth Brexit is achieved, market interest rates and debt interest payment projections may rise again, i.e. reducing that headroom. Extending Article 50 by a few months would have a damaging impact on the UK's economy, and erode the chancellor's headroom to borrow and spend more. So argues Danielle Haralambous, UK analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit: Even though the OBR has slashed its economic growth forecast for 2019, there's been a marked improvement in the UK's fiscal ratios, creating more headroom for the Chancellor to loosen fiscal policy if required and allowing him to stick to his declaration of an \"end to austerity\". However, there's a big cloud hanging over these projections, as they all are all conditional on a smooth end-March Brexit transition that parliament pretty much ruled out last night. Mr Hammond expressed a hope that the negotiated Brexit deal will still be passed in the coming weeks, but that is unrealistic. We don't expect a \"no deal\" scenario, but an extension of Article 50 that will compound the current uncertainty associated with Brexit and probably mean a deterioration in the forecasts and slightly less fiscal room for manoeuvre by the Autumn Budget. My colleague Aditya Chakrabortty says Philip Hammond's spring statement had one large flaw -- a massive vacuum where the chancellor should have put some new policies. Ah, but what about Brexit uncertainty pinning Hammond in? Not good enough.... You would not have guessed from listening to him that the economy is on the brink of recession, that local councils are going bust, that schools across the land are sending parents begging letters for cash. Analysis by the TUC shows that by 2024, spending on public services will still be \u00a3500 lower per person than it was in 2009. Hammond claims that all he needs is a deal on Brexit to open the sluice gates and get spending, but there is no logical connection between the two. The UK has its own currency, and interest rates are barely off the floor. Now is the time for a government to spend on public housing, on schools and on a welfare system that doesn't treat claimants as scammers and idlers. Sadly, it won't be this government. Here are some of our Spring Statement news stories: Philip Hammond made much play of his Brexit war chest - the \u00a326bn of extra spending that will be possible within the government's fiscal rules, and the boost to business confidence. But it's too late to avoid damage to the economy, says Michael Izza, chief executive of ICAEW (Institute of Chartered Accountants). \"As to be expected after last night's vote, the Chancellor's statement provided little sunshine to cut through the Brexit fog. \"If there is a managed deal, we can expect a significant Brexit dividend with businesses investing, consumers more confident and an uptick in the market. However, much damage has already been done as a result of the ongoing uncertainty. Businesses have taken decisions to relocate assets and cancel planned investments, which are unlikely to reversed even if a deal is reached. Adam Jackson, director of public affairs at Grant Thornton UK LLP, says Philip Hammond has hinted at the likely priorities of this summer's spending review (assuming's he's still chancellor at that stage) taking on 'digital giants' (such as Amazon, Google, Facebook) with an investigation into competition in digital advertising and confirmation that the UK will press ahead with a digital services tax despite it being dropped as an EU-wide proposal (it has not been dropped by a number of EU countries such as France, Spain and Italy) confirming that housing investment and Northern Powerhouse transport infrastructure remains a priority measures to tackle climate change, including mandating zero fossil fuels in all new build homes from 2025 Jackson adds: \"These felt like placeholders; a possible government programme if the UK ever completes the interminable current phase of Brexit decisions. The Treasury says the spring statement offered several new spending and policy commitments for Scotland, which included a \u00a365m share of the \u00a3260m on offer in the new Borderlands growth deal which will straddle the English and Scottish border. Coincidentally boosting the electoral fortunes of the Conservative MPs who have seats on either side of the border, the Treasury said it meant that regional partnership would be getting a total of \u00a3362m. Edinburgh University will get \u00a379m for a new \"Archer 2\" supercomputer, \"providing researchers with a fivefold increase over the current computing capacity, paving the way for new discoveries in pharmaceuticals, climate science and aerospace.\" There would also be reviews of whether the aggregates levy, which is now devolved to Scotland, benefits devolved areas sufficiently; reforms to how VAT is claimed back by government departments after an embarrassing row over a VAT bill for Police Scotland; and efforts to boost oil and gas decommissioning industries. Torsten Bell, Director of the Resolution Foundation, says the government has the firepower to end austerity, if it wants to: \"In a speech light on policy, the Chancellor used a \u00a330bn windfall from the OBR to promise sunny uplands if Parliament delivers a smooth Brexit in the months ahead. \"The Chancellor's \u00a326bn of fiscal firepower is more than enough to bring austerity to an end in the Spending Review later this year. This marks a major shift as the debate in British politics moves to focusing on how much more we should spend, rather than how deeply to cut. \"But despite an improvements to the public finances driven in part by particularly fast earnings growth for high earners, austerity will continue for just about managing families, who face a \u00a31.8 billion hit from the benefit freeze in just three weeks' time.\" This chart, from the Office for Budget Responsibility's new report, outlines how future interest tax receipts have strengthened while debt repayment costs have fallen. The spring statement is being criticised for not providing more help to fight poverty and support poorer families. Here's a video clip of the chancellor announcing that fossil fuel heating systems will be banned by 2025, from new homes. And here's a reminder that his predecessor tore up plans to make homes carbon neutral, back in 2015. Climate activists have welcomed the government's pledge to end fossil-fuel heating in new homes by 2025 - which might turn out to be one of the biggest measures today. Hammond told MPs that a new standard will be introduced by 2025 to future-proof new build homes with low carbon heating and energy efficiency measures, That appears to means the end of gas boilers being used to warm new-build houses. Campaign group 10:10 Climate Action's director, Max Wakefield, backed the move, saying: \"All our homes and buildings must be made efficient, affordable and zero-carbon within the next two decades to address the climate crisis. Ending the scandal of poor quality new homes is a no-brainer that's good for everyone.\" Mel Evans, senior campaigner at Greenpeace UK said the plan to end fossil fuels in new homes \"is vital\".... but added that we need bigger thinking to tackle the climate emergency. Conservative MP James Heappey is also impressed (although it's bad form not to support your own chancellor on these occasions). Heads-up. The Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted that UK house prices will be falling by the end of this year. The OBR has downgraded its forecasts for the housing market, due to signs that house price growth has flowed, and subdued turnover in the housing market. It now thinks house price inflation will turn negative, before bouncing back in 2021. This is going to make a serious hole in the government's tax receipts, as stamp duty has been a lucrative tax in recent years. Greg Hands, Conservative MP for Chelsea, is worried: Back in parliament, Chuka Umunna MP has pointed out that Britain's economy had been expected to grow at over 2% per year, before the 2016 referendum. Today's growth forecasts - just 1.2% this year, picking up to 1.6% in 2021 - are sluggish and unimpressive, Umunna points out. Philip Hammond tells MPs (well, those who have hung around in the chamber) that the OBR's recent downgrade of likely UK productivity growth is to blame. Hammond is being criticised for not ending the freeze on benefits (which means the will continue to shrink in real terms). Heidi Allen MP, who quit the Conservatives to join The Independent Group, says it makes a mockery of 'compassionate' Conservatism. Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, says the government is failing the poorest. \"Struggling families are desperate for an end to the freeze on working age benefits, but this Spring Statement leaves them out in the cold once again. Already the freeze has saved the Treasury more than was ever intended, so there can be no ongoing justification for these 'stealth cuts' that mean that the poorest in society have borne the heaviest burden from paying off the deficit. \"Today, the Chancellor could have sent a lifeline to low-income families. That he didn't is evidence of Ministers' refusal to confront the reality that families have been left with too little money to live on after three long years of stagnant incomes and rising prices. Funding sanitary products for girls in schools may help with one small area of expenditure, but this will have a minimal impact on poverty overall. It leaves in tatters the prime minister's claim that austerity is over. Hammond's call for MPs to build a 'consensus' to prevent a no-deal Brexit has caused a stir at Westminster. Is he suggesting giving up on Theresa May's deal, in favour of a new plan that could be backed by Labour? Labour's shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, responded to the spring statement by blasting the government's record: The Chancellor has the nerve to tell those who have suffered most at the hands of his Government, that their suffering was necessary. If austerity wasn't ideological, why has money been found for tax cuts for big corporations while vital public services have been starved of funding? Austerity was never a necessity, it was always a political choice. So when the Chancellor stands there and says that the end of austerity is in sight, talks of a plan for a brighter future - how can anyone who has lived through the last nine years believe him? This is a Government that has demonstrated a chilling ability to completely disregard the suffering they have caused. To talk of changing direction after nine years in office is not only impossible to believe, it's also much too late. Too late for the thousands who have died while waiting for a decision on their Personal Independence Payments. Too late for families who have lost their home due to cuts in housing benefit. Too late for young people losing their lives to knife crime after youth clubs have shut down and police numbers fallen, whatever he has been forced into announcing today. He also urged Hammond to help remove the threat of no deal: Of course Brexit looms large over everything we discuss. Even today, the Chancellor has tried to use the bribe of a deal double dividend or threat of postponing the spending review to cajole MPs into voting for the government's deal. Publication of the tariffs this morning is clearly part of this strategy. This is a calamitous strategy. It is forcing people into intransigent corners. What we need now is the Chancellor today to commit to vote to take no deal off the table. Then to join me in discussing the options available, including Labour's deal proposal and yes, if it requires it, taking any deal back to the public. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, has bad news for the government -- it doesn't currently have enough firepower to handle a no-deal Brexit. So it would have to tear up its borrowing and spending plans, if Britain crashes out without a deal. The Office for Budget Responsibility's verdict is out. The independent watchdog's top line is that growth has slowed, but the public finances look marginally healthier. Economic growth in the UK and globally has slowed since the Budget in October, leading us to revise down our near-term GDP forecast. But tax receipts have performed better than we expected in the final months of 2018-19 and we judge that much of this buoyancy will endure. Together with downward pressure on debt interest spending from lower market interest rates, this delivers a modest medium-term improvement in the public finances. The Chancellor has banked most of it in lower borrowing, but has spent some on higher planned public services spending. The OBR has also confirmed that the chancellor's now has over \u00a326bn of extra spending power he could unleash, once a no-deal Brexit is off the table. It says: This is up from \u00a315.4 billion in October, as the fiscal costs of the temporary nearterm cyclical weakness of the economy have been swamped by the fiscal gains from higher income tax and lower debt interest spending. But... the government still isn't on track to balance the budget by 2025-26 - a whole decade later than George Osborne's first target. Some reaction from Hammond's side of the House: But opposition MPs are predictably less impressed: As we suspected, there wasn't much new in that statement. The economic picture for 2019 has darkened, with growth forecast to only be 1.2%, from 1.6% before. Brexit uncertainty, and the slowdown in the global economy, are both probably to blame. Hammond pointed to faster projected growth in 2021 and 2022 -- but he'd surely agree that we can't bank on that until MPs have got their act together on Brexit. Also, growth is still seen below 2% per year for the next five years; a poor performance by historical standards. The chancellor's main message that he could unlock more spending, if MPs backed a deal. Those improved borrowing figures mean he's got more than \u00a326bn to play with, and a Spending Review planned for this year. With a pointed nod to those who marched through the No lobby last night, he said: \"Leaving with no deal would mean significant disruption in the short and medium term and a smaller, less prosperous economy in the long term, than if we leave with a deal. Higher unemployment, lower wages, higher prices in the shops. That is not what the British people voted for in June 2016.\" Tonight's votes will show exactly how many MPs agree with Hammond (Andy Sparrow will be tracking that in Politics Live here). There was welcome news -- money for free sanitary products in secondary schools and colleges, the extra cash for knife crime protection, and a focus on climate change prevention. Hammond ends his speech by warning MPs that while the economy is fundamentally robust, it is still overshadowed by Brexit uncertainty. He tells the House: We cannot allow that to continue. It is continuing our economy, and damaging our standing in the world. Tonight we have a choice, he continues. MPs can remove the threat of an imminent no-deal threat. Tomorrow we can map out a way to build a consensus across the house, to exit the EU in an orderly way, and create a relationship that allows Britain to flourish, he continues. Another rumour is confirmed, as Hammond announces \u00a3100m of extra funding to tackle knife crime. The money will go to violence reduction units, and for more police overtime. That follows heavy lobbying from the Home Secretary Sajid Javid. Hammond has confirmed that he is taking action on period poverty. The Treasury will fund the provision of free sanitary products in schools from the next school year [as we reported last weekend]. On the environment, Philip Hammond says fresh standards will be introduced for new housing, to mandate the end of fossil fuel heating by 2025. He also announces a new review into the link between biodiversity and growth. Plus, the government will designate a further 445,000 square kilometres of ocean around Ascension Island as a Marine protected area. On housing, Hammond announce a \u00a33bn \"affordable homes guarantee\" scheme. As expected, Hammond has announced a review of global tech giants, to ensure they pay a fair share in the UK. He has also asked the competition and markets authority to undertake a study of the digital advertising market. The chancellor also announces \u00a345m to the European Bioinformatics Institute for genomics research. There's also \u00a381m in a new Extreme Photonics Centre in Oxfordshire to develop a new types of laser. \"Cutting edge technology\", grins the chancellor (whose gags haven't been up to their usual standard) Hammond announces \u00a379m for Archer 2, a new supercomputer based at the University of Edinburgh, which is five times faster than previous models. Capable of 10,000 trillion calculations per second, hopefully it's fast enough to solve the backstop issue, he jokes (this is no time for puns, chancellor) Hammond says PhD level roles will be eliminated completely from visa caps - as part of a push to stimulate research and development in the UK. The government will, as expected, open a consultation on how to replace PFI contracts. Hammond also announces a review of low pay in Britain Philip Hammond's Brexit War Chest has grown to \u00a326.6bn, up from around \u00a315bn, thanks to the lower borrowing forecast by the OBR. Hammond announces \u00a3260m of funding for the Borderlands region (areas in Southern Scotland and the North of England). Hammond says he wants Britain to embrace the technology of the future, so it can \"slay the twin demons of low productivity and low wages\". The upcoming spending review will focus spending on raising productivity, he adds. Leaving Brexit without a deal would deliver a significant short-to-medium term hit to the productive capacity of the UK economy, the chancellor warns. Hammond also says it is \"just wrong\" to think there is a simple way of coping with the consequences of no deal. Any fiscal and monetary response would have to be carefully calibrated so as to not simply cause inflation, he explains. Hammond also warns that the progress in repairing the UK economy will be at risk if it cannot agree a \"smooth and orderly\" exit from the EU. Significant news. Hammond says he will launch a full, three-year spending review before the summer recess - ready for the next budget - if a Brexit deal is agreed. He dangles the prospect of more spending on public services, saying Britain could get a deal dividend. That would come from increased business confidence and a fiscal boost, as less money needing to be set aside for the consequences of no-deal. On borrowing, the 2018-19 deficit will be 1.1% of GDP, Hammond says, down from the 1.2% expected in the October budget. Hammond says the UK will create another 600,00 new jobs by 2023. The OBR has also revised its wage growth up, to at least 3% each year. Onto the growth forecasts. As feared, growth in 2019 has been cut significantly, to just 1.2% from 1.6% in the last budget. But there's good news too - growth in 2021 and 2022 has been revised up. Here are the new forecasts: 2019: 1.2% compared to 1.6% in last October's budget 2020: 1.4% compared with 1.4% 2021: 1.6% compared with 1.4% 2022: 1.6% compared with 1.5% 2023: 1.6% compared with 1.6% Philip Hammond is on his feet now, sporting a smart Tory blue tie, to deliver the spring statement. Let's see what light he can shed on the state of the economy, with less than three weeks until Britain is currently due to leave the EU. The chancellor begins by telling MPs that he knows the House has other pressing issues on its time. Last night's vote leaves a cloud of uncertainty over the country, the chancellor says. But the economy remains robust and has \"defied expectations\", he continued. Hammond says the UK's economy has grown for 9 years in a row - the longest of any G7 member. And it's expected to keep growing for the next five years. He then accuses John McDonnell of living in a \"parallel universe\", for predicting the UK would fall into recession. The chancellor has tweeted.... saying he'll make announcements on infrastructure, technology, housing, skills, and green energy today. Chancellor love to produce a crowd-pleasing surprise or two on these occasions. Brexit uncertainty, though, means any rabbits will probably stay firmly inside Hammond's hat. We may hear about the 'Brexit dividend' today, but how much do taxpayers actually hand to the EU? A new website lets you find out -- enter your salary, and it calculates how much of your income tax heads to Brussels. Spoiler alert, it might be less than you think..... [Reminder: other levies, such as corporation tax, also help fund the UK's bill for EU membership] Prime Minister's Questions is underway now. Our Politics Live blog is tracking all the action: Philip Hammond told the cabinet this morning that the spring statement will set out measures to support an open and competitive economy, according to Theresa May's spokesman (via Reuters). Hammond also said it will confirm the resilience of the UK economy, and the progress made \"repairing the public finances\".... Philip Hammond has emerged from Number 11 Downing Street, and headed to the House of Commons to deliver the spring statement (after Prime Minister's Questions). As it's not the budget, we didn't get a photoshoot with the traditional red box. Just a polite smile for the cameras. Bloomberg Economics have calculated that the chancellor's war chest - money set aside for a no-deal Brexit - has swelled to over \u00a320bn. That's up from \u00a315bn in last autumn's budget, thanks to strong tax receipts in January. If Britain leaves the EU under the withdrawal agreement, it could be spent elsewhere. Bloomberg's Jess Shankleman explains: U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond could next week offer the country an extra 5 billion pounds ($7 billion) to end austerity, but only if Parliament backs a Brexit deal with the European Union. Hammond is expected to receive the windfall to his Brexit war chest when he presents his Spring Statement on Wednesday. He says backing Prime Minister Theresa May's deal would release extra cash for public services that's currently held in reserve to mitigate the fallout from a no-deal split. Alison Thewliss, SNP Treasury spokesperson, says Philip Hammond should announce an emergency budget today, to protect the UK from Brexit confusion. I fear such an emergency fiscal event might be needed if Britain crashes out on the 29th March. In the meantime, Hammond will probably keep his powder dry (while hinting at a spending boost if Brexit goes more smoothly). Once upon a time, the Conservative party promised to eliminate Britain's budget deficit by 2015. They failed (of course), and are now aiming to wipe it out by the middle of the next decade. But we have seen progress on cutting government borrowing. Last October, the OBR estimated that net borrowing could drop to \u00a325.5bn for 2018-2019, down from \u00a3153.1bn in 2009-10 after the financial crisis. As this chart from RBC Capital Markets shows, Britain's net borrowing requirement are on track for their lowest level since 2002-03. You could argue that this is prudent management of the economy (at least compared to the handling of Brexit). But you could also argue that there is freedom to borrow more to invest, and to tackle the public sector funding crisis. No arguing with this statement, from our parliamentary sketch writer. Rupert Harrison of investment giant Blackrock (and a former chief of staff for George Osborne) says the spring statement forecasts don't mean very much. Harrison told Sky News that they're effectively 'fantasy forecasts', due to Brexit uncertainty. If we do get a no-deal Brexit, Philip Hammond will be spending a lot more money on emergency measures. If we get some lifting of the uncertainty, I think there will be more money for public services. Claire Walker, co-executive policy director at the British Chamber of Commerce, says there are worrying signs in the economy. Brexit has already driven business investment down, so Hammond needs to help. This is an opportunity to send a strong and supportive message to businesses at this very tricky time, even though there's a limit to what he can do. City investors are more concerned by the Brexit mess than the chancellor's statement. They'll still be watching at 12.30pm, though, to hear the latest growth and borrowing forecasts. Sam Buckingham, investment analyst at Thomas Miller Investment, explains: Of particular importance will be the latest forecasts for economic growth and public finances. It's expected the former is to be revised down considerably bearing in mind the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recently reduced their forecast for 2019 economic growth for the UK down to just 0.8%, well below the Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) previous prediction of 1.6%. Fiona Cincotta of City Index says Brexit chaos will overshadow the speech: Nevertheless, based on January data the government's tax income is likely to have worked some way towards reducing the budget deficit. Economic growth remains woefully subdued, at about 0.2% last month, which will make it less likely for the Chancellor to end austerity measures. This would normally be a negative for the pound but a no-deal Brexit vote will trump that. Richard Stone, chief executive of The Share Centre, thinks that Philip Hammond should keep his statement as brief as possible: With so much political uncertainty at present it's difficult to see how he could possibly commit to any large scale spending plans or initiatives at this point in time. Indeed, it may well be best for the Chancellor to simply stand-up and say at this stage he has nothing to say. At the very least he must be relieved the Spring Statement is now just that and no longer a full blown March Budget. Although Hammond's hands are rather tied, MPs are still hoping to hear some good news in the spring statement. Labour's Alison McGovern says the chancellor must do more to tackle the problems with universal credit: At the budget, the Chancellor made a big show of accepting changes to the work allowances in universal credit that he argued would help address some of the Osborne-era cuts. In essence, this was just making the cut somewhat less punitive. Hammond has some way to go if he is to make sure that no one is worse off under the new system. The two-child policy remains in place, for example, and we still haven't had a vote on managed migration. Given that this is allegedly 'not a fiscal event', we can assume there is not much hope. Her colleague Marsha de Cordova has also lobbied the Treasury to help severely disabled people who have lost out under UC. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran wants to see fresh education funding (but isn't holding her breath). Conservative Guy Opperman would like to see more funding for the Borderlands (the region covering Southern Scotland and Northern England), after the Scottish Government's pledged \u00a385m overnight. The Treasury's system for funding devolved areas of the UK is under attack from different directions after the National Audit Office, the spending watchdog, said its decisions were sometimes hard to understand, our Scotland editor Severin Carrell reports. The NAO investigated the controversial way the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments are funded, flagging issues in several areas - including the Treasury's opaque ways of sharing out cash, and higher per-head funding of devolved areas. The Treasury provides core funding for the devolved nations worth \u00a3287bn for the five years to 2020/21 through a method called the Barnett formula. That allocates their funds on the basis of need (particularly for Wales), their geographic challenges and population, and it also shares out extra cash if there is a major England-only spending decision such as the Crossrail project in London. The Treasury said Crossrail was \"local\" funding, so handed out \u00a3500m to all three devolved areas. The NAO wondered why it then ruled the HS2 high speed rail line to Birmingham was \"national\" infrastructure, which triggered payments to the administrations in Edinburgh and Belfast, but not Cardiff. Then there was the notorious decision to give Northern Ireland \u00a3410m for 2018/19 under Theresa May's deal with the Democratic Unionist party, but no extra money went to Scotland or Wales. Conversely, if the Treasury awards special one-off funding to devolved nations, there is no consequential extra cash for England. The Scottish government said these funding disparities needed to be addressed by the Chancellor in today's spring statement. It said Scotland should have had \u00a33.3bn extra if the Barnett formula had been properly applied to May's sweetheart deal with the DUP. \"We have urged the UK government to use the spring statement to provide a proportionate amount of additional finance and flexibility to Scotland in line with the Barnett formula,\" a spokesman said. The Barnett formula, which has no legislative basis, has other unexpected quirks, the NAO said. Its calculations showed Northern Ireland got \u00a32,110 per capita more than the \u00a39,080 spent in England last year, Scotland \u00a31,801 more and Wales \u00a31,317 more. However, the Barnett formula does not seem sensitive enough to reflect the fact that because England's population is rising faster than in the devolved nations, their per capita share was growing at England's expense. Alan Bermingham, government policy manager for the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, said the NAO's findings justified Cipfa long-standing criticisms of Barnett. Bermingham says: \"In light of this investigation, we call on government to consider the long-term future of the formula, and to consider an independent needs-based funding system covering all regions of the UK.\". The Treasury denied there was a problem, insisting its funding rules were \"clearly set out in the published statement of funding policy, the Scottish government fiscal framework, and the Welsh government fiscal framework. \"The Treasury works closely with all three devolved administrations to ensure they understand how these arrangements have been applied.\" The Financial Times says Philip Hammond will launch a consultation into new ways to fund Britain's infrastructure. This follows Hammond's decision to end the discredited PFI scheme in last October's Budget. That creates a question of how the government can team up with the private sector to pay for major project, such as new hospitals and roads. This will show that Hammond's looking to the future. However, we already know that business investment has been hit by Brexit - major companies will be reluctant to take on potentially risky contracts until they have clarity over the UK's future. Philip Hammond is expected to take action on another important issue - period poverty. Following pressure from campaigners, the chancellor will fund a scheme to make free sanitary products available from September. My colleague Heather Stewart reported: The chancellor will announce that he is asking Damian Hinds, the education secretary, and Penny Mordaunt, minister for women and equalities, to design a scheme that would be implemented in all secondary schools in England. The scheme is expected to mirror one already in place in Scotland. It is understood that the Treasury has not yet carried out a detailed costing, but when the Scottish equivalent was announced last year, it was expected to cost \u00a35m. Full details of the funding will be announced in the spending review, expected later in the year - but Hammond is expected to make clear that the Treasury will fund it in full, and that availability will not be restricted, for example, to those students eligible for free school meals. Labour deputy leader Tom Watson has welcomed Hammond's plan to give consumers more control over their data held by Big Tech: The Sun is reporting that Hammond will unveil a \u00a3100m funding package for the police, in response to the surge in knife crime. They say most of the new cash will be spent on new violent crime units in seven worst affected UK areas -- London, the West Midlands, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, South Wales and Manchester. The money will also help pay for police officers overtime. The Sun says: It is a major victory for Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who demanded the cash after the surge in knife killings this year. Chancellor Philip Hammond had offered a new package of \u00a350 million but Mr Javid held out for more. The world's technology giants may find themselves in the firing line in today's spring statement. Our economics editor Larry Elliott explains: A fresh bid to curb the market power of US tech giants will be signalled by Philip Hammond on Wednesday when he welcomes the findings of an independent review calling for government action to ensure companies including Google, Facebook and Apple face stiffer competition. The chancellor will use his annual spring statement to promise action after a review conducted for the Treasury by Jason Furman, Barack Obama's chief economic adviser, concluded that the dominance of the big digital players was curbing innovation and reducing consumer choice. Furman, now a Harvard professor, said a new digital markets unit should be set up in Whitehall staffed by people with technological expertise and equipped with the powers to set and enforce greater competition. The review says individuals should be given more control over their personal data to enable them to switch between platforms more easily, that the biggest tech companies - Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple - should have to sign up to an enforceable code of conduct, and that merger policy should be toughened up. \"Over the last 10 years the five largest firms have made over 400 acquisitions globally. None has been blocked and very few have had conditions attached to approval, in the UK or elsewhere, or even been scrutinised by competition authorities,\" the review said. Here's the full story: Shadow chancellor John McDonnell released a video clip last night, urging Hammond to end austerity once and for all. Local government is on its knees, child poverty is rising, and people are being driven to food banks by the government's universal credit system, McDonnell says: Here's our preview of what to expect today: We'll be tracking the spring statement here, while Politics Live focuses on Brexit: Good morning. Britain has seen some famous fiscal events over the years. From Hugh Gaitskell introducing charges on dental work and glasses in 1951 (triggering Nye Bevan's resignation) to Sir Geoffrey Howe hiking taxes in the teeth of the 1981 recession or Gordon Brown announcing \u00a340bn of fresh NHS funding in 2002, chancellors have made the political and economic weather at the dispatch box. But not today. Instead, Philip Hammond's Spring Statement is likely to be more of a fiscal non-event. For a start, it's not a full budget - more like an update on the nation's financial health. Secondly, it's being overshadowed the full-blown Brexit crisis raging, now that MPs have rejected Theresa May's deal again. So Hammond's performance will be more like a palate cleanser, between last night's Meaningful Vote and a new vote tonight on whether to rule out leaving the EU without a deal. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn will further steal the limelight when they clash at PMQs at noon, before the chancellor speaks. But what can we expect? Hammond will give MPs the latest growth forecasts. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility may have downgraded its view of 2019, given the recent global slowdown. In October 2018, they projected 1.3% growth for 2018 -- but just last week, the OECD said growth will slide to just 0.8% this year. But the OBR could also bring good news -- the UK may need to borrow less than previously expected, thanks to bumper tax receipts in January. That means Hammond's \"Brexit war chest\" - money set aside to protect the economy if a no-deal Brexit occurs - may have swelled from \u00a315bn close to \u00a320bn. The chancellor is expected to tell Parliament that this goody bag could be used on urgent priorities such as schools and hospitals, as long as Britain doesn't crash out of the EU (something to concentrate MPs minds ahead of tonight's vote). The statement may also announce some new consultations into the issues facing Britain (productivity problems and climate change, perhaps), or an update on Hammond's Digital Services Tax. But more wide-ranging changes to tax and spending plans, to reverse the impact of years of painful austerity, must probably wait for another day.

Last year, they promised Washington that they would build a 5G wireless network for 97% of the country in three years, including much of rural America, while offering \"same or better rate plans at the same or better prices.\" The combined company, which will retain the T-Mobile name, is expected to serve more than 100 million subscribers, rivaling the larger footprints of AT&amp;T and Verizon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero said the merger was unlikely to \"substantially lessen competition,\" rejecting arguments from California, New York and 11 other states that sued to block it.</p><p>\"T-Mobile has redefined itself over the past decade as a maverick that has spurred the two largest players in its industry to make numerous pro-consumer changes. The proposed merger would allow the merged company to continue T-Mobile's undeniably successful business strategy for the foreseeable future,\" he wrote in his decision. \"While Sprint has made valiant attempts to stay competitive in a rapidly developing and capital-intensive market, the overwhelming view both within Sprint and in the wider industry is that Sprint is falling farther and farther short of the targets it must hit to remain relevant as a significant competitor.\"</p><p>Sprint shares spiked more than 72% on the news, trading at $8.25 by midday. T-Mobile surged 11.1%, to $93.90.</p><p>The deal could be complete as soon as April 1, the companies said in a news release, though it still requires approval from the California Public Utilities Commission. And though the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department approved the deal last year, it's possible the legal battle isn't over yet. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who spearheaded the lawsuit, said the states \"wholeheartedly\" disagreed with the ruling and are considering an appeal.</p><p>\"From the start, this merger has been about massive corporate profits over all else, and despite the companies' false claims, this deal will endanger wireless subscribers where it hurts most: their wallets,\" James said in a statement. \"There is no doubt that reducing the mobile market from four to three will be bad for consumers, bad for workers, and bad for innovation, which is why the states stepped up and led this lawsuit.\"</p><p>Recent months have seen lawmakers on both sides of the aisle raise concerns about the dangers of corporate consolidation. House lawmakers have embarked on a wide-ranging probe exploring whether Silicon Valley giants such as Apple, Google and Facebook have taken unfair action to quash rivals. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(See related story on Page B3)</emphasis></p><p>Senators Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have made breaking up big tech a prominent feature of their presidential campaigns. But even when federal regulators are involved, they rarely take action against mergers: The Federal Trade Commission challenged 22 mergers out of 2,111 in 2018, according to an agency report. Five challenges resulted in litigation.</p><p>Advocates of the deal say it would boost competition by rescuing the struggling Sprint, which has been unprofitable for the better part of the past decade and claims 13% of the market. Aija Leiponen, a professor of applied economics at Cornell University and an expert in the telecom industry, said the deal will keep Sprint out of the hands of AT&amp;T and Verizon, which command 40% and 30% of the market, respectively.</p><p>\"If Sprint goes bankrupt, its assets will likely be sold to the other three companies, potentially enhancing the already strong dominance of the two market leaders,\" Leiponen said. \"The creation of a third equal competitor, the combined Sprint-T-Mobile, would have about 30% of the market, too. This might actually provide a more viable alternative, and a counterweight, to Verizon and AT&amp;T nationwide.\"</p><p>Although the merger was formally announced in April 2018, T-Mobile and Sprint, run by Japanese conglomerate Softbank, had been flirting with a combination for years but were thwarted by political head winds. To win the government's blessing, both companies agreed to sell off key assets - including hundreds of retail stores, thousands of cell sites and spectrum licenses - to Dish Network in an effort to turn Dish into a fourth national wireless carrier. Sprint and T-Mobile were also forced to ditch their prepaid phone businesses, Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile.</p><p>\"If this merger proceeds, we hope the plan for DISH Network to enter the wireless marketplace as a new competitor works, and that wireless users will eventually benefit again from a market with four strong competitors,\" John Bergmayer, legal director at think tank Public Knowledge said in a statement. \"There will be a great deal of uncertainty for consumers in the meantime, as a result of this decision. New entry into the wireless market is not easy, especially when it requires the cooperation of your competitors, as under the DOJ's proposal.\"</p><p>Executives said the new T-Mobile will increase competition in broadband markets by bringing high-quality coverage to underserved areas and be a major job creator in a tight labor market. The new company will have more than 3,500 additional full-time workers than the individual companies would, T-Mobile said in a news release, and 11,000 more by 2024. About 600 new retail locations and five new customer experience centers will also create 12,000 jobs, the company said, many in small towns.</p><p>\"This will benefit Kansas consumers by increasing competition in our state, expanding quality coverage in many rural areas of Kansas, expediting the deployment of 5G technology for Kansans, and protecting and expanding Kansas jobs,\" Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, who supported the merger, said in a statement. \"We intend to hold the merged company to its promises of investment in its Kansas network and of maintaining substantial employment at what will become the combined company's 'second headquarters' in Overland Park.\"</p><p>Sprint executive chairman Marcelo Claure said in a news release that the company was \"ready to make the vision of a New T-Mobile a reality.\" It \"brings us a big step closer to creating a combined company that will provide nationwide 5G, lower costs, and a high-performing network that will invigorate competition to the benefit of all mobile wireless and in-home broadband consumers.\"</p><p>Richard Parker, legal counsel for T-Mobile's parent company, Deutsche Telekom, said in a statement emailed to The Washington Post that the company was \"delighted\" with the decision. \"As we argued in court, this merger ensures competition by allowing the combined companies to more effectively compete with the market leaders. It is our hope that with the Court's endorsement of the merger, along with the federal agencies' approval, this matter can be closed so that the market can do what it does best: fuel competition and innovation.\"</p><p>Mike Sievert, T-Mobile's current president, is poised to succeed John Legere as chief executive to helm the newly combined company on May 1. Legere, whose charisma and acumen helped move the merger forward, will remain a member of the board.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UNIONL-7c30bce24d0c11eabd5f00163ec2aa77</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UNIONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y67-T661-DYTR-404S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152974</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1258\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Union Leader Corp.

Last year, they promised Washington that they would build out a 5G wireless network to 97 percent of the country in three years, including much of rural America, while offering the \"same or better rate plans at the same or better prices.\" The combined company, which will retain the T-Mobile name, is expected to serve more than 100 million subscribers, rivaling the even larger footprints of AT&amp;T and Verizon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero said the merger was unlikely to \"substantially lessen competition,\" rejecting arguments put forward by California, New York and 11 other states that sued to block it.</p><p>\"T-Mobile has redefined itself over the past decade as a maverick that has spurred the two largest players in its industry to make numerous pro-consumer changes. The proposed merger would allow the merged company to continue T-Mobile's undeniably successful business strategy for the foreseeable future,\" he wrote in his decision. \"While Sprint has made valiant attempts to stay competitive in a rapidly developing and capital-intensive market, the overwhelming view both within Sprint and in the wider industry is that Sprint is falling farther and farther short of the targets it must hit to remain relevant as a significant competitor.\"</p><p>Sprint shares spiked more than 77 percent on the news, closing at $8.52. T-Mobile surged 11.8 percent, to $94.49.</p><p>The deal could be completed as soon as April 1, the companies said in a news release, though it still requires the approval of the California Public Utilities Commission. And though the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department approved the deal last year, it is possible the legal battle is not over. New York Attorney General Letitia James, who spearheaded the lawsuit, said that the states \"wholeheartedly\" disagree with the ruling and are considering an appeal.</p><p>\"From the start, this merger has been about massive corporate profits over all else, and despite the companies' false claims, this deal will endanger wireless subscribers where it hurts most: their wallets,\" James said in a statement. \"There is no doubt that reducing the mobile market from four to three will be bad for consumers, bad for workers, and bad for innovation, which is why the states stepped up and led this lawsuit.\"</p><p>Recent months have seen lawmakers on both sides of the aisle raise concerns about the dangers of corporate consolidation. House lawmakers have embarked on a wide-ranging probe exploring whether Silicon Valley giants such as Apple, Google and Facebook have taken unfair action to quash rivals. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) have made breaking up big tech companies a prominent feature of their presidential campaigns. But even when federal regulators are involved, they rarely take action against mergers: The Federal Trade Commission challenged just 22 mergers out of 2,111 in 2018, according to an agency report. Only five challenges resulted in litigation.</p><p>Advocates of the deal say it would boost competition by rescuing the struggling Sprint, which has been unprofitable for the better part of the past decade and claims just 13 percent of the market. Aija Leiponen, a professor of applied economics at Cornell University and an expert in the telecom industry, said the deal will keep Sprint out of the hands of AT&amp;T and Verizon, which command 40 percent and 30 percent of the market, respectively.</p><p>\"If Sprint goes bankrupt, its assets will likely be sold to the other three companies, potentially enhancing the already strong dominance of the two market leaders,\" Leiponen said. \"The creation of a third equal competitor, the combined Sprint-T-Mobile, would have about 30 percent of the market, too. This might actually provide a more viable alternative, and a counterweight, to Verizon and AT&amp;T nationwide.\"</p><p>Although the merger was formally announced in April 2018, T-Mobile and Sprint, the latter controlled by the Japanese conglomerate Softbank, had been flirting with a combination for years but were thwarted by political head winds. To win the government's blessing, both companies agreed to sell key assets - including hundreds of retail stores, thousands of cell sites and spectrum licenses - to Dish Network in an effort to turn Dish into a fourth national wireless carrier. Sprint and T-Mobile were also forced to ditch their prepaid phone businesses, Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile.</p><p>\"If this merger proceeds, we hope the plan for DISH Network to enter the wireless marketplace as a new competitor works, and that wireless users will eventually benefit again from a market with four strong competitors,\" legal director John Bergmayer at the think tank Public Knowledge said in a statement. \"There will be a great deal of uncertainty for consumers in the meantime, as a result of this decision. New entry into the wireless market is not easy, especially when it requires the cooperation of your competitors, as under the DOJ's proposal.\"</p><p>Executives said the new T-Mobile will increase competition in broadband markets by bringing high-quality coverage to underserved areas and will be a major job creator in a tight labor market. The new company will have over 3,500 more full-time workers than the individual companies would, T-Mobile said in a news release, and 11,000 more by 2024. Some 600 new retail locations and five new customer experience centers will also create 12,000 jobs, the company said, many in small towns.</p><p>\"This will benefit Kansas consumers by increasing competition in our state, expanding quality coverage in many rural areas of Kansas, expediting the deployment of 5G technology for Kansans, and protecting and expanding Kansas jobs,\" Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, who supported the merger, said in a statement. \"We intend to hold the merged company to its promises of investment in its Kansas network and of maintaining substantial employment at what will become the combined company's 'second headquarters' in Overland Park.\"</p><p>Sprint executive chairman Marcelo Claure said in a news release that the company was \"ready to make the vision of a New T-Mobile a reality.\" The ruling \"brings us a big step closer to creating a combined company that will provide nationwide 5G, lower costs, and a high-performing network that will invigorate competition to the benefit of all mobile wireless and in-home broadband consumers.\"</p><p>Richard Parker, legal counsel for T-Mobile's parent company, Deutsche Telekom, said in a statement emailed to The Washington Post that the company was \"delighted\" with the decision. \"As we argued in court, this merger ensures competition by allowing the combined companies to more effectively compete with the market leaders. It is our hope that with the Court's endorsement of the merger, along with the federal agencies' approval, this matter can be closed so that the market can do what it does best: fuel competition and innovation.\"</p><p>Mike Sievert, T-Mobile's current president, is poised to succeed John Legere as chief executive to helm the newly combined company on May 1. Legere, whose charisma and acumen helped move the merger forward, will remain a member of the board.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-836f6c1ed42d4809a90182230f79749b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y63-9RN1-JB4M-V0BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1275\"/><timeReceived>1:35 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 11, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS443142 ELECTRONICS STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC4812 RADIOTELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

T-Mobile and Sprint must provide Dish the cell sites needed to run its wireless service for seven years, while Dish builds its own 5G network, according to the agreement.</p><p>Those steps ensure \"large amounts of currently unused or underused spectrum are made available to American consumers in the form of high-quality 5G networks,\" Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said in a statement Friday.</p><p>The DOJ's approval is the last major step for the merging of the nation's No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers.</p><p>Although the Federal Communications Commission needs to approve it, too, FCC chairman Ajit Pai gave his blessing to the corporate marriage two months ago.</p><p>After the DOJ's announcement Friday, Pai said he would recommend the commission approve the merger.</p><p>\"The commitments made to the FCC by T-Mobile and Sprint to deploy a 5G network that would cover 99 percent of the American people, along with the measures outlined in the Department's consent decree, will advance U.S. leadership in 5G and protect competition,\" he said. Pai noted bipartisan support for the merger from Governor Laura Kelly (D-KS), Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), and former FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn.</p><p>T-Mobile CEO John Legere celebrated the agreement on Twitter saying: \"We are one step closer to bringing New T-Mobile to American consumers!\"</p><p>During a teleconference with investors, Legere said he expected the deal to close by the end of the year.</p><p>Dish Network said it planned to deploy a 5G broadband network to 70 percent of the U.S. population by June 2023.</p><p>The deal will \"will set the stage for our entry as the nation's fourth facilities-based wireless competitor and accelerate our work to launch the country's first standalone 5G broadband network,\" said DISH co-founder and chairman Charlie Ergen.</p><p>But not all agree on the regulators' decision.</p><p>Democratic presidential candidate and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has called for a breakup of big tech firms, tweeted that the merger \"will cost thousands of jobs, reduce wages, and further reduce competition in a sector that badly needs it.\"</p><p>\"The administration thinks it's OK for two of the four major cell phone cos. to combine This is a bad deal - it means less competition &amp; more costs,\" tweeted Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who also is running for president and a member of the Senate Commerce Committee. \"T-Mobile can't compete for you for cheaper service against Sprint when they are the same company!\"</p><p>FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, tweeted that she \"remained skeptical that this combination is good for consumers, good for competition, or good for the economy.\"</p><p>Fourteen states including California and New York have sought to block the merger on the grounds its unnecessary consolidation curbs competition. A status hearing on that case is scheduled for Thursday in the Southern District of New York, but the states are asking for a delay from the previously agreed upon Oct. 7 trial date due to changes in the merger, including DOJ provisions.</p><p>The DOJ said five states - Nebraska, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma, and South Dakota - had agreed with the agency on its merger provisions. Those states are not part of the other states' legal challenge.</p><p>\"A marketplace with fewer active competitors drives up costs, reduces consumer choice and thwarts innovation,\" said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. \"We intend to be prepared to go to trial to fight for a fair, competitive, and equitable marketplace for consumers nationwide.\"</p><p>Added New York Attorney General Letitia James:  \"We have serious concerns that cobbling together this new fourth mobile player, with the government picking winners and losers, will not address the merger's harm to consumers, workers, and innovation.\"</p><p>At advocacy group Free Press, research director Derek Turner said the states have come to the same conclusion that the DOJ's staff did previously: \"This merger is bad for wireless users and can't be fixed,\" he said.</p><p>\"By signing off on this merger, the Justice Department has done nothing to remedy the short- and long-term harms the loss of an independent Sprint will create for U.S. wireless users. Nothing about these divestitures would lower prices for customers,\" he said. \"DISH can't mount a retail operation that's even close to what Sprint currently offers.\"</p><p>Follow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FLATDY-brv-1876823068</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLATDY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPX-3YF1-JC3H-01HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">256483</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FLORIDA TODAY All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>FLORIDA TODAY (Brevard County, Florida)</publicationName><edition>1 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 1, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0009EZR</classCode><className>SPRINT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0008XKE</classCode><className>T-MOBILE INTERNATIONAL AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001ZF4</classCode><className>DISH NETWORK CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS443142 ELECTRONICS STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC4812 RADIOTELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS515210 CABLE &amp;

Specifically, T-Mobile and Sprint must divest Sprint's prepaid business   including the Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Sprint prepaid brands   to DISH, along with certain spectrum assets. The two wireless carriers will also be required to make at least 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations available to DISH, as well as provide DISH with \"robust access\" to the T-Mobile network for seven years as the satellite company builds out its own 5G wireless network.</p><p>\"Today marks an incredibly important step forward for the New T-Mobile,\" T-Mobile CEO John Legere said in a July 26 news release after the Justice Department's announcement. \"Our goal was to ensure that the DOJ's concerns were addressed while enabling us to deliver on every aspect of the synergies we promised to unlock   and we did it. It may have taken longer than expected by some, but today's results are a win-win for everyone involved.\"</p><p>The DOJ's decision had been anticipated for months. Earlier this week, an announcement from the department had been expected on July 25, ahead of T-Mobile's second-quarter earnings conference call, but the decision was put off and the planned conference call with analysts was canceled. The Wall Street Journal reported at the time that DOJ needed more time to win support from state attorneys general for the department's planned settlement.</p><p>A total of 17 state attorneys general filed suit earlier this year to block the deal, five of those states   Nebraska, Kansas, Ohio, Oklahoma and South Dakota   signed on to the DOJ's settlement. Unless more states join the settlement agreement, that case is set to head to trial in October.</p><p>Beyond the DOJ, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai said July 26 that he plans to present a draft order favorably resolving the commission's own review of the transaction. At the federal level, the deal required approval from both the FCC and DOJ.</p><p>Shares in Sprint were trading at $7.91 as of midday on July 26, up 13.81% for the week, while shares in T-Mobile were up 7.15% over the same time period, trading at $82.97.</p><p>In other deal news, Intel Corp. this week agreed to sell the majority of its smartphone modem business to Apple Inc. in a $1 billion transaction.</p><p>During an earnings conference call after the transaction's announcement, Intel CFO George Davis said the company expects an improvement in operating expenses of about $400 million to $500 million in 2019 due to the divestiture and about double that in 2020. The company reported full-year operating expenses of $20.42 billion in 2018.</p><p>Shares in Intel were trading at $51.87 as of midday on July 26, up 3.19% for the week.</p><p>Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. stock moved this week as the tech giants delivered better-than-expected earnings despite facing intensifying scrutiny from regulators and legislators.</p><p>Google LLC parent Alphabet's shares surged after the company on July 25 reported a 19% year-over-year increase in revenue for the second quarter of $38.94 billion, along with net income of $9.95 billion, or $14.21 per share, up from $3.20 billion, or $4.54 per share, a year earlier.</p><p>Speaking during a webcast to discuss second-quarter earnings, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said regulatory scrutiny is \"not new\" to Google, adding that company management will engage \"constructively\" with regulators to resolve all outstanding concerns.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice this week confirmed it had opened an antitrust investigation into Alphabet and its peers, including Facebook, Apple and Amazon.com Inc., examining potential anticompetitive business practices.</p><p>Around midday July 26, Alphabet shares were trading at $1,257.32, up 11.11% for the week.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook shares popped and then simmered this week.</p><p>The social media giant on July 24 reported a 28% year-over-year increase in second-quarter revenue of $16.89 billion, but net income fell 49% year over year to $2.62 billion resulting from a $5 billion fine levied by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that same day. Excluding the one-time charge, Facebook's second-quarter EPS would have been $1.99, Facebook said.</p><p>The FTC fine related to violations of a 2012 order regarding Facebook's user data practices, including the company's 2018 admission that the now-defunct data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica LLC had improperly accessed millions of users' personal information.</p><p>Facebook is also facing a separate FTC investigation regarding antitrust concerns.</p><p>Shares in Facebook were trading at $198.24 midday July 26, down 0.06% from their July 19 close.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-53103422</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPD-SJ21-F19Y-C11B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"836\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

President Trump is set to hold a big rally there tonight, ahead of a special election for a House seat hopes to keep in Republican hands.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, we talked this past weekend to the guy for whom the president is making his pitch. But there is a bigger worry for the president tonight, what to do about the 16 House Republicans who already have announced they're making their way to the exit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're going to speak to former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker about all of this in a moment.</p><p>First to John Roberts at the White House on what we can expect from the president tonight.</p><p>Hey, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, you can expect a big rally tonight, there's no question about that, in Fayetteville, which really is Trump territory, very heavy military town.</p><p>But there's some debate actually, Neil, as to whether or not this is the last election of the 2018 cycle or if this is the first election of the 2020 cycle. This is a do-over of the Ninth Congressional District in North Carolina after it was declared null and void after the original Republican candidate's campaign engaged in an illegal voting scheme.</p><p>Dan McCready, the Democrat, lost by 905 votes in that first election in a district that President Trump won by 12 points. McCready now facing the North Carolina State Senator Dan Bishop. At the end of August, polls showed McCready with a small lead.</p><p>But the president has been pulling out all the stops to try to push Bishop over the top, that big rally tonight, and ahead of that, as he was departing the White House this afternoon, the president said this about Bishop:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Bishop is a great gentleman, a great man. He's going to be a great -- I think he's going to be a great congressman. It was a very close race. I think it's getting less close.</p><p>If you look at the numbers from two weeks ago -- and I got involved about two weeks ago, and the numbers have gone way up. I think Dan has a very good chance of winning the election.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: I asked the president this afternoon, Neil, if he thought that tomorrow's election in the Ninth Congressional District was a bellwether. He said no.</p><p>You can bet that, if Dan Bishop wins, a lot of Republicans will say that it's indicative of what happened -- what might happen in 2020. And if he loses, you can bet a lot of Democrats will be saying it could be indicative of what's happening, what will happen in 2020.</p><p>The president also this afternoon -- this is the other big story of the day -- saying that peace talks between the United States and the Taliban are dead. The president was going to bring the Taliban and the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, to Camp David yesterday to try to push a peace deal, which Zalmay Khalilzad, the former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, said was almost a done deal.</p><p>But then after the Taliban claimed responsibility for that car bombing near the U.S. Embassy in Kabul on Thursday that killed an American service member, a NATO soldier and 10 other people, the president said, that's it. Nobody's coming to Camp David, and the peace talks are dead.</p><p>I'm told by other administration officials the situation is still fluid, but, at the moment, Neil, hard to see how you get the Taliban back to the table after what they did on Thursday.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, I could see that.</p><p>All right, thank you, John, very much, John Roberts.</p><p>Now, I spoke to Dan Bishop. He's the Republican, as we said, running in that special election. He was with me on Saturday on \"Cavuto Live.\" He sounded optimistic, despite polls suggesting it could be an uphill fight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAN BISHOP (R), NORTH CAROLINA CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: When I go across the district talking to people, the thing that I hear most often is how surprised and even frightened people are by the extraordinary hard-left positions you see coming out of the Democratic Party, people openly embracing socialism.</p><p>And there's a real clear choice in this election between that vision and the Trump vision of an economy that -- as you say, that's sort of roaring along, lower taxes, border security, and continued American exceptionalism.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, we did reach out to his Democratic opponent, Dan McCready, for a second time. Have yet to hear back. But hope springs eternal.</p><p>Former Wisconsin Republican Governor, presidential candidate Scott Walker with us now.</p><p>Governor, what do you make of the importance of this particular race, as 16 Republicans have already announced their retirement in the House? Does it make you, as a Republican, anxious?</p><p>SCOTT WALKER (R), FORMER WISCONSIN GOVERNOR: Well, it's all about turnout.</p><p>If you look at this district, as was mentioned the report, President Trump did well there in the past. I think you saw, in special elections, and particularly in the last fall's elections, the left was more motivated going into the 2018 elections, which is not uncharacteristic any time you have got an incumbent and the other party's got that.</p><p>But I think it's going to be critical in North Carolina, as it will be going into 2020, that Republican right-of-center voters wake up and realize the left is motivated. We got to be just as motivated.</p><p>I think Dan Bishop is going to win. And I think the president's involvement is going to be critical. And, remember, his opponent, the Democrat who won't go on your show, had a two-year head start. He had a $2 million head start. He didn't have a primary.</p><p>So he's got a lot of things going in his favor. I think the president being there will remind people just how critically important this election is.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, it's a little less so in this particular district, but I'm talking about union households nationally. They have been very, very important in deciding some crucial elections, and maybe some of those retirements that we're hearing from Republicans, because a lot of money was plowing into at least eight of the 16 districts whose congressmen incumbents have decided to retire.</p><p>And I'm wondering. You dealt with that, was able to deal with it in your first election, in your -- in the recall election, in your reelection, but it is a constant.</p><p>And the president has made inroads with union households, but it's a very different matter on the House and Senate level, right?</p><p>WALKER: Well, it is.</p><p>And there's a big difference between the big government union bosses and the hardworking employees. The men and women who go to work every single day, I think they like the president. I think they like a lot of our House members.</p><p>But you can't take it for granted. You look at those House seats you mentioned where there have been retirements, all but one of them are plus - - on average, plus 14 Republican-leaning districts.</p><p>The only one you have got is Will Hurd down in Texas, who's an anomaly in his own right, having it in the first place. But I think you look at -- in my own state, we have got two, Sean Duffy, who is spectacular, NorthwesternWisconsin in the suburbs, and to the middle of the state, Jim Sensenbrenner, who has been there more than four decades.</p><p>In both those cases, those are strong Republican districts, as long as the candidates running get out and tell a convincing story. And as you just heard from Dan Bishop, I think, in each of those races, it's going to be a clear contrast between freedom and free enterprise and those who want to fight for socialism.</p><p>The more the Squad is out front, the more AOC and Omar and others are the face of today's socialist Democratic Party, the better off we're going to be in those elections in 2020.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm just beginning to wonder. You talk about the passion, and is it jazzed on the other side, and it might very well be as we get close to the election for Republicans, but thus far that doesn't appear to be the case.</p><p>Why do you think that is?</p><p>WALKER: Well, think, up through 2018, I certainly saw that, in Wisconsin, a lot of Republican-leaning voters took it for granted.</p><p>A lot of them were complacent, thought there was no way, whether it was losing in Wisconsin or any number of other battleground states. I think people took it for granted. They saw a strong economy. They saw good things happening in the government, Republicans' commonsense conservative reforms working.</p><p>I think they didn't think that that -- that would be enough on the left, just having the kind of enthusiasm they had. Now I think a lot of voters have woken up to the reality that, if they don't do something about it, not only are Democrats going to win, but you really have the most radical of radical Democrats embracing ideas like a complete government takeover of the health care system.</p><p>I don't think people want that. They want our fellow citizens to have access to good, quality, affordable health care, but they don't want the federal government running it, taking it over, causing all sorts of havoc.</p><p>And that's just one of many examples out there where, if we get that story out, if we get that message out, our candidates in the House, certainly in keeping the Senate -- and I think the contrast with the president, whether it's Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, or whoever is out of that crazy car routine on the left, I think, if that's the contrast, we win the election.</p><p>If it's not, if Republicans, if right-of-center voters take it for granted, we're in trouble. But I don't think that's going to happen.</p><p>CAVUTO: Governor, thank you very much for taking the time. I appreciate it, sir.</p><p>WALKER: Thank you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, the president just saying that the North Carolina special election is not a referendum about him.</p><p>What do my guests think about that?</p><p>Democratic strategist Kevin Chavous joins us. We have also got Independent Women's Forum's Patrice Onwuka and The Federalist's Emily Jashinsky.</p><p>I could see that being the case, let's say, in an off-year election, Emily, but, even then, it is sort of a sentiment of how party voters, non-party voters feel about the president.</p><p>Is this more or less the case this go around?</p><p>EMILY JASHINSKY, THE FEDERALIST: Well, yes, I think what you're seeing in this race is a dynamic that's going to be replicated in districts around the country, where you have rural voters who are very favorable to the president make up his base.</p><p>Then you have some of the suburban voters, who may not be part of the Republican base, the Trump base, but could vote Republican, and are undecided on the president.</p><p>And what you have just heard from Scott Walker and what you heard from Bishop in your interview with him on Saturday is very important, because what Republicans are trying to do is set a binary, so that you have a Republican candidate and you have a Democrat that they're able to depict as a socialist, as someone who's on the hard left, to use Bishop's words himself.</p><p>And that -- I just reported this last week from RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel -- is what resonates, particularly with suburban women, in helping Republicans come back to the Trump side or come back to vote for a Republican candidate, is when Republicans are able to have that binary, where they depict the Democrat as hard left.</p><p>That is what you should expect from Donald Trump at the rally tonight.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you need to focus on a singular candidate. I get that. We have still many who are in the race to challenge him.</p><p>But, Kevin Chavous, I'm beginning to wonder when, to a man or woman, they're all espousing we're getting rid of the president's tax cuts, these gifts to the wealthy, that that invariably means you're going to raise taxes.</p><p>So how is that going to fly in a general election?</p><p>KEVIN CHAVOUS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think you're going to see people really go back to the issues that are most important to them.</p><p>And we know that's always the economy in a presidential race. And the economy has been strong. But it has started to slow up a little bit. And there are some signs that portend maybe a potential recession. We don't want that to happen, even as a Democrat, we don't -- definitely don't want that.</p><p>But that could be a problem for Donald Trump. And I think, in this North Carolina race we were talking about, a lot will go back to the way they feel about immigration and health care. And I think that McCready has been strong on health care with his position.</p><p>And although he didn't cooperate with ICE, as when he was sheriff, that's something that may -- the fact that he is at least moderate in that area may help him in the suburbs, because the Ninth District is obviously very diverse.</p><p>And I think, among suburban voters, they may be open to that. He's a moderate Democrat. He's not far left, like some of the members of the Squad. He's actually more in the middle.</p><p>So this is an important test for Donald Trump, because, if he can't get -- or the GOP -- if they can't win this seat, where Donald Trump had great success, a seat they have held since 1963, that would be a problem for them moving forward.</p><p>CAVUTO: No, no, you raise a very good point. And he is a different type of a candidate, in fact, echoing support of some of the president's positions, I believe, in even the trade battle with China.</p><p>But, Patrice, given the fact that the Democratic challenger now is up by four points in the latest poll, obviously, within the margin of error, I understand, so anything can happen, but this in a district that the president swamped.</p><p>And you get other anecdotal reports of some big goings-on in Texas that might show that that Republican lock might be more in play than we appreciate. What's your read of things?</p><p>PATRICE ONWUKA, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Yes, I think Republicans are probably surprised that it's such a close race right now.</p><p>And what's interesting, also, Neil, is that you have two additional candidates, a Green Party candidate and a libertarian candidate. Wouldn't it be interesting if either of those candidates siphons off enough support from either side?</p><p>So you will see what -- we will see what happens there. But this candidate, the Democratic candidate here, he's a veteran. This is someone who's running as a moderate. He's trying his best to run from AOC and the Squad in Washington because he doesn't want to be connected to the far left.</p><p>And that's a problem that Democrats nationwide are going to face, which is that, all this time, the attention has been focused on AOC, and Democrats who have been elected have not done anything. They haven't proven there's a reason why they should have -- they should retain the House.</p><p>And so making that case for 2020 why they should continue to keep the House and even retain or even grab the Senate is going to be a hard case to make.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, Emily, looking at that, then, you could make the argument the economy, even though I think some of these recessionary arguments have been overplayed here, but it's slowing from the blistering pace.</p><p>It's still an enviable pace to the rest of the world. And I'm wondering if that is an issue for the president.</p><p>JASHINSKY: I mean, I think it depends on how much it eventually slows down.</p><p>I also think it's important in this particular race to zoom in to the local level and acknowledge that this is happening in the shadow of an electoral scandal, frankly, that hurts Republicans.</p><p>And so while we're trying to figure out how a district that was won by double digits -- double digits by Donald Trump only three years ago is now -- has the Democratic candidate up by four points in the latest poll, I think that's also very important to this.</p><p>But to the question of the economy, it's just so hard to predict what's going to happen. But I think, when you are looking at three years of, as you just said, blistering pace, I actually think that still helps Republicans, because they have seen -- it seems -- voters have seen favorable results.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, very good.</p><p>It's always very good to be in a position where the economy is still -- has pluses in front of it than minuses.</p><p>So, guys, we will watch it closely.</p><p>JASHINSKY: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: I apologize for breaking into you there.</p><p>Some news we're following up here on the fallout from those now collapsed talks with the Taliban, the fallout now in the region entirely -- after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: They're dead. They're dead. As far as I'm concerned, they're dead.</p><p>They thought that they had to kill people in order to put themselves in a little better negotiating position. When they did that, they killed 12 people. One happened to be a great American soldier.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: And that was that for the president of the United States.</p><p>Those Taliban talks that would have been at Camp David that just days around the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on this country not happening.</p><p>Retired Green Beret Lieutenant General Jerry Boykin.</p><p>General, good to have you.</p><p>LT. GEN. JERRY BOYKIN (RET.), U.S. ARMY: Good to be with you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Are you happy those talks are dead, General?</p><p>BOYKIN: Yes, not only am I happy that they're dead, Neil, but I really cannot understand how we could have thought in any serious kind of way that we were going be able to negotiate with the Taliban.</p><p>And, frankly, I don't think we should have ever gone down this path to begin with.</p><p>CAVUTO: There are those in the military sphere, General, who always tell me, well, talking is better than the alternative and that, if you can talk, at least you're not killing each other.</p><p>What do you say to that?</p><p>BOYKIN: Neil, I came into the counterterror business in 1978, when we stood up the Delta Force.</p><p>And we had a -- we already had a longstanding policy that we don't negotiate with terrorists. Keep in mind that the Taliban are terrorists. They are motivated by the same ideology that Al Qaeda and ISIS and Boko Haram are motivated by. They are terrorists.</p><p>You sit down and talk with them, especially when you leave out a legitimate government, like the government of President Ghani, and you start talking to them, you're violating, I think, a longstanding U.S. policy towards terrorists.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think that this attack that killed an American soldier and dozens of others was meant to do just that, squelch the talks, stop them in their path?</p><p>BOYKIN: Well, I think that is something that could be considered, because what does the Taliban get out of this?</p><p>First of all, they have already started claiming that they have waited the U.S. out. They have already started taking credit for a big win in their social media. And what do they have to gain from this? They're going to do what they're going to do regardless of whether U.S. troops are there.</p><p>We're down to the point now where our U.S. troops are at what I consider to be a really a minimal size. And the Taliban are still going after our troops, going after innocent civilians with their car bombings and their attacks.</p><p>And so I would just say, I don't know whether they did it for that reason or not, but, if they wanted peace, if they really wanted some kind of agreement, they wouldn't have been out taking a chance on killing Americans.</p><p>CAVUTO: Where does this go?</p><p>I mean, Jim Mattis has a book out right now, the former defense secretary, in which he's had run-ins with presidents, not only this one, but his predecessor, Barack Obama, who essentially fired him from his CENTCOM commander job.</p><p>But the one, two links they have in common is that Mattis wanted to avoid troop drawdowns in Iraq with Barack Obama, in Syria with the plan that then President Trump was looking at. And the president -- President Trump, I'm saying, has since reconsidered that for the time being, but that we are trying to extricate ourselves from this region, but it's next to impossible.</p><p>BOYKIN: Neil, look, I think that what we have there in Afghanistan now is sustainable for an indefinite period of time.</p><p>Now, I would like to see us get all troops out of there as well. But we have got to be realistic. Now, even if you decide to draw down, we could draw down and offset that with some kind of contractor support.</p><p>The problem with contractors is, they have to be on a tight leash, and they have to be under very strict control. But in terms of training, and equipping, and helping the Afghan national forces, helping them to be able to provide their own protection, sort of like the CORDS program in Vietnam, we could certainly do some of that with contractors and further reduce our presence here.</p><p>The bottom line is, though, there has to be an American military presence in that country for, as far as I'm concerned, an indefinite, unforeseeable amount of time.</p><p>CAVUTO: Wow.</p><p>General, thank you very much, as I often say, more for your service to this incredible country, and that was incredible service, at that.</p><p>General Boykin, thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Thank you.</p><p>In the meantime, I have a little assignment for you during the break here. Try Googling \"mounting political pressure,\" and I bet you the name Google actually comes up, because don't look now, but just about every single state attorney general in the United States of America is saying Google is playing fast and loose with the rules, and it ends now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOUG PETERSON, NEBRASKA ATTORNEY GENERAL: When 50 attorney generals come together, 50 attorney generals send a strong message to Google. And I'm not going to quote Joe Biden, but I am going to tell you it's a big deal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Google's got some trouble.</p><p>Fifty state attorneys general claiming the online search engine is so much more, so much bigger, and so much so that Republicans and Democrats agree, enough is enough.</p><p>FOX Business Network's Hillary Vaughn at the Supreme Court, where the announcement went all down -- Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil.</p><p>Every state really getting on board here, except for California and Alabama. But 50 state attorneys generals stood on the steps of the Supreme Court today to announce that they are officially launching an investigation into Google.</p><p>The A.G.s will decide if the company played fair or if they have crossed the line in an effort to crush their competition. The probe is starting with a review of Google's ad practices, how consumers' data feeds into their ad dominance.</p><p>But it could go beyond that. Texas A.G. Ken Paxton is leading the investigation. He says they will go wherever the facts lead.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN REYES, UTAH ATTORNEY GENERAL: That's what our investigation intends to uncover and reveal, whether Google is played by the rules and acted fairly. There's a fine line sometimes between aggressive business practices and illegal ones.</p><p>Usually, the line is very clear. And, again, our investigation will determine whether Google has crossed that line.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: This is not the first state A.G. probe into Google. But it is the largest.</p><p>The 50-strong bipartisan team of state watchdogs is a show of force for the company. Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt tells me there is strength in numbers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIC SCHMITT, MISSOURI ATTORNEY GENERAL: But, ultimately, that's the force and the power of all the attorneys general banding together to get answers and make sure that everybody's held accountable, that even the biggest of the big tech companies are held accountable.</p><p>PETERSON: When 50 attorney generals come together, 50 attorney generals send a strong message to Google. And I'm not going to quote Joe Biden, but I am going to tell you it's a big deal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: Paxton saying he won't say today what legal remedies might come out of this investigation, whether it would be a fine or a restructuring of the company for Google.</p><p>So, really, Google's fate right now is up in the air. But their stock is not really affected by this news today, closing just down a little over a point -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, all the threats about this that have been out there on the federal and global level with the Europeans for months, and barely budging the stock.</p><p>Hillary, thank you very, very much.</p><p>Here to weigh in on this, I'm so happy to see this guy back here to sort this out, is Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>What do you think? Where is this going?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, I will give you two sides to this.</p><p>The Supreme Court has ruled unambiguously that if a set of acts implicates federal law and state law at the same time, there's no impediment to the states investigating the acts at the same time the feds are.</p><p>So that the fact that the feds have threatened in the past and are threatening today Google doesn't stop the state attorneys general from doing so.</p><p>And the states have their own consumer protection laws about how sharp your elbows can be with your competitors -- or -- in this case, they don't have a competitor -- with your customers, the advertisers. And the states have privacy laws.</p><p>So the violation of federal privacy law by Google, whether inadvertent or intentional, could implicate state laws. Well, that's one side of this. The other side of is, these 50 state attorneys general, they're the same ones, not the same human beings, but the same office, that shook down big tobacco in the '90s.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. Right. Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: And what happened there? Two hundred billion dollars was divvied up by all 50 of them. Did it reduce smoking? Did it enhance health? Of course not. It just plugged in the gaps in the budgets that those state governments had.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, is this a quest cynically for money, or is there something more here?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, that's why I give you both sides of the argument. Time will tell.</p><p>But I don't think they're looking for answers. I think they're looking for dollars, which for Google is the easiest thing for it to provide.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, let me -- when you look at Google, it controls virtually nine out of 10 searches you do on a computer.</p><p>The advertising, the digital advertising part of it -- and they own DoubleClick, keep in mind -- that's about half the market. That's just theirs. Facebook, you throw them in, you're well over half.</p><p>So is there a case to be made? They own the Android operating system, ubiquitous on more than half the phone sold in this world, YouTube itself, the video service, on and on.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Here's two questions that both must be answered yes before they can get to first base in a civil or a criminal investigation.</p><p>Has the consumer been harmed? I would suggest the answer is no.</p><p>CAVUTO: The consumer gets all this stuff for free.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Because this is all for free. How could we live without after getting accustomed to it?</p><p>Second question is, is there intentional anti-competitive activity? That's probably what they are looking for. And how could Google be anti- competitive? Well, they might say, might say to their customers, their advertisers, you can't advertise anywhere else. You can only advertise with us, because we want all of your advertising dollars.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: And we provide the means by which you use that advertising, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Correct. That would be anti-competitive.</p><p>On the issue of privacy, I'm laughing. What am I laughing at? The state attorneys general going to go after a company for violating privacy? The 50 of them do more violations of privacy, the people that work for them, than Google ever could.</p><p>CAVUTO: Where do you think this all goes?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Dollars. It will be ended with a settlement. It'll be something larger than that $200 billion, because that was 20 years ago, that the...</p><p>CAVUTO: What if the FTC and Justice Department sort of stick their noses in here?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, then it'll be even more dollars.</p><p>But the last thing Google wants is a trial and a breakup. And they will pay dearly to prevent that from happening. And then 20 years from now, the successors to these 50 people will come after whatever...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: And we will be talking about that too, because we still be in this business, because we love what we're doing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I think we will be here in this studio.</p><p>CAVUTO: Absolutely.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Why are you pointing to the ground?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Do you remember when this used to be a Chinese restaurant?</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, I do. And I was very good waiter.</p><p>All right, Judge, thank you very much.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: You will Google \"wicked smart.\" Just Google \"wicked smart\" right now. I can wait. See that?</p><p>It's the judge's picture.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: We will have more after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, the president isn't even slated to speak at this Fayetteville gymnasium or stadium for another two-and-a-half-hours. It's already filled to capacity.</p><p>What's he doing there and what's at stake when he is?</p><p>After this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right crowds are gathering for an event that is still two-and- a-half-plus hours away.</p><p>The Trump campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, I'm talking about. He is dealing with a growing field of challengers now within the Republican Party for the presidential nomination.</p><p>But that is not an issue for him tonight.</p><p>Jonathan Serrie at the rally that will get everyone's attention, certainly in that neck of the woods, tonight.</p><p>Hey, Jonathan. How is it looking there?</p><p>JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Neil.</p><p>Well, Neil, talking about those potential competitors, after Mark Sanford announced that he was throwing his hat in the race, President Trump wasted no time attacking him over an extramarital affair that made headlines 10 years ago.</p><p>Mr. Trump took to social media, tweeting: \"When the former Governor of the great state of South Carolina Mark Sanford was reported missing, only to then say he was away hiking on the Appalachian Trail, then was found in Argentina with his flaming dancer friend, it sounded like his political career was over. It was. But then he ran for Congress and won, only to lose his reelection after I tweeted my endorsement on Election Day for his opponent. But now take heart. He is back and running for president of the United States. The three stooges, all badly failed candidates, will give it a go.\"</p><p>Sanford has yet to respond directly to the president's latest tweets, but he says he's entering the race to foster a national debate on America's debt, deficits and spending.</p><p>Before departing for North Carolina, President Trump took a question on whether he'd agreed to debate any of the three Republicans running against him. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: They're all at less than 1 percent. It's a -- I guess it's a publicity stunt. We just got right a little while ago 94 percent popularity or approval rating within the Republican Party.</p><p>So, to be honest, I'm not looking to give them any credibility. They have no credibility.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SERRIE: But Mark Sanford insists that competition helps the nation and ultimately The Republican Party -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Jonathan, I just want to be clear. The president is criticizing Terry Sanford for an extramarital affair?</p><p>SERRIE: Mark Sanford, yes, an extramarital affair that went public 10 years ago.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK. Mark Sanford, I should say. All right, just want to be clear.</p><p>All right, meanwhile, the president says these challengers to the Republican Party are irrelevant. He is including in that Joe Walsh and Bill Weld and Mark Sanford. So that's his view of things and dismissing it.</p><p>And given his very high approval within the Republican Party, it doesn't appear like he has too much to worry about.</p><p>Let's get the read from Karl Rove on all this.</p><p>Karl, what do you think?</p><p>KARL ROVE, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: No, I don't think he has much to worry about.</p><p>Look, Joe Walsh was a one-term congressman from Illinois. He endorsed a white supremacist who was running in a primary challenge to Paul Ryan. He was a shock jock on radio. He's not going to go anywhere.</p><p>Mark Sanford was a capable governor of South Carolina who blew himself up over an affair with an Argentinean while he was governor, saying he was on the Appalachian Trail.</p><p>You got to contrast yourself with an incumbent. And on Sunday, he was talking about humility and character. And neither one of the -- none of those things talk to character.</p><p>Bill Weld, wonderful governor of Massachusetts, did a terrific job, resigned in order to become Bill Clinton's ambassador to Mexico, and that was in 1997.</p><p>And then he ran for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016. So he'd been really essentially out of Republican politics for more than two decades.</p><p>I don't see any of these three being able to put together the resources, the message and the presence to challenge the president in any of these early contests.</p><p>CAVUTO: What is your read about some who strike out of the blue? Or, obviously, George Bush Sr. didn't envision that type of potency -- populist potency that a Pat Buchanan, for example, had.</p><p>ROVE: Yes. Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: But, barring that, what do you see here?</p><p>ROVE: Well, look, you're right.</p><p>Unless there is some dramatic issue that inserts itself into the campaign and some charismatic individual who has a record of current involvement in the party and the ability to sort of say, I am different and stronger and better than Donald Trump, there's not going to be a serious primary challenge.</p><p>Now, having said that, I hope the president doesn't take this -- I mean, his point about he's very popular among Republicans, yes. But underneath the surface, a large number of Republicans earlier this year and late last year said they were open to a primary challenge.</p><p>And that was an expression of their concern that while they like what the president's doing, they would like him to tweet less and act more presidential.</p><p>And I catch this as I go around the country. People come up. I was in Indianapolis on Friday. People said: I like what the president's doing. But is there any way you can get him to tweet less? And I said, I'm not in charge. Sorry.</p><p>But the president ought to -- he's in good political shape within the party. He'd be in better shape if he understood that there is some disquietude among his supporters about how often he tweets and how he sometimes acts.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, when we see what's happening in the economy, which is still good -- it's slowed down from the momentum it had -- most analysts say it's very unlikely that a recession would be gripping the country by election time. You never know.</p><p>But that that is the wind behind his back here, but the crosswinds are these -- talking about the fairness of that recovery. Are they just whistling Dixie here? What's your sense?</p><p>ROVE: Well, I think they are.</p><p>I think there are three things that are going to deeply affect the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, the economy. If it's good, the Democrats are in trouble, and Trump is in good shape. If it is softening, weaker than it is today, then the president is going to be facing headwinds. And if it goes into recession, he's in trouble.</p><p>The second thing will be the nature of the Democratic candidate. Is the Democratic candidate somebody who says, I have embraced Medicare for all, so I want to abolish your private insurance, I have got some variant of the Green New Deal, I have got free college this, free that, free this, and free that?</p><p>Those -- the more that Democrats sound like that, the worse off they are. But then, finally, the question is going to be, what is the president doing to reassure those suburban Republicans and suburban independents, whom he lost in 2018 in the midterm elections?</p><p>That's why we lost the House and didn't -- we didn't pick up more in the Senate, because we lost strength in the suburbs. And he's got to do something between now and next summer in order to reassure those voters.</p><p>CAVUTO: Karl Rove, thank you, my friend. Good seeing you again.</p><p>ROVE: You bet. Thank you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Congress is back in session, but guess what is as well? Talk of impeachment -- after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Look, the Michael Cohen here and didn't work out the way they wanted. The John Dean hearing didn't work out the way they wanted.</p><p>And, of course, the Bob Mueller hearing and that investigation didn't work out the way they wanted. But that doesn't stop them. They're going to continue to push this ridiculous impeachment narrative.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Republican House Judiciary Committee member Jim Jordan calling out all House Democrats as they unveil a plan to pursue the impeachment today, at least those who are doing that.</p><p>Where is this all headed?</p><p>The Washington Examiner's Kaylee McGhee joins us right now.</p><p>Kaylee, from what I understand, the real focus should be on what the House Judiciary Committee wants to do. And it seems to be within just a breath of beginning -- whether it starts here, I have no idea -- formal impeachment proceedings.</p><p>Do I have that right?</p><p>KAYLEE MCGHEE, THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Right.</p><p>I mean, for months, the Democrats have been talking about impeachment, but that's exactly what it's been, all talk. But now it seems like they're finally getting serious, and they're going to try to do something about it.</p><p>Whether Republicans or Democrats will get on board with that is something that we're going to have to find out.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. They say there are about 100 votes or so for impeachment, again, exclusively among Democrats. But even allowing for the possibly they get up to, I don't know, 125, 130, it's not as if any of that is going to make any progress in the Senate, if they were to get a vote on an article or several of impeachment in the House, right?</p><p>MCGHEE: Right.</p><p>And it'll be interesting to see how establishment Democrats like Nancy Pelosi respond to that, because she's made it clear that she will not get on board with a formal impeachment inquiry until she knows for certain that the Senate will agree with her.</p><p>So, as of right now, it looks like they're going into a divided Democratic Party, especially moving into 2020.</p><p>CAVUTO: So where does this go right now, if you had to take your bets about how many Democrats participate?</p><p>I have been seeing more of the House leadership considering it, if for no other reason than to sort out what committee does what. Let's say Judiciary is pursuing this. Other committees are free to work on issues, I think, as Dan Kildee and others were telling me, that would be the issues that are being raised on the campaign trail, sort of like having their cake and eat it too.</p><p>MCGHEE: Right.</p><p>So, obviously, the more progressive Democrats in the House definitely have been pushing for this inquiry for a long time. And they would like to see a formal impeachment inquiry happen. But what this resolution really calls for is just -- it's laying out the parameters of what a formal inquiry would look like and what regulations that the committees need to follow in order to make that a reality.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, to follow up on what I was saying about Kildee, of course, who is in the leadership of the House, he was telling me over the weekend right now that they just need a point of order here.</p><p>I want you to respond to this. This is from Kildee.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Many of your colleagues in the House are urging moving full steam with impeachment proceedings. How do you feel about that?</p><p>REP. DAN KILDEE (D-MI): Well, I actually think the Judiciary Committee would do everyone a favor if they did provide some order and some structure to these investigations that partly revolve around the potential of impeachment and partly just deal with the general oversight responsibilities that Congress has.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Kaylee, I think what he's saying is, we got to make up our minds here. We can't just tease, tease, tease, right?</p><p>MCGHEE: Exactly.</p><p>The House Democrats, if they want to move forward with this, then they just need to do it. They either need to impeach him or move on. And what I would like to see is just one House Democrat provide a definition of what it is when they say that there is concrete evidence of corruption, crimes and wrongdoing, because, as of yet, we don't have one.</p><p>And without a definition and specific examples to back it up, they're just throwing a bone to the progressive voters and hoping that it motivates them to turn out in 2020.</p><p>CAVUTO: Kaylee, thank you very much for taking the time. Good seeing you.</p><p>All right, in the meantime, relief efforts are picking up in the Bahamas. Now, that is the good news. But something else could be picking up there as well. And that is awful news.</p><p>CAVUTO: Dorian is finally, finally heading out to sea, but not before wreaking havoc, probably most severely in the Bahamas, where relief efforts are intensifying.</p><p>Steve Harrigan now in Freeport, Bahamas, with the very latest.</p><p>Steve, what does it look like there?</p><p>STEVE HARRIGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, one week after the rain stopped here and the storm, you can take a look behind me.</p><p>This destruction is pretty much common in many parts of Freeport right now. And you get no sense that there are government trucks, telephone workers, repairmen, bulldozers. Nothing is really going on.</p><p>So the destruction pretty much sits just as it was a week ago. Instead, people are trying to get out of here, get out as quickly as possible. You can see lines for days for people trying to get on ferries, get on planes.</p><p>Most of them wants to go to Nassau or to the U.S. Some are complaining they lost key documents, passports, visas, police records, in the destruction of the storm.</p><p>Aid is beginning to pour in, USAID $3 million, the Red Cross $2 million. Cruise companies, airline companies all donating as well, but really not making much of a mark here yet.</p><p>The biggest question is the death toll. Officially, it stands at 45. Most Bahamians you speak to think that is just not accurate at all. There are still thousands of people trying to find relatives, loved ones neighbors -- Neil, back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO: So we're looking at a count that risks getting substantially higher?</p><p>HARRIGAN: That's right.</p><p>The Bahamian media puts the number around 3,000.</p><p>CAVUTO: Wow.</p><p>HARRIGAN: But, right now, the official total is 45.</p><p>CAVUTO: Steve Harrigan, thank you. I know you have been in war zones and disasters, and this is a pretty unique development here, Steve in Freeport, Bahamas.</p><p>All right, remember when everyone thought Congress dodged a government shutdown? Yes, well, about that. I hate to break it to you, but they're just back from vacation and they have got 16 working days to avoid a government shutdown.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Congress is back in session. Doesn't have a lot of time, though, to get stuff done, including keeping the government lights on.</p><p>We have got Chad Pergram on Capitol Hill with the very tough timeline.</p><p>What's this all about, Chad?</p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS SENIOR CAPITOL HILL PRODUCER: Well, they have to fund the government by the 30th of September.</p><p>There was just a meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Senate Minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, Nita Lowey, over on the Senate side.</p><p>What we're looking at here is some sort of an interim spending bill, which would probably keep the government funded until late November. We have heard some different dates batted around, but nothing is concrete.</p><p>And, again, the Senate, they're going to try to move four individual bills. But the House is not interested in touching any of those bills. They're going to try to do just an interim bill to keep the lights on.</p><p>Here is that the flash point here. They never quite know how this is going to go with President Trump. Is he going to get incensed over impeachment and investigations? Could that be a wild card on this?</p><p>And, also, Chuck Schumer, he didn't take a question about whether or not they would try to put any gun legislation and attach it to those appropriations bills later this year. He didn't want to have any part of that. And he sidestepped that question when he was asked about that just a few minutes ago.</p><p>So that's going to be the key issue here and whether or not there will be restrictions put into these bills, maybe to keep the President Trump from moving money around willy-nilly for his border wall.</p><p>And I got a little bit of news here about firearms. They just had a press conference about trying to pressure Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, to move guns. He gave his initial speech on the Senate floors for the first time since they came back. He didn't mention guns.</p><p>And Nancy Pelosi said the following -- quote -- \"We will make this issue too hot to handle. Mitch McConnell and Republicans will have hell to pay.\"</p><p>That is her quote -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, these 12 spending bills, they all need to be done. In other words, if you got 10 or 11 out of 12, that's not going to do it, right?</p><p>PERGRAM: That's right.</p><p>The House has passed 10 of the 12, so they would have to do those two individual ones, but that's not going to happen. They're going to glom them all together.</p><p>And, remember, this budget accord that they reached back in July, that doesn't spend any money. That just sets the overall spending parameters for the next two years. You're dealing with live ammo when you're doing an appropriations.</p><p>That actually spends the money down to the nickel, and they have to resolve that. And the problem for defense hawks, Neil, is, if they don't work out something for the Pentagon, they have the most to lose.</p><p>There was a little bit of a good agreement from both sides there on defense spending. And if you go with the C.R. and interim spending bill, well, the Pentagon, they have uncertainty, and they lose money under that type of arrangement.</p><p>CAVUTO: So the odds of them getting all this done, how would you handicap it?</p><p>PERGRAM: Well, usually, they can come to terms pretty quickly here.</p><p>Mitch McConnell said they're going to work out those spending bills.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>PERGRAM: But this is probably going to be a punt into the fall. That's going to be the problem.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Thank you, my friend, very, very much.</p><p>PERGRAM: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Chad Pergram in the middle of all that.</p><p>We will be monitoring all that and market reaction to that, as the battle ensues, that, of course, on FOX Business, much more.</p><p>Here's \"The Five.\"</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

Prices for stocks, bonds and gold all made several U-turns after Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave a highly anticipated speech. In it, he essentially said the Fed may continue efforts to prop up the economy even if inflation rises above its target level of 2 percent, as long as it had been weak before then. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The Fed's change in strategy is a big deal for markets. The central bank has rescued them from crises through the years, by slashing short-term interest rates and buying all kinds of bonds. The announcement was widely expected on Wall Street, if not on Thursday then later this year, but trading was nevertheless erratic following it.</p><p>  The Dow Jones industrial average rose 160.35 points, or 0.57 percent, to 28,492.27. The Nasdaq composite fell 39.72 points, or 0.34 percent, to 11,625.34.</p><p>  The benchmark S&amp;P 500 gained 5.82 points to 3,484.55 to set a record for the fifth straight day. It's surged nearly 56 percent since late March after the Fed helped erase its pandemic losses. Low rates often act like steroids for stocks, allowing their prices to rise faster than corporate profits.</p><p>  Treasury yields fell immediately after Powell began talking, but then started bouncing up and down. The yield of the 10-year Treasury was at 0.74 percent after stocks stopped trading, up from 0.68 percent late Wednesday. The 30-year yield climbed to 1.50 percent from 1.41 percent.</p><p>  Shorter-term Treasury yields were more subdued, and the two-year yield held at 0.14 percent. The widening gap between short- and longer-term yields could be an indication of higher expectations for the economy or inflation among investors.</p><p>  Gold for delivery in December settled at $1,972.50 per ounce. Lower Treasury yields can drive demand for gold from investors seeking safety but not interested in the lower interest payments coming from bonds.</p><p>  Earlier in the morning, a report showed the pace of layoffs sweeping the country remains incredibly high but may be slowing. A little more than 1 million U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, which was a decline from the slightly more than 1.1 million the prior week.</p><p>  In another report, the government said the economy looks like it shrank at an annual rate of 31.7 percent in the spring quarter. That would be the sharpest quarterly drop on record, but it's not as bad as the Commerce Department's estimate of 32.9 percent.</p><p>Abbott Laboratories jumped 7.8 percent for one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;P 500 after regulators gave emergency use authorization for its Covid-19 test, which can provide results in 15 minutes and will cost only $5.</p><p>  Stocks of companies that need people looking to get back to ''normal'' life were also strong. Live Nation Entertainment rose 8.8 percent, Norwegian Cruise Line was up 5.9 percent and United Airlines rallied 5.8 percent.</p><p>  Financial stocks had the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the S&amp;P 500, up 1.7 percent. A higher 10-year Treasury yield allows for higher rates on mortgages and other loans, which boosts profits for banks. JPMorgan Chase gained 3.3 percent, and Wells Fargo rose 2.3 percent.</p><p>  Counterbalancing those gains were losses for some big tech and internet companies, which gave back some of their slingshot, earlier gains. Apple slipped 1.2 percent. It's coming off four straight weeks where it rocketed up by 3 percent to 14.7 percent.</p><p>  Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 35 cents to $43.04 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 55 cents to $$45.09 a barrel.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-121231200828</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60PF-R681-DXY4-X2H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"628\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/business/sp-500-ticks-up-as-era-of-easy-money-looks-set-to-last.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/business/sp-500-ticks-up-as-era-of-easy-money-looks-set-to-last.html</url><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 28, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0001WOB</classCode><className>ABBOTT LABORATORIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>NAICS339113 SURGICAL APPLIANCE &amp;

The melt-up continues: S&amp;#38;P futures rose on Monday for the eighth session in a row alongside European markets, after setting fresh all time highs on Friday amid continued bets on prolonged central bank support, setting the benchmark S&amp;#38;P 500 for its best August in over three decades.    The three main US indexes are set for their fifth straight monthly rise following this year's March lows, with the S&amp;#38;P 500 looking at its biggest percentage rise in August since 1984, even as economic data pointed to an uneven recovery from the steep downturn. Among early movers, Aimmune Therapeutics more than doubled premarket after Swiss food group Nestle offered to pay $2 billion for full ownership of the peanut allergy treatment maker to expand its fast-growing health science business.  Apple gained 1.5% to $126.64    while Tesla initially spiked to a new all time high, rising to $470 before reversing, as both stocks became less costly after their pre-announced stock splits took effect. </p><p>   Shares of the Cupertino company, which have rallied nearly 30% since it announced its surprise 4-for-1 stock split and blockbuster quarterly results on July 30, were priced at $126.56, up 1.4% when compared to Friday's split-adjusted close, in pre-market trade. It will be Apple's latest stock split since a 7-for-1 move in 2014 and its fifth since going public in 1980. Apple shares closed at $499.23 before the split on Friday, up 70% this year, a rally which helped the iPhone maker overtake Saudi Aramco as the world's most valuable publicly listed company and become the first publicly listed U.S. company to breach $2 trillion in market capitalization.  Tesla followed suit earlier this month by announcing a 5-for-1 split to portion its richly valued stock into smaller chunks, which also takes effect on Monday. Tesla's stock has surged more than five-fold this year, while shares of General Motors and Ford Motor declined on fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Shares of Tesla, up 61% since it announced what is its first stock split in mid-August, closed at $2,213.4 on Friday. They were priced up 2.33% at $453 when counted at their post-split value in pre-market on Monday.  The unprecedented surges driven entirely by stock split news have stunned market watchers because while in theory no new value was created, the fact that \"more\" retail daytraders can now purchase the stocks was seen as a catalyst to push them higher, even though online brokerages Robinhood, Charles Schwab Corp and Fidelity, along with several smaller shops, have begun offering slices of individual shares.  In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.5% as of 10:30 a.m. in London, with automakers and energy shares advancing the most among sectors. Mining shares also outperformed along with utilities including Suez SA, which jumped after anapproachby rival Veolia Environnement SA. The Stoxx Europe 600 Oil &amp;#38; Gas Index gained as much as 1.5% to lead gains among sectors as the price of Brent crude price climbed to the highest since early March with traders focusing on demand recovery. European energy gauge extends gain in Aug. to 5.7%, after retreating 5.4% in July. London markets are closed for a public holiday  Earlier in the session, Asian stocks fell, led by communications and IT, after rising in the last session. Japanese stocks outperformed peers in Asia, the Topix Index gaining 0.8%, bolstered by Berkshire Hathaway's purchase of stakes in five major trading companies in one of billionaireWarren Buffett's biggest investments in the nation. Aside for Japan, most markets in the region were down, with Jakarta Composite dropping 2% and India's S&amp;#38;P BSE Sensex Index falling 1.6%. Trading volume for MSCI Asia Pacific Index members was 22% above the monthly average for this time of the day. The Topix gained 0.8%, with Artra and Segue rising the most. The Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.2%, with Zoy Home Furnishing and Tibet Tourism posting the biggest slides.  Chinese economic activity continued to rebound in August as the world's second- largest economy emerges from the virus slump. The August Manufacturing PMI from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) signaled a continued recovery in overall activity. The NBS manufacturing PMI stayed solid at 51.0 in August (despite being 0.1pp lower than July). The NBS non-manufacturing PMI rose in August as the services PMI climbed to the highest level since early 2018. The construction PMI was modestly lower but remained strong in absolute terms.  China official NBS manufacturing PMI: 51.0 in August (GS forecast: 51.1, Bloomberg consensus: 51.2), vs. 51.1 in July.  Official non-manufacturing PMI: 55.2 in August, vs. 54.2 in July.

The pound weakened versus the euro after anews reportsaid U.K. Treasury officials are pushing for significant tax increases. The country's stock and bond markets are closed for a public holiday.

ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.1%) were both positive but with gains in Australia's benchmark capped by mixed fortunes among the mining names and varied data releases, while sentiment in Tokyo was buoyed after stronger than expected Industrial Production which showed the largest M/M increase on record and on hopes of political continuity after reports that staunch Abe loyalist and current Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga is to run in the LDP elections to succeed PM Abe. Furthermore, the biggest gainers in Japan have been the largest general trading companies after Berkshire Hathaway acquired at least a 5% stake in the industry leaders including Itochu Corp. (8001 JT), Marubeni Corp. (8002 JT), Mitsui &amp;#38; Co. (8031 JT), Mitsubishi Corp. (8058 JT) and Sumitomo Corp. (8053 JT). Hang Seng (-1.0%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) also conformed to the upbeat tone despite mixed PMI data in which headline Manufacturing PMI missed expectations although remained in expansionary territory, while Non-Manufacturing PMI was the highest since January 2018 and Composite PMI also improved. There was a slew of earnings from China including the Big 4 banks which all showed weaker profits and China's largest oil company Sinopec posted its first loss since 2003, although the weaker results failed to dent the risk appetite with the relevant companies all sitting on respectable gains, while concerns regarding the sale of TikTok after China tightened tech export rules were also brushed aside. Finally, 10yr JGBs were initially lacklustre and briefly slipped below 151.50 with demand for bonds subdued by the heightened risk appetite in Japan, although downside was later reversed amid the BoJ presence in the market for JPY 870bln of JGBs predominantly focused on 1yr-5yr maturities.

Note, UK markets remain closed on account of Summer Bank Holiday. Sectors trade modestly higher across the board with a mild cyclical/value bias; utilities are the marked outperformer on the back of Suez (+18.8%) after Veolia (+3.4%) is offering to purchase ~30% of the group from Engie (+6.3%) for EUR 15.50/shr, amid speculation, since confirmed, that such a move would be a precursor to launching a takeover bid.

In fact, the Greenback on a firmer footing vs most G10 counterparts and the DXY has bounced from a 92.142 low to 92.480 at best awaiting comments from Fed's Clarida and Bostic alongside the Dallas Fed manufacturing business index for any further opinion on the new flexible average inflation targeting regime.  JPY - Not quite zero from hero, but the Yen has retreated further from post-Abe peaks amidst reports that staunch supporter and current Cabinet Secretary Suga is in the running to become new LDP leader. Usd/Jpy is now nudging through 105.90 and also taking on board remarks from another challenger to takeover as PM, as Ishiba contends that there is no need to radically change Abenomics or monetary easing, adding that a weaker Yen is not preferable in his view.  GBP - The next weak major link, and perhaps the Pound is taking note of Brexit news and media speculation suggesting that the UK is prepared to walk away from negotiations with the EU if Brussels does not back down on its demand for alignment with state aid rules. Cable is struggling to keep hold of 1.3300, albeit with volumes lighter than normal due to the August Bank Holiday.  AUD/NZD/EUR - Also unwinding recent gains/outperformance vs the US Dollar as the Aussie fades ahead of 0.7400 in wake of mixed data (Q2 business inventories fell 3 times more than forecast, but company profits rebounded from -7.5% to +15%) and pre-RBA, while the Kiwi has stalled around 0.6750 following deteriorations in ANZ business sentiment and the activity outlook. Elsewhere, the Euro is straddling the 1.1900 handle amidst benign German state, Spanish and Italian national CPI data, but also wary of hefty option expiry interest at the strike in 1.5 bn.  CAD/CHF - The Loonie is bucking the broad trend and holding 1.3100+ status against the backdrop of firm crude prices and awaiting Canadian data in the form of building permits and ppi, while the Franc is meandering between 0.9050-25 after an acceleration in Swiss retail sales and not really hindered by latest increases in bank sight deposits.  SCANDI/EM - The aforementioned buoyancy in oil and no change in daily FX purchases by the Norges Bank for September appear to be underpinning the Nok, while the Try has derived some support from Turkish GDP defying expectations for a steeper contraction and the Cnh via another firmer PBoC Cny midpoint fix rather than somewhat mixed official Chinese PMIs.  In commodities, WTI Oct and Brent Nov futures continue grinding higher in early European trade as the benchmarks remain supported by overall sentiment. An uptick in prices coincided with source reports that UAE's ADNOC are reportedly to cut October crude oil term supplies to Asia customers by 30% across all grades. In terms of Gulf of Mexico developments, BSEE estimates of shut in for Gulf of Mexico production at 69.76% vs. Prev. 82.13% following Hurricane Laura. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs which anticipates Brent prices to reach USD 65/bbl by Q3 next year. WTI Oct has tested USD 43.50/bbl to the upside (vs. low USD 42.90/bbl), whilst Brent Nov is yet to convincingly breach USD 46.50/bbl after printing an overnight base at USD 45.80/bbl. Elsewhere, spot gold falls victim to the firming Dollar and trickles lower from overnight highs of USD 1976/oz closer towards USD 1950/oz. Spot silver conversely remains supported around the USD 27.75/oz area. In terms of base metals, Shanghai copper posted its fifth consecutive month of gains - with robust construction and infrastructure activities keeping the red metal buoyed.

Or will it?<br/> Those worries start with a potential loss of trust in some US companies that have a vast global reach, and are cooperating with NSA requests for information. Among the prominent names named are Google(NASDAQ:GOOG[1]), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB[2]), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT[3]) and Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO[4]).<br/> Further, they include concerns about the fast-growing enterprise cloud computing business, which depends on a reputation for absolute security of private data.<br/>Google, Microsoft and Apple(NASDAQ:AAPL[5]), all names that have popped up in the NSA spy story, are on the long list of competitors for enterprise cloud computing clients. Some much younger American companies are growing with the industry, too: A new report from Forbes[6] shows that some lesser-known names have been performing better than big tech in the cloud space so far this year.<br/> So, some of the latest developments in the spy story must come as a relief, including the following:<br/> A report in the publication Der Spiegel over the weekend revealed that the German government is cooperating[7] with NSA data requests on a \"no questions asked\" basis. So much for Chancellor Angela Merkel's denunciation of the program as \"Cold War tactics,\" not to mention her demand for an explanation from the US.<br/> The source of the report in Der Spiegel was the talkative Snowden, who in fact said that \"most Western states\" are cooperating with the NSA, not just Germany.<br/> The French newspaper Le Monde reported late last week that the French government has been collecting[8] data on its own citizens' phone calls, emails and social media activity. <br/>So, it looked like American companies could at least argue that they were no more or less vulnerable to government snooping demands than any others. At least, that was the case until Sunday.<br/> That was the day the Washington Post published a report, based on \"top-secret documents,\" alleging that the US and British governments have \"direct access\" to servers[9] operated by Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, and Facebook through a program called PRISM. AOL (NYSE:AOL[10]) and privately-owned PalTalk also were named in the report.<br/> The distinction is crucial. The companies have acknowledged complying with specific requests for information. Googleeven has a public \"Transparency Report\"[11] that tracks the numbers on user data requests.<br/> But the companies have flatly denied permitting server access to the US government, or anyone else. Googlehas posted a new denial[12], and executives of other tech companies named in the Post story followed in an article published in the British newspaper The Guardian[13].<br/> The denials have the proper note of indignation-more than one said they had never even heard of any program called PRISM.<br/> Suspicious minds have pointed out before that the companies would be prohibited from commenting about their participation, by the same secrecy laws that enable the programs to operate.<br/> In fact, the story of the NSA spying operation is all about the potential impact on suspicious minds.<br/> The story broke at a particularly poor time for Googleand other US companies, as the European Union has begun to finalize its expected update to privacy rules related to Internet data collection.<br/> The tech companies and their clients have expressed concerns that the new rules will place onerous restrictions on data tracking and gathering. Those practices are the commercial lifeblood on the Internet, as they're used to target and deliver advertising and direct marketing messages to the right audiences.<br/> Behind the scenes, the threat of burdensome regulation might not be that dire.<br/> Privacy advocate Simon Davies, who was commissioned by the EU to assess its privacy proposal, has instead posted a shockingly blunt public denunciation of the plan[14] in its latest form. He blames intensive lobbying by US corporations, with help from the \"business-friendly\" British and Irish governments, for the watering down of the proposed privacy protections. It was, he concludes, \"a vast stitch-up to kill the reforms.\"<br/> There's even a bright side there, in a Monty Python-ish way. GigaOm speculates that all these privacy worries could create whole new industries-or at least give a boost[15] to new ventures aimed at providing \"private cloud\" services.<br/> [1]: <url

The fine, part of the fallout of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, was remarkable in only one sense: for something with a $US100 million ($144 million) price tag, it was thoroughly unremarkable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That same day, the US Federal Trade Commission also fined Facebook 50 times as much for the same scandal, a record $US5 billion, and forced the social media company to institute systemic changes so it finally might make good on previous undertakings to fix its privacy settings. Also that same day, Facebook announced that it was being investigated by the FTC for antitrust violations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The day earlier, the US Department of Justice said that it was conducting an anti-trust review of Big Tech, looking to see whether companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple were abusing their market power.</p><p>All this came on top of a (EURO)1.5 billion ($2.4 billion) fine in March, and another (EURO)4.3 billion fine last June, levied against Google by the European Union for various antitrust abuses.</p><p>It's a sign of an industry in permanent crisis when a $US100 million fine seems like the very least of its woes.</p><p>And this week, Big Tech's permanent crisis came to Canberra.</p><p>On Friday, the federal government released the long-awaited findings of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's 18-month-long Digital Platforms Inquiry - one of the first regulatory inquiries in the world to investigate the market power of the online platforms Google and Facebook, with respect to their influence on the media and advertising landscape.</p><p>The ACCC found that, despite Google's and Facebook's protestations that they don't have market power due to the range of alternatives available to consumers, the two companies do indeed wield considerable market power.</p><p>Its final Digital Platforms Inquiry report recommended a range of measures to curb that power, including the formation of a new division inside the ACCC that would have the power to oversee the algorithms Google, Facebook and other tech companies use to shape the way advertising and news reaches the public.</p><p>It recommended that Google be forced to change the settings on phones running its Android platform, so that consumers can more readily change the default browser away from Google's Chrome, and the default search engine away from google.com.</p><p>It recommended a code of conduct that would govern the way platforms such as Facebook handle complaints about fake news.</p><p>And it recommended Australia strengthen its privacy laws, placing strictures on the way the tech giants can capture information from the public, and forcing the giants to erase personal information \"without undue delay\" when requested to do so by a member of the public.</p><p>\"The market power of these companies is immense,\" said Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, announcing the findings of the ACCC inquiry.</p><p>\"The world has never seen so much data collected and aggregated among two companies. Our legislative and regulatory framework could not and did not anticipate such a new paradigm: a paradigm which poses real challenges for authorities the world over.\"</p><p>At stake are nearly $9 billion in online advertising revenues, the lion's share of which go to Facebook and Google.</p><p>\"For every $100 spent by advertisers on online advertising, excluding classifieds, $47 goes to Google, $24 to Facebook and $29 to other participants,\" Frydenberg said.</p><p>At stake, too, is the influence which those platforms have on the way Australians consume their news, and on the very news they consume.</p><p>In its final report, the ACCC cited the findings of a Nielsen Digital Panel from February, which looked at how Australians across all demographics spent their time looking at the internet on phones, tablets and PCs.</p><p>More than one fifth of time, some 2.5 per cent, was spent looking at Google. Another 18.5 per cent of time was devoted to Facebook's various apps, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger.</p><p>Only 2.3 per cent of time was spent on all major news outlets combined, including Ten, Seven West, News Corp, ABC and Nine, which publishes AFR Weekend.</p><p>\"Australian society, like others around the world, has been impacted by disinformation and a rising mistrust of news,\" the ACCC said in a statement.</p><p>\"The dominant digital platforms' response to the issues we have raised might best be described as 'trust us',\" ACCC chairman Rod Sims said.</p><p>But there's something else at stake, too. Something more fundamental. It's the very way tech companies are perceived in the world, and how they are taxed and regulated as a result.</p><p>The ACCC's inquiry, along with the investigations announced this week in the US, asks the question that Big Tech has been trying to avoid since it emerged as a dominant social and economic force in the 1990s.</p><p>Should technology companies be treated for what they say they are, or for what they actually are?</p><p>Tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Uber and Airbnb want to be treated as software platforms, as something essentially new in the annals of business, that gets regulated and taxed in a new way: one that happens to suit their bottom line.</p><p>Uber, for instance, argues it's not a taxi or transport company, but rather claims it's simply an app that helps drivers and passengers connect to each other, allowing it to avoid regulations that usually might apply to transport companies.</p><p>Facebook argues it's not a publisher, and shouldn't be held to the same standards that other publishers are held to. Laws such as copyright and defamation, which restrict traditional publishers, either shouldn't apply at all to Facebook, or in only a very limited way. But, increasingly, regulators around the world have been calling for them to be treated for what they really are: advertising companies, or transport companies, or in Airbnb's case, a property agent.</p><p>In December 2017, the European Court of Justice ruled that Uber really was a transport company and not just a social app for people interested in sitting in cars.</p><p>That same month, the ACCC's Rod Sims made a similar case against Facebook and Google.</p><p>\"They are essentially advertising companies. People think of them differently, but there's no question they're advertising companies, they're trying to tailor their product to advertisers,\" he told The Australian Financial Review.</p><p>Since then, the regulatory tide has been turning against Big Tech.</p><p>In May 2018, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation came into effect, putting limits on the way the tech giants could handle the billions of pieces of information they have collated on the world's population. The new regime also gave people the right to review that information, or have it removed.</p><p>The following February, regulators in German, emboldened by the GDPR, ordered Facebook to separate its Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp apps from one another, despite Facebook's protestations that it's an Irish company for purposes of the GDPR, and should be regulated as such.</p><p>And then, in March this year, Facebook live-streamed the shooting of 100 people in Christchurch, New Zealand, killing 51, in what the terrorist described as a \"real effort\" social media post.</p><p>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern addressed her parliament.</p><p>\"There cannot be the case of all profit, no responsibility,\" Ardern said. \"They are the publisher, not just the postman.\"</p><p>The era of Big Tech getting special regulatory treatment had come to an end.</p><p>One of the ACCC's 23 recommendations called for a \"harmonisation\" of Australia's media regulatory framework, so that Big Tech companies such as Netflix no longer get treated as something inherently different from other media companies that do essentially the same thing.</p><p>Communications Minister Paul Fletcher, who helped launch the ACCC findings alongside Frydenberg, provided an example of how things are set to change for Big Tech.</p><p>\"Free-to-air television networks face regulatory obligations to show a certain amount of Australian content and to pay for that, as do subscription television platforms. But there are no such obligations on internet-based video streaming services.</p><p>\"The ACCC recommends that there's a need to develop a harmonised media regulatory framework to deal with these issues and this is something the government accepts,\" he said.</p><p>Whether that's something Big Tech will accept remains to be seen.</p><p>Digi, the peak body representing US technology companies including Google, Facebook and Twitter, on Friday called on the Australian government to assess the ACCC's recommendations against an \"innovation test\".</p><p>The test would examine how the ACCC's recommendation would \"impact Australia's digital industry at large and Australia's global standing as a place to invest in technology\", Digi said.</p><p>But an innovation test, which by its very definition would seek to treat a company or an industry differently because it was doing something new, is the very thing that regulators around the world have spent the past two years trying to wind back.</p><p>Uber, the European Court of Justice found in 2017, might be something new, but that's no reason not to treat it the same as an old-fashioned transport company.</p><p>Google, as Sims said, might be doing something new in the way it sells ads, but that's no reason not to treat it the same as an old-fashioned advertising company.</p><p>Not everything new is desirable. A terrorist live-streaming the massacre of 51 New Zealanders was an innovation that not even Facebook wants repeated.

People in Sri Lanka seem not to be taken in on all the promises made by the candidates in the Presidential election, this time round?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To be considered good, effective and successful, a President must be a good persuader and be able to deliver.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are three systematic and rigorous dimensions used to measure success.</p><p>First, people evaluate and assess the external factors that the President will face when he takes up office and how well he can deal with those situations, events and crises ahead.</p><p>Next, they examine his ratings in public opinion polls in being able to perform and deliver.</p><p>Finally, they analyse and assess his potential success in implementing his campaign promises.</p><p>External factors</p><p>We in Sri Lanka often give credence to what is of primary importance within the nation. Well, that is not what scholars think it necessary as a measure of success today.</p><p>Of course, we know of three things that come to mind in Sri Lanka as our priorities:</p><p>1. Drug menace</p><p>2. Corruption</p><p>3. Religious extremism</p><p>We tend to think that if the new President is able to initiate change to eradicate or control the above three issues facing Sri Lanka at the present, he could consider himself successful? This premise could be accepted if Sri Lanka can achieve all three issues on its own steam.</p><p>We also note that as a small nation island what happens around our waters affects us in a very serious, if not a subtle way. Why? Today, we have to accept that world events control much of what we can do, more than ever before. We have seen international events, problems can 'drive out' domestic concerns. Thus, salient international events and Presidential action in the foreign arena does enhance the public standing of any President in our island, as well as in the world.</p><p>What are these international forces?</p><p>The international forces that we can anticipate in the next five years will most certainly colour our progress in Sri Lanka.</p><p>First and foremost is the fact that the world may be heading toward its next big slowdown. Downturns historically come about once every decade and it has been more than that since the 2008 financial crisis. Back then, it was the banking crisis. Banks were thought to be too big to fail and wreaked financial havoc on us all. Today, we can be in little doubt that the next big crisis will be different. It is argued that it will emanate from 'Big Tech' which at present is using its lobbying muscle to avoid regulation and thinks it should play by different rules. Because of this the 'wealth divide' has been increased which is driving political populism.</p><p>Our next President has to meet head on the next crisis upon us, which is the deflationary power of technology. This means that all the time technology has driven down the prices of things and has kept interest low. Thus, Central Banks will have much less room to navigate unlike in the past through any upcoming crisis. We in Sri Lanka in the past, have relied more on this method to manage our debt.</p><p>Our new President, whoever he is, will have as his priority how to tackle growing self-regulation, which has become the norm in the world. Risks posed by increased reliance on technology as well as risks to the global economy will become major concerns for us? We need to be prepared to tackle this. For this we need cooperation and forethought.</p><p>Internal factors</p><p>A more aged or ageing population in Sri Lanka than ever before is before us. People in the world and in Sri Lanka are living longer than ever. Which is great, but the downside is all those senior citizens are going to require care at the expense of the younger generation? The new President may have to think seriously about our declining birth rates.</p><p>What about the 'have's and the have nots'?</p><p>The chasm between rich and poor have never mattered more to a Sri Lankan President than now. Solving this level of inequality will be held up as a grand challenge to the incoming President.</p><p>The issue in Sri Lanka is not the existence of unfairness. Some people in the recent past have been treated preferentially and others unjustly.</p><p>First, the idea that people should have equal opportunity in society regardless of their background, race or gender.</p><p>Second, is fair distribution of wealth, which means that benefits and/or rewards should be distributed fairly, based on merit.</p><p>There is much silence about the poverty in the Sinhalese heartlands, rather than in other parts of the land. This must be corrected.</p><p>Finally, the equality of outcome or the fact that people of all races receive equal outcomes regardless of circumstances.</p><p>A tall order for the new President</p><p>The new President has no choice but at the start of his terms to declare war on poverty. The poverty trap has spiralled for far too long and the same people have been poor for far too long.</p><p>The new President must get new minds and put a face on poverty.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLGUAR-SRILAGUARD1011201900006</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLGUAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P9-1Y31-JCH9-G444-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"816\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sri Lanka Guardian All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Sri Lanka Guardian</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18517\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 10, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001371</classCode><className>HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp; ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A51F</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CRISIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000162</classCode><className>BANK FAILURES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000465</classCode><className>DEFLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>STX001347</classCode><className>POLLS &amp; SURVEYS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST0009RX6</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000162</classCode><className>BANK FAILURES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DPKP</classCode><className>BIG TECH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000465</classCode><className>DEFLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>GC381</classCode><className>SRI LANKA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

But this is how bad the situation has gotten.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is the ugly conundrum of the digital age: When you traffic in outrage, you get death.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So when the Sri Lankan government temporarily shut down access to American social media services like Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube after the bombings there on Easter morning, my first thought was \u201cgood.\u201d </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good, because it could save lives. Good, because the companies that run these platforms seem incapable of controlling the powerful global tools they have built. Good, because the toxic digital waste of misinformation that floods these platforms has overwhelmed what was once so very good about them. And indeed, by Sunday morning so many false reports about the carnage were already circulating online that the Sri Lankan government worried more violence would follow.</p><p>It pains me as a journalist, and someone who once believed that a worldwide communications medium would herald more tolerance, to admit this \u2014 to say that my first instinct was to turn it all off. But it has become clear to me with every incident that the greatest experiment in human interaction in the history of the world continues to fail in ever more dangerous ways.</p><p>In short: Stop the Facebook/YouTube/Twitter world \u2014 we want to get off.</p><p>[Kara Swisher answered questions about this column <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1120773846091563009\">on Twitter</url>.]</p><p>Obviously, that is an impossible request and one that does not address the root cause of the problem, which is that humanity can be deeply inhumane. But that tendency has been made worse by tech in ways that were not anticipated by those who built it.</p><p>I noted this in my very first column for The Times almost a year ago, when I called social media giants \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/opinion/the-expensive-education-of-mark-zuckerberg-and-silicon-valley.html\">digital arms dealers of the modern age</url>\u201d who had, by sloppy design, weaponized pretty much everything that could be weaponized.</p><p>\u201cThey have weaponized civic discourse,\u201d I wrote. \u201cAnd they have weaponized, most of all, politics. Which is why malevolent actors continue to game the platforms and why there\u2019s still no real solution in sight anytime soon, because they were built to work exactly this way.\u201d</p><p>So it is no surprise that we are where we are now, with the Sri Lankan government closing off its citizens\u2019 access to social media, fearing misinformation would lead to more violence. A pre-crime move, if you will, and a drastic one, since much critical information in that country flows over these platforms. Facebook and YouTube, and to a lesser extent services like Viber, are how news is distributed and consumed and also how it is abused. Imagine if you mashed up newspapers, cable, radio and the internet into one outlet in the United States and you have the right idea. </p><p>A Facebook spokesman stressed to me that \u201cpeople rely on our services to communicate with their loved ones.\u201d He told me the company is working with Sri Lankan law enforcement and trying to remove content that violates its standards. </p><p>But while social media had once been credited with helping foster democracy in places like Sri Lanka, it is now blamed for an increase in religious hatred. That justification was behind another brief block a year ago, aimed at Facebook, where the Sri Lankan government said posts appeared to have incited anti-Muslim violence.</p><p>\u201cThe extraordinary step reflects growing global concern, particularly among governments, about the capacity of American-owned networks to spin up violence,\u201d The Times reported on Sunday.</p><p>Spin up violence indeed. Just a month ago in New Zealand, a murderous shooter apparently radicalized by social media broadcast his heinous acts on those same platforms. Let\u2019s be clear, the hateful killer is to blame, but it is hard to deny that his crime was facilitated by tech.</p><p>In that case, the New Zealand government did not turn off the tech faucets, but it did point to those companies as a big part of the problem. After the attacks, neither Facebook nor YouTube could easily stop the ever-looping videos of the killings, which proliferated too quickly for their clever algorithms to keep up. One insider at YouTube described the experience to me as a \u201cnightmare version of Whack-a-Mole.\u201d</p><p>New Zealand, under the suffer-no-foolish-techies leadership of Jacinda Ardern, will be looking hard at imposing penalties on these companies for not controlling the spread of extremist content. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/world/australia/social-media-law.html\">Australia already passed such a law</url> in early April. Here in the United States, our regulators are much farther behind, still debating whether it is a problem or not.</p><p>It is a problem, even if the manifestations of how these platforms get warped vary across the world. They are different in ways that make no difference and the same in one crucial way that does. Namely, social media has blown the lids off controls that have kept society in check. These platforms give voice to everyone, but some of those voices are false or, worse, malevolent, and the companies continue to struggle with how to deal with them. </p><p>In the early days of the internet, there was a lot of talk of how this was a good thing, getting rid of those gatekeepers. Well, they are gone now, and that means we need to have a global discussion involving all parties on how to handle the resulting disaster, well beyond adding more moderators or better algorithms. </p><p>Shutting social media down in times of crisis isn\u2019t going to work. I raised that idea with a top executive at a big tech company I visited last week, during a discussion of what had happened in New Zealand.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t shut it off,\u201d the executive said flatly. \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/opinion/letters/letters-to-editor-new-york-times-women.html\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.

But this is how bad the situation has gotten.</p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is the ugly conundrum of the digital age: When you traffic in outrage, you get death.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So when the Sri Lankan government temporarily shut down access to American social media services like Facebook and Google's YouTube after the bombings there on Easter morning, my first thought was \"good.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good, because it could save lives. Good, because the companies that run these platforms seem incapable of controlling the powerful global tools they have built. Good, because the toxic digital waste of misinformation that floods these platforms has overwhelmed what was once so very good about them. And indeed, by Sunday morning so many false reports about the carnage were already circulating online that the Sri Lankan government worried more violence would follow.</p><p>It pains me as a journalist, and someone who once believed that a worldwide communications medium would herald more tolerance, to admit this - to say that my first instinct was to turn it all off. But it has become clear to me with every incident that the greatest experiment in human interaction in the history of the world continues to fail in ever more dangerous ways.</p><p>In short: Stop the Facebook/YouTube/Twitter world - we want to get off.</p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Kara Swisher answered questions about this column </emphasis>on Twitter<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">.</emphasis>]</p><p>Obviously, that is an impossible request and one that does not address the root cause of the problem, which is that humanity can be deeply inhumane. But that tendency has been made worse by tech in ways that were not anticipated by those who built it.</p><p>I noted this in my very first column for The Times almost a year ago, when I called social media giants \"digital arms dealers of the modern age\" who had, by sloppy design, weaponized pretty much everything that could be weaponized.</p><p>\"They have weaponized civic discourse,\" I wrote. \"And they have weaponized, most of all, politics. Which is why malevolent actors continue to game the platforms and why there's still no real solution in sight anytime soon, because they were built to work exactly this way.\"</p><p>So it is no surprise that we are where we are now, with the Sri Lankan government closing off its citizens' access to social media, fearing misinformation would lead to more violence. A pre-crime move, if you will, and a drastic one, since much critical information in that country flows over these platforms. Facebook and YouTube, and to a lesser extent services like Viber, are how news is distributed and consumed and also how it is abused. Imagine if you mashed up newspapers, cable, radio and the internet into one outlet in the United States and you have the right idea. </p><p>A Facebook spokesman stressed to me that \"people rely on our services to communicate with their loved ones.\" He told me the company is working with Sri Lankan law enforcement and trying to remove content that violates its standards. </p><p>But while social media had once been credited with helping foster democracy in places like Sri Lanka, it is now blamed for an increase in religious hatred. That justification was behind another brief block a year ago, aimed at Facebook, where the Sri Lankan government said posts appeared to have incited anti-Muslim violence.</p><p>\"The extraordinary step reflects growing global concern, particularly among governments, about the capacity of American-owned networks to spin up violence,\" The Times reported on Sunday.</p><p>Spin up violence indeed. Just a month ago in New Zealand, a murderous shooter apparently radicalized by social media broadcast his heinous acts on those same platforms. Let's be clear, the hateful killer is to blame, but it is hard to deny that his crime was facilitated by tech.</p><p>In that case, the New Zealand government did not turn off the tech faucets, but it did point to those companies as a big part of the problem. After the attacks, neither Facebook nor YouTube could easily stop the ever-looping videos of the killings, which proliferated too quickly for their clever algorithms to keep up. One insider at YouTube described the experience to me as a \"nightmare version of Whack-a-Mole.\"</p><p>New Zealand, under the suffer-no-foolish-techies leadership of Jacinda Ardern, will be looking hard at imposing penalties on these companies for not controlling the spread of extremist content. Australia already passed such a law in early April. Here in the United States, our regulators are much farther behind, still debating whether it is a problem or not.</p><p>It is a problem, even if the manifestations of how these platforms get warped vary across the world. They are different in ways that make no difference and the same in one crucial way that does. Namely, social media has blown the lids off controls that have kept society in check. These platforms give voice to everyone, but some of those voices are false or, worse, malevolent, and the companies continue to struggle with how to deal with them. </p><p>In the early days of the internet, there was a lot of talk of how this was a good thing, getting rid of those gatekeepers. Well, they are gone now, and that means we need to have a global discussion involving all parties on how to handle the resulting disaster, well beyond adding more moderators or better algorithms. </p><p>Shutting social media down in times of crisis isn't going to work. I raised that idea with a top executive at a big tech company I visited last week, during a discussion of what had happened in New Zealand.</p><p>\"You can't shut it off,\" the executive said flatly. \"It's too late.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006472350</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYC-PVD1-DYR7-C3V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"924\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The FSB is an international body that monitors the global financial system.</p><p>Randal Quarles, chair of the Financial Stability Board</p><p>Source: Associated Press</p><p>Big tech firms' speed, efficiency and ubiquity may allow them to offer financial services in a more convenient way or at a lower cost to consumers, he said, but there could be other repercussions.</p><p>\"Technological innovation offers the promise of a substantially more efficient financial system. But new systems, processes and types of businesses will bring with them novel fragilities,\" he said in a speech hosted by the ECB.</p><p>Substantial impact</p><p>He warned that the impact of the biggest tech companies could be very substantial indeed.</p><p>\"As they are only dipping their toes into the edges of the financial services water, the effects they have on the provision of financial services could grow enormously if they were to dive in   [or cannonball],\" he said.</p><p>The growth in fintech has seen a move towards decentralization, as participants in financial markets were directly connected, said Quarles, who is also vice chair for supervision at the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.</p><p>Its potential is broad for settling interbank payments, verifying and reconciling trade finance invoices, and keeping an audit trail to deter money laundering, he said. But new technologies also bring potential risks and the FSB would put significant resources into understanding these developments.</p><p>\"To be clear, we are not trying to oppose innovation, because innovation, including fintech, offers the world many potential benefits ... However, we have to work to ensure that we can reap the benefits offered by these new technologies without harming financial stability,\" he said.</p><p>Quarles also warned that new forms of interconnectedness between shadow banking firms   lenders that are not regulated like banks   and the banking system had emerged that could increase risk in the financial system. Shadow banking now accounted for just under 50% of total global financial assets, a share that has grown nearly 5 percentage points since 2009, he said.</p><p>Though Quarles said shadow banking provided a valuable alternative to bank financing and helped support real economic activity, he warned that it also often featured high leverage, opaque structures, and maturity and liquidity mismatches. The FSB promotes the resilience of shadow banks through its policies and worked alongside other standard-setting bodies like the Basel Committee to monitor those policies, as well as producing an annual report on the issue.</p><p>'Too big to fail'</p><p>Quarles also said the FSB would examine the effectiveness of the reforms introduced in the wake of the financial crisis to deal with 'too big to fail' banks   those that investors think would receive support from their governments if they became distressed.</p><p>\"We must ask ourselves, how effective have we been at reducing the problem of 'too big to fail'? Have we achieved our objective to reduce or eliminate the problem? Have we introduced new unintended risks to the financial system or costs to other financial market participants?\" he said.</p><p>The FSB had taken steps to deal with such institutions including the introduction of a total loss absorbing capacity standard for banks along with its bail-in strategy, whereby investors' funds can be used to support the bank in a crisis so taxpayers are not affected.

The FSB is an international body that monitors the global financial system.</p><p>Randal Quarles, chair of the Financial Stability Board</p><p>Source: Associated Press</p><p>Big tech firms' speed, efficiency and ubiquity may allow them to offer financial services in a more convenient way or at a lower cost to consumers, he said, but there could be other repercussions.</p><p>\"Technological innovation offers the promise of a substantially more efficient financial system. But new systems, processes and types of businesses will bring with them novel fragilities,\" he said in a speech hosted by the ECB.</p><p>Substantial impact</p><p>He warned that the impact of the biggest tech companies could be very substantial indeed.</p><p>\"As they are only dipping their toes into the edges of the financial services water, the effects they have on the provision of financial services could grow enormously if they were to dive in   [or cannonball],\" he said.</p><p>The growth in fintech has seen a move towards decentralization, as participants in financial markets were directly connected, said Quarles, who is also vice chair for supervision at the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.</p><p>Its potential is broad for settling interbank payments, verifying and reconciling trade finance invoices, and keeping an audit trail to deter money laundering, he said. But new technologies also bring potential risks and the FSB would put significant resources into understanding these developments.</p><p>\"To be clear, we are not trying to oppose innovation, because innovation, including fintech, offers the world many potential benefits ... However, we have to work to ensure that we can reap the benefits offered by these new technologies without harming financial stability,\" he said.</p><p>Quarles also warned that new forms of interconnectedness between shadow banking firms   lenders that are not regulated like banks   and the banking system had emerged that could increase risk in the financial system. Shadow banking now accounted for just under 50% of total global financial assets, a share that has grown nearly 5 percentage points since 2009, he said.</p><p>Though Quarles said shadow banking provided a valuable alternative to bank financing and helped support real economic activity, he warned that it also often featured high leverage, opaque structures, and maturity and liquidity mismatches. The FSB promotes the resilience of shadow banks through its policies and worked alongside other standard-setting bodies like the Basel Committee to monitor those policies, as well as producing an annual report on the issue.</p><p>'Too big to fail'</p><p>Quarles also said the FSB would examine the effectiveness of the reforms introduced in the wake of the financial crisis to deal with 'too big to fail' banks   those that investors think would receive support from their governments if they became distressed.</p><p>\"We must ask ourselves, how effective have we been at reducing the problem of 'too big to fail'? Have we achieved our objective to reduce or eliminate the problem? Have we introduced new unintended risks to the financial system or costs to other financial market participants?\" he said.</p><p>The FSB had taken steps to deal with such institutions including the introduction of a total loss absorbing capacity standard for banks along with its bail-in strategy, whereby investors' funds can be used to support the bank in a crisis so taxpayers are not affected. However, these developments had yet to be tested.</p><p>\"We must be conscious that we have not actually tested the failure of a large bank in the marketplace   surely a good thing,\" he said</p><p>The FSB will produce a consultative report on its findings next year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLFIN-50834574</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLFIN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSV-8K51-JDVW-N193-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360249</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Financial Services Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 29, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

But new technologies also bring potential risks and the FSB would put significant resources into understanding these developments.</p><p>\"To be clear, we are not trying to oppose innovation, because innovation, including fintech, offers the world many potential benefits ...

Shadow banking now accounted for just under 50% of total global financial assets, a share that has grown nearly 5 percentage points since 2009, he said.</p><p>Though Quarles said shadow banking provided a valuable alternative to bank financing and helped support real economic activity, he warned that it also often featured high leverage, opaque structures, and maturity and liquidity mismatches.
