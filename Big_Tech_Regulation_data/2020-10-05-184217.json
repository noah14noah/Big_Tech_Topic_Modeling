Facebook executive David Marcus will testify before the Senate banking committee today and the House Financial Services committee on Wednesday, according to a report[1] by CNN.The Senate hearing will likely focus on data privacy concerns with Libra, while Marcus will attempt to explain how the cryptocurrency works and would protect user's data.Democratic senators and representatives have argued that Libra will make Facebook too powerful or would compromise the Fed's ability to handle monetary policy.\"They're motivated by one thing: surely their own bottom line,\" Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democratfrom Ohio, said last week. \"Allowing Big Tech companies to take over the payment system or position themselves to influence monetary policy would be a huge mistake.\"Marcus, however has said that the Libra Association, \"has no intention of competing with any soverign currencies or entering the monetary policy area.\" Topics: Bitcoin[2], Mobile Payments[3], Regulatory Issues[4]Companies: Facebook[5]Sponsored Links: Related ContentLatest Content [ 1]: </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/16/tech/libra-facebook-senate-hearing/index.html\">https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/16/tech/libra-facebook-senate-hearing/index.html</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/topics/bitcoin/\">https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/topics/bitcoin/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/topics/mobile-payments/\">https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/topics/mobile-payments/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/topics/regulatory-issues/\">https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/topics/regulatory-issues/</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/companies/media/facebook/\">https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/companies/media/facebook/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-NWMG1183021563290749626251766100215</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWMG-118302</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK9-8CN1-F03R-N564-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"272\"/><timeReceived>3:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Mobilepaymentstoday.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for you now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The traders are back on Wall Street, but the selling continues, and it is pretty grim, so those of a nervous disposition looks the other way. Down two percent for the Dow Jones, the big board, which is the broader stocks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All the major indices are lower. The triple stack is off as well with the largest losses being seen on the tech stocks. NASDAQ is down 3.5 percent. We will explain that. That look at the underlying stocks in those indices on the Dow 30, and you see Boeing down five percent, Apple down five percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We will understand. We will get to the reasons why on exactly what's going on tonight.</p><p>Tech stocks, they are stuck in a selloff mode. It is the third straight day of loss for the NASDAQ. There are technical and underlying reasons.</p><p>Highly charged sessions for two companies, both taking from the name Nikola Tesla. We will understand that, too.</p><p>And South Africa's economy suffers its worse quarter in decades. It is down nearly 20 percent if not more.</p><p>We are live from London on Tuesday, it is September 8th. I'm Richard Quest, and I mean business.</p><p>A very good day to you. Good evening to you wherever you are joining me this evening. A terrible day for stocks. As I showed you in the opening, all the major indices are sharply lower and there is very little enthusiasm for buying at the moment.</p><p>It is the technology stocks that seem to be pushing the market down hardest. That's ignoring Boeing, but that has unique factors that we will come to in just a moment.</p><p>The losses across all indices, and oil, which is significant is down nine percent. That is going to be a demand-led fall rather than supply-led as we saw a couple of weeks ago with the hurricanes.</p><p>There is no hiding place either. Tesla, just have a look at Tesla, now, bearing in mind that during the month of August, it rallied up -- not rallied, it roared more than 80 percent. Tesla is now down as much as 18 percent at the moment. That followed the S&amp;P 500 Index Committee opting against its inclusion.</p><p>Elon Musk has tweeted \"A la guerre comme a la guerre.\" It is the French historic tradition that roughly translates to all is fair in love and war. There is no love lost it seems at the moment. \"A la guerre comme a la guerre.\" Sounds good.</p><p>Quincy Krosby is Chief Market Strategist at Prudential joins me now. All right, the markets are being routed, Quincy. But it has to be seen in context, I realize, with the great run-up that we saw in August.</p><p>Now, I am guessing the run-up wasn't really justified and this is sort of putting things right.</p><p>QUINCY KROSBY, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, PRUDENTIAL: Well, yes. I mean, you have a relentless move higher. It was dramatic, and now we know one of the major underpinnings for that move was call buying that we saw from the big whale, $50 billion worth from Softbank.</p><p>We don't know how many other whales there are, but what happens is, Richard, that when you have that, you are working with a broker/dealer selling you those options, call options on the thought that your stocks that you bought the options on will move higher.</p><p>What happens then is that those broker/dealers usually buy that underlying stock as a way to hedge. So you have that going on.</p><p>And then, in addition to that, we have inexperienced traders hoping to make a killing. They did, but they went in for too much and kept going and going. They have gotten killed.</p><p>And then what happens with any kind of selloff like this is, one, you are looking for more whales or little baby whales. And then you are also looking at the margin calls. Those who borrowed money in order to join this relentless move higher. They are under fire now.</p><p>And what happens in that in real life is, I will sell whatever I can sell to meet that margin call.</p><p>QUEST: All right. Now, Quincy. Is it believed that Softbank, I mean, if they took -- if they made the call option and then they bought the underlying security, then they've covered or at least hedged.</p><p>But is it believed they may have lost money on all of this?</p><p>[15:05:03]</p><p>KROSBY: Yes, well, they did lose money. They did lose money on it. You see their share prices being battered. Then, again, the question is, how many others have been doing this?</p><p>You know, there is an old expression from Wall Street, Richard. Money goes to where it is best treated, until it isn't, and that leads to that relentless buying until something comes along that stops it. That's what has happened.</p><p>And the market was overbought. It was extended. You began to see call buying outnumber buying, which means I am protecting the downside.</p><p>We began to see the idea of, you know, going in and shorting the market. Everyone just caved.</p><p>You mentioned Tesla. The analysts that were the most bearish on Tesla actually caved. They wound up just giving up. That ultimately, from a contrarian standpoint, we were due for this kind of selloff.</p><p>QUEST: But, Quincy, I have an element -- forgive me, in my voice, if you hear an element of exasperation bordering on anger that, you know, the economy's market players here, the economy is not in good shape.</p><p>There is no vaccine yet, and it will be months before it is in full throttle. The Fed has changed its inflation, but the Fed is still pumping money into the economy. So the Fed is the major player in town.</p><p>The last thing we need is traders playing shenanigans with the market.</p><p>KROSBY: Well, yes. But the fact is they always do. The problem is, as you know, Richard, all of these products -- we haven't even gone into the products that are filled with leverage, that now are also being unwound.</p><p>Sometimes people think they are smarter than Mother Nature. They think they are smarter than the market, and then they get caught. It always happens.</p><p>We are not through with this. The unwinding is going to continue until the market just is oversold, the air comes out, and then we start to see buyers come into these very stocks.</p><p>They are good companies. They are companies that make money. They are companies that have a buzzing resume.</p><p>QUEST: But.</p><p>KROSBY: It is crazy -- yes.</p><p>QUEST: If we are looking, though, to trade the value of the stocks in terms of the economy, because, as we look towards the winter, and we look to the difficulty BS that we are going to be seeing if there is a resurgence, where do you place the market?</p><p>I mean, it's been clearly overbought as against the economy, where do you place it now vis-a-vis the real economy?</p><p>KROSBY: Well, what is going to happen as is the tech names become oversold, buyers will go in there. Why? Because they are growth names and they actually made money. The valuations were thrown out the window. No one cared about valuations, and you see what happens.</p><p>However, this isn't 1999 when it was only about tech names. You have got -- how about consumer staples? Clorox? You have got SPAM, Hormel, that's the mother company. Campbell Soups. That's the other side of the equation, the other side of the barbell.</p><p>You also have material names moving higher. The weaker U.S. dollar has been helping. The turnaround in China has been helping. And you also have consumer discretionary names.</p><p>Some of those companies that are associated with the housing boom in the United States. They have been doing well. But you can't beat the market capitalization of these big tech names.</p><p>Over in NASDAQ, you have Tesla. Obviously, they are not in the S&amp;P 500. They make up -- the six names make up about 50 percent of the NASDAQ has unbelievably gone higher.</p><p>Money will go back into those names when the share prices come down if -- if the economy is not healing and if we don't have the vaccine on the horizon.</p><p>QUEST: How good to have you with us tonight, Quincy, to make sense of it all. I really appreciate it. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>KROSBY: Thank you so much.</p><p>QUEST: And we will talk more, and we will keep on top of this.</p><p>Now, the other big, extraordinary story today in the business world. Nine of the world's top vaccine makers came together to write a letter and in doing so, a warning to governments not to start using their vaccines until they are properly safe.</p><p>They are the world's largest pharmas, and they are usually fierce competitors. You see the names there on the screen. Now, they are saying they promise to uphold high ethical standards and will only release vaccines under sound scientific principles.</p><p>It follows Donald Trump's suggestion of a vaccine before the election.</p><p>[15:10:12]</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are going to have it soon. Wait a minute. So now what they are saying is oh, wow, this is bad news. President Trump is getting this vaccine in record time.</p><p>By the way, if this were the Obama administration, you wouldn't have that vaccine for three years, and you probably wouldn't have it at all.</p><p>So we are going to have a vaccine very soon, maybe even before a very special date. You know what date I am talking about.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: So that indication that there would be some sort of emergency authorization has clearly helped to prompt the vaccine makers. Let's review where they all stand the moment.</p><p>This is the state of the vaccine race, so to speak, at the moment. According to the data from the \"New York Times.\" Now, more companies are entering the fray. Sanofi and GSK are in Phase 1. In Phase 2, we have old friends Novavax and Johnson &amp; Johnson. There are 14 in Phase 2.</p><p>And in Phase 3, the names we have heard again and again -- Moderna, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, all of them of course are part of Operation Whale -- sorry, the U.S. one, which is under way at the moment where they are buying billions and billions -- Operation Warp Speed -- of vaccines to be given in the future.</p><p>BioNTech's chief executives has told CNN that the companies won't be swayed by politics. There was an exclusive interview with Fred Pleitgen at a time when everybody is saying they will go along with an October surprise for the presidential election.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UGUR SAHIN, CEO, BIONTECH: It has an excellent profile, and I consider this vaccine as a vaccine which is near perfect, which has a near perfect profile. We have done preclinical experiments. We have shown that this vaccine is able to protect animals from infection in really tough challenge experiments, and they have, of course, done much more, more testing than we have published so far, and this provides us a lot of confidence in combination with the understanding of the mode of action, in combination with the safety data coming in from the running trial.</p><p>Yes, we believe that we have a safe product and we believe that it will be able to show efficacy.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: You are not in any rush to bring it on the market either, right? Because I mean, as we have said, something like this should never be rushed.</p><p>Because right now in politics, people are talking about the end of October. Everything has to do with the American election. But you guys are just focused on the science.</p><p>SAHIN: Yes, there is no other way. We are considering all options how development can be accelerated. So we have, for example, implemented 24/7 research program. Really ensuring that we don't lose any time.</p><p>We are corroborating with the authorities who help us to review our documents including the safety data almost in real time to ensure that there is no time lost. But we will not make any shortcuts.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: We have Stephen Collinson is we me. Stephen, the President is clearly hoping somehow to bamboozle with this idea of an October surprise on vaccines. It won't work if the vaccine companies won't play along?</p><p>STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: That's right. I think, Richard, what the President wants to do, clearly, is to give everybody hope, a way out of this nightmare that he has not been able to chart so far and to distract of course from his rather disastrous handling of the pandemic.</p><p>Now, of course, he doesn't have the power to force these companies to apply for authorization. What people are worried about, though, and what this crisis has borne out is that the regulatory authorities in the U.S. the F.D.A., health authorities like the C.D.C. have proven that they are vulnerable to political browbeating by the President.</p><p>We saw with hydroxychloroquine. We saw with it convalescent plasma. So, I think that is the level of concern. It is not that there is distrust of the companies or even the lower down the chain scientists in the U.S. or authorities, it's the political appointees who may be persuaded to go along with the President. And of course we have every reason to expect that he will try to pull the wool over the American people's eyes and claim credit for something which, you know, perhaps isn't all there at the time.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but, Stephen, already we know from surveys and polls that Americans are dubious about taking a vaccine that may not be -- I mean, even if all goes according to plan, they are still dubious about the integrity of such a vaccine. Who is going to take it early?</p><p>[15:15:10]</p><p>COLLINSON: That's right. There was a poll recently, a CNN poll which found that 40 percent of Americans are dubious about it. If that was borne out in reality, it would severely cripple the effectiveness of this vaccine which of course is absolutely crucial to ending this pandemic.</p><p>I think also, I think we also have to bear in mind that if Trump announce as vaccine on October 30th, it would mean that 100 million Americans are going to get a jab on November 1st. This is something that is going to take months and months to be able to be rolled out.</p><p>So, I think as much as the President is pushing the vaccine, as much as there are many doubts in the U.S. populace not just about the President's handling of this, but vaccines as a whole, I think the political impact in the end is going to be a lot less sort of significant a few days before the election than many people think.</p><p>QUEST: Stephen Collinson, thank you. Stephen, unfortunately, we weren't able -- we heard what you were saying, but it wasn't a good connection. So, I do apologize to our viewers for that. But thank you, Stephen, it was worth staying with you because of the importance of this.</p><p>Carnival Cruise Lines is going back in business, or at least taking back to the high seas. The first route in some six months, and it is going to be in Italy. The Costa Line will set sail from Sunday. Carnival's stock is down 60 percent. It had been down much more, so a marginal rally, as you can see from the graph there.</p><p>The services announced so far, the Italy-based Costa Line will begin over the weekend. Germany's AIDA Line starts in November. In North America so far, operation is voluntarily suspended along with other major lines until the end of next month at least and that affects those states with major ports. And the season is suspended in South America, 21 to 22 season is though on sale.'</p><p>Australia, Carnival has paused all operations through to the end of the year.</p><p>Arnold Donald is the chief executive of Carnival Cruise. Let's meet him and as they say, Arnold, it is good of to you. Thank you, sir. Good the see you.</p><p>All right, so there is an irony here, isn't there? That the European country that was at the worst of the pandemic at one point is now the country where you feel it is safe enough to begin cruise line cruises again?</p><p>ARNOLD DONALD, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CARNIVAL CORPORATION: First of all, Richard, always good to be with you. So, good to see you.</p><p>Yes, I guess there's a bit of an irony, but at the same time, if you think about it, the pandemic moved from East to West. So, you know, it's not out of the question that resumption would also move from East to West.</p><p>QUEST: If you look at the measures being taken. The tests, which are all understandable, but the tests, the swab tests, essentially everybody on that ship has had a COVID test before the thing sails.</p><p>These are -- and with social distancing, I mean, can you have a good time? Is it worth going to all this testing and trouble for what's a relatively short cruise?</p><p>DONALD: You know, first of all, it is a seven-day cruise. As you mentioned it sailed on September 6th, Costa Deliziosa is our first ship. Costa Diadema will be sailing out of Genoa, I believe on September 19th and the Deliziosa will continue its seven-day sailings out of Trieste. Italian residents only in Italian ports only initially.</p><p>But of course, it is worth it. The guests are still going to have a great time. They are still doing shore excursions. They have to stay on the shore excursions that we define. A lot of testing, of course most of that happens prior to boarding the ship. So once you are onboard, there are additional measures, of course, protocols.</p><p>There is some physical distance, mask wearing in public spaces wherever you can't achieve the physical distancing. There is of course lots of hand sanitizers and other personal hygiene things.</p><p>But the essence is still there. You still can have a good time. You still have great food and great dining. You are still going on excursions and experiencing new places. And it is still a good experience.</p><p>Now, you have to keep in mind, Richard, that the incidence of the COVID-19 is reduced in the Italian population. I mean it is much lower than what it was obviously at the time when Italy was making the news on that.</p><p>QUEST: Right. So this -- it is difficult to overstate the significance in the sense of getting back -- a ship back on the seas. But also, the huge amount that's at stake, God forbid, if anything were to go wrong.</p><p>[15:20:12]</p><p>QUEST: So to that extent, how much of this Italian and German experience is preparing you for the U.S. resumption, whenever that might be?</p><p>DONALD: As you know, more than half our business is from guests from outside the United States. So it is very important to us in that market. That market is a very significant market for us.</p><p>We have nine world-leading cruise line brands, several based in Europe. You mentioned Costa. We just talked it. AIDA, you mentioned earlier, our German line. We also have two, Noordam and P&amp;O, two of our British lines and then some of our U.S. based lines, HollandAmerica and Princess, they also sail lots of European guests.</p><p>So it is really important we do it right everywhere, and so it is not just a matter of testing in the airport later. This is actually, you know, real time experience that's relevant where it is.</p><p>Having said that, I think that, you know, the measures that are being taken are the point in time. So as you know, this virus has evolved. Treatments have evolved. Testing has evolved. Everything is evolving.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>DONALD: And what is working right now literally may or may not be required when it is time to sail in the U.S.</p><p>QUEST: When we spoke earlier in the crisis, there was a distinct flavor of financial crisis as well as the fleet is laid up and questions about the survivability. Can you now say that Carnival, not out of the rough seas but that you are at least financially smooth sailing?</p><p>DONALD: I am sure all of those puns were intended, Richard, knowing you. But the reality is that, we had to raise over $12 billion of new capital to give us a long runway for a pause that could be extended where we have no revenue.</p><p>We have gone through serious cash preservation measures. As you know, this has been devastating for travel and leisure broadly. And certainly, it has been a challenge for the cruise industry.</p><p>But we have raised capital. That gives us a long runway with no revenue through at least 12 months, if not longer and we have taken the other steps to ensure that. So it has been a trying time financially, but we rallied. Our people have rallied. The markets, the investors have rallied with us. The banks have been tremendously supportive, and so we feel financially we are in a position to weather the storm, and we are anxious to get back.</p><p>QUEST: You know, I am sure you found this yourself with sea-faring puns, the moment you start them, you go ever deeper into them and before long, Arnold, you are wondering what on earth you have gotten yourself into and how you are going to dig yourself out.</p><p>Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. Arnold Donald there from Carnival. Arnold was talking about runways, long runways -- but the runways aren't long enough for the aviation industry.</p><p>Alexandre de Juniac, to the continue the puns, the head of IATA, after the break.</p><p>[15:25:49]</p><p>QUEST: IATA, the airline association believes that European flyers can learn to live with the virus. It is calling for a traffic light system to be introduced across the E.U. Red, amber type of system with the green telling flyers when it is safe or when they need to quarantine.</p><p>Data should be shared and quarantines should be the last resort. The industry worldwide is losing a quarter of a billion dollars a day. Alexandre de Juniac is the CEO of IATA, he joins me now.</p><p>Alexandre, I am in the middle of my third quarantine. I am in quarantine here in London because there is no transatlantic corridors. So you must be very frustrated at the inability of airlines to get governments to actually create these corridors necessary.</p><p>ALEXANDRE DE JUNIAC, DIRECTOR GENERAL, INTERNATIONAL AIR TRANSPORT ASSOCIATION: You are certainly right, we are very frustrated. Because you know, we have worked a lot with -- we have convinced government to put together a takeoff set of measures that are now implemented everywhere. But the borders still remain closed.</p><p>Either they are fully closed or you know governments are restricting flights or travel by imposing quarantine, and the quarantine is a clear stop to any travel. Who would like to travel for two weeks, you would have to spend that two weeks in a quarantine in a hotel or whatever --</p><p>QUEST: The British government makes the point that, look, you travel at your own risk. Quarantines are necessary, they say. But your argument is that the way in which these are imposed at very short notice, in draconian ways just basically kills the whole industry.</p><p>DE JUNIAC: That's exactly the point. It kills the industry and what they are saying to governments is, we fully understand that you want to protect your population and to avoid reimporting or importing the virus. We understand that fully.</p><p>And we say to government, there are now processes that should be implemented to reduce significantly, minimize the risk of importing virus by testing passengers. The industry -- the testing industry, the pharmaceutical industry is now ready. They are antigen tests that are ready that are quick, that are scalable, that are produced in very big quantities, millions per day in October. So we will try to discuss and convince government.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>DE JUNIAC: That by testing passengers, they can avoid imposing quarantines.</p><p>QUEST: We have seen a good example of what is going to happen or could happen on the wider scale. The sheer number of jobs that are being lost. Virgin Atlantic manages to get itself refinanced and still has to lose another 1,500 jobs. Is it your fear on travel, aviation and tourism that there will be jobs that will never come back?</p><p>DE JUNIAC: It is a real risk because, you know, there is a very big need for this action because we have no revenues basically or major drop in revenues. So it triggers immediately restructuring plan, layoff, and probably a shrinkage of this industry.</p><p>So in the future, the coming two to three years, it is very likely to happen that the number of companies will reduce. That the size of companies will probably be smaller because they will operate less flights. They will open less routes.</p><p>And at the end of the day, you know, there are two big diseases in that division. First one, for the passenger, there is less connectivity, less choice, less travel, and for the economy. Much less strong, much less fast recovery.</p><p>QUEST: All right. Alexandre de Juniac, your line was just breaking up a little bit there, but we got the -- we certainly got the point Thank you, sir, as always for joining us in -- aviation is a crucial part of QUEST MEANS BUSINESS coverage. And markets, I do need to show you what the markets are doing before we take a short break. They are down heavily. You'll see the numbers on both the Dow which is off nearly 500 points. Nearly just off the worst of the day. Triple stock shows the NASDAQ is down even more. The NASDAQ is down nearly four percent. We will talk more about this as the program goes on. This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS live tonight from London.</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. There's a lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS tonight from London. Another alternative -- the alternative fortunes for the companies named after Nikola Tesla. We'll look at both of them. And Willie Walsh retired today after 15 years. British Airways and IAG. You'll hear his thoughts on leadership from the man who went from the cockpit as a captain to the -- to the boardroom as the CEO. First, though, the news headlines, because this is CNN. And on this network, the news always comes first.</p><p>The Russian media says the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko is blaming the United States for the protests in his country. He says Americans are behind the telegram channels demonstrators are using to gather and communicate. Lukashenko added he has no intention of resigning as protesters have demanded. Russian activists has at least three volunteers got sick after an attack on the Siberia office of the Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. The activists said two men ran into the office and threw a bottle of yellow liquid. The German government says Navalny was poisoned by a nerve agent last month. He's recovering in a Berlin hospital.</p><p>South Africa is condemning U.S. President Donald Trump over allegations in a new book by his former attorney. The Michael Cohen claims Mr. Trump crudely insulted South African President Nelson Mandela, following his death in 2013. A statement from South Africa's ANC Party described Mr. Trump as divisive and disrespective -- disrespectful. The White House has denied the claims.</p><p>[15:35:21]</p><p>South Africa's economy dropped 17 percent in the second quarter, largely, of course, as a result of it being shut down. South Africa also had some rather unusual restrictions, such as a national ban on cigarettes and other such things. Eleni Giokos is our correspondent in Johannesburg, joins me now. Not surprising, Eleni, to see the market -- the drop in GDP by such a large extent. Take me underneath the figures and tell me what they mean.</p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, look, the point here is that it came in worse than anticipated. We constantly revised the number downwards. And the extent of the lockdown is really reflective in that 17 percent contraction in GDP. But importantly, Richard, that South Africa was already in a recession in the first quarter of this year before the pandemic. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of contraction for South Africa, which means that the fundamentals in the country were already questionable before COVID-19 hits.</p><p>And of course, the pandemic has merely exacerbated an already downward trend. We saw big hits on all fronts, manufacturing, construction, you mentioned alcohol and tobacco, that was down 92 percent. And of course, one of the strictest lockdowns in the world was, you know, with an aim to try and curb the spread of COVID-19. South Africa embarked on a very strict lockdown before COVID-19 cases got out of control. They were able to flatten the curve, but then it became a lives lived versus livelihoods conversation. And then, they were an effort -- there was an effort to try and reopen the economy. But then, Richard, we're facing an electricity crisis now. And that basically means hopes for a V-shaped recovery, or at least a straight line up has completely been derailed.</p><p>QUEST: Before just throwing this out to you, you'll have heard what's saying in the news, this story about South Africa and its response to apparently crude comments made by President Trump concerning Nelson Mandela. I mean, you know, whites, blacks, every kind of color and political persuasion in that country reveres the man. What's the mood on that?</p><p>GIOKOS: Yes, I mean, it's been interesting. I was looking at what the Nelson Mandela Foundation came out with, and they actually used a quote by Nelson Mandela, something that President Trump should take into consideration, and he says, \"A good leader can engage in debate frankly and thoroughly, knowing that at the end of he -- at the end, he and the other side must be closer and thus emerged stronger.\"</p><p>So, it was interesting to see not only the government, but also the Nelson Mandela Foundation come back and hit against the news that President Trump had criticized Nelson Mandela, a man that has been revered for reconciliation in South Africa. It's an interesting one. Of course, the White House, as you say, has denied those claims. One to definitely take a look at in terms of relations between the U.S. and South Africa going forward, I would say.</p><p>QUEST: Eleni, thank you. There's much we must talk about in the days and weeks ahead, particularly those electricity cuts and strikes taking place in South Africa. Eleni Giokos in Johannesburg. After the break, it took some time and he stayed longer than he'd intended. Willie Walsh has now finally left the building waterside, no longer the head of IAG. We'll hear his thoughts, though, on leadership from the man who's a leader for many years.</p><p>[15:40:00]</p><p>QUEST: Willie Walsh, the chief exec of IAG, owners of British Airways, Iberia, and other airlines has left the building. He's finally retired several months after he first said that he would. The COVID pandemic forced him to delay his retirement. Willie Walsh has been at the helm of an airline for more than 15 years. First, he was a pilot for Aer Lingus, then chief executive of Aer Lingus before 15 years ago, joining British Airways as the CEO. He put together the group IAG, bringing in other airlines, and now finally says, it's time to go. He spoke to me just before he turned in the keys.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIE WALSH, OUTGOING CEO, INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP: It's a very long time. And to be honest, I never thought I would do that. When I signed up for British Airways, I assumed it would be three to five years, you know, the average tenure of a FTSE 100 CEO is still only five years. So, to have done 15 years, 15 years plus. Yes, it's -- I have to be honest, Richard, it's not what I had expected, but I've enjoyed every minute of it.</p><p>QUEST: The one thing that comes back to me when I review, you know, your time at Aer Lingus, your time at B.A., your time at IAG, you seem to have a -- have a -- have a -- I want to say love of a fight. You closed B.A. in 2010 or the Union's did, and you saw that fight. At Aer Lingus you have problems, work management problems that's an old management, but do you go around spoiling for fights?</p><p>WALSH: Quite the opposite. And you know, I don't believe in looking for a fight, but I've always been clear, I'm not going to walk away from one. So, if you look at my career, you know, yes, I have had a few skirmishes along the way. But not of them started by me. You know, where we face challenge. I've been absolutely clear, you need determination to see your way through, and I think I have that determination. I don't know where it comes from, probably, you know, from my parents, but, you know, I don't look for a fight, but I'm not going to walk away if somebody wants to pick one with me.</p><p>QUEST: There have been times and I'm not being uncharitable here, where you've not exactly been the most popular CEO.</p><p>WALSH: But you don't do this job to be popular, you know? And I've always been clear on that. You know, I realized very early on in my career, that if you were to run your business to satisfy the press or to be popular with people, you would go out of business because it's a -- you know, the airline industry is brutally competitive. And to succeed, you have to be prepared to take decisions that are unpopular. And I think that's what leadership is about. You know, good leaders will face up to difficult challenges.</p><p>I know lots of people who, when it comes to the crunch, don't like to give bad news, and don't like to face difficult decisions. I've never had a problem with that. And that may come from my training as a pilot, you know, where you don't have the opportunity to put everything on hold and wait for people to decide what to do. You have to, as a pilot, and particularly as a captain, you have to be ready to make decisions. And you know, to assess everything quickly, make decisions in the interest of safety and move on. So, yes, you know, I've never sought to be popular and, you know, I'm popular with my friends, but, you know, I probably have fewer than most people.</p><p>[15:45:19]</p><p>QUEST: The ability to drive forward change in the airline industry, which is the most complicated and the capital costs, and all of those sorts of things. Did you ever -- what was your moment of doubt? In 2010, look, you're shaking your head before we've even (LAUGHTER)</p><p>WALSH: No, I've never had any doubts. And you can't, you know, you -- I've been really lucky in my career. You know, I've got to where I am not because I was the best or most-qualified person, but I was the person in the right place, at the right time, and the person who took the risk. Because it's no secret, you know, I became the CEO of Aer Lingus because nobody else wanted the job. You know, other people were offered this, and they turned it down because they saw an airline in crisis that was unlikely to survive.</p><p>So, I became the CEO and that, you know, I'm not trying to rewrite history here. I know myself; I became the CEO because nobody else wanted that job. So, you know, I happen to be in the right place at the right time. And I happen to have the determination to take on a challenge. And, you know, we saw that challenge true, not just me, you know, but working with a team of people. And as you know from my time at Aer Lingus, I worked very closely with two colleagues there, Brian Dunne and Seamus Kearney, the three of us, you know, I think collectively achieved fantastic things at Aer Lingus. And, you know, that's really defined my career, I suppose.</p><p>QUEST: When you sat in exec meetings and your weekly executive meetings, how do you choose between your children? I mean, B.A. is obviously the favorite child since you joined -- you were the CEO there. How did you stop yourself?</p><p>WALSH: I think you have to be disciplined. And, you know, I found it very tough when I became the CEO for Aer Lingus and being the COO, I found it very tough to let go areas of responsibility that I had, but I learned a lot from that. So, the same happened at British Airways, becoming the CEO, and then moving on to IAG, you know, letting go of the responsibility, particularly for operational issues in British Airways. And I think you just have to do that. You have to have good people with you and around you, and you have to trust them. And I've been very, very lucky, you know, to work with fantastic people over the years.</p><p>QUEST: I've read all the comments where you've said, you want to go on holiday, you want to rest, you're going to go and travel and see the places that you've been to but never seen and you're not getting away with that. And what are you going to do next? Rumor is if and when the job at IATA comes up, Willie Walsh is the man.</p><p>WALSH: Well, I can honestly tell you, and you've asked me these questions before. I said I would retire when I finished up at AIG. And as you know, I originally said I was going to retire when I was 55. I'm 58 -- 59 this year, so I've stayed on a lot longer than I had expected. And, you know, I'm not looking to do anything else. I think this is an industry that is fascinating and challenging, but, you know, working 12 hours a day and, you know, it's only five days a week. It was seven days a week for a long time. But you know, it just gets you after a while. And so, I'm looking forward to taking a break.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Taking a break. I give him about six months, maybe a year, I don't know, before we hear what Willie Walsh is up to next. When we come back after the break, I can tell you what (INAUDIBLE) next. Nikola, Tesla, two companies named after him. One called Nikola, one called Tesla, and both having very different reactions on the market. We'll talk about it after the break. It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>[15:50:00]</p><p>QUEST: There are two car companies who are inspired and named after the same inventor, the electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. He lends his name obviously to Elon Musk's Tesla, Inc. But there's also the startup Nikola Corporation, and that makes green vehicles. There you have, Nikola himself. Now, Nikola says, that's the green vehicles, not the man. Badger pickup truck will be ready by 2022. With a battery and the hydrogen fuel cell models. General Motors is to supply the fuel cells.</p><p>Nikola shares were up, or Nikola, it must be Nikola. There we go. Up -- they were up 11 percent on G.M. taking a stake. Tesla's was down 20 percent on woes concerning investors. Paul La Monica is with me. I think it's Nikola, Nikola Tesla. But these two companies, both going in opposite directions, and yet both in the same business.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, clearly, I mean, Tesla had all the momentum, Richard, you had the speculation that it would be added to the S&amp;P 500 Index soon. It's not. We had some new news Friday with the S&amp;P, CA announcing some other constituents and one of them, Etsy, the arts and crafts online retailer. They're being added, but not Tesla. But I think in the case of Nikola, you have a company that is getting the backing of G.M. And that's reminding people that there is a lot of competition in the electric vehicle area.</p><p>You've got Nikola, with G.M. You have Rivian, another hot electric truck company of Lordstown Motors, which is going public as well, not to mention Volkswagen-Toyota, all the major auto companies have realized, they've woken up and found religion in electric vehicles. This isn't going to be just Tesla's market to lose.</p><p>QUEST: Nikola and its trucks will make a wave. But Tesla and its cars are sexy.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think a lot of consumers still like the Model S, the Model X. Those are the ones that are a little pricier, a lot of early adopters buying those. But now you have the Model 3 which is the quote unquote, more affordable Tesla sedan. The model Y SUV is coming. There's the cyber truck, as odd as it may be, may have some fans.</p><p>And keep in mind, Richard, too, Tesla with its stock pulling back in the past couple of days, it's still up more than 300 percent in 2020. So, Elon Musk isn't exactly poor as we know, because he's rocketed up the Forbes and Bloomberg ranks like the World's Wealthiest People because of his investment.</p><p>QUEST: OK. So, Elon Musk's cars have split the stock, which is we've talked about on this program, is a clever way of sort of making it look less valuable. So, people in retail investors will buy it. But the run up was unjustified. I sort of always wonder where is fair value for that stock?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think it is hard to say. I mean, to be fair, Tesla has now been consistently profitable for a couple of quarters which is why you had the speculation that it might get added to the S&amp;P 500 soon. But still, you're talking about a P.E. multiple for us old folks who still care about traditional valuations.</p><p>[15:55:10]</p><p>I say that sarcastically, of course, but this is a company that is still trading at an exorbitant premium to other automakers, when you look at its price to earnings ratio, and that does still matter. And I think it just goes to show even though the stock price is cheaper, so to speak, because of the split, you've had the stock fall just going to show that people were willing to buy it when it was in the quadruple digits. They're not willing to buy it now that it's triple digit stock, really shows that it's all about momentum. It's not about what the share price is.</p><p>QUEST: Paul, the Dow is creamed today at two percent. NASDAQ's off the best part of four percent. Is this just a froth of an -- of an unseemly rally that we saw in August? Or is this something more and more going on?</p><p>LA MONICA: I think that it's going to be hard to say just yet because, I mean, I'm not sure what more the Fed can do, the Federal Reserve, to support this stock market. I think investors now are waiting for the prep in Congress to come up with a deal on new stimulus. And that's what might be the second leg to get this rally going again, unless I don't know. I mean, does the Fed go negative? I seriously doubt they cut rates below zero.</p><p>QUEST: No.</p><p>LA MONICA: If the Fed may have to --</p><p>QUEST: No.</p><p>LA MONICA: if it continues to fall.</p><p>QUEST: No, they've said they weren't, but that doesn't mean anything. Paul La Monica, thank you. We'll take a profitable moment after -- we'll take a profitable moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment, Willie Walsh's mantra, when he said tonight about leadership, the outgoing CEO of IAG. He said he didn't become chief executive to be popular. Well, you can certainly say that. If you look back at the strike of British Airways at 2010, which is one of the most bitter, and then you look back at the current -- at this pilot strike at British Airways.</p><p>But he did create an airline group that was amongst the most profitable in Europe, behind Ryanair and certainly, of the three legacies, Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and IAG, be it that the IAG group is the most profitable. But this does beg the question, this idea of strong leadership, the role that's necessary in an industry like aviation.</p><p>In the German market, of course, there's a lot more consensus, but it hasn't stopped (INAUDIBLE) from being very tough with the pilot's union. And if you look at the future direction of running an airline group, IAG now Willie has gone. Well, Luis Gallego has his work cut out for him. It's one of the most profitable, but it has deep-seated problems at British Airways with industrial relations, (INAUDIBLE) pilots can be truculent too.</p><p>And what do you do about level, the long -- for the long haul, low cost carrier. Willie Walsh was one of those characters you enjoyed interviewing every time. He's that sort of colorful character that will be missed. And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in London. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's profitable. The market is heavily down. You might want to look the way at the closing bell rings.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020090801cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T1-V8K1-JB20-G3TG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7110\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 8, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

It is not looking pretty. Now signs are pointing to  a pretty significant loss when the bell rings. So these are the numbers for  you. You look at the Dow Futures, Nasdaq Futures, S&amp;P 500 Futures, all down  by about 0.5 percent. </p><p>And it comes as markets in Europe have been showing declines. Let's bring  up those numbers up for you. And you can see additional red arrows. There  you see the FTSE 100 down more than 1.5 percent, the Xetra DAX down 0.9  percent and in Paris, the CAC 40 down by 1.5 percent. </p><p>Meanwhile, markets here in Asia earlier in the day they posted the steepest  losses in global trading. The Nikkei and the Hang Seng dropping close to 4  percent. As for the Shanghai Composite, it lost more than 5 percent. Now,  I'll be speaking with our chief business correspondent, Christine Romans  about all this market uncertainty in just a few minutes from now. </p><p>Now, residents across the southeastern are waking up to asses the damage  from Hurricane Michael's path of destruction. The storm made landfall in  Mexico Beach, Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, the strongest ever to hit  the region. Two storm-related death have been reported including a child. </p><p>Now just look at what these huge winds did to this home in Panama City  Beach. The roof, it was literally ripped off. And now a tropical storm,  Michael is still pummeling parts of Georgia as it heads north towards the  Carolinas. More than half a million customers are without power across  three U.S. states. Erica Hill is in Panama City Beach, Florida where it's  just after 7:00 a.m., and Erica, folks there in Florida waking up to assess  the damage. What are they seeing this day? </p><p>ERICA HILL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  There is a lot to assess, I can tell you.  So we made a good portion of our drive this morning as we headed east in  the dark. And even in the dark it was very clear as we crossed into Bay  County our phones all of a sudden started buzzing with emergency alerts,  but not only there was a curfew in order, there was a boil water alert for  Bay County. </p><p>And we could see very low hanging power lines, downed power lines. There  were entire lamp posts on bridges laying on the bridge, a number of trees  down understandably, pieces of metal from stru8ctures like we're seing  behind me, wrapped around trees. And I just want to step out of the shot a  little bit so we can give you a sense of the damage here. </p><p>So we are at a marina in Panama City Beach on Grand Lagoon. This, according  to Pirate's Cove website is a mega barn that can hold some 450 boats. As  you can see the pieces of metal, it is shredded. Things are literally  turned around, trees on the other side of me. We hear the metal shaking,  moving. There is only a slight breeze right now and you can see inside to  some of the boats. </p><p>What is really remarkable, too, as we look at this and you see the force of  the winds and the strength of this system, as we were driving along this  morning too, it almost felt like we were covering a tornado this morning  because there would be areas that were devastated and right next to them,  entire yards of boats, Kristie, that were untouched. </p><p>There is a lot to assess this morning, people trying to figure out what is  left of their homes. People still trying to reach loved ones, and we'll be  covering a lot more of that for you throughout the day. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, and just look at that apocalyptic scene behind you.  Hurricane Michael certainly left a mark there in Panama City Beach. Erica  Hill reporting live for us. Thank you so much. Now let's bring in CNN  meteorologist Chad Myers. He's standing by for us. </p><p>And Chad, this was a powerful storm. We saw, you know, what happened there  in the live shot right behind Erica Hill. It arrived with a big punch. Walk  us through the damage and also where Michael is now. </p><p>CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Two hundred and fifty kilometers per hour  was the landfall number in a town called Mexico Beach. We can't even get  there. So what you see on the screen behind me and at Panama City Beach is  nothing.  </p><p>[08:05:04] Mexico Beach is gone. All the homes are either damaged or just  gone. The water, the surge, the wind of 250 is equal to a super typhoon  because that starts at 241. So we were higher than what a minimal super  typhoon would be. Tyndall Air Force Base had 209 kilometer wind speed. And  then before they got any further, the wind gauge broke. </p><p>So, we really don't even know if that was ground zero. We don't even know  what the real number there was. So where is it now? Eighty-five kilometers  per hour over Columbia. Now the storm did go right over Augusta, Georgia.  And if that name rings a bell, it's where the Masters is played every year. </p><p>I suspect that there is some damage there as well. It was still a 65  kilometers to 85 kilometers per hour storm then. There are your tropical  storm warnings. They still go on up to the places we talked about so  readily with Matthew. Remember that storm? Matthew put down all the rain  here. In some spots one meter of rain two weeks ago. </p><p>And that water is still trying to go away, still trying to go down the  rivers. And now we're putting more rain on top of that. It does move  offshore. It will affect D.C., Philadelphia, maybe even New York City with  the flights today. If you're in and out of those areas here, any kind of  intercontinental airports probably will start to slow down international  airports because of that rainfall especially later on today. </p><p>Some spots could pick up about 250 millimeters of rainfall. So there it is  right now, heading toward Columbia, South Carolina. Trees are still coming  down on this because the tree roots are completely saturated from all that  rainfall. Remember that one meter of rainfall from the previous storm. So,  even at 85 or 100 kilometers per hour, there are still many, many trees  down. Almost a million people so far without power, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Well, this is a powerful storm, a historic storm. Chad Myers  reporting, thank you. Michael brought incredible storm surge to  Apalachicola, Florida and the mayor of that city, Van Johnson joins us now  on the phone from Destin. And mayor, thank you so much for joining us here.  First, the damage assessment. No doubt you've been getting up to speed on  the devastation delivered by Hurricane Michael. What have you learned? </p><p>VAN JOHNSON, MAYOR OF APALACHICOLA, FLORISA (via telephone):  Yes, I have.  I'm learning that the streets are littered with trees that fell during the  storm, that we're out of power, that there's no electricity. Crews are out  there now still assessing the overall damage. </p><p>We do have a small city crew out there that is trying to remove a lot of  debris out of the roads. So right now, things are just chaotic and we're  just trying to find out what is going on so we can get our lives back to  normalcy as soon as possible. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Absolutely. You know, there was that call to evacuate from the  governor of Florida. You're calling us from Destin. You heeded that call.  You evacuated, but how many people in your community decide not to leave  before the storm? </p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, before the storm, it was probably about 60 percent of the  people decided to stay. As the storm approached and intensified to a  Category 4, people had a change of heart and they started to evacuate. But  about 20 percent of the people stayed there and hunkered down during the  storm even though I was a mandatory call to evacuate from the governor's  office, from the county emergency management office, as well as from my  office. </p><p>LU STOUT:  A number of people, as you said, they decided to stay put. So,  what about rescue operations? Among those who decided to ride out the storm  in their own homes, are they finding themselves in need of rescue? </p><p>JOHNSON:  Not necessarily. I did receive a call from a resident yesterday  saying that a tree had fell down right in the middle of the driveway  (inaudible) and they couldn't get out. But there was nothing at that  particular time we could because we were still under the hurricane and  assessment is under way. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Got you. And I want to ask you about power outages because we're  hearing that close to about half a million customers are without power  across multiple U.S. states. What's the situation in your community? </p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, we have about 2,400 people in Apalachicola and they're out  of power, as well. </p><p>LU STOUT:  OK, got it, sir. Thank you very much indeed for joining us. Van  Johnson, the mayor of that community, hit hard by this storm. We wish you  and your colleagues and the people of Apalachicola there in Florida the  very best as you rebuild. Take care. </p><p>Now, let's return to the state of the markets around the word. You know,  just the storm that's happening there. Wall Street futures all pointing  down. European markets a few hours before they close for the day. We got  CNN's chief business correspondent Christine Romans joining me from New  York now. Christine, welcome back. After that big sell-off yesterday in the  U.S., we're seeing deep falls in markets across Asia and Europe. </p><p>[08:10:02] CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, this  thing has sort of ricocheted around the globe. It was a pretty momentous  decline for stocks in the U.S. quite frankly. I mean, you saw the Dow down  more than 800 points. That's the third largest point drop ever. </p><p>But I want to put it in perspective because percentagewise, that still is  not even the top 20, I don't think. It's not remarkable in terms of the  percentage decline. But what was interesting is that you had just record  highs just a few weeks ago and now you got a reassessment really because of  higher interest rates and concerns about passive (ph) growth and global  growth next year because of the China-U.S. trade war. </p><p>LU STOUT:  And tracking U.S. stock performance, do you think the sell-off  is going to continue, not just for today, but days from now? </p><p>ROMANS:  I think you might see it today at the opening bell. I mean, I've  been watching futures for the past four or five hours and they've been  consistently weak. We'll be looking for some inflation data that comes out  this morning in the United States, morning time. If that shows maybe a  resurgence of inflation, that could be a problem for stocks here. </p><p>But if it shows, you know, benign inflation, then maybe you're going to get  some buying here, some relief. Just have to sort of see how it goes. But I  think what you're really seeing here is this focus on interest rates.  Interest rates have been rising in this country. </p><p>The fed is raising interest rates to try to cool off the red hot economy.  And it's interesting because the president addressed this. The president of  the United States who often uses the stock market as his personal  scorecard, now he's found a scapegoat. Listen. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think the Fed is making a  mistake. They're so tight. I think the Fed has gone crazy. </p><p>The Fed is going wild, I mean, I don't know what their problem is but  they're raising interest rates and it's ridiculous. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>It's interesting this morning. There's a lot of chatter among the Wall  Street watchers and the Wall Street tacticians who say that it might not be  good for the president to be talking down the Fed and scapegoating and  blaming the Fed because, you know, attacks on the Fed aren't necessarily  good for investor confidence either. So, that does not help his case if he  really wants stocks to go up.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes. So what is this going to happen ahead, you know, is this  going to be the end of the bull market or is this a correction albeit a  pretty significant one? </p><p>ROMANS:  So, look, corrections can be good. You know, you still have very  good fundamentals in the American economy. You have still very good profit  growth, although we think that the third quarter could be the peak of  profit growth. So that means next year is going to be a little more tough. </p><p>You see a lot of wild cards in the China trade situation. That is something  that hangs over the market. But nine years into a bull market, you know, is  it the end? Is this sort of like a whimper? No one really knows for sure,  but we do know that the economy is very strong here. Corporate profits  continue to be strong. Economic statics continue to be strong. </p><p>If the Fed can raise interest rates slowly and gradually and not in a  disruptive way, there is really no reason why the economy couldn't take  that. Remember, December's interest rates is sort of the shock absorbers on  a very strong economy. That's a good thing if it's done right. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes, so many factors to consider here as we try to anticipate  what is going to happen next with these markets as they move. Christine  Romans, reporting live from New York. Thank you so much. </p><p>A looming trade war between the U.S. and China, rising interest rates,  those comments from President Trump, the specter of inflation, all this and  more have contributed to this market slump. And that's not lost on the  president of the IMF, Christine Legarde, who is warning against trade  conflicts and currency manipulation. </p><p>She has been speaking in Bali, Indonesia at the launch of an IMF and World  Bank Summit. To discuss all these issues and more, we are joined by Robert  Koepp from the Economist Corporate Network here in Hong Kong. Robert,  welcome back. Good to see you. </p><p>ROBERT KOEPP, DIRECTOR, ECONOMIST CORPORATE NETWORK:  Hi Kristie. Thanks  for having me.</p><p>LU STOUT:  You just heard Christine Romans talk about, you know, the wild  card of U.S.-China trade. Is that the biggest factor here behind this major  global sell-off? </p><p>KOEPP:  It certainly among the chief factors. I'd say the other big factor  is a huge appreciation that we've seen in major tech stocks. So last month  and the month before that, we had Amazon and Apple reach a market  capitalization of $1 trillion, first time ever in history. So, that's  symbolic of what's called the FANG group of companies. Some would also add  FANG plus as one index that measures in addition to that. There is some  Chinese stocks, but big tech has been really overweighted. So that's  another contributing factor. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Got it. Yes, as you said, tech stocks, they have really taken a  particular beating here, you know, to make it a little bit more regional.  The Hong Kong listed tech from Tencent just entered its tenth straight day  of declines. So, is this a correction for the tech sector globally? </p><p>KOEPP:  Yes, I think -- I mean, the correction, there's different ways to  measure it. I think it's certainly a reality check, to put it that way. I  mean, Tencent's been facing regulatory issues in China and then the trade  war contributes to all of this. Apple is very dependent on China's supply  chains.</p><p>[08:15:06] Tencent is exposed to Chinese regulations and so forth so, in  the back drop of the U.S.-China trade conflict, we have these tech  exposures that relate both to this very high valuation and then lots of  things going on within the U.S. and within China relevant to their  valuations. So, that's kind of a complex explanation but it's all  intertwined, to put it that way. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Y es. In fact, the tension between the U.S. and China is  growing. You know, just overnight, President Donald Trump announced new  investment restrictions aimed primarily at China to keep China from getting  access to sensitive American-made technology. </p><p>KOEPP:  Indeed. </p><p>LU STOUT:  What is your thinking about the forecast, you know, the look  ahead for the U.S.-China relationship? </p><p>KOEPP:  It's not looking particularly positive right now. I think the view  in Washington, at least at the White House is that they need to hold their  ground and they are not about to concede until China budges. I would say  that China has been making moves, kind of behind the scenes. </p><p>So like Tesla in July was given permission to build a $10 billion giga  factory. Actually, that's (inaudible) Trump doesn't like but for U.S  business interest, it's a positive sign because it shows Chinese opening  up. That sort of (inaudible) foreign enterprise puts in a lot (inaudible). </p><p>So, there are some positive movements, but until we see kind of  breakthrough maybe a change in the presidency, I don't think U.S.-China  relations economically are going to improve too much. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes. And knowing that and all the other factors weighing on the  markets, how long can we expect this global sell-off to go on? </p><p>KOEPP:  Well, the global sell-off is although related to U.S.-China trade  frictions, they are also, I mean, the investor should be pricing that in.  So I don't think we have to wait for U.S.-China trade relations to improve  before the stock market recoveries. </p><p>Currently based on the data we heard and as Christine was just mentioning,  you know, it's not an absolute plummet of the stock market. So, let's see  how the next few days play out. I would say the main thing to look for are  not only the economic macro fundamentals but company reportings of  earnings. </p><p>So that will be coming out the end of this week and then the next week. If  those are positive actually there is a good chance the stock market will be  recovering. </p><p>LU STOUT:  All right, Robert Koepp, director of the Economist Corporate  Network, always a pleasure to have you here on the program. Thank you. Take  care.</p><p>Now, do stay with CNN for the opening bell on Wall Street. Following  Wednesday's massive loses, get that and more on First Move with Julia  Chatterley. That starts in about 40 minutes from now. And the moment you  could take a look at what to anticipate, there's all down arrows there in  terms of the futures. </p><p>Now, up next, you're watching \"News Stream.\" Two men on board a Russian  spacecraft, they have just gone through what must have been a terrifying  ordeal. We'll tell you what happened that forced the Soyuz to make an  emergency landing. </p><p>Also ahead, President Donald Trump has been speaking about the  disappearance of the missing Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. We'll bring  you the very latest on the search for answers, right here on \"News Stream.\"</p><p>[08:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT:  All right, coming to you live from Hong Kong. Welcome back. This  is \"News Stream.\" What began as a trip to the International Space Station  ended abruptly just a few hours ago with a dramatic emergency landing. The  crew on board the Soyuz, a Russian cosmonaut and a NASA astronaut, they  have survived a hard dusty landing in Kazakhstan. </p><p>They are said to be doing OK. It's an incredible story. We have CNN's Fred  Pleitgen standing by in Moscow with more. And Fred, the crew is alive  despite a very hard landing. This was an extraordinary rescue. </p><p>FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  It certainly was.  You know, this was a major incident obviously for the Russian space program  and obviously in partnership with the Americans as well. But I could have  been so much worse, Kristie. </p><p>We do have the first images that we just got a couple of minutes ago of  these two, one astronaut and one cosmonaut obviously, after they had been  retrieved from that capsule. It shows them on what seems to be two couches  with medical equipment seemingly hooked up to them obviously monitoring  their vital signs. </p><p>Now, the information that we're getting from the Russian side at this  point, they say that both of these astronauts are in good condition. The  latest that I got, just a couple of minutes ago, Kristie, is that they are  currently on a helicopter and they're going from the site where the capsule  touched down back to Baikonur, which is of course Russia's main space  station from where they lift off their rockets into space. </p><p>It's about 250 miles away from where that capsule touched down. Meanwhile,  we're still trying to piece together what exactly happened with that  launch. It seems as though the rockets took off from the Baikonur Space  Station and then about, I'd say a little less than three minutes into the  flight, the crew radioed back and said that there had been a malfunction  with the main booster. </p><p>We've been listening to the radio transmission which was going out live and  it was really amazing to see the professionalism of these two crew members  as they realized their spacecraft was in trouble and that they had to do  something and had to the abort the mission. </p><p>They radioed back that they had separated from the booster rocket and that  they were starting to do what's called a ballistic dissent back towards  Earth which is at a much steeper angle than would usually be the case, much  faster and much more tough also on those astronauts as well. </p><p>And they managed to touch the spacecraft down. Apparently at all times, and  they were conscious and they did have communications back to the main  offices of the Russian Space Administration. There are some NASA folks  there as well. </p><p>And as we said now, apparently right now they're on those helicopters.  They're back on their way to Baikonur and of course pretty much everybody  at NASA and also at the Russian Space Administration, probably a lot of  people around the world breathing a sigh of relief because of course,  Kristie, we've known from unfortunately space disasters that we've had to  report on in the past, how small the margin of error is when you're talking  about space travel, Kristie. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Yes. But I still can't get over the video. This was a stunning  emergency landing. They're back on Earth and they are reported to be in  good condition. Fred Pleitgen reporting live for us in Moscow. Fred, thank  you. </p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump says it appears Saudi Arabia is behind the  disappearance of the missing journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, but it's too  early to talk about America's response. The Turkish government has released  more video it says ties the Saudi state to his disappearance. </p><p>These images first aired on Turkish television, a report that this was the  moment 15 Saudi operatives arrived at Ataturk Airport just hours before  Khashoggi visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and vanished. The Saudi  government denies any involvement. And here is what Mr. Trump had to say. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  This is a bad situation. We cannot let this happen to reporters, to  anybody. We can't let this happen and we're going to get to the bottom of  it. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, CNN's international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, joins  us now from Istanbul. And Nic, what impact will the fate of Jamal Khashoggi  have on Saudi Arabia's international ties especially with the U.S.? </p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITORL:  Well, it is a testing  time for the leadership in Saudi Arabia because the allegations that  they're being exposed to, what Turkish officials say is a murder of Jamal  Khashoggi in the consulate here not long after he walked into it Tuesday of  last week. </p><p>It is a very strong allegation. The turkish authorities are leaking closed  circuit television recordings to media here in Turkey, leaking names of  those 15 Saudi men who arrived in Saudi Arabia around the time that Jamaal  Khashoggi was killed.</p><p>[08:25:02] So the there is a lot of pressure and scrutiny emerging here in  Turkey that's putting end to national pressure on the leadership in Saudi  Arabia to come up with answers. And at the moment, it's a difficult  situation for them because there is no real wiggle room here. </p><p>They had said that they would allow Turkish authorities into the consulate  to, you know, for an examination of it as part of the investigation. That  has been put on hold. The Turks are saying that the Saudis are not  cooperating fully. </p><p>So I think where this leaves the Saudi leadership is in a very difficult  situation where their relationship with their international partners, not  least President Trump and of course with Turkey of being put under strain,  so their credibility in how they answer these very strong accusations is  really going to be tested. And so far, they haven't put forward lines that  have been palatable it seems to those allies around the world. </p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, the pressure continues to build on Saudi Arabia to provide  some real answers. Nic Robertson reporting live for us from Istanbul. Nic,  thank you. </p><p>In an unprecedented move, a Chinese intelligence officer has been indicted  on economic espionage charges and extradited to the U.S. from Belgium.  Yanjun Xu is accused of trying to steal trade secrets from aviation and  aerospace companies in the U.S. </p><p>Just a short time ago, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman called the  accusations, quote, \"pure fabrication.\" The Trump administration has vowed  to crack down on China's theft of intellectual property. Xu faces up to 25  years in prison if convicted. </p><p>China is rejecting criticism after Xinjiang appeared to officially legalize  so-called re-education camps. The camps are for people accused of religious  extremism. Human rights groups have long alleged the Chinese government has  been detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighurs as a largely Muslim  minority in such centers. The rights group say it is an effort to enforce  loyalty to Beijing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU KANG, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN (through translation):  Taking  such measures to prevent and crackdown on terrorism and extremism have  helped preserve stability as well as the life and livelihood of people of  all ethnicities in Xinjiang. These measures are firmly supported by all in  Xinjiang.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Now, just a little over a month ago, authorities in Xinjiang  denied that the camps even existed. You're watching \"News Stream.\" And  still to come, Hurricane Michael is downgraded after devastating parts of  the U.S. Gulf Coast. But this tropical storm is still on the move and it is  carving a path of destruction. </p><p>[08:30:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN NEWS STREAM SHOW HOST:  I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong  Kong. You're watching \"News Stream.\" These are your world headlines.</p><p>The head of Russia' space agency says the crew of the Soyuz spacecraft, a  NASA astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut, have been rescued. The Soyuz was  forced to make an emergency landing in central Kazakhstan after a booster  failure. NASA says the men are in good condition.</p><p>Wall Street opens for business in an hour and it is bracing itself for  another day of heavy losses after stocks stumbled in Asia and Europe on  Thursday. Wednesday saw the third biggest point decline in the Dow's  history and it could get worse in trading today. U.S. President Trump has  blamed the Federal Reserve for the fall.</p><p>We are seeing images of destruction from the island of Mallorca, Spain  where at least 10 people were killed after heavy rain triggered flash  flooding on the island. The water cut off roads and forced schools to  close. Hundreds of emergency responders including members of the military  have been deployed to the scene.</p><p>As morning begins in the U.S. state of Florida, residents are getting a  first look at the devastation left by Hurricane Michael. Dianne Gallagher  is live for us from Panama City. She joins us now. Dianne, we know that the  storm surge ripped apart the Florida coast. What kind of damage have you  seen?</p><p>DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Kristie, I'm going to be  honest, that storm surge ripped apart the coastline here in the panhandle,  but really, I want you to take a look at what the wind did as well.</p><p>Now, remember, Hurricane Michael was just about two miles per hour away  from a Category Five. This was an extremely strong Category Four hurricane.  This is not an uncommon sight here, Kristie. It's an auto facility where  they fix cars, they have parts, things like that, just ripped to shreds by  those winds. We are seeing this on almost every single block in Panama City  here.</p><p>I just went through to a mobile home park, a community right behind this,  to talk to residents. Most of them, Kristie, spent the night through the  hurricane all day in their homes. Now look, these are aluminum metal homes  and the hurricane just shredded them.</p><p>You can see the trees that just fell into them. One home, three trees on  one mobile home. Thankfully, only one foot injury in all of these. At this  point right now because the light has sort of just come with daybreak here,  we are still not entirely sure of exactly how much damage we are looking  at.</p><p>We do know that in the words of Governor Rick Scott of Florida that it is  utter devastation. But just how bad it is right now, Kristie, we are still  not sure. I can tell you that more than half a million people do not have  power as a result of the storm.</p><p>The good news is we have already seen power trucks driving by as soon as  the sun came up. We are also seeing civilians with boats and backhoes and  other types of equipment on the back of their vehicles, towing them around  to go and assist right now.</p><p>There appears to be a dire need of chainsaws, food, and water in these  communities. We are not sure when they are going to get the power back. We  have a boiled water advisory because they are not sure if it is safe right  now for people here.</p><p>And Kristie, this isn't even the worst of it. Down at Mexico Beach which is  about maybe an hour away from here, the flooding there was so severe that  it came up almost to the rooftops of some of the homes there, and they are  just now starting to get into that community as the light has come up to  see how bad this devastation was.</p><p>This was the worst hurricane to hit the panhandle of Florida since they  started keeping records on hurricanes.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Wow! Roof-high flood waters and right behind you. You know, just  looking at the scene there and what you've described for us, just these  fierce winds literally shredding this community apart, we can clearly see  the devastation caused by this hurricane. Dianne Gallagher reporting live  for us. Dianne, thank you.</p><p>You're watching \"News Stream.\" And still to come to CNN, we are going to  take a bite into authentic Hong Kong. It's a place that serves old school  favorites and where some kitchens run 18 hours a day. We're going to take  you to the culinary hot spot that has attracted the likes of our dear  friends, Anthony Bourdain.</p><p>[08:35:00]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT:  All right, coming to you live from Hong Kong, welcome back. This  is \"News Stream.\" Now, this is a full series. It's called \"Smart  Creativity.\" As part of the series this week, we bring you the artwork of  NASA's first ever artist-in-residence.</p><p>Laurie Anderson is the woman behind a lunar landing installation at  Denmark's major contemporary art gallery. It is a virtual reality  experience, allows viewers to explore the surface of the moon, but not just  any moon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAURIE ANDERSON, ARTIST:  I want to walk into work of art and get lost in  it. Every artist from the beginning of time has wanted to come into that  world. VR offers you that in a way that is unique.</p><p>People are attracted to the moon because it presents itself in so many  mysteriously different ways. I'm somebody who wants to lose my body in  works of art that take me out of this place, this body I love. Virtual  reality can do that. This piece is called \"To The Moon.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Now, you are on your way to the moon.</p><p>ANDERSON:  But as soon as you land on the moon, you start seeing all the  constellations. We use the constellations as more or less like drawings of  things we've lost. So, we had things in nature reflect of constellation of  a polar bear and as you look at that polar bear, it dissolves. So, it's  almost like a picture that becomes an idea that just blows away when you  see it.</p><p>Then you also see democracy and if you look at it, you realize all of these  things -- we think it is unstable and so fragile and can be lost. It's not  narrative anymore. It's not linear. It's not contained in the rectangle  that you're looking at.</p><p>The moon is a dream. And so I wanted to push it more in that direction. You  can fly into a graphic representation of a dinosaur made from its own DNA.  Diamonds are falling from the sky, a little nod (ph) to twinkle, twinkle  little star. (INAUDIBLE) flags.</p><p>Also, this -- that was a nod (ph) to the colonization of the moon by  everybody. So, here is a Russian flag, here is an American flag, and  they're being planted around you.</p><p>So you're flying around in this free world. And it is like combination of  hallucination and reality. And so it ends up being this very mysterious  thing, very much like the moon itself. </p><p>A work like this is for me is just a way to encourage people to go, wow,  what is that? To think about it, not just to the world as we see it, but  the beauty of the information that we can't see, the things that we can't  see.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT:  I just love that. Laurie Anderson is the coolest. Now, this  week, CNN is exploring a neighborhood in Hong Kong called Sham Shui Po.  This area serves up some delicious local dishes from street food to bamboo  pole noodles. We visit some of the restaurants to get a taste of some of  the classics of Hong Kong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[08:40:02]  LU STOUT (voice over):  In this bustling neighborhood of Hong  Kong, Hop Yik Tai eatery serves up a local favorite.</p><p>NICOLE FUNG, FOOD AND TRAVEL BLOGGER:  We are in Sham Shui Po and we are  going to eat rice sheet rolls or cheong fun. This place is in a little  alleyway here. This is a really popular Hong Kong street food snack.  They're served differently, but the street food way is just plain but with  bunch of different sauces.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over):  Nicole Fung is a food and travel blogger and comes  to this recommended eatery in Sham Shui Po often.</p><p>FUNG:  Very chewy and very soft. Very healthy. It's just like (INAUDIBLE)  delicious sauce. It's very simple, but very good.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over):  While shoppers might indulge in this area  (INAUDIBLE) markets, for Fung, it is all about finding local culinary  treasures.</p><p>FUNG:  Sham Shui Po is very unique to Hong Kong, so you can get really  classic favorites. </p><p>LU STOUT (voice over):  Classic favorites like tofu pudding.</p><p>FUNG (voice over):  It's really healthy and you can kind of see like --  there's like layers of tofu in here.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over):  Fung says the best in Hong Kong is served here at  the family-owned Kung Wo factory.</p><p>RENEE SO, DIRECTOR, KUNG WO FACTORY:  Actually, our shop has a very long  history, almost 50 (ph) years.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over):  Renee So is the fourth generation to run this  restaurant.</p><p>SO:  We have a kitchen operating 18 hours a day, so we start making the  tofu at 1:00 a.m nonstop until 4:00 p.m. every day.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over):  So says that the number of tourists who visit her  restaurant has increased in the past few years, especially vegans (ph) and  vegetarians interested in soybean products. This might be true for So but  Fung believes it is because of the area's charm.</p><p>FUNG:  I think Sham Shui Po is becoming more gentrified. There's a lot of  like older buildings that are being torn down and then they're building new  buildings so there are a lot of more people coming through.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over):  The area has also attracted food enthusiasts from  across the world. \"Parts Unknown\" featured the famous Lau Sum Kee  Restaurant earlier this year.</p><p>FUNG:  Lau Sum Kee is one of my favorite noodle spots in Hong Kong. They  are known for their egg noodles. Actually, it's called bamboo noodles. They  still make it old school way.</p><p>So the first time I came here was with my dad, as well. This is one of his  favorites. But it's like a classic Hong Kong dish. He's been eating it  since he was a kid.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over):  This is what childhood memories taste like. For  fun, eating at Sham Shui Po reconnects her to her roots.</p><p>FUNG:  Sham Shui Po to me is very authentic. When people want to come visit  Hong Kong, I think they should come to Sham Shui Po because it actually  feels like Hong Kong.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over):  Authentic Hong Kong, certainly a palate teaser.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT:  Did that wet your appetite? It did mine.

It is not looking pretty. Now signs are pointing to a pretty significant loss when the bell rings. So these are the numbers for you. You look at the Dow Futures, Nasdaq Futures, S&amp;P 500 Futures, all down by about 0.5 percent.</p><p>And it comes as markets in Europe have been showing declines. Let's bring up those numbers up for you. And you can see additional red arrows. There you see the FTSE 100 down more than 1.5 percent, the Xetra DAX down 0.9 percent and in Paris, the CAC 40 down by 1.5 percent.</p><p>Meanwhile, markets here in Asia earlier in the day they posted the steepest losses in global trading. The Nikkei and the Hang Seng dropping close to 4 percent. As for the Shanghai Composite, it lost more than 5 percent. Now, I'll be speaking with our chief business correspondent, Christine Romans about all this market uncertainty in just a few minutes from now.</p><p>Now, residents across the southeastern are waking up to asses the damage from Hurricane Michael's path of destruction. The storm made landfall in Mexico Beach, Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, the strongest ever to hit the region. Two storm-related death have been reported including a child.</p><p>Now just look at what these huge winds did to this home in Panama City Beach. The roof, it was literally ripped off. And now a tropical storm, Michael is still pummeling parts of Georgia as it heads north towards the Carolinas. More than half a million customers are without power across three U.S. states. Erica Hill is in Panama City Beach, Florida where it's just after 7:00 a.m., and Erica, folks there in Florida waking up to assess the damage. What are they seeing this day?</p><p>ERICA HILL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There is a lot to assess, I can tell you. So we made a good portion of our drive this morning as we headed east in the dark. And even in the dark it was very clear as we crossed into Bay County our phones all of a sudden started buzzing with emergency alerts, but not only there was a curfew in order, there was a boil water alert for Bay County.</p><p>And we could see very low hanging power lines, downed power lines. There were entire lamp posts on bridges laying on the bridge, a number of trees down understandably, pieces of metal from stru8ctures like we're seing behind me, wrapped around trees. And I just want to step out of the shot a little bit so we can give you a sense of the damage here.</p><p>So we are at a marina in Panama City Beach on Grand Lagoon. This, according to Pirate's Cove website is a mega barn that can hold some 450 boats. As you can see the pieces of metal, it is shredded. Things are literally turned around, trees on the other side of me. We hear the metal shaking, moving. There is only a slight breeze right now and you can see inside to some of the boats.</p><p>What is really remarkable, too, as we look at this and you see the force of the winds and the strength of this system, as we were driving along this morning too, it almost felt like we were covering a tornado this morning because there would be areas that were devastated and right next to them, entire yards of boats, Kristie, that were untouched.</p><p>There is a lot to assess this morning, people trying to figure out what is left of their homes. People still trying to reach loved ones, and we'll be covering a lot more of that for you throughout the day.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, and just look at that apocalyptic scene behind you. Hurricane Michael certainly left a mark there in Panama City Beach. Erica Hill reporting live for us. Thank you so much. Now let's bring in CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. He's standing by for us.</p><p>And Chad, this was a powerful storm. We saw, you know, what happened there in the live shot right behind Erica Hill. It arrived with a big punch. Walk us through the damage and also where Michael is now.</p><p>CHAD MYERS, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Two hundred and fifty kilometers per hour was the landfall number in a town called Mexico Beach. We can't even get there. So what you see on the screen behind me and at Panama City Beach is nothing.</p><p>[08:05:04] Mexico Beach is gone. All the homes are either damaged or just gone. The water, the surge, the wind of 250 is equal to a super typhoon because that starts at 241. So we were higher than what a minimal super typhoon would be. Tyndall Air Force Base had 209 kilometer wind speed. And then before they got any further, the wind gauge broke.</p><p>So, we really don't even know if that was ground zero. We don't even know what the real number there was. So where is it now? Eighty-five kilometers per hour over Columbia. Now the storm did go right over Augusta, Georgia. And if that name rings a bell, it's where the Masters is played every year.</p><p>I suspect that there is some damage there as well. It was still a 65 kilometers to 85 kilometers per hour storm then. There are your tropical storm warnings. They still go on up to the places we talked about so readily with Matthew. Remember that storm? Matthew put down all the rain here. In some spots one meter of rain two weeks ago.</p><p>And that water is still trying to go away, still trying to go down the rivers. And now we're putting more rain on top of that. It does move offshore. It will affect D.C., Philadelphia, maybe even New York City with the flights today. If you're in and out of those areas here, any kind of intercontinental airports probably will start to slow down international airports because of that rainfall especially later on today.</p><p>Some spots could pick up about 250 millimeters of rainfall. So there it is right now, heading toward Columbia, South Carolina. Trees are still coming down on this because the tree roots are completely saturated from all that rainfall. Remember that one meter of rainfall from the previous storm. So, even at 85 or 100 kilometers per hour, there are still many, many trees down. Almost a million people so far without power, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Well, this is a powerful storm, a historic storm. Chad Myers reporting, thank you. Michael brought incredible storm surge to Apalachicola, Florida and the mayor of that city, Van Johnson joins us now on the phone from Destin. And mayor, thank you so much for joining us here. First, the damage assessment. No doubt you've been getting up to speed on the devastation delivered by Hurricane Michael. What have you learned?</p><p>VAN JOHNSON, MAYOR OF APALACHICOLA, FLORISA (via telephone): Yes, I have. I'm learning that the streets are littered with trees that fell during the storm, that we're out of power, that there's no electricity. Crews are out there now still assessing the overall damage.</p><p>We do have a small city crew out there that is trying to remove a lot of debris out of the roads. So right now, things are just chaotic and we're just trying to find out what is going on so we can get our lives back to normalcy as soon as possible.</p><p>LU STOUT: Absolutely. You know, there was that call to evacuate from the governor of Florida. You're calling us from Destin. You heeded that call. You evacuated, but how many people in your community decide not to leave before the storm?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, before the storm, it was probably about 60 percent of the people decided to stay. As the storm approached and intensified to a Category 4, people had a change of heart and they started to evacuate. But about 20 percent of the people stayed there and hunkered down during the storm even though I was a mandatory call to evacuate from the governor's office, from the county emergency management office, as well as from my office.</p><p>LU STOUT: A number of people, as you said, they decided to stay put. So, what about rescue operations? Among those who decided to ride out the storm in their own homes, are they finding themselves in need of rescue?</p><p>JOHNSON: Not necessarily. I did receive a call from a resident yesterday saying that a tree had fell down right in the middle of the driveway (inaudible) and they couldn't get out. But there was nothing at that particular time we could because we were still under the hurricane and assessment is under way.</p><p>LU STOUT: Got you. And I want to ask you about power outages because we're hearing that close to about half a million customers are without power across multiple U.S. states. What's the situation in your community?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, we have about 2,400 people in Apalachicola and they're out of power, as well.</p><p>LU STOUT: OK, got it, sir. Thank you very much indeed for joining us. Van Johnson, the mayor of that community, hit hard by this storm. We wish you and your colleagues and the people of Apalachicola there in Florida the very best as you rebuild. Take care.</p><p>Now, let's return to the state of the markets around the word. You know, just the storm that's happening there. Wall Street futures all pointing down. European markets a few hours before they close for the day. We got CNN's chief business correspondent Christine Romans joining me from New York now. Christine, welcome back. After that big sell-off yesterday in the U.S., we're seeing deep falls in markets across Asia and Europe.</p><p>[08:10:02] CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this thing has sort of ricocheted around the globe. It was a pretty momentous decline for stocks in the U.S. quite frankly. I mean, you saw the Dow down more than 800 points. That's the third largest point drop ever.</p><p>But I want to put it in perspective because percentagewise, that still is not even the top 20, I don't think. It's not remarkable in terms of the percentage decline. But what was interesting is that you had just record highs just a few weeks ago and now you got a reassessment really because of higher interest rates and concerns about passive (ph) growth and global growth next year because of the China-U.S. trade war.</p><p>LU STOUT: And tracking U.S. stock performance, do you think the sell-off is going to continue, not just for today, but days from now?</p><p>ROMANS: I think you might see it today at the opening bell. I mean, I've been watching futures for the past four or five hours and they've been consistently weak. We'll be looking for some inflation data that comes out this morning in the United States, morning time. If that shows maybe a resurgence of inflation, that could be a problem for stocks here.</p><p>But if it shows, you know, benign inflation, then maybe you're going to get some buying here, some relief. Just have to sort of see how it goes. But I think what you're really seeing here is this focus on interest rates. Interest rates have been rising in this country.</p><p>The fed is raising interest rates to try to cool off the red hot economy. And it's interesting because the president addressed this. The president of the United States who often uses the stock market as his personal scorecard, now he's found a scapegoat. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think the Fed is making a mistake. They're so tight. I think the Fed has gone crazy.</p><p>The Fed is going wild, I mean, I don't know what their problem is but they're raising interest rates and it's ridiculous.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>It's interesting this morning. There's a lot of chatter among the Wall Street watchers and the Wall Street tacticians who say that it might not be good for the president to be talking down the Fed and scapegoating and blaming the Fed because, you know, attacks on the Fed aren't necessarily good for investor confidence either. So, that does not help his case if he really wants stocks to go up.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes. So what is this going to happen ahead, you know, is this going to be the end of the bull market or is this a correction albeit a pretty significant one?</p><p>ROMANS: So, look, corrections can be good. You know, you still have very good fundamentals in the American economy. You have still very good profit growth, although we think that the third quarter could be the peak of profit growth. So that means next year is going to be a little more tough.</p><p>You see a lot of wild cards in the China trade situation. That is something that hangs over the market. But nine years into a bull market, you know, is it the end? Is this sort of like a whimper? No one really knows for sure, but we do know that the economy is very strong here. Corporate profits continue to be strong. Economic statics continue to be strong.</p><p>If the Fed can raise interest rates slowly and gradually and not in a disruptive way, there is really no reason why the economy couldn't take that. Remember, December's interest rates is sort of the shock absorbers on a very strong economy. That's a good thing if it's done right.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, so many factors to consider here as we try to anticipate what is going to happen next with these markets as they move. Christine Romans, reporting live from New York. Thank you so much.</p><p>A looming trade war between the U.S. and China, rising interest rates, those comments from President Trump, the specter of inflation, all this and more have contributed to this market slump. And that's not lost on the president of the IMF, Christine Legarde, who is warning against trade conflicts and currency manipulation.</p><p>She has been speaking in Bali, Indonesia at the launch of an IMF and World Bank Summit. To discuss all these issues and more, we are joined by Robert Koepp from the Economist Corporate Network here in Hong Kong. Robert, welcome back. Good to see you.</p><p>ROBERT KOEPP, DIRECTOR, ECONOMIST CORPORATE NETWORK: Hi Kristie. Thanks for having me.</p><p>LU STOUT: You just heard Christine Romans talk about, you know, the wild card of U.S.-China trade. Is that the biggest factor here behind this major global sell-off?</p><p>KOEPP: It certainly among the chief factors. I'd say the other big factor is a huge appreciation that we've seen in major tech stocks. So last month and the month before that, we had Amazon and Apple reach a market capitalization of $1 trillion, first time ever in history. So, that's symbolic of what's called the FANG group of companies. Some would also add FANG plus as one index that measures in addition to that. There is some Chinese stocks, but big tech has been really overweighted. So that's another contributing factor.</p><p>LU STOUT: Got it. Yes, as you said, tech stocks, they have really taken a particular beating here, you know, to make it a little bit more regional. The Hong Kong listed tech from Tencent just entered its tenth straight day of declines. So, is this a correction for the tech sector globally?</p><p>KOEPP: Yes, I think -- I mean, the correction, there's different ways to measure it. I think it's certainly a reality check, to put it that way. I mean, Tencent's been facing regulatory issues in China and then the trade war contributes to all of this. Apple is very dependent on China's supply chains.</p><p>[08:15:06] Tencent is exposed to Chinese regulations and so forth so, in the back drop of the U.S.-China trade conflict, we have these tech exposures that relate both to this very high valuation and then lots of things going on within the U.S. and within China relevant to their valuations. So, that's kind of a complex explanation but it's all intertwined, to put it that way.</p><p>LU STOUT: Y es. In fact, the tension between the U.S. and China is growing. You know, just overnight, President Donald Trump announced new investment restrictions aimed primarily at China to keep China from getting access to sensitive American-made technology.</p><p>KOEPP: Indeed.</p><p>LU STOUT: What is your thinking about the forecast, you know, the look ahead for the U.S.-China relationship?</p><p>KOEPP: It's not looking particularly positive right now. I think the view in Washington, at least at the White House is that they need to hold their ground and they are not about to concede until China budges. I would say that China has been making moves, kind of behind the scenes.</p><p>So like Tesla in July was given permission to build a $10 billion giga factory. Actually, that's (inaudible) Trump doesn't like but for U.S business interest, it's a positive sign because it shows Chinese opening up. That sort of (inaudible) foreign enterprise puts in a lot (inaudible).</p><p>So, there are some positive movements, but until we see kind of breakthrough maybe a change in the presidency, I don't think U.S.-China relations economically are going to improve too much.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes. And knowing that and all the other factors weighing on the markets, how long can we expect this global sell-off to go on?</p><p>KOEPP: Well, the global sell-off is although related to U.S.-China trade frictions, they are also, I mean, the investor should be pricing that in. So I don't think we have to wait for U.S.-China trade relations to improve before the stock market recoveries.</p><p>Currently based on the data we heard and as Christine was just mentioning, you know, it's not an absolute plummet of the stock market. So, let's see how the next few days play out. I would say the main thing to look for are not only the economic macro fundamentals but company reportings of earnings.</p><p>So that will be coming out the end of this week and then the next week. If those are positive actually there is a good chance the stock market will be recovering.</p><p>LU STOUT: All right, Robert Koepp, director of the Economist Corporate Network, always a pleasure to have you here on the program. Thank you. Take care.</p><p>Now, do stay with CNN for the opening bell on Wall Street. Following Wednesday's massive loses, get that and more on First Move with Julia Chatterley. That starts in about 40 minutes from now. And the moment you could take a look at what to anticipate, there's all down arrows there in terms of the futures.</p><p>Now, up next, you're watching \"News Stream.\" Two men on board a Russian spacecraft, they have just gone through what must have been a terrifying ordeal. We'll tell you what happened that forced the Soyuz to make an emergency landing.</p><p>Also ahead, President Donald Trump has been speaking about the disappearance of the missing Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. We'll bring you the very latest on the search for answers, right here on \"News Stream.\"</p><p>[08:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT: All right, coming to you live from Hong Kong. Welcome back. This is \"News Stream.\" What began as a trip to the International Space Station ended abruptly just a few hours ago with a dramatic emergency landing. The crew on board the Soyuz, a Russian cosmonaut and a NASA astronaut, they have survived a hard dusty landing in Kazakhstan.</p><p>They are said to be doing OK. It's an incredible story. We have CNN's Fred Pleitgen standing by in Moscow with more. And Fred, the crew is alive despite a very hard landing. This was an extraordinary rescue.</p><p>FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It certainly was. You know, this was a major incident obviously for the Russian space program and obviously in partnership with the Americans as well. But I could have been so much worse, Kristie.</p><p>We do have the first images that we just got a couple of minutes ago of these two, one astronaut and one cosmonaut obviously, after they had been retrieved from that capsule. It shows them on what seems to be two couches with medical equipment seemingly hooked up to them obviously monitoring their vital signs.</p><p>Now, the information that we're getting from the Russian side at this point, they say that both of these astronauts are in good condition. The latest that I got, just a couple of minutes ago, Kristie, is that they are currently on a helicopter and they're going from the site where the capsule touched down back to Baikonur, which is of course Russia's main space station from where they lift off their rockets into space.</p><p>It's about 250 miles away from where that capsule touched down. Meanwhile, we're still trying to piece together what exactly happened with that launch. It seems as though the rockets took off from the Baikonur Space Station and then about, I'd say a little less than three minutes into the flight, the crew radioed back and said that there had been a malfunction with the main booster.</p><p>We've been listening to the radio transmission which was going out live and it was really amazing to see the professionalism of these two crew members as they realized their spacecraft was in trouble and that they had to do something and had to the abort the mission.</p><p>They radioed back that they had separated from the booster rocket and that they were starting to do what's called a ballistic dissent back towards Earth which is at a much steeper angle than would usually be the case, much faster and much more tough also on those astronauts as well.</p><p>And they managed to touch the spacecraft down. Apparently at all times, and they were conscious and they did have communications back to the main offices of the Russian Space Administration. There are some NASA folks there as well.</p><p>And as we said now, apparently right now they're on those helicopters. They're back on their way to Baikonur and of course pretty much everybody at NASA and also at the Russian Space Administration, probably a lot of people around the world breathing a sigh of relief because of course, Kristie, we've known from unfortunately space disasters that we've had to report on in the past, how small the margin of error is when you're talking about space travel, Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes. But I still can't get over the video. This was a stunning emergency landing. They're back on Earth and they are reported to be in good condition. Fred Pleitgen reporting live for us in Moscow. Fred, thank you.</p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump says it appears Saudi Arabia is behind the disappearance of the missing journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, but it's too early to talk about America's response. The Turkish government has released more video it says ties the Saudi state to his disappearance.</p><p>These images first aired on Turkish television, a report that this was the moment 15 Saudi operatives arrived at Ataturk Airport just hours before Khashoggi visited the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and vanished. The Saudi government denies any involvement. And here is what Mr. Trump had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: This is a bad situation. We cannot let this happen to reporters, to anybody. We can't let this happen and we're going to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Now, CNN's international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, joins us now from Istanbul. And Nic, what impact will the fate of Jamal Khashoggi have on Saudi Arabia's international ties especially with the U.S.?</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITORL: Well, it is a testing time for the leadership in Saudi Arabia because the allegations that they're being exposed to, what Turkish officials say is a murder of Jamal Khashoggi in the consulate here not long after he walked into it Tuesday of last week.</p><p>It is a very strong allegation. The turkish authorities are leaking closed circuit television recordings to media here in Turkey, leaking names of those 15 Saudi men who arrived in Saudi Arabia around the time that Jamaal Khashoggi was killed.</p><p>[08:25:02] So the there is a lot of pressure and scrutiny emerging here in Turkey that's putting end to national pressure on the leadership in Saudi Arabia to come up with answers. And at the moment, it's a difficult situation for them because there is no real wiggle room here.</p><p>They had said that they would allow Turkish authorities into the consulate to, you know, for an examination of it as part of the investigation. That has been put on hold. The Turks are saying that the Saudis are not cooperating fully.</p><p>So I think where this leaves the Saudi leadership is in a very difficult situation where their relationship with their international partners, not least President Trump and of course with Turkey of being put under strain, so their credibility in how they answer these very strong accusations is really going to be tested. And so far, they haven't put forward lines that have been palatable it seems to those allies around the world.</p><p>LU STOUT: Now, the pressure continues to build on Saudi Arabia to provide some real answers. Nic Robertson reporting live for us from Istanbul. Nic, thank you.</p><p>In an unprecedented move, a Chinese intelligence officer has been indicted on economic espionage charges and extradited to the U.S. from Belgium. Yanjun Xu is accused of trying to steal trade secrets from aviation and aerospace companies in the U.S.</p><p>Just a short time ago, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman called the accusations, quote, \"pure fabrication.\" The Trump administration has vowed to crack down on China's theft of intellectual property. Xu faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted.</p><p>China is rejecting criticism after Xinjiang appeared to officially legalize so-called re-education camps. The camps are for people accused of religious extremism. Human rights groups have long alleged the Chinese government has been detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighurs as a largely Muslim minority in such centers. The rights group say it is an effort to enforce loyalty to Beijing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU KANG, CHINESE FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN (through translation): Taking such measures to prevent and crackdown on terrorism and extremism have helped preserve stability as well as the life and livelihood of people of all ethnicities in Xinjiang. These measures are firmly supported by all in Xinjiang.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Now, just a little over a month ago, authorities in Xinjiang denied that the camps even existed. You're watching \"News Stream.\" And still to come, Hurricane Michael is downgraded after devastating parts of the U.S. Gulf Coast. But this tropical storm is still on the move and it is carving a path of destruction.</p><p>[08:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN NEWS STREAM SHOW HOST: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. You're watching \"News Stream.\" These are your world headlines.</p><p>The head of Russia' space agency says the crew of the Soyuz spacecraft, a NASA astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut, have been rescued. The Soyuz was forced to make an emergency landing in central Kazakhstan after a booster failure. NASA says the men are in good condition.</p><p>Wall Street opens for business in an hour and it is bracing itself for another day of heavy losses after stocks stumbled in Asia and Europe on Thursday. Wednesday saw the third biggest point decline in the Dow's history and it could get worse in trading today. U.S. President Trump has blamed the Federal Reserve for the fall.</p><p>We are seeing images of destruction from the island of Mallorca, Spain where at least 10 people were killed after heavy rain triggered flash flooding on the island. The water cut off roads and forced schools to close. Hundreds of emergency responders including members of the military have been deployed to the scene.</p><p>As morning begins in the U.S. state of Florida, residents are getting a first look at the devastation left by Hurricane Michael. Dianne Gallagher is live for us from Panama City. She joins us now. Dianne, we know that the storm surge ripped apart the Florida coast. What kind of damage have you seen?</p><p>DIANNE GALLAGHER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Kristie, I'm going to be honest, that storm surge ripped apart the coastline here in the panhandle, but really, I want you to take a look at what the wind did as well.</p><p>Now, remember, Hurricane Michael was just about two miles per hour away from a Category Five. This was an extremely strong Category Four hurricane. This is not an uncommon sight here, Kristie. It's an auto facility where they fix cars, they have parts, things like that, just ripped to shreds by those winds. We are seeing this on almost every single block in Panama City here.</p><p>I just went through to a mobile home park, a community right behind this, to talk to residents. Most of them, Kristie, spent the night through the hurricane all day in their homes. Now look, these are aluminum metal homes and the hurricane just shredded them.</p><p>You can see the trees that just fell into them. One home, three trees on one mobile home. Thankfully, only one foot injury in all of these. At this point right now because the light has sort of just come with daybreak here, we are still not entirely sure of exactly how much damage we are looking at.</p><p>We do know that in the words of Governor Rick Scott of Florida that it is utter devastation. But just how bad it is right now, Kristie, we are still not sure. I can tell you that more than half a million people do not have power as a result of the storm.</p><p>The good news is we have already seen power trucks driving by as soon as the sun came up. We are also seeing civilians with boats and backhoes and other types of equipment on the back of their vehicles, towing them around to go and assist right now.</p><p>There appears to be a dire need of chainsaws, food, and water in these communities. We are not sure when they are going to get the power back. We have a boiled water advisory because they are not sure if it is safe right now for people here.</p><p>And Kristie, this isn't even the worst of it. Down at Mexico Beach which is about maybe an hour away from here, the flooding there was so severe that it came up almost to the rooftops of some of the homes there, and they are just now starting to get into that community as the light has come up to see how bad this devastation was.</p><p>This was the worst hurricane to hit the panhandle of Florida since they started keeping records on hurricanes.</p><p>LU STOUT: Wow! Roof-high flood waters and right behind you. You know, just looking at the scene there and what you've described for us, just these fierce winds literally shredding this community apart, we can clearly see the devastation caused by this hurricane. Dianne Gallagher reporting live for us. Dianne, thank you.</p><p>You're watching \"News Stream.\" And still to come to CNN, we are going to take a bite into authentic Hong Kong. It's a place that serves old school favorites and where some kitchens run 18 hours a day. We're going to take you to the culinary hot spot that has attracted the likes of our dear friends, Anthony Bourdain.</p><p>[08:35:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LU STOUT: All right, coming to you live from Hong Kong, welcome back. This is \"News Stream.\" Now, this is a full series. It's called \"Smart Creativity.\" As part of the series this week, we bring you the artwork of NASA's first ever artist-in-residence.</p><p>Laurie Anderson is the woman behind a lunar landing installation at Denmark's major contemporary art gallery. It is a virtual reality experience, allows viewers to explore the surface of the moon, but not just any moon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAURIE ANDERSON, ARTIST: I want to walk into work of art and get lost in it. Every artist from the beginning of time has wanted to come into that world. VR offers you that in a way that is unique.</p><p>People are attracted to the moon because it presents itself in so many mysteriously different ways. I'm somebody who wants to lose my body in works of art that take me out of this place, this body I love. Virtual reality can do that. This piece is called \"To The Moon.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Now, you are on your way to the moon.</p><p>ANDERSON: But as soon as you land on the moon, you start seeing all the constellations. We use the constellations as more or less like drawings of things we've lost. So, we had things in nature reflect of constellation of a polar bear and as you look at that polar bear, it dissolves. So, it's almost like a picture that becomes an idea that just blows away when you see it.</p><p>Then you also see democracy and if you look at it, you realize all of these things -- we think it is unstable and so fragile and can be lost. It's not narrative anymore. It's not linear. It's not contained in the rectangle that you're looking at.</p><p>The moon is a dream. And so I wanted to push it more in that direction. You can fly into a graphic representation of a dinosaur made from its own DNA. Diamonds are falling from the sky, a little nod (ph) to twinkle, twinkle little star. (INAUDIBLE) flags.</p><p>Also, this -- that was a nod (ph) to the colonization of the moon by everybody. So, here is a Russian flag, here is an American flag, and they're being planted around you.</p><p>So you're flying around in this free world. And it is like combination of hallucination and reality. And so it ends up being this very mysterious thing, very much like the moon itself.</p><p>A work like this is for me is just a way to encourage people to go, wow, what is that? To think about it, not just to the world as we see it, but the beauty of the information that we can't see, the things that we can't see.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: I just love that. Laurie Anderson is the coolest. Now, this week, CNN is exploring a neighborhood in Hong Kong called Sham Shui Po. This area serves up some delicious local dishes from street food to bamboo pole noodles. We visit some of the restaurants to get a taste of some of the classics of Hong Kong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[08:40:02] LU STOUT (voice over): In this bustling neighborhood of Hong Kong, Hop Yik Tai eatery serves up a local favorite.</p><p>NICOLE FUNG, FOOD AND TRAVEL BLOGGER: We are in Sham Shui Po and we are going to eat rice sheet rolls or cheong fun. This place is in a little alleyway here. This is a really popular Hong Kong street food snack. They're served differently, but the street food way is just plain but with bunch of different sauces.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): Nicole Fung is a food and travel blogger and comes to this recommended eatery in Sham Shui Po often.</p><p>FUNG: Very chewy and very soft. Very healthy. It's just like (INAUDIBLE) delicious sauce. It's very simple, but very good.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): While shoppers might indulge in this area (INAUDIBLE) markets, for Fung, it is all about finding local culinary treasures.</p><p>FUNG: Sham Shui Po is very unique to Hong Kong, so you can get really classic favorites.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): Classic favorites like tofu pudding.</p><p>FUNG (voice over): It's really healthy and you can kind of see like -- there's like layers of tofu in here.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): Fung says the best in Hong Kong is served here at the family-owned Kung Wo factory.</p><p>RENEE SO, DIRECTOR, KUNG WO FACTORY: Actually, our shop has a very long history, almost 50 (ph) years.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): Renee So is the fourth generation to run this restaurant.</p><p>SO: We have a kitchen operating 18 hours a day, so we start making the tofu at 1:00 a.m nonstop until 4:00 p.m. every day.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): So says that the number of tourists who visit her restaurant has increased in the past few years, especially vegans (ph) and vegetarians interested in soybean products. This might be true for So but Fung believes it is because of the area's charm.</p><p>FUNG: I think Sham Shui Po is becoming more gentrified. There's a lot of like older buildings that are being torn down and then they're building new buildings so there are a lot of more people coming through.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): The area has also attracted food enthusiasts from across the world. \"Parts Unknown\" featured the famous Lau Sum Kee Restaurant earlier this year.</p><p>FUNG: Lau Sum Kee is one of my favorite noodle spots in Hong Kong. They are known for their egg noodles. Actually, it's called bamboo noodles. They still make it old school way.</p><p>So the first time I came here was with my dad, as well. This is one of his favorites. But it's like a classic Hong Kong dish. He's been eating it since he was a kid.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): This is what childhood memories taste like. For fun, eating at Sham Shui Po reconnects her to her roots.</p><p>FUNG: Sham Shui Po to me is very authentic. When people want to come visit Hong Kong, I think they should come to Sham Shui Po because it actually feels like Hong Kong.</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): Authentic Hong Kong, certainly a palate teaser.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: Did that wet your appetite?

The FTSE 100 this morning is up 58 points, that's about 1 percent; the CAC quarante is up 41; and the DAX index higher by 134.</p><p>England moving to curb coronavirus spikes, banning social gatherings of more than six people now in the U.K.</p><p>In Asia overnight, it was a sea of red following the sell-off on Wall Street yesterday. Take a look.</p><p>The U.S. is preparing orders to block cotton and tomato imports from China's Xinjiang region. Over forced labor allegations, China responding saying that the U.S. is trying to oppress Chinese customers and incite instability. Xinjiang of course is the region where 1 million Uyghurs are in camps.</p><p>Let's look at the top stories that we are watching this morning right now.</p><p>Joe Biden launching his new 'Made in America' platform today in Michigan, imposing an offshoring tax penalty and a new tax credit to reward those who invest in American products.</p><p>President Trump doubling down on his law and order message at a rally in North Carolina yesterday. He warned if Biden wins, the economy will collapse, and the rioters, anarchists and looters will take over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: If Biden wins, the violent mobs, you see these mobs all over the place, they're Biden people, they are Biden states and cities, they're Democrat states. If they win, the mobs win. You see these guys, they go around saying, hey, I want your meal, give me that food, give me that - a woman sitting there, she wants to eat, and they come, they grab her food, they grab her drink. Nobody's ever seen stuff like this. This is all that ideology. We're not going to let it happen. If Biden wins, the rioters, arsonists and anarchists win.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Today, President Trump is expected to announce a withdrawal of 1700 troops from Iraq. Meanwhile, no break for firefighters in California, where devastating wildfires are threatening lives and property across the state. Three firefighters hurt, one critically injured while fighting the Dolan Fire that's in Central California. At least 148 people trapped by the Creek Fire, rescued by helicopter crews. Governor Gavin Newsom warning that the peak of fire season is still to come. 2.3 million acres have been burned so far this year in California.</p><p>AstraZeneca pausing clinical trials of its coronavirus vaccine after a participant in the U.K. had a serious adverse reaction. It is unclear if the illness was caused by this vaccine, but AstraZeneca says this is routine. It doesn't know how long it will last. This is the first report of any serious issue from these trials.</p><p>Just take a look at the premarket this morning and AstraZeneca shares which were down about 2 percent.</p><p>Well, violence and unrest taking a toll on Rochester. The city's police chief and entire command staff now stepping down. This as Rochester police are trying to identify suspects accused of launching fireworks at law enforcement during these protests.</p><p>Apple steps up the legal pressure on Epic Games, the maker of the popular game Fortnite. Apple is counter-suing the company for breach of contract for operating its own in-app payment system. It is seeking punitive damages. Epic sued both Apple and Google last month after the tech company pulled the Fortnite video game from their app stores. Apple and Google get 30 percent of in-app purchases. Apple shares in the premarket trading this way, let's take a look at Apple here. Of course, the Dow components as well, and it is up 3.75 percent.</p><p>Broad market also positive this morning, Apple lifting a few boats as well following yesterday's selloff. Look at this bounce back we've got going on this morning. The Dow Industrials fell better than 600 points yesterday and is rebounding this morning 175. The NASDAQ now in correction territory with a 465 point decline yesterday, is now bouncing this morning. All six major tech stocks all lost more than $1 trillion in market value in just the last three days.</p><p>Joining me right now is Disruptive Tech Research Founder and Chief Analyst, Lou Basenese; along with joining the conversation all morning Fox Business' Dagen McDowell; and National Taxpayers Union Senior Fellow, Forward Strategies President, Mattie Duppler. Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lou Basenese, let me kick it off with you, ask you about that massive selloff in the NASDAQ yesterday, which really took the whole market down. Was that the correction, is there more to come? You look at some of these names like Tesla and Apple, they were pretty hard-hit yesterday.</p><p>LOU BASENESE, DISRUPTIVE TECH RESEARCH FOUNDER AND CHIEF ANALYST: Yes, perspective matters. We've had five months of rallies, three days of a sudden selloff. It begs that question, is this just a natural healthy pause in the market, or the start of something bigger - a bigger downturn? And I think the answer is both.</p><p>I think you have to look at names like Tesla and Zoom which were up 400 percent, 500 percent year-to-date, completely divorced from any rational fundamental metrics in terms of valuation. You cannot put a model to Tesla and Zoom and justify that.</p><p>So I think those types of stocks are in jeopardy of correcting a lot more. I mean, Tesla had its single worse drop - single day drop ever at 21 percent. But then you have all other names like the Big Tech giants like Microsoft and Apple, you get in to Google, they're not trading at ridiculous valuations yet, they're trading at about 28 to 33 times historical earnings. Everyone wants to say this is a dot-com era all over again. But back then, those stocks would have been trading at double those prices. So again, I think you really can't--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. No, please, finish your thought.</p><p>BASENESE: I was going to say, I think you can't look at tech as a block, right? We used to be able to trade the FANG stocks in a block, no problem, buy every dip. I think now you have to be a lot more selective, you can't just buy every tech stock for the rally and momentum play. You have to be more selective on fundamentals, and maybe start moving down in the market caps where you can get better valuations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So Tesla suffered its worst decline ever yesterday. The stock was down 21 percent, just because it was let out of the new additions to the S&amp;P 500 on Friday, Lou. This is the kind of situation where as we watch this stock go up, there were questions about whether or not it was equating to the company's actual earnings power or earnings visibility.</p><p>BASENESE: Right. I think, look, you see this, there was tremendous momentum, there was a lot of speculation that they were going to be included because they had four quarters of profitability. If they were included that would bring in a lot of automatic buying from index funds and ETFs. That didn't happen. So it really took out that underlying buying momentum, but then you also saw some large investors started selling as well.</p><p>This is a thing about momentum stocks. When things change direction, they change direction quickly. And now we've got some negative momentum going the opposite direction.</p><p>I've been really bearish on Tesla for a long time and I've been wrong, thankfully I haven't had a personal position in it. But I just don't think fundamentally that the company can justify its valuation, trading at bigger than pretty much every car company combined in the world, and yet still producing a fraction of the cars each year. I think there are about 500,000 cars a year when someone like Toyota is doing 10 million a year.</p><p>So again, I think Tesla is in for more declines, just like other companies that are trading at these stretched valuations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what do you think then as far as the rest of the year and investing? I mean, there are a few unknowns obviously, the election being the biggest out there, the economy coming back as well. How do you want to allocate capital with these unknowns?</p><p>BASENESE: Yes, listen, I think there's uncertainty building about the election. This is a question that keeps going up with a lot of clients and among colleagues. I think the best and most prudent course of action right now is to have some cash on the sidelines. If we do get a nasty selloff because of whoever wins the election, you want to be in a position where you can take advantage of that. We've seen that time and time again through this bull market that these 10 percent to 15 percent corrections are followed by strong rallies once the uncertainties remove from the market.</p><p>So whether we have a Biden or a Trump presidency moving forward, the market will adjust. But right now, it's uncertain.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I think you make a great point.</p><p>Dagen McDowell, I was struck, because you look at that selloff in the NASDAQ and then you look at the number of stocks that actually attribute that 460 point selloff. It was like four or of five stocks, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But to Lou's point, those are the four or five stocks that the kind of new trader, the reckless retail trader, or people who maybe were betting on sports before the shutdown, who are now in the market, those are the very names that individuals are attracted to, right, Lou?</p><p>BASENESE: No, they are. Look, these are the household names, we all use these products and services every day, the pandemic has accelerated the use of Apple, on Amazon and Netflix. I mean, it's just - you invest in what you know and what you use. And I think Dagen, you're spot on. This is (inaudible) have been bred by new traders coming in, and investing in these stocks and driving them to valuations that day-in day-out move the markets.</p><p>I think what you need to do as you become more experienced, these investors will learn, we all learn the hard way, right? You're either humble by in the markets, or humbled by the markets and they're going to figure that out. And those start moving in to names that are more affordable in software-as-a-service base. You can buy Salesforce at a ridiculous valuation, or you can get small and mid-cap names that are trading at half the valuation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there. Lou, it's great to get your insights this morning. Thank you so much, sir. We will see you soon.</p><p>BASENESE: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Lou Basenese joining us there on tech.</p><p>Check out your morning mover now. Slack, the stock is sliding after reporting earnings last night as well. Despite raising its full year outlook, billing growth slowed in the second quarter, it came in below analyst estimates. Billings are a key indicator of future revenue growth at Slack and the industry. The company said it took an $11 million hit in the first half because of the coronavirus concessions that stopped down 16 plus percent.</p><p>Quick break. We are just getting started this morning.</p><p>Coming up right here, Edelman CEO Richard Edelman is here on how employees are feeling about safely returning to work. Got to get back, coming up.</p><p>And then next hour, Oklahoma Senator James Lankford joining us to weigh in on the GOP'S skinny stimulus plan. All that and a lot more.</p><p>Plus Dr. Mike is here joining me to discuss what speeds up the process of aging, tips to staying young.</p><p>You're watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The stimulus stalemate this morning, Senate Republicans have proposed a $300 billion coronavirus aid package. It provides a $300 a week unemployment boost through December 27. It also funds state governments, schools and small business. It forgives the U.S. postal service's $10 billion loan and it does not provide another round of stimulus checks.</p><p>Joining us right now is the editor at large of Reason, Matt Welch. Matt, it's good to have you. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>MATT WELCH, EDITOR-AT-LARGE, REASON: Morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think, this plan will likely be rejected in the house, but is this a starting point for another stimulus plan?</p><p>WELCH: Some stimulus is going to happen. I'm struck by the House Democrats' criticism of this using the word 'emaciated' to describe a bill that would spend $300 billion. It shows how much the baseline of our conversations about Washington, sort of, money printing machine has gone over the past's 10, 15 years. It's crazy.</p><p>We've spent more money on coronavirus-related stimulus relief, whatever you want to describe it. Then we did the financial crisis of 2008-2009 by a lot, by a lot. We're going to have more debt this year than the government has ever spent in a year and Democrats are saying this is emaciated. This will give you a sense of what the spending pressures would be like under a Biden presidency, should he win in November.</p><p>So I think there's going to be a deal, there's going to be some money printing going on from Washington. There is not any more any meaningful break on the appetite for spending in Washington. The fiscal conservatives lost and they're not making a peep in much anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That said, you're so right. Emaciated is the word that they use, and it's sort of a sign of the times of where we are, all of that money emaciated. What does this mean for the campaign trail? You have got President Trump campaigning in Florida and North Carolina yesterday, he's warning of a \"economic collapse\" and certainly more riots if Joe Biden wins.</p><p>And then there is Biden, he is headed to Michigan to make his pitch, called Made in America, to save manufacturing jobs, which is of course what President Trump has been doing. He says he's promising to enforce offshoring tax penalties and buy American initiatives. It's interesting how Biden has pretty much very similar plans as the president when it comes to onshoring and jobs and manufacturing.</p><p>WELCH: Yes, it's a race to the left when it comes to trade protectionism on the two major parties at this point. And I think with Biden what you might expect and you've seen this on other issues like fracking is that, when he's talking to Michigan autoworkers, he's going to sound an awful lot like Donald Trump. But when he goes back to raise money in New York or wherever, he's got wink-wink and nudge-nudge, and said I'm not really going to punish you for moving offshore.</p><p>That's just the normal way of Democratic business, we saw the same thing with Hillary Clinton and other than you get the moderate, the centrist comparatively in the field to win, to make insincere promises to the progressive left and then you make sure the financeres are happy.</p><p>But from this, I think America is pretty fed up with insincere politics, just one of the reasons why Donald Trump won in the first place. So whether that's going to work for Biden, who knows, but it's hard to see what the overall impact of kind of stimulus, the politics are on the country when that's just not the center of the conversation. People, yes, people are suffering. I would say the way that most people are feeling with coronavirus this particular month are in schools.</p><p>If you are a parent of one of the 57 million kids, who are in public schools, you're freaking out trying to figure out what to do. The problem with that in politics is that, is that really a national issue? No, it's handled on the state and local level. So it's really hard to see how that plays out in the presidential election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Matt, I want to go back to the stimulus really quickly. Do we really need it at this point, or is this just political posturing?</p><p>WELCH: I don't know, Dagen. I mean, the - but one thing that really strikes me about this is that in the Republicans' plan, I think something like $47 million or $47 billion, it's all hellions at this point, $47 billion being spent on things like testing and specific things having to do with combating the coronavirus. It's always a fraction in these bills, which strikes me as kind of bananas.</p><p>What is the role of the federal government in this thing? One could argue that the biggest problem the federal government had from the beginning and this is a bureaucratic problem, not a Trump problem, is that we put the brakes on testing. We've had a bottleneck of it back in February and March with huge implications.</p><p>Well, I would have hoped that the reaction from Washington would have been fixed that. But throwing money at a problem, throw money at a testing problem more than anything else and vaccines and things of that nature that makes sense. And that has not been the case and it continues to not be the case. But again, we have now tried to, or we devolved in to seeing Washington as a money printer.</p><p>And so, do we need it? I don't know. I don't think so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WELCH: But there's a ton of people struggling out there right now and there's no meaningful kind of stop on that line of thinking.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, certainly we are expecting growth in the second half, but it's been tough for many people. Matt, real quick before you go, your feeling on the election, is Florida up for grabs right now?</p><p>WELCH: Sure. Florida is the best state for Trump in terms of a momentum in his direction. But then on the other side, Arizona is up for grabs in ways that people wouldn't have thought. Well, keep an eye on one thing, there was a lot of third-party voters in 2016, they're not going to vote for third parties this time in nearly the same way. They are overwhelmingly going towards Biden and that's a problem for Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Matt, it's great to see you this morning. Thank you so much. Matt Welch joining us--</p><p>WELCH: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: --from Reason. We'll take a break. When we come back, AstraZeneca is pausing clinical trials of the coronavirus vaccine. We're going to take a look at that. It has the stock down better than 2 percent right now.</p><p>Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. AstraZeneca pausing global trials of its coronavirus vaccine. A participant suffered an adverse reaction, that was the catalyst and the company is calling the pause routine. It does not know how long it will last. However, the stock right now is down better than 2 percent.</p><p>Dagen McDowell, what do you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: So this news was broken by the health website, it's a news site called Stat News. I will point to their story. And in the story, there are still a lot of unknowns. \"The nature of the adverse reaction and when it happened, not immediately known. It's still unclear how severe and rare the adverse event is\". But one thing we do know is the rigorous scientific process to vet and prove these vaccines is working, that the data and safety monitoring board is working.</p><p>Stat News reports that researchers are running other trials, are now looking for similar cases of adverse reactions by combing through databases as part of the review by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board.</p><p>I will point to this. There are a lot of completely non-partisan scientists who are on Twitter and you can follow. They're educators, they work in the vaccine field, and they will freely weigh in with some really smart comments. And this is from Ellie Murray, who is an assistant professor at Boston University. She said, \"What is the take home message? Is this bad news for the vaccine? It depends on what the event is and whether there is any way to rule out the vaccine as a cause. Be patient. This is why we do Phase 3 trials. This is the system working\".</p><p>I'll point out that there are total nine Phase 3 trials happening now around the globe. There are three here in the United States for a COVID vaccine. There's the Pfizer, BioNTech Phase 3, there is the Moderna Phase 3 and then the AstraZenecaOxford University Phase 3. It does appear right now that the Pfizer Phase 3 trial is furthest along in the United States, but more information is going to come out about this surely in the days ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean Stat News is very reliable, typically in this sector, right, Dagen? And this study, which began last week, was aiming to enroll 30,000 people in it, funded by federal agencies. And I'm glad you said that you think that this is why, you think that this shows that the system is working.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. So that 30--</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's important information, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So that 30,000 Phase 3, that's here in the United States. It's not clear where this adverse reaction happened in someone in the trial, but it could be that it happened in the Phase 2/3 trial that is currently underway in the U.K. So it could have happened over in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Nevertheless, this adverse event in the AstraZeneca trial, it could have an impact, and this is in the Stat News' story, could have an impact on the efficacy data from the U.K. trial, and it being available if AstraZeneca is going to try and get emergency authorization to get the vaccine approved here in the United States. So it does, even though it might have happened in the U.K., it would impact what happens here with the FDA in the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure. Mattie Duppler, your thoughts? And of course, all of these companies already have plans in place for distribution programs with the federal government once, in fact, the vaccine is ready.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION: Maria, that is an extremely important point. Remember, we're only six months in to this thing and we're already in Phase 3 for a vaccine trial. That is an incredible rate for these companies to have gotten to this point. That is in thanks, in part, to the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed that has tried to get rid of some of the regulatory barriers to make sure that we can have a vaccine, so we can start to look forward in to the next year to start to return to life as normal.</p><p>I think that really is the environmental factor here that we need to stay focused on. We are light years ahead of where we've been in the past when we're trying to come up with a vaccine for a disease that is this confounding and this critical.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All great points.</p><p>All right. Let's slip in a break. When we come back, Jeff Bezos marking another milestone, his new fortune when we come back, the stock up another 1.68 percent this morning.</p><p>Then pulling the plug, the Kardashians going off the air after 20 seasons with their tele fans, straight ahead. Back in a minute.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, ANCHOR, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning everybody, thanks so much for joining us, I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, September 9th. Let's check markets here at 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast. We've got a rally underway, futures indicating a gain at the start of trading, a rebound after yesterday's dropping. The Dow Industrials up 134 points, the Nasdaq up 193 and the S&amp;P higher by 24.5. This after the big technology selloff fueled another broader selloff in markets yesterday.</p><p>The Nasdaq finished at the day's lows, it was down 465 points. It entered correction territory. The six biggest technology stocks erased over $1 trillion in value over the last three trading sessions that was Tesla, Apple and Microsoft. Dow Industrials yesterday also down better than 600 points. This morning, a bounce-back across the world, European indices are also bouncing. Take a look, FTSE 100 up 48, CAC Quarante up 25 and the Dax Index in Germany up 118 points right now, about 1 percent. In Asia overnight, the markets took a cue from Wall Street, it was a sea of red following the selloff. The U.S. is preparing orders to block cotton and tomato imports from China's Xinjiang region over forced labor allegations.</p><p>This of course is the region where the 1 million Uyghurs are being held and detained. China is denying the mistreatment of the Uyghurs, saying that the camps are vocational training centers. As you see, the Shanghai Composite was down about 2 percent overnight. The tech stock selloff hitting SoftBank shares hard. Cheryl Casone with those details right now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS: Yes, that's right, Maria. So SoftBank has lost about $15 billion in market value this week after the Japanese company reportedly made big bets on tech companies like you said, Tesla, Microsoft and Apple. Well, the company's CEO, Masayoshi Son, they're calling on the market guys are a whale, given the huge size of those bets, $4 billion worth of options. This is all according to the \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning. SoftBank shares are up 25 percent this year. But again, definitely another stock to watch today. Well, Michaels is gearing up for the busy holiday season, hiring more than 16,000 seasonal workers across the country.</p><p>The arts and crafts retail giant says it's now focusing on expanding its buy online and pick up in store teams. Michaels is holding hiring events at U.S. stores on Saturday. Well, Jeff Bezos is topping \"Forbes'\" list of richest Americans for the third straight year. Bezo's fortune, $179 billion as of July 24th, that is up 57 percent from last year. The jumped helped by a 55 percent increase in Amazon shares since mid-February due to the COVID- 19 pandemic. Taking a look at Amazon in the pre-market, Maria, stock is up a little more than 1.5 percent. And those are your headlines, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you. Gender reveal parties are now in question. One of the many wildfires burning in California generated by a pyrotechnic device used during a reveal, according to fire officials. They are expecting parents --the expecting parents rather, could now face severe penalties. The Eldorado fire is still burning, scorching more than 11,000 acres so far. Joining me right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge, it's great to see you this morning, what a story. What legal trouble could this couple be facing?</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Well, I mean, they could be indicted for the destruction of all of this property which would obviously bankrupt them and expose them to a very serious jail time. Quite frankly, I don't know if anybody has been killed. If anyone has died either, a homeowner or a person on the property that trapped by the fire or even a firefighter, they could be indicted for criminally negligent homicide. Their defense would probably be, it wasn't us, it was the pyrotechnics device and you should indict the company that manufactured it.</p><p>So we don't know exactly how the fire started. We don't know if the device operated properly or if it was designed poorly. We don't know if the homeowners were negligent or if it's the fault of the manufacturer of this device. All of those things would be determined after the fires are put out and the governor -- and the government, the prosecutors have the time to conduct their investigation. As well, insurance companies are going to want to go after that manufacturer of the device because they're on the hook for the billions in property loss that they now have to pay for.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's some story. I mean, you know, you just -- obviously, it was a gender reveal. It wasn't their fault, but they're being held liable.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, you know, people -- the law presumes that you intend the natural and probable consequences of your behavior. So if they were rational and careful, they're probably not going to get indicted. But if they were irrational and negligent and careless, they're going to be held responsible for the consequences of what they did. Whether it's a gender reveal or a wedding or a first communion or a --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Bar mitzvah or whatever the -- whatever the reason is for the -- for the celebration. How careful were they and how properly did they operate this equipment, and did the equipment operate as it was supposed --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: To operate? Those are questions the prosecutors want to --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Makes a lot of sense --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Answer before they decide to file charges.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Judge, let me switch over to this story. JPMorgan in the news today, saying that it has found evidence of employees and clients misusing coronavirus relief funds. Your reaction?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, this could be very serious, Maria. Remember, JPMorgan is the biggest lender in the United States. The government didn't directly give this money away. It gave it to the banks. So JPMorgan is the biggest distributor of the 2.2 trillion that Congress appropriated. So, the question is, did some JPMorgan employees help customers who did not qualify for the program to receive the money? And, did JPMorgan employees help customers who did qualify to receive the money, receive it twice? So was there deception and was there fraud here, and were the JPMorgan employees compensated by the customers for these deceptive and criminal acts?</p><p>There must be some evidence of this because our mutual friend, Jamie Dimon himself addressed this yesterday. So we don't know exactly what the evidence is. Quite frankly, I'm speculating on the basis of the news reports this morning as to what it may be. But there must be a there, there or Jamie Dimon wouldn't have made the statement that he did. What's happening?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: JPMorgan itself is doing the investigation. If they find probable cause of crime, they're going to turn it over to the federal prosecutors in the area where the events took place.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and let's not forget when the money was first doled out, there were a lot of questions about why certain big companies got money, why smaller companies didn't get --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Money, and there were lots of questions about who was getting what. We'll watch that, judge. It's great to see you this morning. Thank you so much. Judge Andrew Napolitano --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Likewise --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us this morning. Quick break, and I'll be speaking with President Trump adviser and coronavirus taskforce member, Dr. Scott Atlas this morning, we'll talk about the pandemic, the race for a vaccine and the AstraZeneca news this morning. Plus, California Congressman Devin Nunes is here on the ongoing investigation into spying on the Trump 2016 presidential campaign, the origins of the Russia probe. Who will be held accountable? We are waiting on John Durham's criminal investigation next couple of weeks.</p><p>Then major mistakes people make when getting rid of old computers and phones, why your personal information is at risk. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business. Stay with us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This week on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, tomorrow, it's the word on Wall Street, our expert insight on the best ways to allocate your capital for the future. And Friday, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former New York Stock Exchange CEO Dick Grasso close out the week, that's all right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Coronavirus concerns and the return to work. Companies are working to come up with plans, but a new Edelman report finds only half of employees polled believe that their offices are safe. Joining me right now is the CEO of Edelman, Richard Edelman. Richard, it's great to see you this morning, thanks very much for joining us. Let's go through --</p><p>RICHARD EDELMAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, EDELMAN: Hi, Maria --</p><p>BARTIROMO: What you're finding. What is fueling these fears? How are companies responding? I feel like it's an ongoing adapting to this new normal.</p><p>EDELMAN: Maria, we have a huge trust issue on the return to the workplace. In short, half the people say I don't feel the workplace is safe, only 20 percent said that they're going to go back to work anytime before Christmas. And actually, 8 percent say that they'll take the subway or the bus or the train. So in fact, they're just locked down, and it's like a kid who has fallen off a bike, they don't really want to get back on the bike and go back into the city. And that's a real disconnect for the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good analogy about getting back on the bike, Richard. Your research shows that many people are fearing a second wave in the Fall of COVID, right?</p><p>EDELMAN: Yes, well, two-thirds of the people think that we're going to have a second wave. The problem, Maria, is they don't feel like they have a credible source of information. There's an equal number, 20 percent who trust state and local federal government and health authorities, and 20 percent trust their peers at work. And so they just are getting, you know, kind of a cacophony, that's just too many information sources. And they read or watch the mainstream media, yet they talk to their doctors who maybe give them different information. And so they're deciding to not decide.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And yet, many are feeling like it's working for them, right? I mean, they're not working, they're working but from home. I found it striking that the report also found a third of people need to read a headline three to five times before believing it, that there's such distrust on social media.</p><p>EDELMAN: Well, look, I think companies have to show four or five actual changes in the workplace for people to feel as if it's different enough to come back. So masks, social distancing, more spacing in the office, temperature checks, fewer people on elevators and our research shows clearly that you need four of those in order to get to belief. And it's also critical, Maria, that we talk about vaccines because 42 percent of Americans said to us, we are scared of taking a vaccine. Maybe, we don't understand how it works or maybe we think the research has been done too quickly. And if we don't get a vaccine, we're not really going to end this level of fear.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you know, this is all among the reasons that the uncertainty is pretty stark for corporations. How do you have a model and expectations about your earnings growth story when you're not sure where your customers will be, you're not sure where your employees will be operating from.</p><p>EDELMAN: Well, I find it fascinating that it's women, 50 percent of women say they won't take a vaccine. Also that it's, you know, people who are in communities of color, and I think we have to do a much better job of explaining how and why the research is proceeding in the way it is. It can't be just sort of like a Greek play where the hero comes down at the end and saves the day. We have to step by step, inch by inch, get people to come back to the office. I find it interesting this week, JPM, JPMorgan said, you know, we want our bankers to start to come into the office because we need them to work together on deals. I don't think we can force people. They have to want to come back. And three-quarters of people --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right --</p><p>EDELMAN: Say, look, we're for sure happy to be at home working and we're productive. But there is a benefit to being --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>EDELMAN: Together. I'm in Manhattan, I -- you know, was in a pretty empty office yesterday and I get it. You know, women who have their kids at home, et cetera, schools are uncertain, I get all that. But we have to be sure that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>EDELMAN: People feel safe when they come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you make so many great points, Richard. On the vaccine issue, it's the same that applies to the flu. How many people just don't get a flu shot, they don't want to get a flu shot, they never get a flu shot. I rarely get flu shots. This flu shot is being talked about as much more serious. We're going to get into that later on in the show. Richard, it's great to see you this morning, thank you, sir.</p><p>EDELMAN: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Richard Edelman joining us. Coming up, the morning stock mover on deck, we will take another hot stock investors are eyeing before the opening bell this morning, that's coming up. And then the Kardashians making a difficult decision to end their reality show. Their message to fans when we come right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, welcome back. Time for the Morning Buzz. First up, the end of an era, no more \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians\". The reality show airing its final season in 2021 after 14 years on the air, that's 20 seasons. Kim Kardashian West making the announcement on Instagram. Though, no official reason was given, Mattie, it is the end of an era here.</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION: It absolutely is. This is a family that has defined reality TV. Now, I think it's something to look out when you look at this announcement from Kim Kardashian, she of course, posted this on Instagram, but that was right after she posted about her underwear line that she had, right after she posted about the fragrance line that she had. I mean, this family has parlayed their television fame into so many different other enterprises. They don't need the TV show. Now, I'm skeptical this will be the last we'll see them on TV, maybe it's the last of this TV show. But certainly, the Kardashians won't be long off camera.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think -- I think you're right about that. New standards for Oscar, this next up, check out this, the Academy of Motion Pictures announcing diversity rules for best picture hopefuls, starting in 2024, they include one lead actor being a person of color and internship opportunities. Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Convoluted rules proving once again that the Academy Awards are completely irrelevant. This is already happening on movie productions, and you don't need to even be nominated for an Oscar anymore for it to mean anything to the film's Box Office or the career of the actor or actress.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right. It is already happening and putting these regulations in place or rules in place is something.

(UPS) to dethrone Canada Post as the only service to deliver magazine subscriptions in Canada, following an arbitration under the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p><p>\"The cultural industry exception has been interpreted to be very, very broad,\" Appleton, who represented UPS in the case, said in an interview.</p><p>A similar interpretation of the power of cultural protection knocked U.S. specialty cable channel Country Music Television (CMT) out of the country in favour of a domestically controlled rival channel in a dispute that began in 1994, he said.</p><p>\"The cultural industries exemption gives Canada policy tools to protect its industries against the U.S.,\" Appleton said, but this will be evident \"if, and only if, the Canadian government wants to support Canadian cultural industries.\"</p><p>Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Canadian media outlets teamed up to urge Ottawa to level the playing field with Google and Facebook, which gobble up an estimated 80 per cent of digital advertising but do not pay the news media for their content. Last month, publishers of several of the country's major newspapers, including the National Post, signed a joint letter to the federal government asking it to \"correct an historical inequality that dates back to the birth of digital media platforms.\"</p><p>In light of the \"unbelievably strong\" illustrations of past regulatory and policy discretion in the case of cultural industries, Appleton said he doesn't see how anyone could argue that the government lacks the power to act, though he didn't rule out the possibility of retaliation from the United States.</p><p>The cultural industry exemption was a point of contention during USMCA negotiations, and while the protection was carried forward from NAFTA, additional language on dispute settlement and retaliation were added.</p><p>The digital sphere specifically allows for a response of \"equivalent commercial effect,\" according to the text of the new trade deal.</p><p>\"Preserving and enhancing Canada's news industry could result in a risk of retaliation,\" Appleton said, adding that he would expect \"a great deal of 'huffing and puffing'\" if Canada were to impose a tax or other measure against the large U.S. tech firms.</p><p>However, given the uneasy relationship between the U.S. administration and tech firms, such as a recent flare-up between U.S.</p><p>President Donald Trump and Twitter, he predicted such \"bravado and threats (would) quickly shift to a diplomatic discussion.\"</p><p>These \"social media platforms simply do not have the necessary type of united support of Congress and the U.S. administration,\" he said.</p><p>\"The likelihood of bluster is high. The real risk of a real trade war over fair treatment of Canadian cultural industries in the media is low.\"</p><p>Appleton described his first-hand experience with Canada's cultural protections in the UPS challenge under the 1992 NAFTA agreement. At its conclusion, the majority of a three-member arbitration tribunal found that UPS could not compete with or replace Canada Post in delivering magazines in this country.</p><p>In a decision in May 2007, the tribunal majority noted that a postal subsidy for some 1,200 eligible Canadian publications helped fulfil Canada's \"cultural and social\" policy aims.

(UPS) to de-throne Canada Post as the only service to deliver magazine subscriptions in Canada, following an arbitration under the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p><p>Canada to study digital tax on tech giants, Morneau says( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/technology/canada-to-study-digital-tax-on-tech-giants-morneau-says\">https://business.financialpost.com/technology/canada-to-study-digital-tax-on-tech-giants-morneau-says</url> )</p><p>Australia to force Google, Facebook to pay domestic media to use content( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/technology/australia-to-force-google-facebook-to-pay-domestic-media-to-use-content-2\">https://business.financialpost.com/technology/australia-to-force-google-facebook-to-pay-domestic-media-to-use-content-2</url> )</p><p>With a US$560-billion war chest, Big Tech goes on pandemic M&amp;;A spree despite political backlash( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/technology/with-a-us560-billion-war-chest-big-tech-goes-on-pandemic-ma-spree-despite-political-backlash\">https://business.financialpost.com/technology/with-a-us560-billion-war-chest-big-tech-goes-on-pandemic-ma-spree-despite-political-backlash</url> )</p><p>\"The cultural industry exception has been interpreted to be very, very broad,\" Appleton, who represented UPS in the case, said in an interview with the Post.</p><p>A similar interpretation of the power of cultural protection knocked U.S. specialty cable channel Country Music Television (CMT) out of the country in favour of a domestically-controlled rival channel in a dispute that began in 1994, he said.</p><p>\"The cultural industries exemption gives Canada policy tools to protect its industries against the U.S.,\" Appleton said, but this will be evident \"if, and only if, the Canadian government wants to support Canadian cultural industries.\"</p><p>In light of the \"unbelievably strong\" illustrations of past regulatory and policy discretion in this area, Appleton said he doesn't see how anyone could argue that the government lacked the power to act, though he didn't rule out the possibility of retaliation from the United States.</p><p>The cultural industry exemption was a point of contention during USMCA negotiations, and while the protection was carried forward from NAFTA, additional language on dispute settlement and retaliation were added.</p><p>The digital sphere specifically allows for a response of \"equivalent commercial effect,\" according to the text of the new trade deal.</p><p>\"Preserving and enhancing Canada's news industry could result in a risk of retaliation,\" Appleton said, adding that he would expect \"a great deal of 'huffing and puffing'\" if Canada were to impose a tax or other measure against the large U.S. tech firms.</p><p>However, given the uneasy relationship between the U.S. administration and tech firms, such as a recent flare-up between U.S. President Donald Trump and Twitter, he predicted such \"bravado and threats (would) quickly shift to a diplomatic discussion.\"</p><p>These \"social media platforms simply do not have the necessary type of united support of Congress and the U.S. administration,\" he said.</p><p>\"The likelihood of bluster is high. The real risk of a real trade war over fair treatment of Canadian cultural industries in the media is low.\"</p><p>Appleton described his first-hand experience with Canada's cultural protections in the UPS challenge under the 1992 NAFTA agreement. At its conclusion, the majority of a three-member arbitration tribunal found that UPS could not compete with or replace Canada Post in delivering magazines in this country.</p><p>A UPS logo on a truck in California.</p><p>In a decision in May 2007, the tribunal majority noted that a postal subsidy for some 1,200 eligible Canadian publications helped fulfill Canada's \"cultural and social\" policy aims. These included connecting Canadians to each other through accessible \"cultural products\" and sustaining and developing the publishing industry.</p><p>UPS had argued that the delivery mechanism fell outside the purview of the cultural industries exception in the trade agreement.</p><p>The panel majority disagreed, stating that the exception essentially removed \"from the scope of NAFTA 'any measure adopted or maintained with respect to cultural industries.'\"</p><p>The language \"is expansive indeed, serving to introduce into NAFTA an admittedly broad exception. This is intentionally so,\" the decision reads, adding that evidence in the case showed that this was understood by the parties during the trade agreement negotiations and implementation.</p><p>The tribunal added that this intent had been carried over from the Free Trade Agreement in the 1980s. The provision ensures that \"a party's ability to pursue its domestic cultural policies would be virtually unimpaired by these trade and investment agreements,\" the tribunal majority wrote in the UPS decision.</p><p>Appleton said what the decision demonstrated to him was the broad application of the cultural protections inherent in trade deals, even at the expense of good policy and regulatory aims such as efficiency.</p><p>\"Even if it's entirely unreasonable, it's totally up to Canada,\" he said.</p><p>The case of Country Music Television (CMT), which played out years earlier in the mid-1990s, is another example of the established power of cultural industry protection in Canada, Appleton said.</p><p>CMT, a U.S. channel with nearly two million subscribers in Canada and a 10-year history of broadcasting in this country, was forced off Canadian airwaves in 1994 when Canada's broadcast regulator licensed a similar channel to be launched by a Canadian broadcaster.</p><p>CMT appealed the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission decision in Canada's federal court of appeal, but lost on the grounds that it had known since it began broadcasting in Canada that it could be bounced if a rival domestic channel was launched.

(UPS) to de-throne Canada Post as the only service to deliver magazine subscriptions in Canada, following an arbitration under the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p><p>Canada to study digital tax on tech giants, Morneau says( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/technology/canada-to-study-digital-tax-on-tech-giants-morneau-says\">https://business.financialpost.com/technology/canada-to-study-digital-tax-on-tech-giants-morneau-says</url> )</p><p>Australia to force Google, Facebook to pay domestic media to use content( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/technology/australia-to-force-google-facebook-to-pay-domestic-media-to-use-content-2\">https://business.financialpost.com/technology/australia-to-force-google-facebook-to-pay-domestic-media-to-use-content-2</url> )</p><p>With a US$560-billion war chest, Big Tech goes on pandemic M&amp;;A spree despite political backlash( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/technology/with-a-us560-billion-war-chest-big-tech-goes-on-pandemic-ma-spree-despite-political-backlash\">https://business.financialpost.com/technology/with-a-us560-billion-war-chest-big-tech-goes-on-pandemic-ma-spree-despite-political-backlash</url> )</p><p>\"The cultural industry exception has been interpreted to be very, very broad,\" Appleton, who represented UPS in the case, said in an interview with the Post.</p><p>A similar interpretation of the power of cultural protection knocked U.S. specialty cable channel Country Music Television (CMT) out of the country in favour of a domestically-controlled rival channel in a dispute that began in 1994, he said.</p><p>\"The cultural industries exemption gives Canada policy tools to protect its industries against the U.S.,\" Appleton said, but this will be evident \"if, and only if, the Canadian government wants to support Canadian cultural industries.\"</p><p>In light of the \"unbelievably strong\" illustrations of past regulatory and policy discretion in this area, Appleton said he doesn't see how anyone could argue that the government lacked the power to act, though he didn't rule out the possibility of retaliation from the United States.</p><p>The cultural industry exemption was a point of contention during USMCA negotiations, and while the protection was carried forward from NAFTA, additional language on dispute settlement and retaliation were added.</p><p>The digital sphere specifically allows for a response of \"equivalent commercial effect,\" according to the text of the new trade deal.</p><p>\"Preserving and enhancing Canada's news industry could result in a risk of retaliation,\" Appleton said, adding that he would expect \"a great deal of 'huffing and puffing'\" if Canada were to impose a tax or other measure against the large U.S. tech firms.</p><p>However, given the uneasy relationship between the U.S. administration and tech firms, such as a recent flare-up between U.S. President Donald Trump and Twitter, he predicted such \"bravado and threats (would) quickly shift to a diplomatic discussion.\"</p><p>These \"social media platforms simply do not have the necessary type of united support of Congress and the U.S. administration,\" he said.</p><p>\"The likelihood of bluster is high. The real risk of a real trade war over fair treatment of Canadian cultural industries in the media is low.\"</p><p>Appleton described his first-hand experience with Canada's cultural protections in the UPS challenge under the 1992 NAFTA agreement. At its conclusion, the majority of a three-member arbitration tribunal found that UPS could not compete with or replace Canada Post in delivering magazines in this country.</p><p>A UPS logo on a truck in California.</p><p>In a decision in May 2007, the tribunal majority noted that a postal subsidy for some 1,200 eligible Canadian publications helped fulfill Canada's \"cultural and social\" policy aims. These included connecting Canadians to each other through accessible \"cultural products\" and sustaining and developing the publishing industry.</p><p>UPS had argued that the delivery mechanism fell outside the purview of the cultural industries exception in the trade agreement.</p><p>The panel majority disagreed, stating that the exception essentially removed \"from the scope of NAFTA 'any measure adopted or maintained with respect to cultural industries.'\"</p><p>The language \"is expansive indeed, serving to introduce into NAFTA an admittedly broad exception. This is intentionally so,\" the decision reads, adding that evidence in the case showed that this was understood by the parties during the trade agreement negotiations and implementation.</p><p>The tribunal added that this intent had been carried over from the Free Trade Agreement in the 1980s. The provision ensures that \"a party's ability to pursue its domestic cultural policies would be virtually unimpaired by these trade and investment agreements,\" the tribunal majority wrote in the UPS decision.</p><p>Appleton said what the decision demonstrated to him was the broad application of the cultural protections inherent in trade deals, even at the expense of good policy and regulatory aims such as efficiency.</p><p>\"Even if it's entirely unreasonable, it's totally up to Canada,\" he said.</p><p>The case of Country Music Television (CMT), which played out years earlier in the mid-1990s, is another example of the established power of cultural industry protection in Canada, Appleton said.</p><p>CMT, a U.S. channel with nearly two million subscribers in Canada and a 10-year history of broadcasting in this country, was forced off Canadian airwaves in 1994 when Canada's broadcast regulator licensed a similar channel to be launched by a Canadian broadcaster.</p><p>CMT appealed the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission decision in Canada's federal court of appeal, but lost on the grounds that it had known since it began broadcasting in Canada that it could be bounced if a rival domestic channel was launched. However, the U.S. cable channel then filed a petition alleging that the CRTC's action violated terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement by discriminating against a U.S. firm.</p><p>U.S. trade representatives threatened retaliation against Canada, and CMT boycotted all Canadian country music artists who did not have contracts with a U.S. record company, but the crisis was averted when the operators of the new Canadian music channel struck a deal to sell a minority stake in their channel to CMT.</p><p>\"The Americans went nuts ... but then they negotiated a deal, because the (cultural protection) exception is so broad,\" Appleton said.</p><p>\"Canada made concessions to the U.S. - but the advent of the cultural industries exemption strengthened Canada's hand and made negotiation the result rather than a trade war.\"</p><p>Financial Post</p><p>.

Amazon shares slumped 4.6 percent and Apple dipped 1 percent.</p><p>US President Donald Trump has called for closer scrutiny of social media companies and Google, accusing them of suppressing conservative voices online, without presenting any evidence.</p><p>He has repeatedly criticized Amazon for taking advantage of the US Postal Service, also without evidence. Trump has frequently taken aim at Amazon's Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, who privately owns the Washington Post, a newspaper which often criticizes Trump.</p><p>Leading lawmakers on both sides of the aisle welcomed potential investigations of big tech firms.</p><p>Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Republican, told Reuters that the business model of companies like Google and Facebook needs to be scrutinized.\u00a0\"It's got so much power, and so unregulated,\" he said. </p><p>Another Republican, Senator Marsha Blackburn, said the panel would do what she called a \"deeper dive\" into big tech companies.</p><p>Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, who said on Monday that US enforcers have to do more than wring their hands about the companies' clout, also weighed in.</p><p>\"Their predatory power grabs demand strict &amp; stiff investigation &amp; antitrust action,\" the Connecticut senator wrote on Twitter.</p><p>Separately, the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee opened its own investigation into competition in digital markets, with both Republicans and Democrats expressing concern about the power exercised by tech giants.</p><p>News broke on Friday that the Justice Department was laying the groundwork to investigate Google to determine whether the world's biggest online advertising platform was using its size to squeeze out smaller competitors, violating laws designed to ensure fair competition.\u00a0</p><p>The Washington Post reported on Saturday that Amazon would come under the remit of the FTC in any probe.\u00a0</p><p>While the four technology companies, all worth hundreds of billions of dollars, have drawn scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world, it was not clear what the US Justice Department or FTC plan to focus on, Reuters said.</p><p>Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer, has been criticized for holding sway over third-party sellers on its website, who must pay for advertising to compete against first-party and private label sales by Amazon itself.</p><p>Lawmakers have also argued that Amazon's low prices have hurt brick-and-mortar retailers, many of whom have closed because they could not compete.</p><p>Apple is the subject of a European Union investigation into a complaint made by streaming music provider Spotify Technology that Apple abuses its power over app downloads. In 2014, the iPhone maker settled a Justice Department lawsuit alleging it conspired with publishers to raise the price of e-books.</p><p>The FTC has already been investigating Facebook's sharing of data belonging to 87 million of its users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Facebook said in April that it expected to be fined up to US$5 billion by the regulator.</p><p>Facebook, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp and has more than 1.5 billion daily users, has a huge influence in many countries and has been criticized for allowing misleading posts and so-called 'fake news' on its service.</p><p>Google has faced accusations that its web search service, which has become so dominant that it is now a verb, leads consumers to its own products at the cost of competitors.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HKEJIT-2153971</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HKEJIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W89-ND51-DXM8-X17S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402685</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"740\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 EJ Insight of Hong Kong Economic Journal Co., Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>EJ Insight</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5530\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 4, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, which enforce antitrust laws in the United States, have divided oversight over the four companies, two sources said, with Amazon and Facebook under the watch of the FTC, and Apple and Google under the Justice Department. With jurisdiction established, the next step is for the two federal agencies to decide if they want to open formal investigations. Results are not likely to be quick. </p><p>A previous FTC probe of Google took more than two years. Technology companies face a backlash in the United States and across the world, fueled by concerns among competitors, lawmakers and consumer groups that the firms have too much power and are harming users and business rivals. Shares of Facebook fell 7.5% on Monday while Google's owner Alphabet shed more than 6%. Amazon.com shares fell 4.6% and Apple dipped 1%. The Justice Department and FTC generally do not discuss investigations. U.S. President Donald Trump has called for closer scrutiny of social media companies and Google[1], accusing them of suppressing conservative voices online, without presenting any evidence. He has repeatedly criticized Amazon[2] for taking advantage of the U.S. Postal Service[3], also without evidence. Trump has frequently taken aim at Amazon's Chief Executive Jeff Bezos[4], who privately owns the Washington Post, a newspaper which often criticizes Trump.Lawmakers weigh inLeading lawmakers on both sides of the aisle welcomed potential investigations of big tech firms. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Republican, told Reuters that the business model of companies like Google and Facebook needs to be scrutinized. 'It's got so much power, and so unregulated,' he said. Another Republican, Senator Marsha Blackburn, said the panel would do what she called a 'deeper dive' into big tech companies. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, who said on Monday that U.S. enforcers have to do more than wring their hands about the companies' clout, also weighed in. 'Their predatory power grabs demand strict ...iff investigation ...titrust action,' the Connecticut senator wrote on Twitter. Separately, the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee opened its own investigation into competition in digital markets, with both Republicans and Democrats expressing concern about the power exercised by tech giants. News broke on Friday that the Justice Department was laying the groundwork to investigate Google to determine whether the world's biggest online advertising platform was using its size to squeeze out smaller competitors, violating laws designed to ensure fair competition. The company declined comment on Monday. The Washington Post reported on Saturday that Amazon would come under the remit of the FTC in any probe. Amazon declined comment on Monday. People briefed on the matter say neither the Justice Department nor the FTC have contacted Google or Amazon about any probes, and that company executives are unaware of what issues regulators are reviewing. Apple and Facebook did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Monday.Regulatory ScrutinyWhile the four technology companies, all worth hundreds of billions of dollars, have drawn scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world, it was not clear what the U.S. Justice Department or FTC planned to focus on. Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer, has been criticized for holding sway over third-party sellers on its website[5], who must pay for advertising to compete against first-party and private label sales by Amazon itself. Lawmakers have also argued that Amazon's low prices have hurt brick-and-mortar retailers, many of whom have closed because they could not compete. Apple is the subject of a European Union investigation into a complaint made by streaming music provider Spotify that Apple abuses its power over app downloads[6]. In 2014, the iPhone maker settled a Justice Department lawsuit alleging it conspired with publishers to raise the price of e-books[7]. The FTC has already been investigating Facebook's sharing of data belonging to 87 million of its users[8] with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Facebook said in April that it expected to be fined up to $5 billion by the regulator[9]. Facebook, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has more than 1.5 billion daily users, has a huge influence in many countries and has been criticized for allowing misleading posts and so-called 'fake news' on its service. Google has faced accusations that its web search service, which has become so dominant that it is now a verb, leads consumers to its own products at the cost of competitors. The FTC settled an investigation of Google in 2013 with a reprimand. The company has been fined multiple times by the European Union's competition regulator, most recently in March for 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) in a case focused on illegal practices[10] in search advertising brokering from 2006 to 2016. Legal experts have said U.S. regulators are unlikely to attempt to break up the technology giants. It is rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT...eing two of the biggest examples. U.S. antitrust probes more often result in an agreement to change certain business practices.

Results are not likely to be quick. A previous FTC probe of Google took more than two years.</p><p>Technology companies face a backlash in the United States and across the world, fueled by concerns among competitors, lawmakers and consumer groups that the firms have too much power and are harming users and business rivals.</p><p>Shares of Facebook Inc fell 7.5% on Monday while Google's owner Alphabet Inc shed more than 6%. Amazon.com Inc shares fell 4.6% and Apple Inc dipped 1%.</p><p>The Justice Department and FTC generally do not discuss investigations.</p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump has called for closer scrutiny of social media companies and Google, accusing them of suppressing conservative voices online, without presenting any evidence.</p><p>He has repeatedly criticized Amazon for taking advantage of the U.S. Postal Service, also without evidence. Trump has frequently taken aim at Amazon's Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, who privately owns the Washington Post, a newspaper which often criticizes Trump.</p><p>LAWMAKERS WEIGH IN</p><p>Leading lawmakers on both sides of the aisle welcomed potential investigations of big tech firms.</p><p>Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, a Republican, told Reuters that the business model of companies like Google and Facebook needs to be scrutinized. \"It's got so much power, and so unregulated,\" he said. Another Republican, Senator Marsha Blackburn, said the panel would do what she called a \"deeper dive\" into big tech companies.</p><p>Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal, who said on Monday that U.S. enforcers have to do more than wring their hands about the companies' clout, also weighed in.</p><p>\"Their predatory power grabs demand strict &amp; stiff investigation &amp; antitrust action,\" the Connecticut senator wrote on Twitter.</p><p>Separately, the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee opened its own investigation into competition in digital markets, with both Republicans and Democrats expressing concern about the power exercised by tech giants.</p><p>News broke on Friday that\u00a0the Justice Department was laying the groundwork to investigate Google to\u00a0determine whether the world's biggest online advertising platform was using its size to squeeze out smaller competitors, violating laws designed to ensure fair competition. The company declined comment on Monday.</p><p>The Washington Post reported on Saturday that Amazon would come under the remit of the FTC in any probe. Amazon declined comment on Monday.</p><p>People briefed on the matter say neither the Justice Department nor\u00a0the FTC have contacted Google or Amazon about any probes, and that company executives are unaware of what issues regulators are reviewing.</p><p>Apple and Facebook did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Monday.</p><p>REGULATORY SCRUTINY</p><p>While the four technology companies, all worth hundreds of billions of dollars, have drawn scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers around the world, it was not clear what the U.S. Justice Department or FTC planned to focus on.</p><p>Amazon, the world's biggest online retailer, has been criticized for holding sway over third-party sellers on its website, who must pay for advertising to compete against first-party and private label sales by Amazon itself. Lawmakers have also argued that Amazon's low prices have hurt brick-and-mortar retailers, many of whom have closed because they could not compete.</p><p>Apple is the subject of a European Union investigation into a complaint made by streaming music provider Spotify Technology SA that Apple abuses its power over app downloads. In 2014, the iPhone maker settled a Justice Department lawsuit alleging it conspired with publishers to raise the price of e-books.</p><p>The FTC has already been investigating Facebook's sharing of data belonging to 87 million of its users with the now-defunct British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Facebook said in April that it expected to be fined up to $5 billion by the regulator.</p><p>Facebook, which owns one-time rivals Instagram and WhatsApp and has more than 1.5 billion daily users, has a huge influence in many countries and has been criticized for allowing misleading posts and so-called 'fake news' on its service.</p><p>Google has faced accusations that its web search service, which has become so dominant that it is now a verb, leads consumers to its own products at the cost of competitors.</p><p>The FTC settled an investigation of Google in 2013 with a reprimand. The company has been fined multiple times by the European Union's competition regulator, most recently in March for 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) in a case focused on illegal practices in search advertising brokering from 2006 to 2016.</p><p>Legal experts have said U.S. regulators are unlikely to attempt to break up the technology giants.</p><p>It is rare to break up a company but not unheard of, with Standard Oil and AT&amp;T being two of the biggest examples. U.S. antitrust probes more often result in an agreement to change certain business practices.</p><p>Reporting by Diane Bartz and Jan Wolfe in Washington; Additional reporting by Nandita Bose, Susan Cornwell, Roberta Rampton, David Shepardson and Stephen Nellis; Editing by Bill Rigby</p><p>Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRPNDE-145999767</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRPNDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W88-P031-F11P-X4N7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411452</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"976\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Yerepouni Daily News.

Among the most noteworthy findings: </p><p>-- The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/united-states\">United States</url> ranks No. 7 overall, bolstered by being seen as the most powerful country.

Those sentiments are part of a larger narrative in which political scientists say worries are growing over an increasingly unstable world. Last week, the Eurasia Group rated this year's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2020-01-10/us-elections-seen-as-top-global-risk\">U.S. presidential election as the world's top risk</url>. </p><p>In Asia, concerns are growing of an increasingly institutionalized Cold War between the U.S. and China, says Zhang Baohui, professor of political science and director of the Centre for Asian-Pacific Studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. \"Hot spots like the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea would be more likely to trigger military conflicts between the two countries,\" Zhang said by email. </p><p>In Europe, the public mood is increasingly anxious about climate change, employment and migration, says Karel Lannoo, CEO of the Centre for European Policy Studies, a nonpartisan think tank based in Brussels. But larger worries are whether countries can work together to preserve geopolitical stability, Lannoo says. </p><p>\"Compare the mood around the world today, compare this to 30 years ago, right after the fall of the Berlin Wall. It was a very hopeful world; we are at the end of that cycle. It is a less free world, with more illiberal democracies.\" </p><p>The Best Countries report and subsequent rankings are based on how people's perceptions define countries in terms of a number of qualitative characteristics. The 2020 report focuses on global perceptions of 73 nations. </p><p>The rankings are formed in partnership between U.S. News &amp; World Report, BAV Group (a unit of global marketing communications company VMLY&amp;R) and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/university-of-pennsylvania-01194\">Wharton School</url> of the University of Pennsylvania. The rankings include 65 metrics. </p><p>The survey's results show respondents reward stability, transparency and equality, say analysts. Switzerland and Canada rank second and third, respectively, as the best countries to conduct business, trailing only Luxembourg. The U.S., by contrast, ranks 45th among the 73 countries assessed in that category. </p><p>Canada is seen as the world's most transparent country, followed by Nordic countries <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/norway\">Norway</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/denmark\">Denmark</url> and . Switzerland ranks No. 5, while the U.S. improved one spot from 2019 to rank No. 18. </p><p>Seven of the top 10 countries overall also rank among the top 10 countries for gender equality, including No. 8 Sweden that is seen as the best country for gender equality. Approximately 90% of survey respondents agreed with the statement that women should have the same rights as men. But just 64% say women actually enjoy the same economic opportunities as men in their country. </p><p>Nearly 4 out of 5 respondents agreed that LGBTQ individuals should be entitled to the same rights as non-LGBTQ individuals, with women (82%) agreeing more than men (76%), and 18- to 24-year-olds registering the highest share of sentiment that strongly agrees with that view (37.4%). </p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. enters a presidential election year with its people and politics highly polarized. Last week, Eurasia Group, a political risk and consulting firm, rated the U.S. domestic politics as the world's top global risk, the first time America has entered into the group's top five worldwide risks. </p><p>In a separate global survey, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/01/08/trump-ratings-remain-low-around-globe-while-views-of-u-s-stay-mostly-favorable/\">Pew found</url> earlier this month that opinions of the U.S. are generally positive, but that views of President Donald Trump remains low. Those negative views are especially strong in Western European countries. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Senior Data Editor Deidre McPhillips contributed to this report.</emphasis><br/></p><p/><p>Kevin Drew is the assistant managing editor of Best Countries, which he helped develop and launch for U.S. News &amp; World Report in 2016.

That's the word from the U.S. president saying that talks with North Korea might be back on, adding predictably, we'll see what happens.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Also ahead -- the vote counting in Ireland is well under way.

We ask an expert about the challenges they're facing. </p><p> Live from CNN World Headquarters in Atlanta.  We want to welcome our viewers here in the United States and around the world.  I'm George Howell.  CNN NEWSROOM starts right now.</p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p> HOWELL:  5:00 am on the U.S. East Coast.  The peace summit between North Korea and the United States, the one that President Trump canceled Thursday, it is back on again, maybe.  </p><p> The Trump administration is apparently working on the assumption that a summit with North Korea may happen after all.  This about-face one day after the U.S. president sent a letter to Kim Jong-un, explicitly cancelling their historic meeting in Singapore set for June 12th.  </p><p> President Trump now tweeting both sides are engaged in productive talks that could revive the meeting.  Earlier, he told reporters he was encouraged by the conciliatory tone coming from Korea.  We get more from CNN's Pamela Brown.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PAMELA BROWN, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President Trump indicating the summit he already canceled with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may, in fact, still happen.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Mr. President, is the summit still on? DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're going to see what happens.  We're talking to them now.  It was a very nice statement they put out.  It could even be the 12th.  We're talking to them now.  They very much want to do it.  We'd like to do it.  We'll see what happens.</p><p> BROWN (voice-over):  Just one day ago citing North Korea's open hostility toward the U.S., President Trump declared the meeting was off but did leave the door wide open.</p><p> TRUMP:  If and when Kim Jong-un chooses to engage in constructive dialogue and actions, I am waiting.</p><p> BROWN (voice-over):  He didn't need to wait long.  The president's apparent 180 on the meeting comes after what Trump called a, quote, \"warm and productive statement\" from North Korea in a tweet.  </p><p> That statement praising the president, saying President Trump made a brave decision and his efforts to make the summit happen.  And the summit is desperately needed for the improvement of the relationship. We reiterate to the U.S. that we are willing to sit face-to-face at any time and in any way.  </p><p> When asked today if he was worried the North Koreans are playing games, the president said -- </p><p> TRUMP:  Everybody plays games.  You know that.</p><p> BROWN (voice-over):  And secretary of state James Mattis is expressing optimism.</p><p> GEN. JAMES MATTIS, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  Equal give and take of trying to put together big summits and stuff.  So diplomats are still at work.  And from our point, here at the Defense Department, that's a fine thing.</p><p> BROWN (voice-over):  The White House is reiterating that the president is serious about the meeting.</p><p> SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president's not just looking to have a meeting.  He's not looking for just a cheap political stunt.  He wants to get something that's a long lasting and actual real solution.  </p><p> And if the meeting takes place on June 12th, we'll be ready.  If it takes place on July 12th, we'll be ready.  We'll do whatever is necessary to prepare for that on that front.</p><p> BROWN (voice-over):  As uncertainty looms over that potentially historic summit, the president is sowing more confusion over the FBI's use of a confidential human source to better monitor Russian activities, a source who made contact with several Trump campaign advisers.  </p><p> Trump is once again alleging a massive conspiracy with zero evidence, tweeting, \"Can anyone even imagine having spies placed in a competing campaign by the people and party and absolute power for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain?\"</p><p> But Republican lawmakers confidently briefed Thursday on the use of that confidential source aren't yet coming to the president's defense or saying much at all.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Were you surprised with what you learned?</p><p> SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R), MAJORITY LEADER:  Nothing particularly surprising but, again, it was classified so there's no real report I can give to you.</p><p> BROWN:  As for North Korea, I spoke to a senior administration official who says the White House is more optimistic than expected and attributed that to North Korea's conciliatory statement praising the president and saying that it wants to talk any time, any place.  </p><p> Also the fact that the communications with the North Koreans have reopened contributed to this change in outlook.  However, the official cautioned that anything can happen between now and June 12th.  </p><p> [05:05:00]</p><p> BROWN:  Pamela Brown, CNN, the White House.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HOWELL:  Pamela, thank you for the reporting.</p><p> Now live in Seoul, South Korea, CNN correspondent Matt Rivers, standing by following developments there.  </p><p> Matt, just give it a day.  I feel like I've got whiplash from the 180 here.  Talk to us about the reaction there, this reversal by the U.S. president.  </p><p> What has been the response from South Korean officials there?</p><p> MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, whiplash is a really good way to put it, George.  It has been really a back-and-forth 36 to 48 hours here in South Korea.  Start with the incredibly deep feelings of disappointment, the major setback felt by the South Korean government after that announcement from President Trump.  </p><p> It was South Korean president Moon Jae-in that really played the role of middle man between North Korea and the United States.  Its biggest proponent, the summit's biggest proponent of happening was the South Korean president.  And then the president made that announcement.  </p><p> That said, ever since that announcement happened, we really had step after step after step that seems to push the likelihood that the summit might happen even again on June 12th higher and higher.  </p><p> And to that, we got a reaction from South Korea.  The spokesperson for the office of the president said in a statement, in part, \"It is fortunate that the embers of the North Korea-U.S. dialogue are not going out but are coming back up again.  We are watching the development carefully.\"  </p><p> George, it's worth noting there that they're not really coming out and saying they're expecting the summit to happen.  I think maybe some lessons were learned over the past week or so.  </p><p> You have the national security adviser here a couple days ago saying he was 99.9 percent sure that the June 12th summit was going to happen and then the President of the United States made that announcement.  </p><p> So I think there's cautious optimism here in South Korea.  But they are keeping a little bit in reserve because, just like the rest of us, the South Korean government is not sure how this is going to play out.</p><p> HOWELL:  As the president usually says, we'll have to wait and see. Matt Rivers, live for us in Seoul, South Korea.  Thank you.</p><p> Let's talk more about this now with Peter Matthews.  He's a professor of political science at Cypress College joining us from Los Angeles this hour.  </p><p> Peter, good to have you here again on the show.</p><p> Again, this on again, off again approach to this summit.  Is this Trumpian theater that we're seeing or some sort of negotiating tactic?</p><p> What do you make of what's happening so far?</p><p> PETER MATTHEWS, CYPRESS COLLEGE:  It's a very dangerous tactic that could explode at any time in the wrong way because diplomacy needs consistency, it needs a measured approach.  And this way no one knows what's going to happen and the people you're negotiating with can't really trust you.  </p><p> It's very concerning especially with nuclear weapons in the background.  We'll have to see where this goes.</p><p> HOWELL:  It was very interesting to see the president's response, very personalized, using the words \"I\" and \"me\" but also the North Korean response very telling, really, the key to opening this possibility again of talks.  </p><p> What do you read from the North Korean reaction to President Trump's cancellation?</p><p> MATTHEWS:  I think North Korea is acting sophisticatedly.  They're saying let's be calm and cool about it since Trump is not and bring him back to the table so we can show we have the upper hand here in being able to set the agenda even meeting.  </p><p> If President Trump is walking away like that, we want him to come to the table so we can have a good deal that will help all of us, especially the North Koreans, to have equal footing with the United States across the table and to get these nuclear weapons challenges under control and have a peace treaty signed.  They want a peace treaty. HOWELL:  Let's talk just a bit more about that because we understand that there are discussions that are happening.  We don't know exactly what is being said, who is having those discussions at this point.  </p><p> But the greater question is this, given what we do know, given what we have seen, who wants this more, Peter, in your view?</p><p> Is it North Korea, looking to take a new approach with the possibility of seeing sanctions lifted?</p><p> Is it President Trump, who has staked a great deal of his presidency on this being a possible legacy moment, even worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize and those commemorative coins that we have seen?</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MATTHEWS:  I think those coins are what's motivating Trump.  No, actually, the peace prize is something he'd really like to have. President Obama got it and he wants to keep up with President Obama. It's a big prize for him if he can bring across a negotiation that's successful.  </p><p> But I think North Korea also wants it.  Their economy is not doing well with the sanctions that have been plied against them for so long and they're concerned about Trump's unpredictability and he's probably showed them he can do things that have never been imagined before.  </p><p> But I do believe both sides want this to a large extent.  But they have to keep their heads, especially Trump has got to keep a cooler head and not let John Bolton run the show because he's the one who made this last event occur, that North Korea walked -- that Trump walked away because North Korea was upset at Bolton saying that the Libyan model would be used, which meant the destruction of the --</p><p> [05:10:00]</p><p> MATTHEWS:  -- dictator -- for example, Moammar Gadhafi in Libya -- when he agreed to give up his nuclear weapons in exchange for working with the U.S. and having economic aid.  </p><p> In the end he got overthrown by NATO-backed forces led by the U.S.  He never got the economic aid from the U.S.  So North Korea doesn't want to suffer the same fate.  They are concerned about getting this settled.  </p><p> That was a very bad comparison that Bolton made by saying the Libya model could be used.  And that really blew things up in the latest negotiation.</p><p> HOWELL:  It seems like things may be getting back on track.  But another question within the region, South Korea, a very important U.S. ally.  They say that there is no daylight between the United States and South Korea.  But clearly that nation has been caught in between very unpredictable parties.</p><p> MATTHEWS:  Yes, in fact, South Korea was a major player in this. President Moon helped to bring President Trump and Kim to the -- leader Kim to the table.  And yet they have the biggest stake in it. So does Japan.  Yet Trump treated both Japan and South Korea, our closest allies there, with impunity.  He didn't even notify them that he was going to call off this latest meeting.  </p><p> He made that announcement about calling off the meeting without even letting them know about it.  So it's not a very good way to treat your allies.  And if you treat your allies that way, what could your opponents think about whether they can trust you or not?  </p><p> It's a real problem.</p><p> HOWELL:  The other nation in play here, China.  </p><p> Where does China factor into all of this, in your view?</p><p> MATTHEWS:  In a big way.  China has a lot of influence with North Korea, if it chose to use it, because 90 percent of North Korean trade is with China.  And China has also agreed to put stricter sanctions on North Korea.  And that helped to bring them to the table.  </p><p> But now China has got problems with the United States because Trump has upped the ante about China-U.S. trade.  He wants to force China to buy $200 billion worth more of United States goods than what we sell them, what we buy them.  </p><p> So this is the problem with using trade as a weapon and mixing it up with diplomacy on this most critical of nuclear issues, nuclear weapons issues.  I think China has a major role to play.  But Trump has to handle them the right way.  I think that's what's really required here.</p><p> HOWELL:  All right.  We'll see where this goes in the days ahead. Peter Matthews, thanks so much for your time and perspective.</p><p> MATTHEWS:  My pleasure.  Thank you.</p><p> HOWELL:  The stories still ahead but live pictures of vote counting under way in Ireland.  It could be history in the making and a major victory for supporters of abortion rights.  CNN is live in Dublin, Ireland, ahead.</p><p> Plus, the E.U. rolling out new data laws and some tech giants are already breaking the rules.  We'll explain as CNN NEWSROOM pushes ahead. </p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> [05:15:00]</p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p> HOWELL:  Live images in Dublin, Ireland.  Terms like \"landslide\" and \"historic\" are being bandied there.  If exit polls are correct, voters have decided they want to throw out some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the developed world.  And it appears the decision was not even close.  </p><p> Again, they're still counting ballots right now.  Our Atika Shubert is watching it all live from Dublin.  </p><p> Atika, first of all, tell us about how important this is and what more are we learning from these exit polls?</p><p> ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it appears that this will be an historic day.  It would be a significant public shift here if these exit poll numbers are correct.  </p><p> What RTE, the Irish broadcaster, has said in their exit poll numbers is that nearly 70 percent of respondents voted in favor of amending the constitution and legalizing abortion here in Ireland with only 30 percent against.  So that's a tremendous change.  </p><p> Now we're waiting for the vote to continue to be counted, actually tallied here in Dublin Castle.  And then we'll get the official results in a few hours.  But we're already starting to see reaction from those yes campaigners, abortion rights campaigners.  They have been, obviously, very happy with the exit poll numbers that have come out.  </p><p> We've also been hearing from the other side as well, specifically from the Save the Eighth campaign, spearheaded by John McGurk (ph).  He has put out a tweet, the eighth amendment referring to the amendments in Ireland's constitution, which basically recognized the right of the unborn as equal to the right of the mother.  </p><p> That was the legal basis for banning abortion here.  He put out a tweet now just saying once those exit polls came out, quote,  \"The eighth did not create an unborn child's right to life.  It merely acknowledged it.  The right exists independent of what a majority says.  That said, with the result of that magnitude, clearly there was very little to be done.  Thank you to every no voter and campaigner.\"  </p><p> So clearly it seems to be a concession there that the no side of this has lost and the yes side of this has won.  But, again, still waiting for those official results, which should come in, in the next two hours or so -- George.</p><p> HOWELL:  Atika, if you could share with our viewers the context here. The legacy of this issue in Ireland, given the deep roots of the Catholic Church there, this would, as you point out, present a major shift in opinions.</p><p> SHUBERT:  It's a huge shift.  It's seismic really.  You know, keeping in mind, Ireland has always had some of the toughest laws on abortion in Europe in the Western world and it was codified into the constitution in 1983, with this referendum putting in the eighth amendment.  </p><p> But now it appears, with these numbers coming in, that has been completely reversed.  And I think one of the most significant factors of this was hearing from so many women in Ireland, talking about these harrowing experiences they had in trying to seek abortions.  </p><p> And we heard from younger women, coming out, talking about how isolated and alone they felt, how frightened they were as teenagers but also from older women, who talked about how difficult it was, even when they had medical complications, such as fatal fetal abnormalities.  </p><p> So I think it was those personal stories that really made a difference with voters.</p><p> HOWELL:  Atika Shubert, live for us in Dublin, Ireland.  We'll continue to watch the votes being counted and report any information as it's confirmed.  Thank you for the reporting.  We'll stay in touch with you.</p><p> The European Union has just rolled out sweeping new data protection laws.  And it's not just affecting people in Europe.  You've been getting e-mails, I'm sure, from websites, telling you they've updated their privacy policies.  It's all part of the E.U.'s new general data protection regulation, simply called GDPR.  </p><p> Legal experts say big tech companies like Facebook and Google, that they're already breaking the rules and they could face billions of dollars in fines.  The law only affects companies that handle data of E.U. residents.  And only E.U. residents can legally enforce it. </p><p> But it's already leading some corporations to change how they handle data for all of their customers.  </p><p> Here's a quick look at the GDPR.  Companies must ask in plain language if they can collect your data.  And hiding the consent in a small text of general terms and conditions, that doesn't count.  </p><p> If you ask a company, it must tell you how it uses your data.  It must also give you an opportunity to permanently delete that data if you so choose.  Businesses will also be required to tell authorities about any data breach within 72 hours of discovering it.  </p><p> The law affects any organization that stores or uses data on E.U. residents, regardless of where it's based.  Let's talk --</p><p> [05:20:00]</p><p> HOWELL:  -- a bit more about this with Jesse Bockstedt.  Jesse is an associate professor of information systems at Emory University.  </p><p> Jesse, good to have you with us again.  Funny thing; my wife has a small business.  I opened an e-mail.  There's a note from her.  All companies small and big have to comply with this, flooding our inboxes.  Many people are finding it.  </p><p> What exactly does this mean for consumers, who have asked for more control over their personal data? JESSE BOCKSTEDT, EMORY UNIVERSITY:  Well, I think this means we'll be asked for consent a lot more than we are used to.  Traditionally, consent means clicking on an end user license agreement when we sign up for an account.  </p><p> Now these E.U. regulations are requiring companies to get consent on all different ways they'll use, capture and process our data.  And so I think these e-mails are just the beginning.  </p><p> For those of us in the U.S., we're seeing this because companies that operate in the U.S. and in the European Union are kind of taking -- changing their policies across the board to be prepared for this in Europe.  </p><p> And I think, you know, hopefully, users will take advantage of these new rights they have, rights to access, right to erasure.  They may not.  Privacy research has shown us that this privacy paradox, where users tend to say they want more privacy and more control over their data online but often act the opposite to that in the things that they do, they way they post, the actions they take on these types of online services.  So we'll see how much users take advantage of these.</p><p> HOWELL:  Very interesting.  These regulations apply specifically to Europe, residents in the E.U.  But what we're seeing around the world, here in the United States, companies that are taking a blanket approach to this, as you point out, is Europe really setting the stage here for the rest of the world to follow?</p><p> BOCKSTEDT:  I think so.  They do tend to have a much stronger stance on privacy in Europe than we are used to here in the United States. But I think the users all across the world are -- especially in wake of some of the most recent scandals -- how pervasive these technologies have become in our lives, users are wanting more control and privacy.  </p><p> And the European Union's new regulations are strong.  And the fines that go along with them can be severe.  So it shows that they are taking a very strong stance on this with companies.</p><p> HOWELL:  Briefly here and we pointed this out, companies are required to notify users within 72 hours of any breach.  </p><p> How does a company carry that out?</p><p> BOCKSTEDT:  It's difficult.  I think, technically, they have to notify the governing authority within 72 hours.  And then users within a reasonable amount of time after that.  </p><p> For large companies, this can be very difficult with large amounts of data, complex systems, just understanding the scope of the breach. From what I understand, the regulation is they have to notify the governing body within 72 hours if they've determined there's been some sort of jeopardy to privacy of their users.  </p><p> Just figuring that out in 72 hours can be difficult for large companies.  And small, medium-sized businesses, they may not have even the resources to figure these things out within 72 hours.  </p><p> So it would be very interesting to see how this is enforced and the types of penalties that come along with it and just in general how much -- how many resources and things are spent by companies in order to be prepared for breaches.  </p><p> Breaches have become very commonplace.  Some recent reports that I've seen have shown there are over 2,000 breaches known just within the last year.  So I think we'll see companies communicating a lot more with users about potential breaches.  We may get breach notification overload from companies.  But I think the stakes are really high.</p><p> HOWELL:  The pressure clearly on.  OK.  I want to talk about one person that is certainly on the hot seat, the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, for transparency, for security issues.  And he was in Europe.  He spoke with regulators there.  And he spoke about regulation.  Let's listen to what he had to say.</p><p> BOCKSTEDT:  Sure.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, COFOUNDER AND CEO, FACEBOOK:  I think the Internet is becoming increasingly important in people's lives.  Some sort of regulation is important and inevitable. </p><p> And the important thing is to get this right and to make sure that we have regulatory frameworks that help protect people, that are flexible, so that they allow for innovation, that don't inadvertently prevent new technologies like AI from being able to develop.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HOWELL:  But critics say that Zuckerberg danced around a lot of their questions, that Facebook is still dancing around, skirting around some of these regulations.  </p><p> What were the biggest takeaways from your perspective about what he had to say?</p><p> BOCKSTEDT:  I think regulation is something that's scary for these companies, largely because, with the GDPR, it's moving toward an opt- in type scenario, where users have to opt-in to sharing their data.  </p><p> These companies have primarily operated on an opt-out type model up to this point, assuming we can use your data unless you opt out.  And we know from psychology and behavioral economics that --</p><p> [05:25:00]</p><p> BOCKSTEDT:  -- users tend to stick with the default.  If the default is you can't use my data and I have to opt in, I think a lot fewer users are going to be opting in to share their data, which will have pretty dramatic impacts on revenue for a lot of these businesses. They may have to rethink their business models.   So Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook do want their customers to feel safe on Facebook.  But, at the same time, they want to make revenue and regulations that can prevent them from making revenue in the ways they have been, through targeted advertising using personal data.  If that goes away, that's a -- that jeopardizes their potential to make money.</p><p> HOWELL:  Jesse Bockstedt, thank you for your time and perspective. We'll stay in touch with you.</p><p> BOCKSTEDT:  I appreciate it.  Thank you.</p><p> HOWELL:  Still ahead here on CNN NEWSROOM, CNN takes you on a rare journey through North Korea's countryside.

That according to a source and this video reviewed by CNN.  </p><p> Special counsel Robert Mueller questioned the Russian oligarch.  His name Victor Vekselberg.  Mueller asked him about a meeting at Trump Tower.  In this video, you can see Vekselberg, wearing the hat, waiting to go up to Cohen's Trump Tower office.  </p><p> The source says the aim of the meeting was to improve U.S.-Russia relations.  A firm connected to Vekselberg paid Cohen more than $500,000 for consulting work.  Last month, the U.S. imposed sanctions on the oligarch for election interference.  </p><p> In this exclusive report, CNN's Matthew Chance tried to ask Victor Vekselberg about his connection to Michael Cohen.  But, as you'll see, Vekselberg wasn't exactly forthcoming about it.</p><p> MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Mr. Vekselberg, a quick question from CNN, thank you, thank you.  </p><p> Mr. Vekselberg, why did your company pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to President Trump's lawyer?</p><p> VICTOR VEKSELBERG, RUSSIAN OLIGARCH:  Thank you, not now.</p><p> Really appreciate it.  </p><p> Just later, OK?</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> VEKSELBERG:  I understand.  You, you are so aggressive.  No, no, no. Please leave.

Kilauea is turning parts of that state's big island into a volcanic wasteland.  More people are being forced to leave.  </p><p> This as molten lava flows onto the streets there.  Active fissures are bubbling up, pushing lava up to the surface in one part of the big island and ash flumes are being thrown 10,000 feet, some 3 kilometers into the air.  And it takes just minutes for this volcano's destructive fury to engulf homes.  Take a look at this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This house, this house, house on that side over there, also gone.  This is insane.  Lava is advancing about, I don't know, 3 feet per minute, 2 feet per minute.  And we have -- we are seeing this river move across this lawn, taking that house in a matter of minutes.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HOWELL:  Wow.  CNN's Stephanie Elam was near the volcano when lava fountains opened up out of nowhere.  Here's her report.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Thick waves of fresh lava blaze a path down a mount of --</p><p> [05:35:00]</p><p> ELAM (voice-over):  -- volcanic rock.  This didn't exist just a few days ago.</p><p> STEVE GEBBIE, HAWAII RESIDENT:  We gambled and maybe didn't win.</p><p> ELAM (voice-over):  Every day, Steve Gebbie heads into Leilani Estates to check on the house he built by hand.  Only one way to his place remains but this road is now scarred with jagged cracks, a byproduct of Kilauea's eruption.  </p><p> Steve says some folks in the neighborhood patched the road enough to make it passable, at least for now.  </p><p> When we first met Steve three weeks ago, it was just days after the eruption began.  Back then, he thought his home would be gone by now.</p><p> GEBBIE:  There's three fissures right next to my house.  What I'm thinking is that they're going to grab a hold of each other.</p><p> ELAM (voice-over):  Steve's fear turned to fact.  The fissures have banded together into a massive volcanic complex.  Kilauea's eruption is callous in its haphazardness, leaving residents who haven't lost their homes with a sick vein of hope each day.</p><p> ELAM:  So how do you feel being back here right now?</p><p> GEBBIE:  A little numb.  At this point, we're kind of numb.  It's been three weeks.  The heart breaks slowly. ELAM (voice-over):  Just a few hundred feet from his driveway, lava continues to ooze closer.  It's already taken out some homes here, swallowed by the unforgiving molten rock, tin roofs at rest in a sea of black.</p><p> GEBBIE:  It almost looks like it's going to fill in this basin and then I'm -- when that happens is when all hell is going to break loose at the top.</p><p> ELAM:  We were just standing down here now five minutes ago and there was no lava fountain to be seen.  But look at this now.  It's like it came out of nowhere.  You can hear it.  The ash is blowing around. We're told by residents that as early as this morning, this looked deep, deep red.  </p><p> ELAM (voice-over):  As the winds pick up, the heat of the lava field scorches past.</p><p> GEBBIE:  It's just a matter of time.  I don't know what's going to be left of Leilani.  I really think it might be wiped out.</p><p> ELAM (voice-over):  A seemingly endless supply of lava fueling Steve's nightmare that his house will be lost to Kilauea -- Stephanie Elam, CNN, Leilani estates, Hawaii.</p><p> HOWELL:  What an image.  What devastation there.</p><p> Now to the U.S. Gulf Coast.  The first named storm of the 2018 hurricane season is set to hit -- get this -- just as Americans get ready to celebrate the holiday weekend.</p><p> (WEATHER REPORT)</p><p> HOWELL:  It is a race against time and a virus in Congo.  You'll hear from the health officials trying to keep the outbreak of Ebola there from turning into a full-blown epidemic.  Details ahead. </p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> [05:40:00]</p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p> HOWELL:  Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM.  </p><p> There's a desperate effort under way in the Democratic Republic of Congo to stop an Ebola outbreak from exploding into a full-blown epidemic.  The focus right now, the presence of the deadly virus in a crowded trading hub, which leads straight into Congo's capital.  Our Zain Asher explains.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ZAIN ASHER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Health workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo are in a life-or-death battle to stop the spread of an Ebola outbreak first reported in early May.  The challenge is magnified by the difficult conditions and the lack of any local health care infrastructure.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Getting in vaccines, getting in freezers, having enough fuel so these freezers can function in the area where you don't really have electricity.  You need to have vaccination teams to be trained so they know exactly what they need to do.</p><p> ASHER (voice-over):  In one case, the relatives of three Ebola patients helped them leave a hospital isolation ward.  One was about to be discharged but the other two were highly infectious and died within 24 hours.  </p><p> Health workers are trying to trace anyone who may have been infected after coming into contact with them.  They're also trying to educate those at risk about the virus.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  It is very important that family members of the patient understand the risk of spreading the disease when they keep the sick at home.  If people understand that, there will be less chance that they'll want to escape.  It is a hospital, not a prison.  We cannot lock everything up.</p><p> ASHER (voice-over):  The World Health Organization says efforts to halt a full-blown epidemic have reached a critical point.  There's particular concern about the presence of the virus in Mbandaka, a crowded trading hub on the Congo River with road, water and air links to Congo's capital, Kinshasa.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're on the epidemiological knife edge of this response.  The next few weeks will really tell if this outbreak is going to expand to urban areas or if we're going to be able to keep it under control.</p><p> ASHER (voice-over):  Ebola was first discovered in the Congo in the 1970s.  It spreads through direct contact with body fluids from an infected person.  More than 11,000 people died in an Ebola outbreak in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between 2013 and 2016 -- Zain Asher --</p><p> [05:45:00]</p><p> ASHER (voice-over):  -- CNN, New York.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HOWELL:  Joining me now to talk more about this is Dr. Gianfranco Rotigliano, he is the acting UNICEF representative in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  </p><p> It's good to have you with us, sir, to talk more about this problem. UNICEF, obviously, putting a great deal of emphasis on schools, on children who may be at risk.  Tell us more about that approach and how it's being received so far. GIANFRANCO ROTIGLIANO, UNICEF:  Well, as you know, children are always vulnerable.  And in this kind of epidemic, they are, of course, one of the weakest link of the chain.  And we work for children and with children. </p><p> And mostly the schools are open, as you know, and, therefore, this is a place where we have communication with them, where we discuss together what should be done and what should not be done in order to face the epidemic.  </p><p> In each school, there's a washing hands facility, there's thermometers to get the temperature in order to check every child when they come and when they leave so that if there is a case of fever or a child that is not feeling well, we can identify that child, put it in isolation, in a small isolation place, and then take care of that child.  </p><p> And that is great because the children are, as you know, are open.  So they collaborate.  They are happy to collaborate.  They are really participating.  And it's so good to see them, how they get into that business with such enthusiasm.</p><p> HOWELL:  So obviously, the focus on children receiving the messages and then seeing that play out throughout families.  Let's talk more about what we've seen before.  </p><p> The region during the outbreak between 2014 and 2015, you see here, the math, the number of cases, the number of deaths.  This was quite a big outbreak at the time and there was concern, obviously, that the situation could have gotten much worse.  </p><p> Here's how one health official describes efforts now to get a grip on what's happening.  Let's listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Getting in vaccines, getting in freezers, having enough fuel so these freezers can function in the area where you don't really have electricity.  You need vaccination teams to be trained so they know exactly what they need to do, how to get the consent, how to define eligibility of a contact and contact of contacts.  So all of that has to be done in a very short period.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HOWELL:  So Dr. Rotigliano, talk to us more about that.  Is there a concern that if measures are not ramped up right now that we could see something similar in size and scope?</p><p> ROTIGLIANO:  No, I don't think -- well, of course, nobody can say that.  Not 100 percent sure but we don't think so.  We are in all places, we have a few places where, yes, he is right.  It is very difficult to get the vaccines there but the vaccines are getting there.  </p><p> After tomorrow, Monday, the vaccination will start and then, following that, we will start in the other two places.  So I'm confident that we get to handle that kind of challenge.  We do the communication side and the logistics, together with the UNESCO and WHO and MSF that is under way.  </p><p> Now the problem, I mean, the risk is the city of Mbandaka, where so far you only have four cases.  If we have more in Mbandaka and in a number that is really huge, then that can be a great risk.  </p><p> But we are putting the emphasis in responding, in following a track of all the contacts that are in Mbandaka.  The whole operation is very well aware that this is a risk.  And the vaccination is available.  So I think that we shouldn't get there.</p><p> HOWELL:  And, obviously, pushing very important topics, like safe burials, hand washing, very important.  We know that your group is certainly spreading that message.  Dr. Gianfranco Rotigliano, thank you so much for your time and perspective today.  We'll stay in touch with you.</p><p> ROTIGLIANO:  Thank you very much.  Bye-bye.</p><p> HOWELL:  After the break, CNN takes you to witness the earth-shaking destruction of North Korea's nuclear test site. </p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> [05:50:00]</p><p> (SPORTS)</p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p> HOWELL:  North Korea put on a dramatic show for journalists Thursday in a place that many Westerners have never seen, destroying a nuclear test site.  CNN's Will Ripley was among those invited to witness the event.  His trip was tightly controlled, though he filed this reporter's notebook about the extraordinary journey.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  From the moment I landed in Wonsan, I knew this story was unlike any other:  18 trips to North Korea and this country still keeps me guessing.  </p><p> For more than 24 hours, we didn't even know if our trip to the Punggye-ri nuclear site would happen.  The rhetoric with the U.S. was really heating up.  Only when we boarded the bus did we know it was a go.  </p><p> We rode for more than 12 hours on a North Korean luxury train.  It was surreal, a 10-course banquet with all the blinds closed and strict orders not to film outside.  We also couldn't film on the drive to the nuclear site.   Arriving at Punggye-ri was surreal.  The buildings were log cabins, almost like a summer camp, it was definitely not what I expected.  We had to carry our gear and hike for what felt like ages --</p><p> [05:55:00]</p><p> RIPLEY (voice-over):  -- up steep ravines to get to observation posts built specifically for us.  </p><p> We visited tunnel after tunnel, the same tunnels North Korea has used to conduct six nuclear tests since 2006, all of them full of explosives, football-sized bags strung with wires.  We even had lunch provided by the North Koreans, ham and cucumber sandwiches, surrounded by buildings that would be blown up just hours later.  </p><p> The explosions were huge, earth-shaking.  They sent rocks and debris flying.  We found some of it scattered later hundreds of feet away.  I can only imagine what it felt like during those nuclear tests.  </p><p> It was totally impossible to verify if what we were seeing, if all those dramatic explosions, actually made the nuclear site unusable as the North Koreans claim.  </p><p> For the nuclear officials onsite, there was almost a sense of sadness, watching more than a decade of hard work go up in smoke -- Will Ripley, CNN, at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, North Korea.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HOWELL:  Our reporters covering the world for you.

We ask an expert about the challenges they're facing.</p><p>Live from CNN World Headquarters in Atlanta. We want to welcome our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm George Howell. CNN NEWSROOM starts right now.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>HOWELL: 5:00 am on the U.S. East Coast. The peace summit between North Korea and the United States, the one that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>canceled Thursday, it is back on again, maybe.</p><p>The <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>is apparently working on the assumption that a summit with North Korea may happen after all. This about-face one day after the U.S. president sent a letter to <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un, </nameText></person>explicitly cancelling their historic meeting in Singapore set for June 12th.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>now tweeting both sides are engaged in productive talks that could revive the meeting. Earlier, he told reporters he was encouraged by the conciliatory tone coming from Korea. We get more from CNN's Pamela Brown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAMELA BROWN, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>indicating the summit he already canceled with North Korean <person><nameText>leader Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>may, in fact, still happen.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. President, is the summit still on? <person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to see what happens. We're talking to them now. It was a very nice statement they put out. It could even be the 12th. We're talking to them now. They very much want to do it. We'd like to do it. We'll see what happens.</p><p>BROWN (voice-over): Just one day ago citing North Korea's open hostility toward the U.S., <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>declared the meeting was off but did leave the door wide open.</p><p>TRUMP: If and when <person><nameText>Kim Jong-un </nameText></person>chooses to engage in constructive dialogue and actions, I am waiting.</p><p>BROWN (voice-over): He didn't need to wait long. The president's apparent 180 on the meeting comes after what Trump called a, quote, \"warm and productive statement\" from North Korea in a tweet.</p><p>That statement praising the president, saying <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>made a brave decision and his efforts to make the summit happen. And the summit is desperately needed for the improvement of the relationship. We reiterate to the U.S. that we are willing to sit face-to-face at any time and in any way.</p><p>When asked today if he was worried the North Koreans are playing games, the president said --</p><p>TRUMP: Everybody plays games. You know that.</p><p>BROWN (voice-over): And secretary of state James Mattis is expressing optimism.</p><p>GEN. JAMES MATTIS, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: Equal give and take of trying to put together big summits and stuff. So diplomats are still at work. And from our point, here at the Defense Department, that's a fine thing.</p><p>BROWN (voice-over): The White House is reiterating that the president is serious about the meeting.</p><p>SARAH SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president's not just looking to have a meeting. He's not looking for just a cheap political stunt. He wants to get something that's a long lasting and actual real solution.</p><p>And if the meeting takes place on June 12th, we'll be ready. If it takes place on July 12th, we'll be ready. We'll do whatever is necessary to prepare for that on that front.</p><p>BROWN (voice-over): As uncertainty looms over that potentially historic summit, the president is sowing more confusion over the FBI's use of a confidential human source to better monitor Russian activities, a source who made contact with several Trump campaign advisers.</p><p>Trump is once again alleging a massive conspiracy with zero evidence, tweeting, \"Can anyone even imagine having spies placed in a competing campaign by the people and party and absolute power for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain?\"</p><p>But Republican lawmakers confidently briefed Thursday on the use of that confidential source aren't yet coming to the president's defense or saying much at all.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Were you surprised with what you learned?</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R), MAJORITY LEADER: Nothing particularly surprising but, again, it was classified so there's no real report I can give to you.</p><p>BROWN: As for North Korea, I spoke to a senior administration official who says the White House is more optimistic than expected and attributed that to North Korea's conciliatory statement praising the president and saying that it wants to talk any time, any place.</p><p>Also the fact that the communications with the North Koreans have reopened contributed to this change in outlook. However, the official cautioned that anything can happen between now and June 12th.</p><p>[05:05:00]</p><p>BROWN: Pamela Brown, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL: Pamela, thank you for the reporting.</p><p>Now live in Seoul, South Korea, CNN correspondent Matt Rivers, standing by following developments there.</p><p>Matt, just give it a day. I feel like I've got whiplash from the 180 here. Talk to us about the reaction there, this reversal by the U.S. president.</p><p>What has been the response from South Korean officials there?</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, whiplash is a really good way to put it, George. It has been really a back-and-forth 36 to 48 hours here in South Korea. Start with the incredibly deep feelings of disappointment, the major setback felt by the South Korean government after that announcement from <person><nameText>President Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>It was South Korean president Moon Jae-in that really played the role of middle man between North Korea and the United States. Its biggest proponent, the summit's biggest proponent of happening was the South Korean president. And then the president made that announcement.</p><p>That said, ever since that announcement happened, we really had step after step after step that seems to push the likelihood that the summit might happen even again on June 12th higher and higher.</p><p>And to that, we got a reaction from South Korea. The spokesperson for the office of the president said in a statement, in part, \"It is fortunate that the embers of the North Korea-U.S. dialogue are not going out but are coming back up again. We are watching the development carefully.\"</p><p>George, it's worth noting there that they're not really coming out and saying they're expecting the summit to happen. I think maybe some lessons were learned over the past week or so.</p><p>You have the national security adviser here a couple days ago saying he was 99.9 percent sure that the June 12th summit was going to happen and then the President of the United States made that announcement.</p><p>So I think there's cautious optimism here in South Korea. But they are keeping a little bit in reserve because, just like the rest of us, the South Korean government is not sure how this is going to play out.</p><p>HOWELL: As the president usually says, we'll have to wait and see. Matt Rivers, live for us in Seoul, South Korea. Thank you.</p><p>Let's talk more about this now with Peter Matthews. He's a professor of political science at Cypress College joining us from Los Angeles this hour.</p><p>Peter, good to have you here again on the show.</p><p>Again, this on again, off again approach to this summit. Is this Trumpian theater that we're seeing or some sort of negotiating tactic?</p><p>What do you make of what's happening so far?</p><p>PETER MATTHEWS, CYPRESS COLLEGE: It's a very dangerous tactic that could explode at any time in the wrong way because diplomacy needs consistency, it needs a measured approach. And this way no one knows what's going to happen and the people you're negotiating with can't really trust you.</p><p>It's very concerning especially with nuclear weapons in the background. We'll have to see where this goes.</p><p>HOWELL: It was very interesting to see the president's response, very personalized, using the words \"I\" and \"me\" but also the North Korean response very telling, really, the key to opening this possibility again of talks.</p><p>What do you read from the North Korean reaction to <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>cancellation?</p><p>MATTHEWS: I think North Korea is acting sophisticatedly. They're saying let's be calm and cool about it since Trump is not and bring him back to the table so we can show we have the upper hand here in being able to set the agenda even meeting.</p><p>If <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is walking away like that, we want him to come to the table so we can have a good deal that will help all of us, especially the North Koreans, to have equal footing with the United States across the table and to get these nuclear weapons challenges under control and have a peace treaty signed. They want a peace treaty. HOWELL: Let's talk just a bit more about that because we understand that there are discussions that are happening. We don't know exactly what is being said, who is having those discussions at this point.</p><p>But the greater question is this, given what we do know, given what we have seen, who wants this more, Peter, in your view?</p><p>Is it North Korea, looking to take a new approach with the possibility of seeing sanctions lifted?</p><p>Is it <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>who has staked a great deal of his presidency on this being a possible legacy moment, even worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize and those commemorative coins that we have seen?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MATTHEWS: I think those coins are what's motivating Trump. No, actually, the peace prize is something he'd really like to have. President Obama got it and he wants to keep up with President Obama. It's a big prize for him if he can bring across a negotiation that's successful.</p><p>But I think North Korea also wants it. Their economy is not doing well with the sanctions that have been plied against them for so long and they're concerned about Trump's unpredictability and he's probably showed them he can do things that have never been imagined before.</p><p>But I do believe both sides want this to a large extent. But they have to keep their heads, especially Trump has got to keep a cooler head and not let John Bolton run the show because he's the one who made this last event occur, that North Korea walked -- that Trump walked away because North Korea was upset at Bolton saying that the Libyan model would be used, which meant the destruction of the --</p><p>[05:10:00]</p><p>MATTHEWS: -- dictator -- for example, Moammar Gadhafi in Libya -- when he agreed to give up his nuclear weapons in exchange for working with the U.S. and having economic aid.</p><p>In the end he got overthrown by NATO-backed forces led by the U.S. He never got the economic aid from the U.S. So North Korea doesn't want to suffer the same fate. They are concerned about getting this settled.</p><p>That was a very bad comparison that Bolton made by saying the Libya model could be used. And that really blew things up in the latest negotiation.</p><p>HOWELL: It seems like things may be getting back on track. But another question within the region, South Korea, a very important U.S. ally. They say that there is no daylight between the United States and South Korea. But clearly that nation has been caught in between very unpredictable parties.</p><p>MATTHEWS: Yes, in fact, South Korea was a major player in this. President Moon helped to bring <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and Kim to the -- leader Kim to the table. And yet they have the biggest stake in it. So does Japan. Yet Trump treated both Japan and South Korea, our closest allies there, with impunity. He didn't even notify them that he was going to call off this latest meeting.</p><p>He made that announcement about calling off the meeting without even letting them know about it. So it's not a very good way to treat your allies. And if you treat your allies that way, what could your opponents think about whether they can trust you or not?</p><p>It's a real problem.</p><p>HOWELL: The other nation in play here, China.</p><p>Where does China factor into all of this, in your view?</p><p>MATTHEWS: In a big way. China has a lot of influence with North Korea, if it chose to use it, because 90 percent of North Korean trade is with China. And China has also agreed to put stricter sanctions on North Korea. And that helped to bring them to the table.</p><p>But now China has got problems with the United States because Trump has upped the ante about China-U.S. trade. He wants to force China to buy $200 billion worth more of United States goods than what we sell them, what we buy them.</p><p>So this is the problem with using trade as a weapon and mixing it up with diplomacy on this most critical of nuclear issues, nuclear weapons issues. I think China has a major role to play. But Trump has to handle them the right way. I think that's what's really required here.</p><p>HOWELL: All right. We'll see where this goes in the days ahead. Peter Matthews, thanks so much for your time and perspective.</p><p>MATTHEWS: My pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>HOWELL: The stories still ahead but live pictures of vote counting under way in Ireland. It could be history in the making and a major victory for supporters of abortion rights. CNN is live in Dublin, Ireland, ahead.</p><p>Plus, the E.U. rolling out new data laws and some tech giants are already breaking the rules. We'll explain as CNN NEWSROOM pushes ahead.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[05:15:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>HOWELL: Live images in Dublin, Ireland. Terms like \"landslide\" and \"historic\" are being bandied there. If exit polls are correct, voters have decided they want to throw out some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the developed world. And it appears the decision was not even close.</p><p>Again, they're still counting ballots right now. Our Atika Shubert is watching it all live from Dublin.</p><p>Atika, first of all, tell us about how important this is and what more are we learning from these exit polls?</p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it appears that this will be an historic day. It would be a significant public shift here if these exit poll numbers are correct.</p><p>What RTE, the Irish broadcaster, has said in their exit poll numbers is that nearly 70 percent of respondents voted in favor of amending the constitution and legalizing abortion here in Ireland with only 30 percent against. So that's a tremendous change.</p><p>Now we're waiting for the vote to continue to be counted, actually tallied here in Dublin Castle. And then we'll get the official results in a few hours. But we're already starting to see reaction from those yes campaigners, abortion rights campaigners. They have been, obviously, very happy with the exit poll numbers that have come out.</p><p>We've also been hearing from the other side as well, specifically from the Save the Eighth campaign, spearheaded by John McGurk (ph). He has put out a tweet, the eighth amendment referring to the amendments in Ireland's constitution, which basically recognized the right of the unborn as equal to the right of the mother.</p><p>That was the legal basis for banning abortion here. He put out a tweet now just saying once those exit polls came out, quote, \"The eighth did not create an unborn child's right to life. It merely acknowledged it. The right exists independent of what a majority says. That said, with the result of that magnitude, clearly there was very little to be done. Thank you to every no voter and campaigner.\"</p><p>So clearly it seems to be a concession there that the no side of this has lost and the yes side of this has won. But, again, still waiting for those official results, which should come in, in the next two hours or so -- George.</p><p>HOWELL: Atika, if you could share with our viewers the context here. The legacy of this issue in Ireland, given the deep roots of the Catholic Church there, this would, as you point out, present a major shift in opinions.</p><p>SHUBERT: It's a huge shift. It's seismic really. You know, keeping in mind, Ireland has always had some of the toughest laws on abortion in Europe in the Western world and it was codified into the constitution in 1983, with this referendum putting in the eighth amendment.</p><p>But now it appears, with these numbers coming in, that has been completely reversed. And I think one of the most significant factors of this was hearing from so many women in Ireland, talking about these harrowing experiences they had in trying to seek abortions.</p><p>And we heard from younger women, coming out, talking about how isolated and alone they felt, how frightened they were as teenagers but also from older women, who talked about how difficult it was, even when they had medical complications, such as fatal fetal abnormalities.</p><p>So I think it was those personal stories that really made a difference with voters.</p><p>HOWELL: Atika Shubert, live for us in Dublin, Ireland. We'll continue to watch the votes being counted and report any information as it's confirmed. Thank you for the reporting. We'll stay in touch with you.</p><p>The European Union has just rolled out sweeping new data protection laws. And it's not just affecting people in Europe. You've been getting e-mails, I'm sure, from websites, telling you they've updated their privacy policies. It's all part of the E.U.'s new general data protection regulation, simply called GDPR.</p><p>Legal experts say big tech companies like Facebook and Google, that they're already breaking the rules and they could face billions of dollars in fines. The law only affects companies that handle data of E.U. residents. And only E.U. residents can legally enforce it.</p><p>But it's already leading some corporations to change how they handle data for all of their customers.</p><p>Here's a quick look at the GDPR. Companies must ask in plain language if they can collect your data. And hiding the consent in a small text of general terms and conditions, that doesn't count.</p><p>If you ask a company, it must tell you how it uses your data. It must also give you an opportunity to permanently delete that data if you so choose. Businesses will also be required to tell authorities about any data breach within 72 hours of discovering it.</p><p>The law affects any organization that stores or uses data on E.U. residents, regardless of where it's based. Let's talk --</p><p>[05:20:00]</p><p>HOWELL: -- a bit more about this with Jesse Bockstedt. Jesse is an associate professor of information systems at Emory University.</p><p>Jesse, good to have you with us again. Funny thing; my wife has a small business. I opened an e-mail. There's a note from her. All companies small and big have to comply with this, flooding our inboxes. Many people are finding it.</p><p>What exactly does this mean for consumers, who have asked for more control over their personal data? JESSE BOCKSTEDT, EMORY UNIVERSITY: Well, I think this means we'll be asked for consent a lot more than we are used to. Traditionally, consent means clicking on an end user license agreement when we sign up for an account.</p><p>Now these E.U. regulations are requiring companies to get consent on all different ways they'll use, capture and process our data. And so I think these e-mails are just the beginning.</p><p>For those of us in the U.S., we're seeing this because companies that operate in the U.S. and in the European Union are kind of taking -- changing their policies across the board to be prepared for this in Europe.</p><p>And I think, you know, hopefully, users will take advantage of these new rights they have, rights to access, right to erasure. They may not. Privacy research has shown us that this privacy paradox, where users tend to say they want more privacy and more control over their data online but often act the opposite to that in the things that they do, they way they post, the actions they take on these types of online services. So we'll see how much users take advantage of these.</p><p>HOWELL: Very interesting. These regulations apply specifically to Europe, residents in the E.U. But what we're seeing around the world, here in the United States, companies that are taking a blanket approach to this, as you point out, is Europe really setting the stage here for the rest of the world to follow?</p><p>BOCKSTEDT: I think so. They do tend to have a much stronger stance on privacy in Europe than we are used to here in the United States. But I think the users all across the world are -- especially in wake of some of the most recent scandals -- how pervasive these technologies have become in our lives, users are wanting more control and privacy.</p><p>And the European Union's new regulations are strong. And the fines that go along with them can be severe. So it shows that they are taking a very strong stance on this with companies.</p><p>HOWELL: Briefly here and we pointed this out, companies are required to notify users within 72 hours of any breach.</p><p>How does a company carry that out?</p><p>BOCKSTEDT: It's difficult. I think, technically, they have to notify the governing authority within 72 hours. And then users within a reasonable amount of time after that.</p><p>For large companies, this can be very difficult with large amounts of data, complex systems, just understanding the scope of the breach. From what I understand, the regulation is they have to notify the governing body within 72 hours if they've determined there's been some sort of jeopardy to privacy of their users.</p><p>Just figuring that out in 72 hours can be difficult for large companies. And small, medium-sized businesses, they may not have even the resources to figure these things out within 72 hours.</p><p>So it would be very interesting to see how this is enforced and the types of penalties that come along with it and just in general how much -- how many resources and things are spent by companies in order to be prepared for breaches.</p><p>Breaches have become very commonplace. Some recent reports that I've seen have shown there are over 2,000 breaches known just within the last year. So I think we'll see companies communicating a lot more with users about potential breaches. We may get breach notification overload from companies. But I think the stakes are really high.</p><p>HOWELL: The pressure clearly on. OK. I want to talk about one person that is certainly on the hot seat, the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, for transparency, for security issues. And he was in Europe. He spoke with regulators there. And he spoke about regulation. Let's listen to what he had to say.</p><p>BOCKSTEDT: Sure.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, COFOUNDER AND CEO, FACEBOOK: I think the Internet is becoming increasingly important in people's lives. Some sort of regulation is important and inevitable.</p><p>And the important thing is to get this right and to make sure that we have regulatory frameworks that help protect people, that are flexible, so that they allow for innovation, that don't inadvertently prevent new technologies like AI from being able to develop.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWELL: But critics say that Zuckerberg danced around a lot of their questions, that Facebook is still dancing around, skirting around some of these regulations.</p><p>What were the biggest takeaways from your perspective about what he had to say?</p><p>BOCKSTEDT: I think regulation is something that's scary for these companies, largely because, with the GDPR, it's moving toward an opt- in type scenario, where users have to opt-in to sharing their data.</p><p>These companies have primarily operated on an opt-out type model up to this point, assuming we can use your data unless you opt out. And we know from psychology and behavioral economics that --</p><p>[05:25:00]</p><p>BOCKSTEDT: -- users tend to stick with the default. If the default is you can't use my data and I have to opt in, I think a lot fewer users are going to be opting in to share their data, which will have pretty dramatic impacts on revenue for a lot of these businesses. They may have to rethink their business models. So Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook do want their customers to feel safe on Facebook. But, at the same time, they want to make revenue and regulations that can prevent them from making revenue in the ways they have been, through targeted advertising using personal data. If that goes away, that's a -- that jeopardizes their potential to make money.</p><p>HOWELL: Jesse Bockstedt, thank you for your time and perspective.

That according to a source and this video reviewed by CNN.</p><p>Special counsel Robert Mueller questioned the Russian oligarch. His name Victor Vekselberg. Mueller asked him about a meeting at Trump Tower. In this video, you can see Vekselberg, wearing the hat, waiting to go up to Cohen's Trump Tower office.</p><p>The source says the aim of the meeting was to improve U.S.-Russia relations. A firm connected to Vekselberg paid Cohen more than $500,000 for consulting work. Last month, the U.S. imposed sanctions on the oligarch for election interference.</p><p>In this exclusive report, CNN's Matthew Chance tried to ask Victor Vekselberg about his connection to Michael Cohen. But, as you'll see, Vekselberg wasn't exactly forthcoming about it.</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Mr. Vekselberg, a quick question from CNN, thank you, thank you.</p><p>Mr. Vekselberg, why did your company pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>lawyer?</p><p>VICTOR VEKSELBERG, RUSSIAN OLIGARCH: Thank you, not now.</p><p>Really appreciate it.</p><p>Just later, OK?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>VEKSELBERG: I understand.

Kilauea is turning parts of that state's big island into a volcanic wasteland. More people are being forced to leave.</p><p>This as molten lava flows onto the streets there. Active fissures are bubbling up, pushing lava up to the surface in one part of the big island and ash flumes are being thrown 10,000 feet, some 3 kilometers into the air. And it takes just minutes for this volcano's destructive fury to engulf homes. Take a look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This house, this house, house on that side over there, also gone. This is insane. Lava is advancing about, I don't know, 3 feet per minute, 2 feet per minute. And we have -- we are seeing this river move across this lawn, taking that house in a matter of minutes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWELL: Wow. CNN's Stephanie Elam was near the volcano when lava fountains opened up out of nowhere. Here's her report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Thick waves of fresh lava blaze a path down a mount of --</p><p>[05:35:00]</p><p>ELAM (voice-over): -- volcanic rock. This didn't exist just a few days ago.</p><p>STEVE GEBBIE, HAWAII RESIDENT: We gambled and maybe didn't win.</p><p>ELAM (voice-over): Every day, Steve Gebbie heads into Leilani Estates to check on the house he built by hand. Only one way to his place remains but this road is now scarred with jagged cracks, a byproduct of Kilauea's eruption.</p><p>Steve says some folks in the neighborhood patched the road enough to make it passable, at least for now.</p><p>When we first met Steve three weeks ago, it was just days after the eruption began. Back then, he thought his home would be gone by now.</p><p>GEBBIE: There's three fissures right next to my house. What I'm thinking is that they're going to grab a hold of each other.</p><p>ELAM (voice-over): Steve's fear turned to fact. The fissures have banded together into a massive volcanic complex. Kilauea's eruption is callous in its haphazardness, leaving residents who haven't lost their homes with a sick vein of hope each day.</p><p>ELAM: So how do you feel being back here right now?</p><p>GEBBIE: A little numb. At this point, we're kind of numb. It's been three weeks. The heart breaks slowly. ELAM (voice-over): Just a few hundred feet from his driveway, lava continues to ooze closer. It's already taken out some homes here, swallowed by the unforgiving molten rock, tin roofs at rest in a sea of black.</p><p>GEBBIE: It almost looks like it's going to fill in this basin and then I'm -- when that happens is when all hell is going to break loose at the top.</p><p>ELAM: We were just standing down here now five minutes ago and there was no lava fountain to be seen. But look at this now. It's like it came out of nowhere. You can hear it. The ash is blowing around. We're told by residents that as early as this morning, this looked deep, deep red.</p><p>ELAM (voice-over): As the winds pick up, the heat of the lava field scorches past.</p><p>GEBBIE: It's just a matter of time. I don't know what's going to be left of Leilani. I really think it might be wiped out.</p><p>ELAM (voice-over): A seemingly endless supply of lava fueling Steve's nightmare that his house will be lost to Kilauea -- Stephanie Elam, CNN, Leilani estates, Hawaii.</p><p>HOWELL: What an image.

The first named storm of the 2018 hurricane season is set to hit -- get this -- just as Americans get ready to celebrate the holiday weekend.</p><p>(WEATHER REPORT)</p><p>HOWELL: It is a race against time and a virus in Congo. You'll hear from the health officials trying to keep the outbreak of Ebola there from turning into a full-blown epidemic. Details ahead.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[05:40:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>HOWELL: Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>There's a desperate effort under way in the Democratic Republic of Congo to stop an Ebola outbreak from exploding into a full-blown epidemic. The focus right now, the presence of the deadly virus in a crowded trading hub, which leads straight into Congo's capital. Our Zain Asher explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ZAIN ASHER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Health workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo are in a life-or-death battle to stop the spread of an Ebola outbreak first reported in early May. The challenge is magnified by the difficult conditions and the lack of any local health care infrastructure.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Getting in vaccines, getting in freezers, having enough fuel so these freezers can function in the area where you don't really have electricity. You need to have vaccination teams to be trained so they know exactly what they need to do.</p><p>ASHER (voice-over): In one case, the relatives of three Ebola patients helped them leave a hospital isolation ward. One was about to be discharged but the other two were highly infectious and died within 24 hours.</p><p>Health workers are trying to trace anyone who may have been infected after coming into contact with them. They're also trying to educate those at risk about the virus.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): It is very important that family members of the patient understand the risk of spreading the disease when they keep the sick at home. If people understand that, there will be less chance that they'll want to escape. It is a hospital, not a prison. We cannot lock everything up.</p><p>ASHER (voice-over): The World Health Organization says efforts to halt a full-blown epidemic have reached a critical point. There's particular concern about the presence of the virus in Mbandaka, a crowded trading hub on the Congo River with road, water and air links to Congo's capital, Kinshasa.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're on the epidemiological knife edge of this response. The next few weeks will really tell if this outbreak is going to expand to urban areas or if we're going to be able to keep it under control.</p><p>ASHER (voice-over): Ebola was first discovered in the Congo in the 1970s. It spreads through direct contact with body fluids from an infected person. More than 11,000 people died in an Ebola outbreak in the West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between 2013 and 2016 -- Zain Asher --</p><p>[05:45:00]</p><p>ASHER (voice-over): -- CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL: Joining me now to talk more about this is Dr. Gianfranco Rotigliano, he is the acting UNICEF representative in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p><p>It's good to have you with us, sir, to talk more about this problem. UNICEF, obviously, putting a great deal of emphasis on schools, on children who may be at risk. Tell us more about that approach and how it's being received so far. GIANFRANCO ROTIGLIANO, UNICEF: Well, as you know, children are always vulnerable. And in this kind of epidemic, they are, of course, one of the weakest link of the chain. And we work for children and with children.</p><p>And mostly the schools are open, as you know, and, therefore, this is a place where we have communication with them, where we discuss together what should be done and what should not be done in order to face the epidemic.</p><p>In each school, there's a washing hands facility, there's thermometers to get the temperature in order to check every child when they come and when they leave so that if there is a case of fever or a child that is not feeling well, we can identify that child, put it in isolation, in a small isolation place, and then take care of that child.</p><p>And that is great because the children are, as you know, are open. So they collaborate. They are happy to collaborate. They are really participating. And it's so good to see them, how they get into that business with such enthusiasm.</p><p>HOWELL: So obviously, the focus on children receiving the messages and then seeing that play out throughout families. Let's talk more about what we've seen before.</p><p>The region during the outbreak between 2014 and 2015, you see here, the math, the number of cases, the number of deaths. This was quite a big outbreak at the time and there was concern, obviously, that the situation could have gotten much worse.</p><p>Here's how one health official describes efforts now to get a grip on what's happening. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Getting in vaccines, getting in freezers, having enough fuel so these freezers can function in the area where you don't really have electricity. You need vaccination teams to be trained so they know exactly what they need to do, how to get the consent, how to define eligibility of a contact and contact of contacts. So all of that has to be done in a very short period.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWELL: So Dr. Rotigliano, talk to us more about that. Is there a concern that if measures are not ramped up right now that we could see something similar in size and scope?</p><p>ROTIGLIANO: No, I don't think -- well, of course, nobody can say that. Not 100 percent sure but we don't think so. We are in all places, we have a few places where, yes, he is right. It is very difficult to get the vaccines there but the vaccines are getting there.</p><p>After tomorrow, Monday, the vaccination will start and then, following that, we will start in the other two places. So I'm confident that we get to handle that kind of challenge. We do the communication side and the logistics, together with the UNESCO and WHO and MSF that is under way.</p><p>Now the problem, I mean, the risk is the city of Mbandaka, where so far you only have four cases. If we have more in Mbandaka and in a number that is really huge, then that can be a great risk.</p><p>But we are putting the emphasis in responding, in following a track of all the contacts that are in Mbandaka. The whole operation is very well aware that this is a risk. And the vaccination is available. So I think that we shouldn't get there.</p><p>HOWELL: And, obviously, pushing very important topics, like safe burials, hand washing, very important. We know that your group is certainly spreading that message. Dr. Gianfranco Rotigliano, thank you so much for your time and perspective today. We'll stay in touch with you.</p><p>ROTIGLIANO: Thank you very much. Bye-bye.</p><p>HOWELL: After the break, CNN takes you to witness the earth-shaking destruction of North Korea's nuclear test site.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[05:50:00]</p><p>(SPORTS)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>HOWELL: North Korea put on a dramatic show for journalists Thursday in a place that many Westerners have never seen, destroying a nuclear test site. CNN's Will Ripley was among those invited to witness the event. His trip was tightly controlled, though he filed this reporter's notebook about the extraordinary journey.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): From the moment I landed in Wonsan, I knew this story was unlike any other: 18 trips to North Korea and this country still keeps me guessing.</p><p>For more than 24 hours, we didn't even know if our trip to the Punggye-ri nuclear site would happen. The rhetoric with the U.S. was really heating up. Only when we boarded the bus did we know it was a go.</p><p>We rode for more than 12 hours on a North Korean luxury train. It was surreal, a 10-course banquet with all the blinds closed and strict orders not to film outside. We also couldn't film on the drive to the nuclear site. Arriving at Punggye-ri was surreal. The buildings were log cabins, almost like a summer camp, it was definitely not what I expected. We had to carry our gear and hike for what felt like ages --</p><p>[05:55:00]</p><p>RIPLEY (voice-over): -- up steep ravines to get to observation posts built specifically for us.</p><p>We visited tunnel after tunnel, the same tunnels North Korea has used to conduct six nuclear tests since 2006, all of them full of explosives, football-sized bags strung with wires. We even had lunch provided by the North Koreans, ham and cucumber sandwiches, surrounded by buildings that would be blown up just hours later.</p><p>The explosions were huge, earth-shaking. They sent rocks and debris flying. We found some of it scattered later hundreds of feet away. I can only imagine what it felt like during those nuclear tests.</p><p>It was totally impossible to verify if what we were seeing, if all those dramatic explosions, actually made the nuclear site unusable as the North Koreans claim.</p><p>For the nuclear officials onsite, there was almost a sense of sadness, watching more than a decade of hard work go up in smoke -- Will Ripley, CNN, at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL: Our reporters covering the world for you.

I'm George Howell, CNN NEWSROOM starts right now.  </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>HOWELL:  At 4:01 on the U.S. East Coast, the peace summit between North Korea and the United States, the one that President Trump canceled Thursday?</p><p>Well, it is back on again, at least for now.  The Trump administration apparently working on the assumption that a summit with North Korea may happen after all.  This about-face a day after the U.S. president sent a letter to Kim Jong-un explicitly canceling their historic meeting in Singapore set for June 12th.  </p><p>President Trump now saying that both sides are engaged in productive talks that could revive the meeting.  Earlier he told reporters he was encouraged by the conciliatory tone coming from North Korea.  So it is a definite maybe at best at this point.  </p><p>It is still unclear though whether the U.S. advance team is headed to Singapore as originally planned.  </p><p>Our Kaitlan Collins picks it up from here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It is the latest case of diplomatic whiplash from President Trump; 24 hours after canceling his highly anticipated sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the president suggesting the summit in Singapore could happen after all.</p><p>TRUMP:  We will see what happens.  It could even be the 12th.</p><p>COLLINS:  In a stunning reversal, Trump telling reporters today his administration is back in touch with North Korea.</p><p>TRUMP:  We're talking to them now.  They very much want to do it. We'd like to do it.</p><p>COLLINS:  But his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said this the day before:</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S.  SECRETARY OF STATE:  We have received no response to our inquiries from them.</p><p>COLLINS:  Asked if Pyongyang is playing games, Trump said:</p><p>TRUMP:  Everybody plays games.  You know that.</p><p>COLLINS:  The developments coming one day after Trump revived talk of military action and vowed to continue economic sanctions.</p><p>TRUMP:  Our very strong sanctions, by far the strongest sanctions ever imposed and maximum pressure campaign will continue, as it has been continuing. COLLINS:  With North Korean officials maintaining they're still willing to sit down with the U.S.  at any time, in any format to resolve the problems.</p><p>The White House unable to answer if planning staff were still flying to Singapore later tonight, as expected.</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We will see.  We have still got a -- a few hours before that takes place.  But as I just said, we are going to be prepared if the meeting takes place on June 12, as the president indicated it still could this morning.  We will be ready one way or the other.</p><p>COLLINS:  Officials answering few questions about the summit's future, with only one formal press briefing this week.</p><p>TRUMP:  Nothing to do with Russia.</p><p>COLLINS:  And 463 days since President Trump's one and only solo press conference.</p><p>QUESTION:  Are you going to Singapore, Mr.  President? </p><p>COLLINS:  Now though the day that they canceled the summit, the president and his secretary of state said there had been a breakdown in communications between the United States and North Korea, that seems to have changed, with the president tweeting that we are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the summit, going on to say that he believes it still could happen on June 12th in Singapore but adding, if necessary, it will be extended beyond that date -- Kaitlan Collins, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL:  Kaitlan, thanks for the reporting.</p><p>And now live to Seoul, South Korea.  CNN correspondent Matt Rivers is standing by following developments there.  </p><p>Matt, oh, what a difference a day makes, right?</p><p>What is the reaction to this reversal from the South Korean perspective?</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, 24-36 hours ago things were very different here in South Korea.  There was deep disappointment.  It was a major setback, especially for South Korea's current government that had pushed so hard for this summit to take place.</p><p>Yet after all of this, what we've heard from the president --</p><p>[04:05:00]</p><p>RIVERS:  -- there is cautious optimism.  I'll read you a part of a statement that was sent by a spokesman for the president's office, that person saying it is fortunate that the embers of the North Korea- U.S. dialogue are not going out but are coming back up again.  We are watching the development carefully.  </p><p>And so that is definitely a note there of cautious optimism, George. But it is worth noting that they are not really showing their hands completely there at this point because consider just a couple days ago. </p><p>You had the national security adviser here in South Korea saying that he was 99.9 percent sure that the summit was going to happen.  And then, well, it didn't.  </p><p>So there is definitely some thought here in the South Korean government to say maybe we won't be too overly optimistic, even though right now things do appear to be trending towards the summit happening at some point.</p><p>HOWELL:  We'll just keep up with the ball there, Matt, thank you so much for the reporting.  </p><p>Let's put this into focus, this ,change of course.  Jasper Kim is the director of the Center for Conflict Management joining from Seoul, South Korea, and also from Brussels, Steven Erlanger, \"The New York Times\" chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe.  Good to have you both with us to talk about this.  </p><p>Steven, I want to start with you. </p><p>And Jasper Kim, jump right in after Steven if you would.  </p><p>But what is your first impression of what is going on here, the off- again on-again approach?</p><p>Is this Trumpian theater?</p><p>Is it a negotiating tactic, is it reckless, is it innovative, Steven?</p><p>STEVEN ERLANGER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\":  Well, I think Trumpian theater, hyperbole and negotiation all go together if I can be honest. We haven't really heard much again from North Korea.  I'd like to hear what they have to say.  I mean Trump clearly feels North Korea needs the sanction relief, wants the summit.  </p><p>I'm not sure it helps to humiliate Pyongyang this way.  But if the summit is back on, the nice thing is it may give the United States a little bit more time to prepare.  What worries quite a lot of people is that Trump will rush into a summit, look for something that sounds like success and not be too careful about the details.  </p><p>That, I think, is a big concern because North Korea is a nuclear country.  It is not like Iran developing nuclear weapons.  That was the allegation.  North Korea has them.  It has lots of them.  It has missiles.  It is a wholly different and dangerous situation.  </p><p>So let's hope it is back on.  One thing you should note is the coin, the famous coin that was minted, didn't have a date.  It only said 2018.  So we have the whole rest of the year to make that come true.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOWELL:  The devil in the details, though, as you rightly point out.  </p><p>Jasper Kim, your thoughts here.</p><p>JASPER KIM, CENTER FOR CONFLICT MANAGEMENT:  Well, I think this is somewhat to be expected because we have two very unconventional political figures.  And both of them actually view the world stage as political theater.  And they are both looking to create a narrative.  </p><p>And from North Korea's perspective, they want to pitch the narrative such that their nuclear state, that is defensively postured, not offensively postured.  Whether that is the truth or not, that is what they want to craft.  </p><p>And on Donald Trump's side, of course, he has the television and media background.  He wants to basically exploit that and create an image that he is bringing success to the table.  He doesn't want to be perceived as going to the negotiating table out of fear.</p><p>He wants to be perceived as having no fear to negotiate.  And so I think that is why he retracted a little bit, trying to maximize his bargaining power before stepping in, if he does step back in.</p><p>HOWELL:  And I want to look at these images, just to show Kim Jong-un, again, these the most recent pictures of Kim Jong-un.  And what we're seeing a very relaxed leader of North Korea, wearing the white suit as opposed to the black suit.  All of this happening during this reversal coming from the U.S. president.  </p><p>Jasper, I want to ask you about the North Korean response.  It was very measured compared to what we've seen from North Korea in the past.  </p><p>How important a factor do you think that was in the possibility of these talks being restored?</p><p>KIM:  Well, I think it is noteworthy, George.  And what we have is an ironic twist here with the two political figures.  Usually it is the North Korean side that is really aggressive in their tone and this is taken from the Korean language.  If you do a direct translation, oftentimes, it is a little bit awkward when it is translated into English.  </p><p>But here we have North Korea actually striking a conciliatory tone when Donald Trump pulled out of the June 12th Singapore summit originally.  And so I think what we have is something very, very interesting.  </p><p>These two political figures are trying to negotiate and they see a little bit of each other in terms of negotiation style, they recognize it.  And even the small things, like Kim Jong-un's suit for example --</p><p>[04:10:00]</p><p>KIM:  -- being white, that could be a very neutral tone, it could be construed as a new era and an olive branch.  And we're trying to seek a peace with you, at least that is the nonverbals that I'm picking up from this side here in Seoul.</p><p>HOWELL:  I mentioned to Matt what a difference a day makes but what a difference a year makes, in fact, looking at where things are now.  </p><p>Steven, I want to get your take.  </p><p>Who do you think wants this more?</p><p>Is it North Korea, looking to see the possibility of sanctions lifted?</p><p>Is it President Trump, who sees this as a legacy moment even worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize?</p><p>ERLANGER:  Well, it is very hard to say.  I think at this time both of them want it.  I do think North Korea needs it more.  But I also think China is advising him along the way.  </p><p>The one thing I worry about is the Trump people still keep talking about denuclearization from the beginning.  And I really don't believe Kim is prepared to denuclearize.  It just would be an act of self-harm from North Korea's point of view.  </p><p>But its nuclear weapons protected from China as well as the United States.  One thing I might look to see if the summit takes place is talk of a peace treaty at long last between North and South Korea, in which Russia and China would have some sort of role as a kind of success before we get to the real nitty-gritty of denuclearization.  </p><p>Because if we get there, it will have to be staged, it will be very much involved with inspections, with intrusive foreign looks inside North Korea.  Very hard for me to imagine there will be a big agreement to denuclearize before economic sanctions are lifted.  I think if it is going to happen, it will have to be a long stage-by- stage process.</p><p>HOWELL:  A lot of serious questions that have yet to be answered. Steven Erlanger, live for us in Brussels and Jasper Kim, live in Seoul, South Korea, gentlemen, thank you for your time and perspective.  We'll keep in touch with you.</p><p>Live around the world, you're watching CNN NEWSROOM.  Still ahead -- </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWELL (voice-over):  -- you could call this proof that alcohol, attitude and altitude don't mix.  A bumpy ride from the islands to South Florida.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>HOWELL (voice-over):  Plus, he once called the shots in Hollywood. Now he is facing felony charges.  The latest in Harvey Weinstein's fall from grace and #MeToo rising.  Stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(HEADLINES) </p><p>[04:15:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p>HOWELL:  Live pictures from Dublin, Ireland.  Now you see an historic vote count getting under way on a referendum on whether to overturn some of the strictest abortion laws in the developed world.  Early exit polls say that the voters there want to happen and, if it doesn't, it will be a major change for Ireland.  </p><p>Our Atika Shubert is following all of this from Dublin.</p><p>Atika, obviously these results will be clear in the coming hours but tell us more about what you're learning from the exit polls, suggesting that a large number of people are voting for change.</p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely. Those ballot boxes just opened 15 minutes ago.  We will get the official results in a few hours.  But meanwhile, Ireland has already woken up to the exit polls.  </p><p>RTE, the Irish broadcaster, showing that nearly 70 percent of respondents voted in favor of amending the constitution and liberalizing abortion laws here in Ireland.  Only 30 percent against. Those are some decisive numbers.  We'll have to see how the official results compare.  </p><p>The count will actually be tallied here in Dublin Castle and then, of course, we'll get the results shortly afterwards.  But it does appear to be an historic day for Ireland.  And it is something that a number of people have been looking forward to, campaigners for decades campaigning for abortion rights. </p><p>And Ireland's prime minister last night putting out a tweet, thanking everybody for voting and saying it does look to be that history will be made today -- George.</p><p>HOWELL:  Again, if this does happen, it would be major change.  But help our viewers understand the legacy behind this issue in Ireland. Given the deep roots of the Catholic Church there, again, this would be a major shift in opinion.</p><p>SHUBERT:  Absolutely.  It is a seismic shift.  Ireland has had some of the strictest laws on abortion in Europe, in the Western world.  And in 1983, actually another referendum voted into the constitution, the eighth amendment, which said that the rights of the unborn are equal to the rights of the mother. </p><p>And that is what really was the legal basis for banning abortion this Ireland.  So this vote, if the official results mirror what we see in the exit polls, would completely reverse that.   And one of the most amazing things to come out of the debate on this is the number of stories that women have been coming forward, to tell about often these deeply and emotional and traumatic stories about how they have had to seek abortions to terminate pregnancies.  </p><p>We spoke to young women, teenagers who felt alone and isolated who had to travel abroad for terminations but also to older mothers, who -- one woman who we spoke to who had, very sadly, a fatal fetal abnormality and had to terminate the pregnancy.  And the sort of heartwrenching stories that came out that were in the public debate here.  </p><p>And I think that really showed the big societal shift that we saw happening in Ireland, not just in the debate running up to this but that has been going on for several decades now.</p><p>HOWELL:  And again, the results will be more clear in the coming hours But from what we're understanding, Atika, people are voting for a big change there.  Live in Dublin, Ireland, thank you so much for your time.  We'll stay in touch with you.  </p><p>The disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein is out on bail.  </p><p>[04:20:00]</p><p>HOWELL:  This after being charged with rape and criminal sexual acts. Weinstein has repeatedly denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex. But the arraignment Friday was a victory for more than 80 women who've accused him of sexual harassment or assault over several decades.  Our Brynn Gingras has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Hollywood megaproducer Harvey Weinstein in handcuffs, walking into court today, facing rape charges.  They stem from the accounts of two women, including an aspiring actress, who first spoke out in a 2017 \"New Yorker\" article, alleging Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him at his office in 2004.  </p><p>Tonight, Weinstein is out of jail after posting a $1 million cash bail but not before surrendering his passport, being forced to wear a monitoring device 24/7 and traveling only between New York and Connecticut.  </p><p>The criminal charges are the first to be filed against Weinstein after dozens of women including, several A-list actresses, made various sexual misconduct accusations against the media mogul last year, among them, Gwyneth Paltrow...</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) </p><p>GWYNETH PALTROW, ACTOR:  We had one instance in a hotel room, where he tried to -- where he made a pass at me.  And then I really kind of stood up to him.</p><p>GINGRAS (voice-over):  -- Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Lupita Nyong'o, Ashley Judd...</p><p>ASHLEY JUDD, ACTOR:  I fought with this volley of nos, which he ignored.</p><p>GINGRAS (voice-over):  -- and actress Rose McGowan, one of the first women to publicly accuse Weinstein of rape.</p><p>ROSE MCGOWAN, ACTOR:  We got you.  Yes.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCGOWAN:  To see him in cuffs on the way out, whether he smiled or not, that is a very good feeling.</p><p>GINGRAS (voice-over):  Weinstein denies having nonconsensual sex with any of his accusers and his attorney insisted today, his client is innocent.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My job is not to defend behavior.  My job is to defend something that is criminal behavior.  Bad behavior, Mr. Weinstein did not invent the casting couch in Hollywood.  And to the extent that there is bad behavior in that industry, that is not what this is about.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP, \"SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK\")</p><p>GINGRAS (voice-over):  It is a stunning fall for the man behind several major movies, like \"Silver Linings Playbook,\" \"The King's Speech\" and \"Shakespeare in Love,\" just to name a few, some of which earned Weinstein dozens of awards for his work behind the camera.  </p><p>But now he is the focus of investigations for alleged sex crimes, not just in New York but also in Los Angeles and London -- Brynn Gingras, CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL:  Brynn, thank you for the reporting.</p><p>The next time you fly and perhaps you've had one too many, remember this.  The law prohibits the airline from serving an intoxicated passenger.  That was apparently what started a bit of a mixup on board American Airlines, a flight from St. Croix to Miami on Wednesday.  </p><p>The video is a bit hard to hear but we'll take you through what happened when passenger Jason Felix wanted another drink.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE).  We'll be there in an hour.</p><p>Why are you upset?</p><p>(INAUDIBLE).</p><p>HOWELL (voice-over):  Got to remember, everybody has got a camera. People capture this.  It doesn't take long for Felix to get more animated, still demanding the flight attendant get him another drink and even taking jabs at the flight attendant.  </p><p>And it didn't end there.  Punches flew.  Other passengers jumped in to try to calm the man down.  According to a criminal complaint, Felix spit blood at one of them, even threatened to kill them.  </p><p>After this, the captain turned on the seat belt sign, he instructed everyone to return to their seats.  Eventually passengers were able to calm Felix down a bit, although he was still agitated, talking loudly, punching the overhead bins.  </p><p>When the plane landed in Miami, four officers from Miami-Dade Police went on board and, after a bit of friendly convincing there, Felix got off the plane and was handed over to the FBI.  He was arrested for interfering with a member of the flight crew.  Felix now has a reservation before a judge, set for Tuesday.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWELL:  You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.

You are watching CNN NEWSROOM.  I'm George Howell.  </p><p>[04:30:00]</p><p>HOWELL:  CNN has learned the U.S. president's personal attorney Michael Cohen met with a Russian oligarch just days before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January 2017.  Video footage shows that oligarch, who was recently sanctioned by the U.S., arriving at Trump Tower during the transition period.  </p><p>In this exclusive report, Matthew Chance tracked down the Russian billionaire.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHANCE:  Mr. Vekselberg, a quick question from CNN.</p><p>VEKSELBERG:  No, thank you, not now.</p><p>CHANCE:  Mr. Vekselberg, Why did your company pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to President Trump's lawyer?</p><p>VEKSELBERG:  Not now.</p><p>CHANCE (voice-over):  He is yet another media-shy Russian billionaire linked with the Kremlin and mired in allegations of collusion with the Trump team.  The FBI questioned Victor Vekselberg about payments to Trump attorney Michael Cohen by his company's U.S. affiliate.  They say it was for consulting work.  We asked about the payments, too.</p><p>VEKSELBERG:  Really appreciate.  Just later, OK?</p><p>Really appreciate.  I understand.  I understand.  But you are so aggressive.</p><p>CHANCE:  No, I'm not.</p><p>VEKSELBERG:  Please wait.  Please later.</p><p>CHANCE (voice-over):  We now know that Vekselberg met Cohen even before President Trump was inaugurated.  These recently unearthed January 2017 images from the lobby of Trump Tower in New York show the Russian billionaire wearing a hat and coat, checking in at the security desk, lingering for several minutes and then entering an elevator with his business partner.  </p><p>Cohen hasn't responded for comment but a person familiar with the meeting tells CNN that the two went up to Cohen's office on the 26th floor, although they did not meet the then president-elect himself. They left the building just 27 minutes later.  </p><p>A person familiar with the meeting told CNN that Vekselberg and Cohen discussed improving U.S.-Russia relations.  But what exactly this now sanctioned Russian billionaire expected remains unclear -- Matthew Chance, CNN, St. Petersburg, Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL:  Matthew, thanks for the reporting.</p><p>Let's talk about the situation from people who live near Hawaii's erupting Kilauea Volcano.  It feels like a never-ending emergency with no real end in site.  On Friday, the U.S. Geological Survey says there were 90 earthquakes in the span of six hours.  </p><p>Ash plumes were being thrown 3 kilometers, about 10,000 feet into the air.  And more people are being told to leave, as molten lava flows further into the streets towards their homes.  While many have already packed up their belongings, one man stayed to battle this volcano's destructive fury.  Scott McLean has his story for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Kilauea continues to force evacuations here in Hawaii.  People are especially reluctant to stay behind because it is almost impossible to protect your home from lava. I say almost because we met a man who took on Mother Nature and won, all to protect a property that is not even his.</p><p>STEVE HILL, HAWAII RESIDENT:  It's a beautiful place.  It's a place that feels very alive.</p><p>MCLEAN (voice-over):  It was two decades ago that Steve Hill found his slice of Hawaiian paradise.  And two weeks ago, he came to grips with losing it.</p><p>MCLEAN:  You left this place fully expecting you wouldn't come home to it.</p><p>HILL:  Lost.  Lost.</p><p>MCLEAN (voice-over):  Hill and his wife packed up their furniture and left for the mainland.  He even left a shot of gin on the deck for Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess, assuming both the gin and his two homes would be swallowed up.</p><p>HILL:  We left feeling heartbroken.  It's like our homes are gone.</p><p>MCLEAN (voice-over):  But his contractor and close friend, Darryl Clinton, had other ideas.</p><p>DARRYL CLINTON, CONTRACTOR:  Might want to step back on this one.</p><p>MCLEAN (voice-over):  Just one week ago, CNN was with Clinton while he was defending Hill's homes against flying chunks of molten lava. Windows had already been destroyed, so had the water catchment tank. Some lava bombs even came crashing through the roof.  </p><p>Armed with little more than a garden hose, Clinton doused the flaming rocks before they torched the entire house.</p><p>CLINTON:  These are the ones that catch the ceiling on fire.</p><p>MCLEAN (voice-over):  The 24/7 task was difficult and even more dangerous.  After almost a week, Hill told Clinton to leave and let the houses burn.</p><p>HILL:  You can't do this, this is unsafe.  It's time to stop.  Valiant effort.  I'm humbled by how hard you've tried. MCLEAN (voice-over):  But Clinton didn't leave until the next day and it wasn't by choice.  A line-drive lava bomb broke his leg, severed an artery and nearly took his foot off.</p><p>CLINTON:  Just took my leg out and threw me against the wall.  It was the most extreme force I've --</p><p>[04:35:00]</p><p>CLINTON:  -- ever felt in my life.</p><p>MCLEAN (voice-over):  The extreme heat burned up the deck, the wall and almost an entire dining set.  But thanks to a fast-acting neighbor with a water jug, the house survived and so did Darryl.</p><p>HILL You're blessed with neighbors like that.</p><p>MCLEAN (voice-over):  Hill returned to Hawaii to find his homes and his friend who helped build them both badly in need of repair.</p><p>HILL:  When Darryl is done rebuilding himself then we'll get on to rebuilding houses.  </p><p>MCLEAN:  He is a journeyman.  </p><p>HILL:  He is a journeyman.  He is a beautiful person.</p><p>MCLEAN (voice-over):  In a place where lava insurance is far too costly to be common, Hill knows that saying thank you isn't saying nearly enough.</p><p>HILL:  This place stands because Darryl chose not to go home.  It stands because he believed that he could save it.  I mean, that is it.</p><p>MCLEAN:  Darryl Clinton has a metal rod in his leg, he's had at least three surgeries and right now he is in Honolulu for another one.  He has a long road ahead of him but he does have support.  His friend Steve Hill says that he will do whatever he can to get Darryl back on his feet.  And his other neighbors are doing what they can to pitch in as well -- Scott McLean, CNN, Pahoa, Hawaii.</p><p>(WEATHER REPORT) </p><p>HOWELL:  Still ahead here on NEWSROOM, the E.U.'s new data laws are now in play and it may be causing a flood of privacy policy updates in your inbox.  We'll explain that ahead.</p><p>Plus Alexa, is Alexa spying on you?</p><p>How Amazon's voice assistant ended up sharing a user's private conversation with a random contact.  Yikes. </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[04:40:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p>HOWELL:  Have you checked your inbox today?</p><p>The e-mails that may be driving you, me and everyone a bit crazy, websites telling you that they have updated their privacy policies. But this is not spam.  It is part of a new regulation rolled out across the European Union.  And some of the world's biggest companies could be breaking the rules already.  Samuel Burke explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Austrian lawyer Max Schrems (ph) has been fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for nearly a decade.  And today, he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook for allegedly violating the E.U.'s new data protection law, called GDPR, the day it came into force.</p><p>MAX SCHREMS (PH), AUSTRIAN LAWYER:  We were looking for big companies that really willfully violate the law, that try to ignore it and try to get away with it.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over):  Schrems (ph), who helped write the regulations. says he is taking legal action because Big Tech isn't complying with the law.</p><p>SCHREMS (PH):  Various read that said here if we don't want this, we think it is stupid so we don't want to comply with is.  And then there is obvious business interests.  There is certain things that you simply can't do with data anymore that give a profit.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over):  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hoovering up your sensitive data, like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and sexuality, for advertising purposes without your consent.  According to legal experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this requirement.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On your Facebook profile, you can put in things like sexuality, religion or political beliefs.  And if you put that on, you don't have any choice but for Facebook to use it to personalize content, to deliver the advertising and so on.</p><p>BURKE:  There is only an \"I accept\" button.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Exactly.</p><p>BURKE:  There's not an \"I don't accept\" button.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Exactly.  You've got it.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over):  He says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your profile, Facebook can still glean information, such as your sexual orientation, by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other websites, too. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Facebook can infer things from the great amount of data it has about you across the Web and also across your mobile devices and apps that also send data to Facebook.</p><p>BURKE:  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making these inferences that they make about us?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  That law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without explicit consent.</p><p>BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook.  European data regulators can impose a fine of up to 4 percent of its global annual revenue.  </p><p>Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.  </p><p>BURKE (voice-over):  In a statement to CNN, Facebook's chief privacy officer said the company has, quote, \"introduced better tools for people to access --</p><p>[04:45:00]</p><p>BURKE (voice-over):  -- \"download and delete their information.\"  </p><p>The company also says it is building a new tool that will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them it collects from other websites and apps.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We do expect about to be fully compliant on May 25th.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over):  Lawyer Max Schrems (ph) believes the new rules are tough enough to prevent the kind of data scraping that companies like Cambridge Analytica have engaged in.</p><p>SCHREMS (PH):  If reinforced improperly, we can actually get a balance in this digitalized age.  In the end, you, as a customer, have the possibility to use, let's say, Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over):  However the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data regulations are already redrawing the line between profit and privacy -- Samuel Burke, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL:  To talk more about this, we have with us Jesse Bockstedt, an associate professor of information systems at Emory University.  </p><p>It's a pleasure to have you hear with us, Jesse, to talk about this.</p><p>So what is the deal with all of these e-mails, from big and small companies alike, flooding our inboxes with these compliance notes, basically asking consumers to take action?  </p><p>Consumers have asked for more control over their personal data.  </p><p>What does this mean for them?</p><p>JESSE BOCKSTEDT, EMORY UNIVERSITY:  Well, we're seeing all these e- mails because the regulation in Europe states that any company that operates in Europe or has users based in Europe has to notify users of how they will use their data, how they plan to distribute their data. </p><p>And all these companies are now notifying everyone of how they are trying to comply with the new regulations.  I think what we'll see for users going forward is a lot more requests for consent.  </p><p>One of the things that really is laid out in the GDPR is this requirement for consent to capture and process personal data from users.  And in the past or up to this point, it has mostly been an opt-out thing; by default you are sharing your data with these companies.  </p><p>And now it is moving the needle more toward an opt-in type scenario, where you actually have to give explicit permission and these companies now have to justify why they need that data, how they plan to use that data.  </p><p>So in theory, users will have a lot more rights around their data, rights to access and understand how their data is being used and distributed, rights to erase their data if they want to remove it from the services.  </p><p>Whether or not they take advantage of those rights, that is the big question.  Actually privacy researchers have long talked about something called the privacy paradox, which is that users claim they want privacy, they want more control over their data.  But then their actions online and the types of services and things they do say the counter to that.  </p><p>So it will be interesting to see how many users take advantage of these new regs.</p><p>HOWELL:  Let's talk about this, because the regulations apply to Europe but we're seeing companies around the world seem to take a blanket approach just to be in compliance with this.  </p><p>Has Europe really set the stage for the rest of the world to follow?</p><p>BOCKSTEDT:  I think so.  It may be a little bit longer before we see these regulations here in the U.S.  Europe and the European Union, both citizens and lawmakers, tend to have a stronger stance on privacy than we see here in the United States.  </p><p>But I think these regulations do capture what users want to see.  So I know there are some proposals in California with similar types of regulations.  Right now, in the United States, it is more of a state- by-state thing in terms of things like notifications on data breaches. And I think we'll see more coming down the pike.  </p><p>One thing that is interesting is how this will affect the business models of the companies that require heavily on personal data for revenue, for target advertising and things like that.</p><p>HOWELL:  One person that has been on the hot seat with regards to transparency, with regards to security, the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg.  He was in Europe, talking to regulators there and he spoke about regulation.  Let's listen and we'll talk about it on the other side.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, COFOUNDER AND CEO, FACEBOOK:  We're doubling the number of people working on safety and security at our company to more than 20,000 by the end of this year.  </p><p>On top of the investments that we're making in other areas, I expect that these increased investments in security will significantly impact our profitability.  But I want to be clear, keeping people safer will always be more important than maximizing our profits.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWELL:  Critics say that he danced around a lot of their questions, that Facebook continues to skirt around the regulations.  </p><p>Basically what are the biggest takeaways from what you heard from Zuckerberg?</p><p>BOCKSTEDT:  I think they haven't quite figured it out yet.  They are moving in the right direction, I think, employing an additional 10,000 people to monitor and curate content.  It is a great move to make sure data is not being misused, abused and deal with things like fake news. </p><p>[04:50:00]</p><p>BOCKSTEDT:  And pursuing machine learning and artificial intelligence- type solutions is the right way to move.  But it may be a while before those capabilities are there to provide the scale that is needed.  </p><p>At the end of the day I think he didn't provide the detail that the lawmakers were looking to hear.  The E.U. lawmakers had the advantage of seeing his testimony in the United States and knowing what type of questions to ask.  And they asked tougher questions and looked for more details, in my opinion.  </p><p>They focused in on things like whether or not Facebook is reaching a monopoly type environment.  And I think the concerns in Europe are a lot stronger than they were during the U.S. hearings.  And so I don't think he provided enough detail.  But the format wasn't good for that, either.  </p><p>They asked all their questions first and then he responded to all of them at once at the end in about 25 minutes, which made it difficult for him to address all the issues.  It also gave him an opportunity to skip over issues that maybe he didn't want to talk about.</p><p>And so I think, hopefully, if there is followup hearings on this, hopefully there is more of a question-response so we can get more answers.  But at the end of the day, I don't think they have quite figured it out yet.  And it is an ongoing process.</p><p>HOWELL:  We'll talk to you more next hour about breaches.  The companies have to notify consumers about breaches and also the fines. Jesse Bockstedt, thanks for your time today.  We'll be back.</p><p>BOCKSTEDT:  Thanks, George.</p><p>HOWELL:  We'll be right back after the break. </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[04:55:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p>HOWELL:  The Amazon voice assistant, Alexa, can do many things and apparently even snoop on your private conversations.  Our Anna Stewart explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It is a cautionary tale of technology telling too much.  A woman in Oregon says Amazon's Alexa recorded and then e-mailed a random person with a private conversation that took place in her house.</p><p>DANIELLE, ECHO OWNER:  I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion. Like immediately, I'm like I'm never plugging that device in again.  I can't trust it.</p><p>STEWART (voice-over):  Amazon Echo owner Danielle says she was chatting with her husband about hardwood floors when the device sent an audio file to a man who worked for her husband.  She only found out about the recording when she received an alarming phone call.</p><p>DANIELLE:  The person on the other line, said unplug your Alexa devices right now.  We go around and unplug them all and he proceeded to tell us that he had received audio files, recordings from what was going on in our house.</p><p>STEWART (voice-over):  Amazon told CNN affiliate KR7 (ph) the device misinterpreted commands like \"send message\" and the contact's name as part of the background conversation and called it an extremely rare occurrence.  It is unknown if the couple didn't hear Alexa's voice replies or see the speaker light up when it was activated. </p><p>Or if the device responded at all.  By the way, it is a case of mixed signals that has a lot of consumers thinking twice about just who or what they bring into the house.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL:  Creepy.

I'm George Howell, CNN NEWSROOM starts right now.  </p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p> HOWELL:  At 4:01 on the U.S. East Coast, the peace summit between North Korea and the United States, the one that President Trump canceled Thursday?</p><p> Well, it is back on again, at least for now.  The Trump administration apparently working on the assumption that a summit with North Korea may happen after all.  This about-face a day after the U.S. president sent a letter to Kim Jong-un explicitly canceling their historic meeting in Singapore set for June 12th.  </p><p> President Trump now saying that both sides are engaged in productive talks that could revive the meeting.  Earlier he told reporters he was encouraged by the conciliatory tone coming from North Korea.  So it is a definite maybe at best at this point.  </p><p> It is still unclear though whether the U.S. advance team is headed to Singapore as originally planned.  </p><p> Our Kaitlan Collins picks it up from here.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It is the latest case of diplomatic whiplash from President Trump; 24 hours after canceling his highly anticipated sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the president suggesting the summit in Singapore could happen after all.</p><p> TRUMP:  We will see what happens.  It could even be the 12th.</p><p> COLLINS:  In a stunning reversal, Trump telling reporters today his administration is back in touch with North Korea.</p><p> TRUMP:  We're talking to them now.  They very much want to do it. We'd like to do it.</p><p> COLLINS:  But his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said this the day before:</p><p> MIKE POMPEO, U.S.  SECRETARY OF STATE:  We have received no response to our inquiries from them.</p><p> COLLINS:  Asked if Pyongyang is playing games, Trump said:</p><p> TRUMP:  Everybody plays games.  You know that.</p><p> COLLINS:  The developments coming one day after Trump revived talk of military action and vowed to continue economic sanctions.</p><p> TRUMP:  Our very strong sanctions, by far the strongest sanctions ever imposed and maximum pressure campaign will continue, as it has been continuing. COLLINS:  With North Korean officials maintaining they're still willing to sit down with the U.S.  at any time, in any format to resolve the problems.</p><p> The White House unable to answer if planning staff were still flying to Singapore later tonight, as expected.</p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  We will see.  We have still got a -- a few hours before that takes place.  But as I just said, we are going to be prepared if the meeting takes place on June 12, as the president indicated it still could this morning.  We will be ready one way or the other.</p><p> COLLINS:  Officials answering few questions about the summit's future, with only one formal press briefing this week.</p><p> TRUMP:  Nothing to do with Russia.</p><p> COLLINS:  And 463 days since President Trump's one and only solo press conference.</p><p> QUESTION:  Are you going to Singapore, Mr.  President? </p><p> COLLINS:  Now though the day that they canceled the summit, the president and his secretary of state said there had been a breakdown in communications between the United States and North Korea, that seems to have changed, with the president tweeting that we are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the summit, going on to say that he believes it still could happen on June 12th in Singapore but adding, if necessary, it will be extended beyond that date -- Kaitlan Collins, CNN, the White House.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HOWELL:  Kaitlan, thanks for the reporting.</p><p> And now live to Seoul, South Korea.  CNN correspondent Matt Rivers is standing by following developments there.  </p><p> Matt, oh, what a difference a day makes, right?</p><p> What is the reaction to this reversal from the South Korean perspective?</p><p> MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, 24-36 hours ago things were very different here in South Korea.  There was deep disappointment.  It was a major setback, especially for South Korea's current government that had pushed so hard for this summit to take place.</p><p> Yet after all of this, what we've heard from the president --</p><p> [04:05:00]</p><p> RIVERS:  -- there is cautious optimism.  I'll read you a part of a statement that was sent by a spokesman for the president's office, that person saying it is fortunate that the embers of the North Korea- U.S. dialogue are not going out but are coming back up again.  We are watching the development carefully.  </p><p> And so that is definitely a note there of cautious optimism, George. But it is worth noting that they are not really showing their hands completely there at this point because consider just a couple days ago. </p><p> You had the national security adviser here in South Korea saying that he was 99.9 percent sure that the summit was going to happen.  And then, well, it didn't.  </p><p> So there is definitely some thought here in the South Korean government to say maybe we won't be too overly optimistic, even though right now things do appear to be trending towards the summit happening at some point.</p><p> HOWELL:  We'll just keep up with the ball there, Matt, thank you so much for the reporting.  </p><p> Let's put this into focus, this ,change of course.  Jasper Kim is the director of the Center for Conflict Management joining from Seoul, South Korea, and also from Brussels, Steven Erlanger, \"The New York Times\" chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe.  Good to have you both with us to talk about this.  </p><p> Steven, I want to start with you. </p><p> And Jasper Kim, jump right in after Steven if you would.  </p><p> But what is your first impression of what is going on here, the off- again on-again approach?</p><p> Is this Trumpian theater?</p><p> Is it a negotiating tactic, is it reckless, is it innovative, Steven?</p><p> STEVEN ERLANGER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\":  Well, I think Trumpian theater, hyperbole and negotiation all go together if I can be honest. We haven't really heard much again from North Korea.  I'd like to hear what they have to say.  I mean Trump clearly feels North Korea needs the sanction relief, wants the summit.  </p><p> I'm not sure it helps to humiliate Pyongyang this way.  But if the summit is back on, the nice thing is it may give the United States a little bit more time to prepare.  What worries quite a lot of people is that Trump will rush into a summit, look for something that sounds like success and not be too careful about the details.  </p><p> That, I think, is a big concern because North Korea is a nuclear country.  It is not like Iran developing nuclear weapons.  That was the allegation.  North Korea has them.  It has lots of them.  It has missiles.  It is a wholly different and dangerous situation.  </p><p> So let's hope it is back on.  One thing you should note is the coin, the famous coin that was minted, didn't have a date.  It only said 2018.  So we have the whole rest of the year to make that come true.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> HOWELL:  The devil in the details, though, as you rightly point out.  </p><p> Jasper Kim, your thoughts here.</p><p> JASPER KIM, CENTER FOR CONFLICT MANAGEMENT:  Well, I think this is somewhat to be expected because we have two very unconventional political figures.  And both of them actually view the world stage as political theater.  And they are both looking to create a narrative.  </p><p> And from North Korea's perspective, they want to pitch the narrative such that their nuclear state, that is defensively postured, not offensively postured.  Whether that is the truth or not, that is what they want to craft.  </p><p> And on Donald Trump's side, of course, he has the television and media background.  He wants to basically exploit that and create an image that he is bringing success to the table.  He doesn't want to be perceived as going to the negotiating table out of fear.</p><p> He wants to be perceived as having no fear to negotiate.  And so I think that is why he retracted a little bit, trying to maximize his bargaining power before stepping in, if he does step back in.</p><p> HOWELL:  And I want to look at these images, just to show Kim Jong-un, again, these the most recent pictures of Kim Jong-un.  And what we're seeing a very relaxed leader of North Korea, wearing the white suit as opposed to the black suit.  All of this happening during this reversal coming from the U.S. president.  </p><p> Jasper, I want to ask you about the North Korean response.  It was very measured compared to what we've seen from North Korea in the past.  </p><p> How important a factor do you think that was in the possibility of these talks being restored?</p><p> KIM:  Well, I think it is noteworthy, George.  And what we have is an ironic twist here with the two political figures.  Usually it is the North Korean side that is really aggressive in their tone and this is taken from the Korean language.  If you do a direct translation, oftentimes, it is a little bit awkward when it is translated into English.  </p><p> But here we have North Korea actually striking a conciliatory tone when Donald Trump pulled out of the June 12th Singapore summit originally.  And so I think what we have is something very, very interesting.  </p><p> These two political figures are trying to negotiate and they see a little bit of each other in terms of negotiation style, they recognize it.  And even the small things, like Kim Jong-un's suit for example --</p><p> [04:10:00]</p><p> KIM:  -- being white, that could be a very neutral tone, it could be construed as a new era and an olive branch.  And we're trying to seek a peace with you, at least that is the nonverbals that I'm picking up from this side here in Seoul.</p><p> HOWELL:  I mentioned to Matt what a difference a day makes but what a difference a year makes, in fact, looking at where things are now.  </p><p> Steven, I want to get your take.  </p><p> Who do you think wants this more?</p><p> Is it North Korea, looking to see the possibility of sanctions lifted?</p><p> Is it President Trump, who sees this as a legacy moment even worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize?</p><p> ERLANGER:  Well, it is very hard to say.  I think at this time both of them want it.  I do think North Korea needs it more.  But I also think China is advising him along the way.  </p><p> The one thing I worry about is the Trump people still keep talking about denuclearization from the beginning.  And I really don't believe Kim is prepared to denuclearize.  It just would be an act of self-harm from North Korea's point of view.  </p><p> But its nuclear weapons protected from China as well as the United States.  One thing I might look to see if the summit takes place is talk of a peace treaty at long last between North and South Korea, in which Russia and China would have some sort of role as a kind of success before we get to the real nitty-gritty of denuclearization.  </p><p> Because if we get there, it will have to be staged, it will be very much involved with inspections, with intrusive foreign looks inside North Korea.  Very hard for me to imagine there will be a big agreement to denuclearize before economic sanctions are lifted.  I think if it is going to happen, it will have to be a long stage-by- stage process.</p><p> HOWELL:  A lot of serious questions that have yet to be answered. Steven Erlanger, live for us in Brussels and Jasper Kim, live in Seoul, South Korea, gentlemen, thank you for your time and perspective.  We'll keep in touch with you.</p><p> Live around the world, you're watching CNN NEWSROOM.  Still ahead -- </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HOWELL (voice-over):  -- you could call this proof that alcohol, attitude and altitude don't mix.  A bumpy ride from the islands to South Florida.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p> HOWELL (voice-over):  Plus, he once called the shots in Hollywood. Now he is facing felony charges.  The latest in Harvey Weinstein's fall from grace and #MeToo rising.  Stay with us. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> (HEADLINES) </p><p> [04:15:00]</p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p> HOWELL:  Live pictures from Dublin, Ireland.  Now you see an historic vote count getting under way on a referendum on whether to overturn some of the strictest abortion laws in the developed world.  Early exit polls say that the voters there want to happen and, if it doesn't, it will be a major change for Ireland.  </p><p> Our Atika Shubert is following all of this from Dublin.</p><p> Atika, obviously these results will be clear in the coming hours but tell us more about what you're learning from the exit polls, suggesting that a large number of people are voting for change.</p><p> ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Absolutely. Those ballot boxes just opened 15 minutes ago.  We will get the official results in a few hours.  But meanwhile, Ireland has already woken up to the exit polls.  </p><p>RTE, the Irish broadcaster, showing that nearly 70 percent of respondents voted in favor of amending the constitution and liberalizing abortion laws here in Ireland.  Only 30 percent against. Those are some decisive numbers.  We'll have to see how the official results compare.  </p><p> The count will actually be tallied here in Dublin Castle and then, of course, we'll get the results shortly afterwards.  But it does appear to be an historic day for Ireland.  And it is something that a number of people have been looking forward to, campaigners for decades campaigning for abortion rights. </p><p> And Ireland's prime minister last night putting out a tweet, thanking everybody for voting and saying it does look to be that history will be made today -- George.</p><p> HOWELL:  Again, if this does happen, it would be major change.  But help our viewers understand the legacy behind this issue in Ireland. Given the deep roots of the Catholic Church there, again, this would be a major shift in opinion.</p><p> SHUBERT:  Absolutely.  It is a seismic shift.  Ireland has had some of the strictest laws on abortion in Europe, in the Western world.  And in 1983, actually another referendum voted into the constitution, the eighth amendment, which said that the rights of the unborn are equal to the rights of the mother. </p><p> And that is what really was the legal basis for banning abortion this Ireland.  So this vote, if the official results mirror what we see in the exit polls, would completely reverse that.   And one of the most amazing things to come out of the debate on this is the number of stories that women have been coming forward, to tell about often these deeply and emotional and traumatic stories about how they have had to seek abortions to terminate pregnancies.  </p><p> We spoke to young women, teenagers who felt alone and isolated who had to travel abroad for terminations but also to older mothers, who -- one woman who we spoke to who had, very sadly, a fatal fetal abnormality and had to terminate the pregnancy.  And the sort of heartwrenching stories that came out that were in the public debate here.  </p><p> And I think that really showed the big societal shift that we saw happening in Ireland, not just in the debate running up to this but that has been going on for several decades now.</p><p> HOWELL:  And again, the results will be more clear in the coming hours But from what we're understanding, Atika, people are voting for a big change there.  Live in Dublin, Ireland, thank you so much for your time.  We'll stay in touch with you.  </p><p> The disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein is out on bail.  </p><p> [04:20:00]</p><p> HOWELL:  This after being charged with rape and criminal sexual acts. Weinstein has repeatedly denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex. But the arraignment Friday was a victory for more than 80 women who've accused him of sexual harassment or assault over several decades.  Our Brynn Gingras has more.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Hollywood megaproducer Harvey Weinstein in handcuffs, walking into court today, facing rape charges.  They stem from the accounts of two women, including an aspiring actress, who first spoke out in a 2017 \"New Yorker\" article, alleging Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him at his office in 2004.  </p><p> Tonight, Weinstein is out of jail after posting a $1 million cash bail but not before surrendering his passport, being forced to wear a monitoring device 24/7 and traveling only between New York and Connecticut.  </p><p> The criminal charges are the first to be filed against Weinstein after dozens of women including, several A-list actresses, made various sexual misconduct accusations against the media mogul last year, among them, Gwyneth Paltrow...</p><p> (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) </p><p> GWYNETH PALTROW, ACTOR:  We had one instance in a hotel room, where he tried to -- where he made a pass at me.  And then I really kind of stood up to him.</p><p> GINGRAS (voice-over):  -- Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Lupita Nyong'o, Ashley Judd...</p><p> ASHLEY JUDD, ACTOR:  I fought with this volley of nos, which he ignored.</p><p> GINGRAS (voice-over):  -- and actress Rose McGowan, one of the first women to publicly accuse Weinstein of rape.</p><p> ROSE MCGOWAN, ACTOR:  We got you.  Yes.  </p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> MCGOWAN:  To see him in cuffs on the way out, whether he smiled or not, that is a very good feeling.</p><p> GINGRAS (voice-over):  Weinstein denies having nonconsensual sex with any of his accusers and his attorney insisted today, his client is innocent.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My job is not to defend behavior.  My job is to defend something that is criminal behavior.  Bad behavior, Mr. Weinstein did not invent the casting couch in Hollywood.  And to the extent that there is bad behavior in that industry, that is not what this is about.</p><p> (VIDEO CLIP, \"SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK\")</p><p> GINGRAS (voice-over):  It is a stunning fall for the man behind several major movies, like \"Silver Linings Playbook,\" \"The King's Speech\" and \"Shakespeare in Love,\" just to name a few, some of which earned Weinstein dozens of awards for his work behind the camera.  </p><p> But now he is the focus of investigations for alleged sex crimes, not just in New York but also in Los Angeles and London -- Brynn Gingras, CNN, New York.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HOWELL:  Brynn, thank you for the reporting.</p><p> The next time you fly and perhaps you've had one too many, remember this.  The law prohibits the airline from serving an intoxicated passenger.  That was apparently what started a bit of a mixup on board American Airlines, a flight from St. Croix to Miami on Wednesday.  </p><p> The video is a bit hard to hear but we'll take you through what happened when passenger Jason Felix wanted another drink.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE).  We'll be there in an hour.</p><p> Why are you upset?</p><p> (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> HOWELL (voice-over):  Got to remember, everybody has got a camera. People capture this.  It doesn't take long for Felix to get more animated, still demanding the flight attendant get him another drink and even taking jabs at the flight attendant.  </p><p> And it didn't end there.  Punches flew.  Other passengers jumped in to try to calm the man down.  According to a criminal complaint, Felix spit blood at one of them, even threatened to kill them.  </p><p> After this, the captain turned on the seat belt sign, he instructed everyone to return to their seats.  Eventually passengers were able to calm Felix down a bit, although he was still agitated, talking loudly, punching the overhead bins.  </p><p> When the plane landed in Miami, four officers from Miami-Dade Police went on board and, after a bit of friendly convincing there, Felix got off the plane and was handed over to the FBI.  He was arrested for interfering with a member of the flight crew.  Felix now has a reservation before a judge, set for Tuesday.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HOWELL:  You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.

You are watching CNN NEWSROOM.  I'm George Howell.  </p><p> [04:30:00]</p><p> HOWELL:  CNN has learned the U.S. president's personal attorney Michael Cohen met with a Russian oligarch just days before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January 2017.  Video footage shows that oligarch, who was recently sanctioned by the U.S., arriving at Trump Tower during the transition period.  </p><p> In this exclusive report, Matthew Chance tracked down the Russian billionaire.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CHANCE:  Mr. Vekselberg, a quick question from CNN.</p><p> VEKSELBERG:  No, thank you, not now.</p><p> CHANCE:  Mr. Vekselberg, Why did your company pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to President Trump's lawyer?</p><p> VEKSELBERG:  Not now.</p><p> CHANCE (voice-over):  He is yet another media-shy Russian billionaire linked with the Kremlin and mired in allegations of collusion with the Trump team.  The FBI questioned Victor Vekselberg about payments to Trump attorney Michael Cohen by his company's U.S. affiliate.  They say it was for consulting work.  We asked about the payments, too.</p><p> VEKSELBERG:  Really appreciate.  Just later, OK?</p><p> Really appreciate.  I understand.  I understand.  But you are so aggressive.</p><p> CHANCE:  No, I'm not.</p><p> VEKSELBERG:  Please wait.  Please later.</p><p> CHANCE (voice-over):  We now know that Vekselberg met Cohen even before President Trump was inaugurated.  These recently unearthed January 2017 images from the lobby of Trump Tower in New York show the Russian billionaire wearing a hat and coat, checking in at the security desk, lingering for several minutes and then entering an elevator with his business partner.  </p><p> Cohen hasn't responded for comment but a person familiar with the meeting tells CNN that the two went up to Cohen's office on the 26th floor, although they did not meet the then president-elect himself. They left the building just 27 minutes later.  </p><p> A person familiar with the meeting told CNN that Vekselberg and Cohen discussed improving U.S.-Russia relations.  But what exactly this now sanctioned Russian billionaire expected remains unclear -- Matthew Chance, CNN, St. Petersburg, Russia.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HOWELL:  Matthew, thanks for the reporting.</p><p> Let's talk about the situation from people who live near Hawaii's erupting Kilauea Volcano.  It feels like a never-ending emergency with no real end in site.  On Friday, the U.S. Geological Survey says there were 90 earthquakes in the span of six hours.  </p><p> Ash plumes were being thrown 3 kilometers, about 10,000 feet into the air.  And more people are being told to leave, as molten lava flows further into the streets towards their homes.  While many have already packed up their belongings, one man stayed to battle this volcano's destructive fury.  Scott McLean has his story for us.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Kilauea continues to force evacuations here in Hawaii.  People are especially reluctant to stay behind because it is almost impossible to protect your home from lava. I say almost because we met a man who took on Mother Nature and won, all to protect a property that is not even his.</p><p> STEVE HILL, HAWAII RESIDENT:  It's a beautiful place.  It's a place that feels very alive.</p><p> MCLEAN (voice-over):  It was two decades ago that Steve Hill found his slice of Hawaiian paradise.  And two weeks ago, he came to grips with losing it.</p><p> MCLEAN:  You left this place fully expecting you wouldn't come home to it.</p><p> HILL:  Lost.  Lost.</p><p> MCLEAN (voice-over):  Hill and his wife packed up their furniture and left for the mainland.  He even left a shot of gin on the deck for Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess, assuming both the gin and his two homes would be swallowed up.</p><p> HILL:  We left feeling heartbroken.  It's like our homes are gone.</p><p> MCLEAN (voice-over):  But his contractor and close friend, Darryl Clinton, had other ideas.</p><p> DARRYL CLINTON, CONTRACTOR:  Might want to step back on this one.</p><p> MCLEAN (voice-over):  Just one week ago, CNN was with Clinton while he was defending Hill's homes against flying chunks of molten lava. Windows had already been destroyed, so had the water catchment tank. Some lava bombs even came crashing through the roof.  </p><p> Armed with little more than a garden hose, Clinton doused the flaming rocks before they torched the entire house.</p><p> CLINTON:  These are the ones that catch the ceiling on fire.</p><p> MCLEAN (voice-over):  The 24/7 task was difficult and even more dangerous.  After almost a week, Hill told Clinton to leave and let the houses burn.</p><p> HILL:  You can't do this, this is unsafe.  It's time to stop.  Valiant effort.  I'm humbled by how hard you've tried. MCLEAN (voice-over):  But Clinton didn't leave until the next day and it wasn't by choice.  A line-drive lava bomb broke his leg, severed an artery and nearly took his foot off.</p><p> CLINTON:  Just took my leg out and threw me against the wall.  It was the most extreme force I've --</p><p> [04:35:00]</p><p> CLINTON:  -- ever felt in my life.</p><p> MCLEAN (voice-over):  The extreme heat burned up the deck, the wall and almost an entire dining set.  But thanks to a fast-acting neighbor with a water jug, the house survived and so did Darryl.</p><p> HILL You're blessed with neighbors like that.</p><p> MCLEAN (voice-over):  Hill returned to Hawaii to find his homes and his friend who helped build them both badly in need of repair.</p><p> HILL:  When Darryl is done rebuilding himself then we'll get on to rebuilding houses.  </p><p> MCLEAN:  He is a journeyman.  </p><p> HILL:  He is a journeyman.  He is a beautiful person.</p><p> MCLEAN (voice-over):  In a place where lava insurance is far too costly to be common, Hill knows that saying thank you isn't saying nearly enough.</p><p> HILL:  This place stands because Darryl chose not to go home.  It stands because he believed that he could save it.  I mean, that is it.</p><p> MCLEAN:  Darryl Clinton has a metal rod in his leg, he's had at least three surgeries and right now he is in Honolulu for another one.  He has a long road ahead of him but he does have support.  His friend Steve Hill says that he will do whatever he can to get Darryl back on his feet.  And his other neighbors are doing what they can to pitch in as well -- Scott McLean, CNN, Pahoa, Hawaii.</p><p> (WEATHER REPORT) </p><p> HOWELL:  Still ahead here on NEWSROOM, the E.U.'s new data laws are now in play and it may be causing a flood of privacy policy updates in your inbox.  We'll explain that ahead.</p><p> Plus Alexa, is Alexa spying on you?</p><p> How Amazon's voice assistant ended up sharing a user's private conversation with a random contact.  Yikes. </p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> [04:40:00]</p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p> HOWELL:  Have you checked your inbox today?</p><p> The e-mails that may be driving you, me and everyone a bit crazy, websites telling you that they have updated their privacy policies. But this is not spam.  It is part of a new regulation rolled out across the European Union.  And some of the world's biggest companies could be breaking the rules already.  Samuel Burke explains.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Austrian lawyer Max Schrems (ph) has been fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for nearly a decade.  And today, he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook for allegedly violating the E.U.'s new data protection law, called GDPR, the day it came into force.</p><p> MAX SCHREMS (PH), AUSTRIAN LAWYER:  We were looking for big companies that really willfully violate the law, that try to ignore it and try to get away with it.</p><p> BURKE (voice-over):  Schrems (ph), who helped write the regulations. says he is taking legal action because Big Tech isn't complying with the law.</p><p> SCHREMS (PH):  Various read that said here if we don't want this, we think it is stupid so we don't want to comply with is.  And then there is obvious business interests.  There is certain things that you simply can't do with data anymore that give a profit.</p><p> BURKE (voice-over):  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hoovering up your sensitive data, like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and sexuality, for advertising purposes without your consent.  According to legal experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this requirement.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  On your Facebook profile, you can put in things like sexuality, religion or political beliefs.  And if you put that on, you don't have any choice but for Facebook to use it to personalize content, to deliver the advertising and so on.</p><p> BURKE:  There is only an \"I accept\" button.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Exactly.</p><p> BURKE:  There's not an \"I don't accept\" button.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Exactly.  You've got it.</p><p> BURKE (voice-over):  He says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your profile, Facebook can still glean information, such as your sexual orientation, by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other websites, too. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Facebook can infer things from the great amount of data it has about you across the Web and also across your mobile devices and apps that also send data to Facebook.</p><p> BURKE:  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making these inferences that they make about us?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  That law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without explicit consent.</p><p> BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook.  European data regulators can impose a fine of up to 4 percent of its global annual revenue.  </p><p> Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.  </p><p> BURKE (voice-over):  In a statement to CNN, Facebook's chief privacy officer said the company has, quote, \"introduced better tools for people to access --</p><p> [04:45:00]</p><p> BURKE (voice-over):  -- \"download and delete their information.\"  </p><p> The company also says it is building a new tool that will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them it collects from other websites and apps.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We do expect about to be fully compliant on May 25th.</p><p> BURKE (voice-over):  Lawyer Max Schrems (ph) believes the new rules are tough enough to prevent the kind of data scraping that companies like Cambridge Analytica have engaged in.</p><p> SCHREMS (PH):  If reinforced improperly, we can actually get a balance in this digitalized age.  In the end, you, as a customer, have the possibility to use, let's say, Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data.</p><p> BURKE (voice-over):  However the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data regulations are already redrawing the line between profit and privacy -- Samuel Burke, CNN, London.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HOWELL:  To talk more about this, we have with us Jesse Bockstedt, an associate professor of information systems at Emory University.  </p><p> It's a pleasure to have you hear with us, Jesse, to talk about this.</p><p> So what is the deal with all of these e-mails, from big and small companies alike, flooding our inboxes with these compliance notes, basically asking consumers to take action?  </p><p> Consumers have asked for more control over their personal data.  </p><p> What does this mean for them?</p><p> JESSE BOCKSTEDT, EMORY UNIVERSITY:  Well, we're seeing all these e- mails because the regulation in Europe states that any company that operates in Europe or has users based in Europe has to notify users of how they will use their data, how they plan to distribute their data. </p><p> And all these companies are now notifying everyone of how they are trying to comply with the new regulations.  I think what we'll see for users going forward is a lot more requests for consent.  </p><p> One of the things that really is laid out in the GDPR is this requirement for consent to capture and process personal data from users.  And in the past or up to this point, it has mostly been an opt-out thing; by default you are sharing your data with these companies.  </p><p> And now it is moving the needle more toward an opt-in type scenario, where you actually have to give explicit permission and these companies now have to justify why they need that data, how they plan to use that data.  </p><p> So in theory, users will have a lot more rights around their data, rights to access and understand how their data is being used and distributed, rights to erase their data if they want to remove it from the services.  </p><p> Whether or not they take advantage of those rights, that is the big question.  Actually privacy researchers have long talked about something called the privacy paradox, which is that users claim they want privacy, they want more control over their data.  But then their actions online and the types of services and things they do say the counter to that.  </p><p> So it will be interesting to see how many users take advantage of these new regs.</p><p> HOWELL:  Let's talk about this, because the regulations apply to Europe but we're seeing companies around the world seem to take a blanket approach just to be in compliance with this.  </p><p> Has Europe really set the stage for the rest of the world to follow?</p><p> BOCKSTEDT:  I think so.  It may be a little bit longer before we see these regulations here in the U.S.  Europe and the European Union, both citizens and lawmakers, tend to have a stronger stance on privacy than we see here in the United States.  </p><p> But I think these regulations do capture what users want to see.  So I know there are some proposals in California with similar types of regulations.  Right now, in the United States, it is more of a state- by-state thing in terms of things like notifications on data breaches. And I think we'll see more coming down the pike.  </p><p> One thing that is interesting is how this will affect the business models of the companies that require heavily on personal data for revenue, for target advertising and things like that.</p><p> HOWELL:  One person that has been on the hot seat with regards to transparency, with regards to security, the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg.  He was in Europe, talking to regulators there and he spoke about regulation.  Let's listen and we'll talk about it on the other side.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, COFOUNDER AND CEO, FACEBOOK:  We're doubling the number of people working on safety and security at our company to more than 20,000 by the end of this year.  </p><p> On top of the investments that we're making in other areas, I expect that these increased investments in security will significantly impact our profitability.  But I want to be clear, keeping people safer will always be more important than maximizing our profits.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HOWELL:  Critics say that he danced around a lot of their questions, that Facebook continues to skirt around the regulations.  </p><p> Basically what are the biggest takeaways from what you heard from Zuckerberg?</p><p> BOCKSTEDT:  I think they haven't quite figured it out yet.  They are moving in the right direction, I think, employing an additional 10,000 people to monitor and curate content.  It is a great move to make sure data is not being misused, abused and deal with things like fake news. </p><p> [04:50:00]</p><p> BOCKSTEDT:  And pursuing machine learning and artificial intelligence- type solutions is the right way to move.  But it may be a while before those capabilities are there to provide the scale that is needed.  </p><p> At the end of the day I think he didn't provide the detail that the lawmakers were looking to hear.  The E.U. lawmakers had the advantage of seeing his testimony in the United States and knowing what type of questions to ask.  And they asked tougher questions and looked for more details, in my opinion.  </p><p> They focused in on things like whether or not Facebook is reaching a monopoly type environment.  And I think the concerns in Europe are a lot stronger than they were during the U.S. hearings.  And so I don't think he provided enough detail.  But the format wasn't good for that, either.  </p><p> They asked all their questions first and then he responded to all of them at once at the end in about 25 minutes, which made it difficult for him to address all the issues.  It also gave him an opportunity to skip over issues that maybe he didn't want to talk about.</p><p> And so I think, hopefully, if there is followup hearings on this, hopefully there is more of a question-response so we can get more answers.  But at the end of the day, I don't think they have quite figured it out yet.  And it is an ongoing process.</p><p> HOWELL:  We'll talk to you more next hour about breaches.  The companies have to notify consumers about breaches and also the fines. Jesse Bockstedt, thanks for your time today.  We'll be back.</p><p> BOCKSTEDT:  Thanks, George.</p><p> HOWELL:  We'll be right back after the break. </p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> [04:55:00]</p><p> (MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p> HOWELL:  The Amazon voice assistant, Alexa, can do many things and apparently even snoop on your private conversations.  Our Anna Stewart explains.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It is a cautionary tale of technology telling too much.  A woman in Oregon says Amazon's Alexa recorded and then e-mailed a random person with a private conversation that took place in her house.</p><p> DANIELLE, ECHO OWNER:  I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion. Like immediately, I'm like I'm never plugging that device in again.  I can't trust it.</p><p> STEWART (voice-over):  Amazon Echo owner Danielle says she was chatting with her husband about hardwood floors when the device sent an audio file to a man who worked for her husband.  She only found out about the recording when she received an alarming phone call.</p><p> DANIELLE:  The person on the other line, said unplug your Alexa devices right now.  We go around and unplug them all and he proceeded to tell us that he had received audio files, recordings from what was going on in our house.</p><p> STEWART (voice-over):  Amazon told CNN affiliate KR7 (ph) the device misinterpreted commands like \"send message\" and the contact's name as part of the background conversation and called it an extremely rare occurrence.  It is unknown if the couple didn't hear Alexa's voice replies or see the speaker light up when it was activated. </p><p> Or if the device responded at all.  By the way, it is a case of mixed signals that has a lot of consumers thinking twice about just who or what they bring into the house.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> HOWELL:  Creepy.

The <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>apparently working on the assumption that a summit with North Korea may happen after all.

Earlier he told reporters he was encouraged by the conciliatory tone coming from North Korea. So it is a definite maybe at best at this point.</p><p>It is still unclear though whether the U.S. advance team is headed to Singapore as originally planned.</p><p>Our Kaitlan Collins picks it up from here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It is the latest case of diplomatic whiplash from <person><nameText>President Trump; </nameText></person>24 hours after canceling his highly anticipated sit-down with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the president suggesting the summit in Singapore could happen after all.</p><p>TRUMP: We will see what happens. It could even be the 12th.</p><p>COLLINS: In a stunning reversal, Trump telling reporters today his administration is back in touch with North Korea.</p><p>TRUMP: We're talking to them now. They very much want to do it. We'd like to do it.</p><p>COLLINS: But his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said this the day before:</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We have received no response to our inquiries from them.</p><p>COLLINS: Asked if Pyongyang is playing games, Trump said:</p><p>TRUMP: Everybody plays games. You know that.</p><p>COLLINS: The developments coming one day after Trump revived talk of military action and vowed to continue economic sanctions.</p><p>TRUMP: Our very strong sanctions, by far the strongest sanctions ever imposed and maximum pressure campaign will continue, as it has been continuing. COLLINS: With North Korean officials maintaining they're still willing to sit down with the U.S. at any time, in any format to resolve the problems.</p><p>The White House unable to answer if planning staff were still flying to Singapore later tonight, as expected.</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We will see. We have still got a -- a few hours before that takes place. But as I just said, we are going to be prepared if the meeting takes place on June 12, as the president indicated it still could this morning. We will be ready one way or the other.</p><p>COLLINS: Officials answering few questions about the summit's future, with only one formal press briefing this week.</p><p>TRUMP: Nothing to do with Russia.</p><p>COLLINS: And 463 days since <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>one and only solo press conference.</p><p>QUESTION: Are you going to Singapore, Mr. President?</p><p>COLLINS: Now though the day that they canceled the summit, the president and his secretary of state said there had been a breakdown in communications between the United States and North Korea, that seems to have changed, with the president tweeting that we are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the summit, going on to say that he believes it still could happen on June 12th in Singapore but adding, if necessary, it will be extended beyond that date -- Kaitlan Collins, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL: Kaitlan, thanks for the reporting.</p><p>And now live to Seoul, South Korea. CNN correspondent Matt Rivers is standing by following developments there.</p><p>Matt, oh, what a difference a day makes, right?</p><p>What is the reaction to this reversal from the South Korean perspective?</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, 24-36 hours ago things were very different here in South Korea. There was deep disappointment. It was a major setback, especially for South Korea's current government that had pushed so hard for this summit to take place.</p><p>Yet after all of this, what we've heard from the president --</p><p>[04:05:00]</p><p>RIVERS: -- there is cautious optimism. I'll read you a part of a statement that was sent by a spokesman for the president's office, that person saying it is fortunate that the embers of the North Korea- U.S. dialogue are not going out but are coming back up again. We are watching the development carefully.</p><p>And so that is definitely a note there of cautious optimism, George. But it is worth noting that they are not really showing their hands completely there at this point because consider just a couple days ago.</p><p>You had the national security adviser here in South Korea saying that he was 99.9 percent sure that the summit was going to happen. And then, well, it didn't.</p><p>So there is definitely some thought here in the South Korean government to say maybe we won't be too overly optimistic, even though right now things do appear to be trending towards the summit happening at some point.</p><p>HOWELL: We'll just keep up with the ball there, Matt, thank you so much for the reporting.</p><p>Let's put this into focus, this ,change of course. Jasper Kim is the director of the Center for Conflict Management joining from Seoul, South Korea, and also from Brussels, Steven Erlanger, \"The New York Times\" chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe. Good to have you both with us to talk about this.</p><p>Steven, I want to start with you.</p><p>And Jasper Kim, jump right in after Steven if you would.</p><p>But what is your first impression of what is going on here, the off- again on-again approach?</p><p>Is this Trumpian theater?</p><p>Is it a negotiating tactic, is it reckless, is it innovative, Steven?</p><p>STEVEN ERLANGER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Well, I think Trumpian theater, hyperbole and negotiation all go together if I can be honest. We haven't really heard much again from North Korea. I'd like to hear what they have to say. I mean Trump clearly feels North Korea needs the sanction relief, wants the summit.</p><p>I'm not sure it helps to humiliate Pyongyang this way. But if the summit is back on, the nice thing is it may give the United States a little bit more time to prepare. What worries quite a lot of people is that Trump will rush into a summit, look for something that sounds like success and not be too careful about the details.</p><p>That, I think, is a big concern because North Korea is a nuclear country. It is not like Iran developing nuclear weapons. That was the allegation. North Korea has them. It has lots of them. It has missiles. It is a wholly different and dangerous situation.</p><p>So let's hope it is back on. One thing you should note is the coin, the famous coin that was minted, didn't have a date. It only said 2018. So we have the whole rest of the year to make that come true.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HOWELL: The devil in the details, though, as you rightly point out.</p><p>Jasper Kim, your thoughts here.</p><p>JASPER KIM, CENTER FOR CONFLICT MANAGEMENT: Well, I think this is somewhat to be expected because we have two very unconventional political figures. And both of them actually view the world stage as political theater. And they are both looking to create a narrative.</p><p>And from North Korea's perspective, they want to pitch the narrative such that their nuclear state, that is defensively postured, not offensively postured. Whether that is the truth or not, that is what they want to craft.</p><p>And on <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>side, of course, he has the television and media background. He wants to basically exploit that and create an image that he is bringing success to the table. He doesn't want to be perceived as going to the negotiating table out of fear.</p><p>He wants to be perceived as having no fear to negotiate. And so I think that is why he retracted a little bit, trying to maximize his bargaining power before stepping in, if he does step back in.</p><p>HOWELL: And I want to look at these images, just to show Kim Jong-un, again, these the most recent pictures of Kim Jong-un. And what we're seeing a very relaxed leader of North Korea, wearing the white suit as opposed to the black suit. All of this happening during this reversal coming from the U.S. president.</p><p>Jasper, I want to ask you about the North Korean response. It was very measured compared to what we've seen from North Korea in the past.</p><p>How important a factor do you think that was in the possibility of these talks being restored?</p><p>KIM: Well, I think it is noteworthy, George. And what we have is an ironic twist here with the two political figures. Usually it is the North Korean side that is really aggressive in their tone and this is taken from the Korean language. If you do a direct translation, oftentimes, it is a little bit awkward when it is translated into English.</p><p>But here we have North Korea actually striking a conciliatory tone when <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>pulled out of the June 12th Singapore summit originally. And so I think what we have is something very, very interesting.</p><p>These two political figures are trying to negotiate and they see a little bit of each other in terms of negotiation style, they recognize it. And even the small things, like Kim Jong-un's suit for example --</p><p>[04:10:00]</p><p>KIM: -- being white, that could be a very neutral tone, it could be construed as a new era and an olive branch. And we're trying to seek a peace with you, at least that is the nonverbals that I'm picking up from this side here in Seoul.</p><p>HOWELL: I mentioned to Matt what a difference a day makes but what a difference a year makes, in fact, looking at where things are now.</p><p>Steven, I want to get your take.</p><p>Who do you think wants this more?</p><p>Is it North Korea, looking to see the possibility of sanctions lifted?</p><p>Is it <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>who sees this as a legacy moment even worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize?</p><p>ERLANGER: Well, it is very hard to say. I think at this time both of them want it. I do think North Korea needs it more. But I also think China is advising him along the way.</p><p>The one thing I worry about is the Trump people still keep talking about denuclearization from the beginning. And I really don't believe Kim is prepared to denuclearize. It just would be an act of self-harm from North Korea's point of view.</p><p>But its nuclear weapons protected from China as well as the United States. One thing I might look to see if the summit takes place is talk of a peace treaty at long last between North and South Korea, in which Russia and China would have some sort of role as a kind of success before we get to the real nitty-gritty of denuclearization.</p><p>Because if we get there, it will have to be staged, it will be very much involved with inspections, with intrusive foreign looks inside North Korea. Very hard for me to imagine there will be a big agreement to denuclearize before economic sanctions are lifted. I think if it is going to happen, it will have to be a long stage-by- stage process.</p><p>HOWELL: A lot of serious questions that have yet to be answered. Steven Erlanger, live for us in Brussels and Jasper Kim, live in Seoul, South Korea, gentlemen, thank you for your time and perspective. We'll keep in touch with you.</p><p>Live around the world, you're watching CNN NEWSROOM.

Now you see an historic vote count getting under way on a referendum on whether to overturn some of the strictest abortion laws in the developed world. Early exit polls say that the voters there want to happen and, if it doesn't, it will be a major change for Ireland.</p><p>Our Atika Shubert is following all of this from Dublin.</p><p>Atika, obviously these results will be clear in the coming hours but tell us more about what you're learning from the exit polls, suggesting that a large number of people are voting for change.</p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely. Those ballot boxes just opened 15 minutes ago. We will get the official results in a few hours. But meanwhile, Ireland has already woken up to the exit polls.</p><p>RTE, the Irish broadcaster, showing that nearly 70 percent of respondents voted in favor of amending the constitution and liberalizing abortion laws here in Ireland. Only 30 percent against. Those are some decisive numbers. We'll have to see how the official results compare.</p><p>The count will actually be tallied here in Dublin Castle and then, of course, we'll get the results shortly afterwards. But it does appear to be an historic day for Ireland. And it is something that a number of people have been looking forward to, campaigners for decades campaigning for abortion rights.</p><p>And Ireland's prime minister last night putting out a tweet, thanking everybody for voting and saying it does look to be that history will be made today -- George.</p><p>HOWELL: Again, if this does happen, it would be major change. But help our viewers understand the legacy behind this issue in Ireland. Given the deep roots of the Catholic Church there, again, this would be a major shift in opinion.</p><p>SHUBERT: Absolutely. It is a seismic shift. Ireland has had some of the strictest laws on abortion in Europe, in the Western world. And in 1983, actually another referendum voted into the constitution, the eighth amendment, which said that the rights of the unborn are equal to the rights of the mother.</p><p>And that is what really was the legal basis for banning abortion this Ireland. So this vote, if the official results mirror what we see in the exit polls, would completely reverse that. And one of the most amazing things to come out of the debate on this is the number of stories that women have been coming forward, to tell about often these deeply and emotional and traumatic stories about how they have had to seek abortions to terminate pregnancies.</p><p>We spoke to young women, teenagers who felt alone and isolated who had to travel abroad for terminations but also to older mothers, who -- one woman who we spoke to who had, very sadly, a fatal fetal abnormality and had to terminate the pregnancy. And the sort of heartwrenching stories that came out that were in the public debate here.</p><p>And I think that really showed the big societal shift that we saw happening in Ireland, not just in the debate running up to this but that has been going on for several decades now.</p><p>HOWELL: And again, the results will be more clear in the coming hours But from what we're understanding, Atika, people are voting for a big change there. Live in Dublin, Ireland, thank you so much for your time. We'll stay in touch with you.</p><p>The disgraced Hollywood producer <person><nameText>Harvey Weinstein </nameText></person>is out on bail.</p><p>[04:20:00]</p><p>HOWELL: This after being charged with rape and criminal sexual acts. Weinstein has repeatedly denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex. But the arraignment Friday was a victory for more than 80 women who've accused him of sexual harassment or assault over several decades. Our Brynn Gingras has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hollywood megaproducer <person><nameText>Harvey Weinstein </nameText></person>in handcuffs, walking into court today, facing rape charges. They stem from the accounts of two women, including an aspiring actress, who first spoke out in a 2017 \"New Yorker\" article, alleging Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him at his office in 2004.</p><p>Tonight, Weinstein is out of jail after posting a $1 million cash bail but not before surrendering his passport, being forced to wear a monitoring device 24/7 and traveling only between New York and Connecticut.</p><p>The criminal charges are the first to be filed against Weinstein after dozens of women including, several A-list actresses, made various sexual misconduct accusations against the media mogul last year, among them, Gwyneth Paltrow...</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>GWYNETH PALTROW, ACTOR: We had one instance in a hotel room, where he tried to -- where he made a pass at me. And then I really kind of stood up to him.</p><p>GINGRAS (voice-over): -- Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Lupita Nyong'o, Ashley Judd...</p><p>ASHLEY JUDD, ACTOR: I fought with this volley of nos, which he ignored.</p><p>GINGRAS (voice-over): -- and actress Rose McGowan, one of the first women to publicly accuse Weinstein of rape.</p><p>ROSE MCGOWAN, ACTOR: We got you. Yes.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>MCGOWAN: To see him in cuffs on the way out, whether he smiled or not, that is a very good feeling.</p><p>GINGRAS (voice-over): Weinstein denies having nonconsensual sex with any of his accusers and his attorney insisted today, his client is innocent.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My job is not to defend behavior. My job is to defend something that is criminal behavior. Bad behavior, Mr. Weinstein did not invent the casting couch in Hollywood. And to the extent that there is bad behavior in that industry, that is not what this is about.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP, \"SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK\")</p><p>GINGRAS (voice-over): It is a stunning fall for the man behind several major movies, like \"Silver Linings Playbook,\" \"The King's Speech\" and \"Shakespeare in Love,\" just to name a few, some of which earned Weinstein dozens of awards for his work behind the camera.</p><p>But now he is the focus of investigations for alleged sex crimes, not just in New York but also in Los Angeles and London -- Brynn Gingras, CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL: Brynn, thank you for the reporting.</p><p>The next time you fly and perhaps you've had one too many, remember this. The law prohibits the airline from serving an intoxicated passenger. That was apparently what started a bit of a mixup on board American Airlines, a flight from St. Croix to Miami on Wednesday.</p><p>The video is a bit hard to hear but we'll take you through what happened when passenger Jason Felix wanted another drink.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE). We'll be there in an hour.</p><p>Why are you upset?</p><p>(INAUDIBLE).</p><p>HOWELL (voice-over): Got to remember, everybody has got a camera. People capture this. It doesn't take long for Felix to get more animated, still demanding the flight attendant get him another drink and even taking jabs at the flight attendant.</p><p>And it didn't end there. Punches flew. Other passengers jumped in to try to calm the man down. According to a criminal complaint, Felix spit blood at one of them, even threatened to kill them.</p><p>After this, the captain turned on the seat belt sign, he instructed everyone to return to their seats. Eventually passengers were able to calm Felix down a bit, although he was still agitated, talking loudly, punching the overhead bins.</p><p>When the plane landed in Miami, four officers from Miami-Dade Police went on board and, after a bit of friendly convincing there, Felix got off the plane and was handed over to the FBI. He was arrested for interfering with a member of the flight crew. Felix now has a reservation before a judge, set for Tuesday.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWELL: You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.

Video footage shows that oligarch, who was recently sanctioned by the U.S., arriving at Trump Tower during the transition period.</p><p>In this exclusive report, Matthew Chance tracked down the Russian billionaire.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHANCE: Mr. Vekselberg, a quick question from CNN.</p><p>VEKSELBERG: No, thank you, not now.</p><p>CHANCE: Mr. Vekselberg, Why did your company pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>lawyer?</p><p>VEKSELBERG: Not now.</p><p>CHANCE (voice-over): He is yet another media-shy Russian billionaire linked with the Kremlin and mired in allegations of collusion with the Trump team. The FBI questioned Victor Vekselberg about payments to Trump attorney Michael Cohen by his company's U.S. affiliate. They say it was for consulting work. We asked about the payments, too.</p><p>VEKSELBERG: Really appreciate. Just later, OK?</p><p>Really appreciate. I understand. I understand. But you are so aggressive.</p><p>CHANCE: No, I'm not.</p><p>VEKSELBERG: Please wait. Please later.</p><p>CHANCE (voice-over): We now know that Vekselberg met Cohen even before <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>was inaugurated. These recently unearthed January 2017 images from the lobby of Trump Tower in New York show the Russian billionaire wearing a hat and coat, checking in at the security desk, lingering for several minutes and then entering an elevator with his business partner.</p><p>Cohen hasn't responded for comment but a person familiar with the meeting tells CNN that the two went up to Cohen's office on the 26th floor, although they did not meet the then president-elect himself. They left the building just 27 minutes later.</p><p>A person familiar with the meeting told CNN that Vekselberg and Cohen discussed improving U.S.-Russia relations. But what exactly this now sanctioned Russian billionaire expected remains unclear -- Matthew Chance, CNN, St. Petersburg, Russia.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL: Matthew, thanks for the reporting.</p><p>Let's talk about the situation from people who live near Hawaii's erupting Kilauea Volcano. It feels like a never-ending emergency with no real end in site. On Friday, the U.S. Geological Survey says there were 90 earthquakes in the span of six hours.</p><p>Ash plumes were being thrown 3 kilometers, about 10,000 feet into the air. And more people are being told to leave, as molten lava flows further into the streets towards their homes. While many have already packed up their belongings, one man stayed to battle this volcano's destructive fury. Scott McLean has his story for us.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Kilauea continues to force evacuations here in Hawaii. People are especially reluctant to stay behind because it is almost impossible to protect your home from lava. I say almost because we met a man who took on Mother Nature and won, all to protect a property that is not even his.</p><p>STEVE HILL, HAWAII RESIDENT: It's a beautiful place. It's a place that feels very alive.</p><p>MCLEAN (voice-over): It was two decades ago that Steve Hill found his slice of Hawaiian paradise. And two weeks ago, he came to grips with losing it.</p><p>MCLEAN: You left this place fully expecting you wouldn't come home to it.</p><p>HILL: Lost. Lost.</p><p>MCLEAN (voice-over): Hill and his wife packed up their furniture and left for the mainland. He even left a shot of gin on the deck for Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess, assuming both the gin and his two homes would be swallowed up.</p><p>HILL: We left feeling heartbroken. It's like our homes are gone.</p><p>MCLEAN (voice-over): But his contractor and close friend, Darryl Clinton, had other ideas.</p><p>DARRYL CLINTON, CONTRACTOR: Might want to step back on this one.</p><p>MCLEAN (voice-over): Just one week ago, CNN was with Clinton while he was defending Hill's homes against flying chunks of molten lava. Windows had already been destroyed, so had the water catchment tank. Some lava bombs even came crashing through the roof.</p><p>Armed with little more than a garden hose, Clinton doused the flaming rocks before they torched the entire house.</p><p>CLINTON: These are the ones that catch the ceiling on fire.</p><p>MCLEAN (voice-over): The 24/7 task was difficult and even more dangerous. After almost a week, Hill told Clinton to leave and let the houses burn.</p><p>HILL: You can't do this, this is unsafe. It's time to stop. Valiant effort. I'm humbled by how hard you've tried. MCLEAN (voice-over): But Clinton didn't leave until the next day and it wasn't by choice. A line-drive lava bomb broke his leg, severed an artery and nearly took his foot off.</p><p>CLINTON: Just took my leg out and threw me against the wall. It was the most extreme force I've --</p><p>[04:35:00]</p><p>CLINTON: -- ever felt in my life.</p><p>MCLEAN (voice-over): The extreme heat burned up the deck, the wall and almost an entire dining set. But thanks to a fast-acting neighbor with a water jug, the house survived and so did Darryl.</p><p>HILL You're blessed with neighbors like that.</p><p>MCLEAN (voice-over): Hill returned to Hawaii to find his homes and his friend who helped build them both badly in need of repair.</p><p>HILL: When Darryl is done rebuilding himself then we'll get on to rebuilding houses.</p><p>MCLEAN: He is a journeyman.</p><p>HILL: He is a journeyman. He is a beautiful person.</p><p>MCLEAN (voice-over): In a place where lava insurance is far too costly to be common, Hill knows that saying thank you isn't saying nearly enough.</p><p>HILL: This place stands because Darryl chose not to go home. It stands because he believed that he could save it. I mean, that is it.</p><p>MCLEAN: Darryl Clinton has a metal rod in his leg, he's had at least three surgeries and right now he is in Honolulu for another one. He has a long road ahead of him but he does have support. His friend Steve Hill says that he will do whatever he can to get Darryl back on his feet. And his other neighbors are doing what they can to pitch in as well -- Scott McLean, CNN, Pahoa, Hawaii.</p><p>(WEATHER REPORT)</p><p>HOWELL: Still ahead here on NEWSROOM, the E.U.'s new data laws are now in play and it may be causing a flood of privacy policy updates in your inbox. We'll explain that ahead.</p><p>Plus Alexa, is Alexa spying on you?</p><p>How Amazon's voice assistant ended up sharing a user's private conversation with a random contact. Yikes.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[04:40:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>HOWELL: Have you checked your inbox today?</p><p>The e-mails that may be driving you, me and everyone a bit crazy, websites telling you that they have updated their privacy policies. But this is not spam. It is part of a new regulation rolled out across the European Union. And some of the world's biggest companies could be breaking the rules already. Samuel Burke explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Austrian lawyer Max Schrems (ph) has been fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for nearly a decade. And today, he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook for allegedly violating the E.U.'s new data protection law, called GDPR, the day it came into force.</p><p>MAX SCHREMS (PH), AUSTRIAN LAWYER: We were looking for big companies that really willfully violate the law, that try to ignore it and try to get away with it.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): Schrems (ph), who helped write the regulations. says he is taking legal action because Big Tech isn't complying with the law.</p><p>SCHREMS (PH): Various read that said here if we don't want this, we think it is stupid so we don't want to comply with is. And then there is obvious business interests. There is certain things that you simply can't do with data anymore that give a profit.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): The new law was supposed to stop companies from hoovering up your sensitive data, like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and sexuality, for advertising purposes without your consent. According to legal experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this requirement.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On your Facebook profile, you can put in things like sexuality, religion or political beliefs. And if you put that on, you don't have any choice but for Facebook to use it to personalize content, to deliver the advertising and so on.</p><p>BURKE: There is only an \"I accept\" button.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Exactly.</p><p>BURKE: There's not an \"I don't accept\" button.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Exactly. You've got it.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): He says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your profile, Facebook can still glean information, such as your sexual orientation, by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other websites, too. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Facebook can infer things from the great amount of data it has about you across the Web and also across your mobile devices and apps that also send data to Facebook.</p><p>BURKE: As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making these inferences that they make about us?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. That law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without explicit consent.</p><p>BURKE: Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook. European data regulators can impose a fine of up to 4 percent of its global annual revenue.</p><p>Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): In a statement to CNN, Facebook's chief privacy officer said the company has, quote, \"introduced better tools for people to access --</p><p>[04:45:00]</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): -- \"download and delete their information.\"</p><p>The company also says it is building a new tool that will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them it collects from other websites and apps.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do expect about to be fully compliant on May 25th.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): Lawyer Max Schrems (ph) believes the new rules are tough enough to prevent the kind of data scraping that companies like Cambridge Analytica have engaged in.</p><p>SCHREMS (PH): If reinforced improperly, we can actually get a balance in this digitalized age. In the end, you, as a customer, have the possibility to use, let's say, Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): However the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data regulations are already redrawing the line between profit and privacy -- Samuel Burke, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL: To talk more about this, we have with us Jesse Bockstedt, an associate professor of information systems at Emory University.</p><p>It's a pleasure to have you hear with us, Jesse, to talk about this.</p><p>So what is the deal with all of these e-mails, from big and small companies alike, flooding our inboxes with these compliance notes, basically asking consumers to take action?</p><p>Consumers have asked for more control over their personal data.</p><p>What does this mean for them?</p><p>JESSE BOCKSTEDT, EMORY UNIVERSITY: Well, we're seeing all these e- mails because the regulation in Europe states that any company that operates in Europe or has users based in Europe has to notify users of how they will use their data, how they plan to distribute their data.</p><p>And all these companies are now notifying everyone of how they are trying to comply with the new regulations. I think what we'll see for users going forward is a lot more requests for consent.</p><p>One of the things that really is laid out in the GDPR is this requirement for consent to capture and process personal data from users. And in the past or up to this point, it has mostly been an opt-out thing; by default you are sharing your data with these companies.</p><p>And now it is moving the needle more toward an opt-in type scenario, where you actually have to give explicit permission and these companies now have to justify why they need that data, how they plan to use that data.</p><p>So in theory, users will have a lot more rights around their data, rights to access and understand how their data is being used and distributed, rights to erase their data if they want to remove it from the services.</p><p>Whether or not they take advantage of those rights, that is the big question. Actually privacy researchers have long talked about something called the privacy paradox, which is that users claim they want privacy, they want more control over their data. But then their actions online and the types of services and things they do say the counter to that.</p><p>So it will be interesting to see how many users take advantage of these new regs.</p><p>HOWELL: Let's talk about this, because the regulations apply to Europe but we're seeing companies around the world seem to take a blanket approach just to be in compliance with this.</p><p>Has Europe really set the stage for the rest of the world to follow?</p><p>BOCKSTEDT: I think so. It may be a little bit longer before we see these regulations here in the U.S. Europe and the European Union, both citizens and lawmakers, tend to have a stronger stance on privacy than we see here in the United States.</p><p>But I think these regulations do capture what users want to see. So I know there are some proposals in California with similar types of regulations. Right now, in the United States, it is more of a state- by-state thing in terms of things like notifications on data breaches. And I think we'll see more coming down the pike.</p><p>One thing that is interesting is how this will affect the business models of the companies that require heavily on personal data for revenue, for target advertising and things like that.</p><p>HOWELL: One person that has been on the hot seat with regards to transparency, with regards to security, the CEO of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg. He was in Europe, talking to regulators there and he spoke about regulation. Let's listen and we'll talk about it on the other side.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, COFOUNDER AND CEO, FACEBOOK: We're doubling the number of people working on safety and security at our company to more than 20,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>On top of the investments that we're making in other areas, I expect that these increased investments in security will significantly impact our profitability. But I want to be clear, keeping people safer will always be more important than maximizing our profits.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOWELL: Critics say that he danced around a lot of their questions, that Facebook continues to skirt around the regulations.</p><p>Basically what are the biggest takeaways from what you heard from Zuckerberg?</p><p>BOCKSTEDT: I think they haven't quite figured it out yet. They are moving in the right direction, I think, employing an additional 10,000 people to monitor and curate content. It is a great move to make sure data is not being misused, abused and deal with things like fake news.</p><p>[04:50:00]</p><p>BOCKSTEDT: And pursuing machine learning and artificial intelligence- type solutions is the right way to move. But it may be a while before those capabilities are there to provide the scale that is needed.</p><p>At the end of the day I think he didn't provide the detail that the lawmakers were looking to hear. The E.U. lawmakers had the advantage of seeing his testimony in the United States and knowing what type of questions to ask. And they asked tougher questions and looked for more details, in my opinion.</p><p>They focused in on things like whether or not Facebook is reaching a monopoly type environment. And I think the concerns in Europe are a lot stronger than they were during the U.S. hearings. And so I don't think he provided enough detail. But the format wasn't good for that, either.</p><p>They asked all their questions first and then he responded to all of them at once at the end in about 25 minutes, which made it difficult for him to address all the issues. It also gave him an opportunity to skip over issues that maybe he didn't want to talk about.</p><p>And so I think, hopefully, if there is followup hearings on this, hopefully there is more of a question-response so we can get more answers. But at the end of the day, I don't think they have quite figured it out yet. And it is an ongoing process.</p><p>HOWELL: We'll talk to you more next hour about breaches. The companies have to notify consumers about breaches and also the fines. Jesse Bockstedt, thanks for your time today. We'll be back.</p><p>BOCKSTEDT: Thanks, George.</p><p>HOWELL: We'll be right back after the break.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[04:55:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>HOWELL: The Amazon voice assistant, Alexa, can do many things and apparently even snoop on your private conversations. Our Anna Stewart explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It is a cautionary tale of technology telling too much. A woman in Oregon says Amazon's Alexa recorded and then e-mailed a random person with a private conversation that took place in her house.</p><p>DANIELLE, ECHO OWNER: I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion. Like immediately, I'm like I'm never plugging that device in again. I can't trust it.</p><p>STEWART (voice-over): Amazon Echo owner Danielle says she was chatting with her husband about hardwood floors when the device sent an audio file to a man who worked for her husband. She only found out about the recording when she received an alarming phone call.</p><p>DANIELLE: The person on the other line, said unplug your Alexa devices right now. We go around and unplug them all and he proceeded to tell us that he had received audio files, recordings from what was going on in our house.</p><p>STEWART (voice-over): Amazon told CNN affiliate KR7 (ph) the device misinterpreted commands like \"send message\" and the contact's name as part of the background conversation and called it an extremely rare occurrence. It is unknown if the couple didn't hear Alexa's voice replies or see the speaker light up when it was activated.</p><p>Or if the device responded at all. By the way, it is a case of mixed signals that has a lot of consumers thinking twice about just who or what they bring into the house.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HOWELL: Creepy.

The authoritarian regime could suppress or promote content to benefit the Chinese Communist Party, the experts said. Data collected through the app could be used to create propaganda, they went on to say. TikTok has denied that it's beholden to China, and Microsoft is in talks to purchase the app. </p><p>TikTok could become a powerful propaganda tool capable of shifting American public opinion if it remains in the hands of its Chinese parent company, national security analysts and China experts told the Daily Caller News Foundation. The authoritarian regime could use data collected through TikTok to produce more targeted, and consequently, effective propaganda, the experts, who favored banning the app, said. The app could also be used to influence U.S. politics, spy on the nation, or suppress, or promote content to benefit the Chinese Communist Party. 'You could influence political behavior or engage in information environment-shaping, or propaganda. All these things can be done, and have been done,' Stephen Yates, CEO of the public policy consultancy firm DC International Advisory, said of a foreign country's ability to use social media platforms as weapons. TikTok has faced increased scrutiny across both the U.S. government as well as private industry, and President Donald Trump floated banning the app. Microsoft is in preliminary talks to purchase TikTok from its parent company, ByteDance, the software company confirmed Sunday. Suppressing and promoting content China could control what content users see on the app, suppressing videos that are critical of the authoritarian regime or amplifying ones it finds beneficial, according to Yates. While TikTok is primarily known for its use among Generation Z to create and view dance and comedy videos, the app has already reportedly influenced U.S. politics on at least one occasion.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) TikTok users coordinated[1] an effort to get people who didn't intend on attending a Trump campaign rally in Tulsa sign up for it, CNN[2]reported in June. OneTikTok post[3] urging fans of Korean pop to sign up for June rally received over 100,000 likes. Mary Jo Laupp, a 51-year-old women in Iowa, reportedly kickstarted the troll campaign. Laupp'svideo[4] encouraging people to register for free tickets to the rally garnered more than 2 million views. The Trump campaign disputed the claims, saying it weeds out phony registrations. Yet demonstrations in Hong Kong that received worldwide attention were barely mentioned[5] on TikTok, according to a Washington Post report. A hashtag used to identify posts showing resistance to an extradition bill supposedly designed to weaken Hong Kong autonomy, #antielab, had only 11 posts[6] on TikTok, but collected more than 34,000 posts on Instagram[7] at the time of reporting. Meanwhile, Hashtags for #HongKongProtests on TikTok returned either a single video or an error message telling users that TikTok could not 'find this hashtag: Check out trending videos.' TikTok also directed moderators to censor content that mentions Tiananmen Square and Tibetan independence and banned religious groups, The Guardian reported[8]in 2019, citing leaked documents highlighting the app's moderation guidelines. The app could similarly suppress content regarding China's treatment of Uighurs, Yates told the DCNF. Numerous reports have shown Uighurs being held in concentration camps[9] and being subjected to forced sterilization[10].Comparing TikTok To FacebookYates, a foreign policy expert whoworked[11] as a deputy national security adviser to former Vice President Dick Cheney, compared TikTok's potential political influence to how Russia used Facebook posts and advertisements to disrupt the U.S. political system ahead of the 2016 election. The Russian government spread disinformation to users on a variety of social media platforms during the last presidential election cycle. Facebook gave[12] Congress roughly 3,000 ads in 2017 with links to Russia. The company said it sold $100,000 worth of ads to Russian-linked sources that investigators believe were trying to influence the the 2016 election. But when it comes to data collection, TikTok and Facebook can't be equated, according to Yates. Washington Post tech columnist Geoffrey Fowler argued[13] on a July 13 that much of the concerns related to TikTok's alleged privacy violations are driven by 'xenophobia' and compared its data collection to Facebook, which owns Instagram. 'This would be a commercial and political communication platform that gives a hostile power access to people's cell phones and computers in which their entire lives have become dependent,' Yates said of TikTok. The app is totally 'within China's sphere of influence,' he added. And Matt Stoller, the Research Director at the American Economic Liberties Project, told the DCNF that the difference between a company like Facebook and TikTok is that one is 'controlled by a greedy American' corporation, while the 'other is controlled by a genocidal regime hostile to liberal democracy.' TikTok's executives have also managed to avoid U.S. oversight. TikTok executives 'couldn't attend hearings and testify because executives were located in #China[14],' Sen. Josh Hawley tweeted[15] in May. He linked to a report that a former Disney executive, Kevin Mayer, would become the app's new CEO. 'But this new executive lives in the USA,' the Missouri Republican continued. 'I look forward to hearing from him. Under oath.' Meanwhile, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, along with the CEOs of Google, Apple and Amazon, testified before the House Judiciary's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law on July 29 over lawmaker concerns that they are building their empires through anti-competitive methods.Potential collaboration with ChinaTikTok has the potential to be used as a spying tool for China, according to Dan Blumenthal, the director of Asian Studies at the American Enterprise Institute. 'The Chinese are building a mass of information about the U.S. including a 'human network map' that makes connections it deems important among U.S. financial, corporate, policy media and political elites,' Blumenthal, who supports banning the app, told the DCNF. 'This is both for espionage purposes as well as for purposes of influencing U.S. politics.' Blumenthal did not elaborate on how such data could be used to spy on Americans. But China's National Intelligence Law[16] gives the government authority to compel Chinese companies to collect and provide any information it requests, including data on foreign users, Quartz reported[17]in 2017. The law makes spying a duty for Chinese companies,Yi-Zheng Lian, a former chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal, wrote in a2019 New York Timeseditorial[18]. TheAustralian Strategic Policy Institute[19] reported in 2019 that ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, worked alongside the Chinese Communist Party to enforce the country's strict censorship laws. ByteDance 'engaged in deeply unethical behavior in Xinjiang, where their work directly supports and enables mass human rights abuses,' the report, titled 'Mapping China's Tech Giants,' said. Xinjiang contains concentration camps where Uighers are held and forced into labor. 'ByteDance collaborates with public security bureaus across China, including in Xinjiang where it plays an active role in disseminating the party-state's propaganda on Xinjiang,' thereport[20]stated. ByteDance also established a joint venture in December 2019 with a Chinese state media group, Shanghai Dongfang Newspaper Company, Reutersreported[21]in 2019. Additionally, Check Point Research found[22] vulnerabilities in the app that could allow cyber attackers to gain control of TikTok accounts, change the privacy settings on videos, upload videos without permission and obtain email addresses of select users. The app collects troves of data on users,according[23] to the company's privacy policy. If a user downloads and opens an app without ever creating an account, for instance, then TikTok can collect a user's IP address, browsing history on the app, mobile carrier, location data when using a mobile device and information on the device used to gain access to TikTok. Once a user creates an account, TikTok can gather details about every video a user uploads, the length of time he or she watches a video, what type of content he or she like the most, which videos are shared, and any messages a user exchanges on the app. The app's portal also asks users for permission to access other social media accounts, their phone number contact list, and geolocation data.'We are not the enemy'Yates, Blumenthal and Stoller made their comments before TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer addressed concerns about data, before Trump threatened to ban[24] TikTok and before the notion of Microsoft purchasing[25] the app became public. 'TikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy,' Mayer wrote[26] Wednesday. He said TikTok will address concerns about 'the company's Chinese origins' 'through greater transparency and accountability.' Mayer did not address what the company would do if China demanded user data. ButTikTok dismisses claims that the company is beholden to the authoritarian regime. 'Our security team is led out of the U.S. by our Chief Information Security Officer who has 30-years of Department of Defense and financial services industry experience,' a company spokesperson said in a statement to the DCNF. 'TikTok collects much less U.S. user information than many of the companies in our space and stores it in the U.S. and Singapore.' The app launched what company executives called a transparency center in Los Angeles to allow government officials to monitor TikTok's content review process, thecompany[27]noted in a March blog post. U.S. officials have reported evidence that TikTok is providing personal user data to the CCP. The company is under national security review, Reuters[28] reported Wednesday.Increasing scrutinyRegardless, companies often use personal data to dramatically influence how people behave and think, according to researchers at Cracked Lab, an independent research institute based in Austria that measures how information networks impact human thinking. '[D]ata-driven persuasion undermines the concept of rational choice and thus the basic foundation of market economy,' the group's researcherswrote[29]ina 2017 report, referring to methods and techniques tech companies use to manipulate users into engaging with content.'When used in political campaigns or in other efforts to shape public policy, it may undermine democracy at large.' A bipartisan slate of lawmakers and U.S. officials have determined TikTok is a major threat. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, for example,suggested[30]during in a July 7 Fox News interview that Americans should download the app 'only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, asked the U.S. intelligence community in 2019 to assess TikTok's national security risks, saying that such apps could be used to spy on U.S. citizens or become targets of foreign influence. Hawley also wants[31]officials to more closely scrutinize the Chinese app. Companies, governmental bodies, and U.S. political campaigns are asking employees to delete the app. Wells Fargo told employees to delete the app amid what executives said were concerns about security, CNNreported[32]on July 13.Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign also directed staffers to stop using TikTok over security concerns, Bloombergreported[33]. The Department of Defense also advisedmilitary personnel in January to remove the app for similar reasons, The New York Timesreported[34]. But a federal ban of the app is too extreme, according to Peter Micek, a digital human rights expert at Access Now, a digital rights nonprofit. '[B]anning apps is an extreme measure that does not meet international human rights standards,' Micektold Vice[35]on July 15. 'Under international human rights law, blocking an entire service or application is not regarded as necessary and proportionate and has been declared unlawful in several instances.' Much of the concerns related to TikTok's ties to China can be solved through comprehensivedata protection regulations[36], Micek argued. The General Data Protection Regulation, a European Union law passed in 2016, gives social media users control over their own personal data, ZDNetreported[37]in 2019. The law requires companies that gather a person's personal information to disclose the data they collect, declare the reason for processing such data, and explicitly state how long the information will be retained, ZDNet noted. Companies must also explain if any data is being redirected to third-party groups. Conversely, Stoller supports banning the Chinese app. 'It's hard to convey just what a yawning gap there is between elite opinion and the obvious right thing to do. The [People's Republic of China] is a dangerous expansionist threat. Literally the least we could do is not allow them to manipulate tens of millions of Americans,' hewrote in a July 20 tweet,[38]referring to critics of banning the application.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is availablewithout charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Without a federal law, technology companies, retailers, advertising firms and others dependent on collecting consumer data to track users and increase sales must adapt to the California law, potentially harming corporate profits over the long term. The delay is a setback for companies ranging from Amazon (AMZN.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O) to Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google and retailers like Walmart Inc (WMT.N), who either directly collect shopper information to run their websites, or provide free services and derive revenues from advertising that relies on online data collection. </p><p>'This will be tremendously challenging companies need to really focus on complying with California now because there is not going to be a life raft from a federal level,' Gary Kibel, a partner specializing in technology and privacy at law firm Davis ...lbert. While the sources, who are involved in the negotiations, still think it is possible at least one discussion draft of the bill could land before the year ends, congressional negotiators must still agree on whether it is adequate to simply ask consumers to consent to collection of personally identifiable information and give them the opportunity to opt out and how the new law would be enforced. They are also negotiating how much information should be deemed private and where one should draw the line in terms of exchange of consumer information with third parties, the sources said. The effort to draft a federal bill is being led by Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal, Brian Schatz and Maria Cantwell along with Republican Senators Jerry Moran, Commerce Committee chairman Roger Wicker and the Senate's No. 2 Republican, John Thune. Two sources said Senators Blumenthal and Moran's staff are working on the federal bill and expected to release a draft before the end of the year. One of those sources said a draft of the House version of the bill could land in a few weeks. California's data privacy law will affect any major company with an online presence and requires companies with data on more than 50,000 people to allow consumers to view the data they have collected on them. It also lets consumers request deletion of data, and opt out of having the data sold to third parties. Each violation carries a $7,500 fine. Companies are also waiting for the state attorney general to roll out regulations around the law in California. While it is only meant to protect California consumers, it is not known whether companies adapt their business practices to work under one set of rules for the most populous U.S. state, and existing rules for the other 49 states. 'California will go into effect without Congress doing anything this year on the federal bill,' said a source with direct knowledge of the matter, who did not wish to be named and is pushing for a federal privacy bill. 'That's a big problem because of the business impact this will have,' the source said. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. Google and Amazon declined comment. President ...O Michael Beckerman of the Internet Association, which counts Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft as its members, said in a statement that there is broad bipartisan consensus for a federal privacy law and urged Congress to act on it now. Walmart did not comment and referred Reuters to the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA). Nicholas Ahrens, a vice president at RILA, which counts Walmart as a member, said the group is continuing to work with Congress toward a federal legislation and is hopeful a bipartisan solution can be reached. Despite the immediate delay, the privacy bill remains one of the few pieces of legislation that many lobbyists still believe has a decent chance of becoming law because it is a bipartisan concern and does not cost taxpayers money.

The Justice Department said Tuesday that it will start an antitrust review into how powerful internet companies had accumulated market power and whether they had acted to reduce competition. The announcement follows similar inquiries underway in Congress and at the Federal Trade Commission, which shares antitrust oversight responsibilities with the Justice Department. The Justice Department did not name specific companies in a news release announcing its review, but noted that it would look into concerns about search, social media and some retail services - presumably putting Google, Facebook and Amazon on notice. </p><p>The pressure on tech giants has ended decades of deferential treatment toward the industry. In Congress, the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust is holding hearings and conducting its own investigation of the market power and behavior of the big tech companies. At a hearing last week, with witnesses from Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple, Rep. David Cicilline, chairman of the subcommittee, said that the government stance for too long was to celebrate the new tech economy rather than scrutinize its corporate leaders. \"Congress and antitrust enforcers allowed these firms to regulate themselves with little oversight,\" Cicilline, D-R.I., said in his opening statement. \"As a result, the internet has become increasingly concentrated, less open, and growingly hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship.\" On Tuesday, Cicilline sent letters to three of the companies at last week's hearing - Google, Facebook and Apple. He is seeking answers to questions posed at the hearing, but not directly addressed by the witnesses. Cicilline characterized those earlier replies as \"evasive, incomplete or misleading.\" In announcing the review, the Justice Department said it would look into whether the internet companies were \"harming consumers.\" For most of the last four decades, U.S. courts and regulators have interpreted the consumer harm standard of antitrust to mean that company behavior led to higher prices, but it's challenging to make that argument when services like Google and Facebook are free and Amazon is celebrated for low prices and convenient delivery. No immediate comments This latest review comes on the heels of the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission splitting up potential antitrust investigations into Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. It's not clear how this review will differ from the investigations into the individual companies. Google and Facebook declined to comment. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple referred to comments made by Tim Cook, the company's chief executive, in a recent television interview on CBS News. \"I think we should be scrutinized,\" Cook said. \"But if you look at any kind of measure about 'is Apple a monopoly or not,' I don't think anybody reasonable is going to come to the conclusion that Apple's a monopoly.\" While the major American technology companies have largely avoided antitrust scrutiny at home, they have been investigated more aggressively around the world, especially in Europe. In March, European authorities fined Google about $1.7 billion for antitrust violations in the online advertising market. The regulators said Google had violated antitrust rules by imposing unfair terms on companies that used its search bar on their websites in Europe. The fine was the third against Google by the European Union since 2017. A lesser force The United States, by contrast, has been seen as a lesser force in antitrust enforcement recently, with the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission moving more cautiously. \"If the United States does not step up, competition policy will be set elsewhere,\" said William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University and a former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN69215704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WN4-PKP1-JC8S-D560-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"678\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Kentucky officials rejected 32,349 mail-in ballots during the state's June primary election, more than one-quarter of which were rejected because of a missing perforated flap. </p><p>Even though the number is a fraction of the more than 1 million votes cast in Kentucky's on June 23, they illuminate a problem for the general election in November. The state has a closely-watched US Senate race between Democrat Amy McGrath and Republican Mitch McConnell, Senate majority leader and one of the most powerful men in Washington. </p><p>Among those rejected, a significant chunk were because of a problem with an inner envelope on the absentee ballot, <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/j0ZLUokdVX\">according to an analysis</url> of the data by University of Florida professor Michael McDonald. Kentucky requires voters to fill out and sign both an inner envelope - which they put their actual ballot in - and then an outer envelope, which they put the inner envelope in.</p><p>The inner envelope contains a perforated flap voters have to sign, but 3,932 ballots were rejected because the flap was unattached when it was returned. Another 3,332 ballots were rejected because the inner envelope was unsealed and 1,484 more ballots went uncounted because they didn't have a signature on the inner envelope. In total, 27% of rejected ballots in Kentucky were because of an inner envelope problem. </p><p> \"Over a quarter of the ballots that are being rejected [are] for some issue that seems to be a major design flaw with this inner envelope ,\" McDonald said. \"We're already at 9,000 ballots that are being rejected now. We could be looking at close to 20,000 if that US senate race is close, that could be determinative of the election outcome.\" </p><p>    Citizens wait in line to vote outside of a polling station in Louisville, Kentucky on Tuesday, June 23, 2020. In-person polling locations have been reduced from 3,700 to fewer than 200 amid a global pandemic. Photograph: Amy Harris/REX/Shutterstock   </p><p>McDonald noted the inner envelope issue could have caused even more ballots to be rejected. Another 11,670 ballots were rejected because of a signature issue, but local election officials did not include whether the signature defect was on the inner or outer envelope. </p><p>A handful of other states use inner envelopes to ensure the secrecy of a voter's ballot, but McDonald said in most other states the voter did not have to do anything with the inner envelope and just had to sign the outer one.</p><p>\"There is no clear purpose for signing the inner envelope other than to trip up voters and provide an excuse to reject their absentee ballots,\" he wrote in his analysis. \"Election officials should provide voters with an inner envelope where the flap does not detach. Kentucky should not require a second signature, which is unnecessary to establish a voter's identity.\"</p><p>The rejections underscore <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/j0ZLUokdVX\">a worry</url> that many voters could have their ballots rejected this fall for technical reasons, even though they are eligible voters. States can disqualify ballots for a number of reasons, including problems with a signature, or if a voter forgets to include information. </p><p>Mail-in ballot rejections typically don't get a lot of attention, but as more people vote by mail for the first time because of the Covid-19 pandemic, more people will have their ballots thrown out.

The American coronavirus death toll is the highest in the world, and more than 4.3 million cases have been recorded in the country. Donald Trump spent his day in Texas, to attend a fundraiser and visit an oil rig. During an official, taxpayer-funded event, the president railed against his 2020 opponent Joe Biden, touted his rollback of environmental regulations and signed permits to boost the ailing fossil fuel industry. Trump also attempted to stoke racial fears among rich, white voters, tweeting that Americans \"living their Suburban Lifestyle Dream\" would no longer be \"bothered\" by low-income housing, after he rescinded Obama-era protections against racial housing discrimination. A jobless aid program is set to expire amid a stalemate at the Capitol. Democrats want to extend a $600 benefit for unemployed Americans, as well as a moratorium on evictions - whereas Republicans and the administration have continued to insist that the program will disincentivize workers. House speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a requirement that representatives and staff wear masks on the House floor, after Texas congressman Louie Gohmert, one of several Republicans who have resisted masks, tested positive for coronavirus today. A federal judge in New York blocked the administration from implementing its \"public charge\" rule amid the coronavirus pandemic. The rule stipulates that immigrants who use public benefits can be denied a green card. Florida will close state-run Covid-19 testing sites for several days, starting tomorrow, due to a looming tropical storm, according to officials. The state is among the worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic. During a landmark congressional antitrust hearing with tech executives, lawmakers questioned the heads of Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google parent company Alphabet. \"Our founders would not bow before a king,\" said the judiciary antitrust subcommittee chairman, David Cicilline. \"Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.\" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the oldest supreme court justice, underwent a non-surgical procedure today and is expected to be released from the hospital this week. In a statement, the supreme court said that Ginsburg has undergone a \"minimally invasive non-surgical procedure\" today and is \"resting comfortably\". This is the justice's second hospital visit this month. Ginsburg, 87, recently revealed that her cancer had returned and she will remain on the court while undergoing chemotherapy. For updates on how the coronavirus pandemic is playing out around the world, follow the Guardian's live global coverage: Brazil confirmed nearly 70,000 coronavirus cases in new daily record. The country recorded 69,074 new confirmed cases and 1,595 related deaths, as the world's second-worst outbreak accelerates toward the milestone of 100,000 lives cut short. Guatemala is burying dozens of unidentified Covid-19 dead. Hospitals say they have had to bury dozens of Covid-19 victims who have never been identified, with one hospital creating archives in hopes that once the pandemic passes relatives will come looking for them. France saw its highest daily increase in cases in more than a month. The number of new coronavirus infections in France rose by 1,392 on Wednesday, a figure likely to fuel fears of a second wave despite officials downplaying such a scenario. The Catalan government eased lockdown in city of Lleida. 160,000 people had been ordered to stay home following a spike in infections. Lebanon reported its highest single-day infection tally. The country reporter 182 new coronavirus cases, ahead of fresh lockdown measures that go into effect at midnight. Barack Obama is expected to eulogize John Lewis, the civil rights icon and Georgia congressman, at the funeral in Atlanta tomorrow, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Obama awarded Lewis the presidential medal of freedom in 2011. The former US president first met the venerated civil rights leader when Obama was in law school. \"When I was elected President of the United States, I hugged him on the inauguration stand before I was sworn in and told him I was only there because of the sacrifices he made,\" Obama said when Lewis died. \"And through all those years, he never stopped providing wisdom and encouragement to me and Michelle and our family. We will miss him dearly.\" More than five hours after they commenced, the historic Congressional hearing of the biggest tech companies in the world over antitrust concerns have come to an end. Here are some highlights from the long day. Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon were represented by their CEOs at the hearing with the House antitrust subcommittee. Lawmakers cited \"millions\" of pages of evidence from years of antitrust investigations into these companies. Throughout the hearing, they brought up information gleaned from internal documents and conversations with anonymous sources in side the tech companies. Democratic lawmakers remained largely focused on antitrust issues, including market share and anti-competitive business practices while Republican lawmakers often zeroed in on perceived biases against conservatives on big tech platforms. Facebook faced most intensive criticism over its acquisition of Instagram. Apple faced most intensive criticism over its App store and whether it blocks competitors from using it. Google faced most intensive criticism over its advertising policies and its treatment of competitors. Amazon faced most intensive criticism over how it treats third-party brands on its site and whether it collects information from them and uses it to develop competing products (a practice that was reported on in April by the Wall Street Journal). Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat of Rhode Island, closed the hearing with a dramatic statement that seemed to suggest legislative action would be coming for the companies who participated today. \"These companies as they exist today have monopoly power,\" he said. \"Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.\" A federal judge in New York has stopped the Trump administration from implmenting its \"public charge\" rule, which stipulates that immigrants who use public benefits could be denied green cards. Judge George Daniels said the police discourages immigrants from seeking coronavirus testing and could threaten efforts to contain and suppress the pandemic. He blocked the administration from implementing the policy during the health crisis. \"Any policy that deters residents from seeking testing and treatment for COVID-19 increases the risk of infection for such residents and the public. Adverse government action that targets immigrants, however, is particularly dangerous during a pandemic,\" Daniels wrote in his ruling. The case could now go to the Supreme Cout, which previously denied requests from states to block the policy while legal challenges played out in lower courts. Several months ago, I reported that the rule has had a \"chilling effect\" - discouraging immigrants from seeking healthcare and other essential benefits out of fear that it will affect their ability to remain in the US: California state lawmakers are considering a plan to continue a $600 weekly unemployment benefit for state residents if Congress does not extend the emergency funding this month. \"We have millions of Californians that are on a financial cliff,\" said Phil Ting, a Democratic state lawmaker from San Francisco. \"They really need that money to pay rent, to buy food, to pay for everyday living expenses.\" Cuts in federal emergency assistance would probably put more California residents in danger of losing their housing, and could make California's homelessness crisis even worse, Ting said. \"The number one way you prevent the spread of Covid is you keep people in their homes,\" he said. Nancy Pelosi has announced that Congressmembers and their staff will be required to wear face masks while on House floor. The requirement comes after Louie Gohmert of Texas, one of several Republican lawmakers who resisted wearing masks in recent weeks, tested positive for Covid-19. All the state-run testing sites will close on Thursday evening and won't reopen until at least Tuesday, according to officials. The National Hurricane Center is predicting that a looming tropical weather system will develop into a storm, and the state's emergency management division is closing sites as a precaution, officials said in an email sent to testing site managers, per local station WCTV. Florida is currently a major coronavirus hotspot, with more than 451,000 cases. The administration and Republicans have yet to reach a deal with Congressional Democrats for an economic relief package. \"We are still very far apart on a lot of issues,\" treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters at the capitol. \"We're far from an agreement.\" The administration floated a short-term extension for a $600-a-week unemployment benefit for tens of millions of Americans, which is set to expire on Friday. Democrats want to extend that $600 per week benefit, which Congress first approved in March as part of the CARES Act, and a provision halting eviction through the end of the year. Republicans have opposed the aid, which they say disincentivizes workers. After the president announced that he will recall federal officers from Portland, Mijente, a Latinx &amp; Chicanx advocacy group, denounced the Department of Homeland security: \"The federal agents who descended on the city, uninvited and unwelcome, in unmarked vehicles, disappearing people with little to no regard for civil liberties, come from the Department of Homeland Security. This agency is bloated, overfunded, and it operates with impunity,\" co-founder Marisa Franco wrote in a statement shared with The Guardian. \"If this is what they do to mostly white US citizens in front of the media, imagine what they are doing to people in their custody, to people who are seeking refuge in isolated parts of the border,\" she said. \"Trump must be defeated in November. Trumpism must be defeated as well. That means dismantling agencies like DHS, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol.\" Alexandra Villarreal reports from Hidalgo county, Texas: The coronavirus pandemic haunts almost everything in this part of the Rio Grande valley, where more than 92% of the almost 900,000 strong population identifies as Hispanic or Latino. Hand-sanitizing machines and big bins with masks and gloves surround shoppers at the regional grocery store. Outside of Nomad Shrine Club, a rundown event space turned drive-thru pop-up, residents join a long line of people in cars in search of a Covid-19 test with rapid results. Even Tex Mex, a gentlemen's club, has a somber message for patrons: \"Clothed Again.\" \"The Rio Grande Valley has become the hotspot of a hotspot of a hotspot,\" said Ivan Melendez, Hidalgo county's health authority and a practicing clinician. \"We're at the epicenter of the coronavirus in the United States.\" Melendez recalled recently encountering a critically ill patient with an alarmingly low pulse. He tried to warn someone, but nurses informed him that a different doctor had already decided not to intervene because they \"didn't expect for [the patient] to survive\". In the United States, where the prevailing mantra for physicians is \"do no harm\", that kind of ruthless calculation strikes deep, especially when so many of the lives at stake are medically vulnerable and easily exploited. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy made a Freudian slip, it seems. Donald Trump, in Texas, has signed several permits for the energy industry, including one allowing the export of oil from Texas to Mexico. The oil industry has been ailing, and the pandemic has made things worse. Today, Trump has been touting his rollback of environmental regulations and deriding Democrats' plans to combat climate change. He called Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez's environmental plan the \"Green New Deal Disaster.\" \"I added the fourth word,\" the president helpfully told reporters. Barack Obama on Wednesday spoke out in continued support of the Black Lives Matter protests and expressed hope that they will inspire greater community cooperation in America while warning things could go either way. Speaking on the debut podcast of his wife, Michelle Obama, in a dialogue between the two, the 44th president did not talk explicitly about Donald Trump but agreed that some voters are discouraged from exercising their rights when they see a government in dysfunction. Michelle Obama said: \"The thing that I worry is that I hear, I think, too many young people who question whether voting, whether politics is worth it.\" Barack Obama pointed out that \"the only time they know about what government is doing is when...\" with his wife interjecting \"...is when it doesn't work, right?\" The former president agreed, saying: \"So we're getting a good lesson in that right now.\" He spoke of his hope that the kind of societal efforts that led to greater prosperity in the fifties, sixties and seventies come around again, but with greater advocacy for all. \"This time let's do it in a way that genuinely includes everybody,\" he said. \"If you take the blinders of racism, sexism, homophobia... All those things off. And say really our tribe is everybody.\" But he warned of the forces of division. \"It could still go both ways in this country just like it's teetering one way or the other in countries all around the world,\" he said. Johns Hopkins University's Covid-19 tracking project reported 150,034 people in America have died of Covid-19 at about 4pm ET Wednesday. America's terrible milestone comes as 21 states reach the \"red zone\" for potential Covid-19 outbreaks. The news came as Donald Trump traveled to Texas today, not to visit hospitals, doctors or patients, but to attend a fundraiser and visit an oil rig. He also spent time tweeting about the \"Suburban Lifestyle Dream,\" which he said would be free of low-income housing projects, because his administration rolled back protections on racial housing discrimination. The tweet has been condemned as racist and classist. Segregated housing is a major driver of health disparities that have placed black, Latino and Native American people at disproportionate risk for Covid-19 infection and death. US Republican Representative Louie Gohmert tested positive for coronavirus today, as did a Texas Republican running for office who was meant to greet the president. Gohmert has refused to wear a mask. Aides in Gohmert's office said they were goaded when they wore masks. US Representative Francis Rooney became the first Republican to vote by proxy today, despite Republican leadership's attempts to end the practice brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. Here is one image from just outside McAllen, Texas, where nurses treated a patient in one of several Covid-19 wards this month. Guardian voting rights reporter Sam Levine gives us this dispatch on franchise: Kentucky's mail-in voting ballots appear to have a \"major design flaw,\" according to an analysis of state data obtained by the Guardian. Kentucky officials rejected 32,349 mail-in ballots during the state's June primary election, more than one-quarter of which were rejected because of a missing perforated flap. Even though the number is a fraction of the more than 1 million votes cast in Kentucky's on June 23, they illuminate a problem for the general election in November. The state has a closely-watched US Senate race between Democrat Amy McGrath and Republican Mitch McConnell, Senate majority leader and one of the most powerful men in Washington. Among those rejected, a significant chunk were because of a problem with an inner envelope on the absentee ballot, according to an analysis of the data by University of Florida professor Michael McDonald. Kentucky requires voters to fill out and sign both an inner envelope - which they put their actual ballot in - and then an outer envelope, which they put the inner envelope in. The inner envelope contains a perforated flap voters have to sign, but 3,932 ballots were rejected because the flap was unattached when it was returned. Another 3,332 ballots were rejected because the inner envelope was unsealed and 1,484 more ballots went uncounted because they didn't have a signature on the inner envelope. In total, 27% of rejected ballots in Kentucky were because of an inner envelope problem. \"Over a quarter of the ballots that are being rejected [are] for some issue that seems to be a major design flaw with this inner envelope,\" McDonald said. \"We're already at 9,000 ballots that are being rejected now. We could be looking at close to 20,000 if that US senate race is close, that could be determinative of the election outcome.\" McDonald noted the inner envelope issue could have caused even more ballots to be rejected. Another 11,670 ballots were rejected because of a signature issue, but local election officials did not include whether the signature defect was on the inner or outer envelope. A handful of other states use inner envelopes to ensure the secrecy of a voter's ballot, but McDonald said in most other states the voter did not have to do anything with the inner envelope and just had to sign the outer one. \"There is no clear purpose for signing the inner envelope other than to trip up voters and provide an excuse to reject their absentee ballots,\" he wrote in his analysis. \"Election officials should provide voters with an inner envelope where the flap does not detach. Kentucky should not require a second signature, which is unnecessary to establish a voter's identity.\" The rejections underscore a worry that many voters could have their ballots rejected this fall for technical reasons, even though they are eligible voters. States can disqualify ballots for a number of reasons, including problems with a signature, or if a voter forgets to include information. Mail-in ballot rejections typically don't get a lot of attention, but as more people vote by mail for the first time because of the Covid-19 pandemic, more people will have their ballots thrown out. Research has shown that first time voters, young people, and minorities are more likely to have their mail-in ballots rejected. The United States has surpassed another tragic threshold, as Johns Hopkins University's Covid-19 tracking system reported 150,034 Americans died of Covid-19. The threshold was passed at about 4pm ET Wednesday. Since the first case of Covid-19 in January, the United States has emerged as an outlier, representing one-sixth of the 662,000 worldwide deaths from Covid-19 and so far failing to contain the spread of coronavirus. The center of the pandemic has moved from the American northeast, where widespread shutdowns began in New York City in March, to the sun belt region stretching from Florida to Southern California this summer, and as 21 more states are declared red zones for Covid-19 outbreaks. It also comes just one day after Trump praised a doctor who spread misinformation online and who believes alien DNA is used in medical treatments, and weeks before schools were set to reopen, a milestone many thought would be safe and achievable this spring. Today, Trump is in Texas, one of the worst-hit states in the nation, but not to visit hospitals, doctors or patients. Instead, he is attending a fundraiser and visiting an oil rig. Representative Francis Rooney from Florida becomes the first Republican Congressman to vote by proxy, saying the Capitol is not safe. Texas Representative Louie Gohmert tested positive for Covid-19 today. Here's more perspective on Trump's move to pull troops out of Germany from Guardian reporter Julian Borger: Trump wrongly claimed, as he has many times in the past, that Germany was not paying its \"Nato fees\". In fact, the friction between the US and Germany, as well as other European allies, is about national defence spending. The allies agreed in 2014 to spend 2% of their GDP on defence by 2024. Germany is currently on just under 1.4%, but Belgium, where the US will move some of its European Command (Eucom) headquarters, spends less than 1%, and Italy, to where the US will move an F-16 fighter squadron and two army battalions from Germany, spends 1.2%. Diplomats and former US officials have described Trump as fixated on Germany and its chancellor, Angela Merkel. \"He's obsessed with the idea that Germany is taking advantage of the US, over defence, but on trade, selling too many cars to the US for example. He has always been particularly rude to Merkel,\" a former White House official said. A second Texas Republican who was supposed to greet Trump in Midland, Texas has tested positive for coronavirus. Conservative Republican House candidate Wesley Hunt tested positive for Covid-19 while he was driving to Midland to greet the president. Hunt said in a tweet he was asymptomatic. US Representative Louie Gohmert, who refused to wear a mask and today tested positive for Covid-19, apparently forced his entire staff to come into the Capitol every day to work as an example of \"how to open up safely\". Also, Republican Alabama Governor Kay Ivey has extended the state's mandatory statewide mask mandate through August 31, including for children aged second grade (about 7-years-old) and up. More on Trump's decision to pull 11,900 American troops out of Germany, the president said because he does not believe Germany pays enough toward the NATO alliance. The process is likely to take years and cost American taxpayers billions of dollars. Donald Trump tweeted today about the anti-discrimination housing law his administration rescinded, but it's not the first time the president's family has been accused of racist housing policies. In the 1970s, the Trumps were also accused of working to prevent black tenants from moving into the middle class buildings that made his father, Fred Trump, rich. Here's more from a New York Times investigation, describing Maxine Brown, a black New York nurse who appeared to be a perfect tenant: Stanley Leibowitz, the rental agent, talked to his boss, Fred C. Trump. \"I asked him what to do and he says, 'Take the application and put it in a drawer and leave it there,'\" Mr. Leibowitz, now 88, recalled in an interview. Revered American folk singer Woody Guthrie, who was Fred Trump's tenant, also wrote about Donald Trump's father in a song titled Old Man Trump. Here are the lyrics, which address racial discrimination in housing: I suppose Old Man Trump knows Just how much Racial Hate he stirred up In the bloodpot of human hearts When he drawed That color line Here at his Eighteen hundred family project Will Kaufman, a professor of American literature and culture at the University of Central Lancashire in Britain told the New York Times that Guthrie, \"thought that Fred Trump was one who stirs up racial hate, and implicitly profits from it.\" Kaufman discovered the song while working on a book. In a move that will take years and cost billions of dollars, Donald Trump wants to pull 11,900 troops out of Germany and reposition them in Poland and other European countries. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters the move did relate to Trump's demands that Germany give more money to the NATO alliance, a claim Trump contradicted almost immediately after Esper asserted it. Here's more from AFP: The move, which will cost the US government several billion dollars, will cut the presence of US military personnel in Germany to around 24,000, Esper said. He stressed that the action is part of his broader plan to reposition US military forces around the world to better address key threats and enhance flexibility, including with the NATO alliance, which is focused on deterring a possible Russian threat to Europe. But at the White House Trump told reporters that Germany has not paid its fair share for the defense of Europe. \"They are there to protect Europe, they are there to protect Germany, and Germany is supposed to pay for it,\" Trump said of the troops, and move nearly 5,600 to other NATO countries, including Italy and Belgium. Former US National Security Adviser Susan Rice, who is widely seen as being on Joe Biden's short list as running mate, earlier today criticized comments by Donald Trump that he would not accept the results of November's presidential election - and urged voters to decisively defeat him at the polls. \"It has to be a resounding defeat of Donald Trump,\" Rice said in an interview on ABC's \"The View\" chat show. Biden, who will face Trump in the November 3 election, is in the final stages of choosing his vice-presidential candidate for the Democratic ticket, and a decision is expected next week. He has said he will pick a woman and has been increasingly expected to pick a woman of color, especially as the Black Lives Matter movement continues to lead protests across the nation against police brutality and systemic racism across all layers of American society, from healthcare to housing to pay. Trump said in an interview with Fox News earlier in July that he would not commit to accepting the results of the November vote, although representatives of his campaign have said he would respect the results. Rice, 55, has never run for public office and if tapped by Biden, would be an untested presence on the campaign trail. But she had a solid working relationship with Biden when he served as Barack Obama's vice president and she as Obama's top foreign-policy aide. Speaking to \"The View,\" Rice, who is Black, confirmed she was under consideration by the Biden campaign for the job, but did not say whether she had been interviewed. Rice conceded that should she be chosen, her role in the aftermath of the 2012 terror attack on the US mission on Benghazi, Libya would likely become a campaign issue. At the time, Reuters writes, Rice, as US ambassador to the United Nations, was accused by Republicans of misleading the public about the nature of the attack. Congressional investigations, however, found no wrongdoing on her part, and Rice on Wednesday defended her actions, calling Republican charges \"dishonest.\" \"I don't doubt that the Republicans will use this and they'll attack whoever is Joe Biden's choice to be his vice president,\" she said. While scientists work day and night to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, leaders at the National Institutes of Health are already preparing for the blowback. Donald Trump is on a very aggressive Twitter streak this afternoon, having just touched down in Texas. Following his post about suburban homeowners, which is being roundly called out as stunningly racist and classist, he is now claiming Portland would have been obliterated if he hadn't sent federal law enforcement agents in. The governor of Oregon, Kate Brown, announced a little earlier that the immigration and border agents, under Homeland Security umbrella, will start pulling out tomorrow, having been regarded as an \"occupying force\" that exacerbated unrest in the city. In what observers see as a play for white voters, Trump has tweeted people living their \"Suburban Lifestyle Dream\" won't be \"bothered\" by a fair housing rule meant to combat racial housing discrimination. Racial segregation in housing is a key driver of the health disparities and chronic health conditions which have made black and minority Americans more susceptible to Covid-19. Housing discrimination has been illegal for decades, but has persisted as a structural legacy of racism and inequality. The Trump administration repealed the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing last Thursday, according to an announcement by the US Housing and Urban Development agency. The law required cities and towns to identify areas of racial segregation and make corrective plans, but has been tied up in courts since the end of the Obama administration. Meanwhile, progressive Democrat US Representative Jan Schakowsky has introduced a bill to repeal an abortion restriction called the Helms Amendment, which has ripple effects the world over. The Helms Amendment bans US funding for abortion services internationally, much like the Hyde Amendment bans federal funding of abortion services nationally. There is almost no chance of the bill passing. Even if the bill got a vote in the Democrat-led House, it would die in the Republican-controlled Senate, and Trump would not sign it. However, the bill could be the opening salvo in a progressive push to expand reproductive rights - a sea change from the tepid support centrist Democrats have expressed in recent decades. One more thing - if the US did repeal the Helms Amendment, the Guttmacher Institute reports it could cost just $10 per person per year to provide sexual and reproductive health services to people the world over. That's just $4.80 more than the US currently spends. With less than 100 days to the November presidential election, Trump has seen flagging numbers with one group in particular: college-educated white women. Guardian reporter Adam Gabbatt explains: In 2016, Trump still lost this group, but narrowly. Exit polls showed him just seven points behind Clinton among college-educated white women. In June this year, a New York Times poll found Trump trailing Biden by 39%. Female voters speaking to the Guardian cited everything from healthcare costs to the push to reopen schools during the coronavirus pandemic as reasons they no longer support Trump. And many felt flat-out guilt. I just want to apologize to the world,\" said Julie, a fraud manager from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who asked that the Guardian not use her real name. \"I feel so guilty for having a part in voting this moron in.\" The chiefs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are set to appear on Capitol Hill today, with a hearing just getting started now. If you want to follow along with the Guardian's coverage of the anti-trust hearing, check out our liveblog. All four will address accusations their respective companies constitute monopolies in the areas of online retail sales (Amazon), software (Apple), social media (Facebook) and online search (Google). A bit of perspective from Guardian reporter Julia Carrie-Wong: When the US House judiciary committee gavels into order its upcoming antitrust hearing the four star witnesses will represent more than $275bn in combined personal net worth - and more than $4.8tn in market value. Here's a passage from a commentary article in scientific journal the Lancet, published in April, which seems notable right now: People often wear masks to protect themselves, but we suggest a stronger public health rationale is source control to protect others from respiratory droplets.\" Just 15 days ago, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Robert Redfield pleaded with Americans to wear masks, saying, \"We are not defenseless against Covid-19.\" He continued: Cloth face coverings are one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus.\" Reuters reports Barr will be tested after he came into close contact with US Representative Louie Gohmert, a conservative Republican from Texas who has refused to wear a face mask on Capitol Hill. US Representative from Texas Louie Gohmert has tested positive for coronavirus. Gohmert is among the most conservative members of Congress and has refused to wear a mask on Capitol Hill. Although masks have become a potent political symbol in the United States and the subject of conspiracy theories, they are safe and one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Donald Trump is still \"thinking about\" banning TikTok, the popular video-sharing social media network. As well, US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he would make a recommendation to the administration about whether the app poses a national security threat this week. Trump has suggested for nearly a month he might ban the app, which is owned by Beijing-based company ByteDance. TikTok has argued it is apolitical and said Wednesday politicians should focus on \"fair and open\" competition. The chiefs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are scheduled to come before Congress today to testify in a historic anti-trust hearing. The White House press reports President Trump has boarded Air Force One for a visit to Midland, Texas, where he will visit the Double Eagle Energy Oil Rig and attend a fundraiser. Directly in front of the president's plane was an Air Force jet carrying the body of former Democratic Representative John Lewis to memorial services in Georgia. The president, who did pay his respects to Lewis while his body laid in state in the US Capitol Rotunda, did not appear to acknowledge Lewis's plane. Lewis was a Civil Rights icon who campaigned for racial justice and equality, sometimes called the \"conscience of the Congress\". He died at 80 this month. Additionally, new polling is coming out about the effect the coronavirus is having on the US presidential election, just as the US is expected to reach a grim milestone: 150,000 Covid-19 deaths. A CNBC and Change Research Poll found \"Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden leads President Donald Trump by three points (48% to 45%) among likely voters in the six major battleground states.\" The poll found the distance between the candidates narrowed, even as Biden continues to lead in each state, with large majorities worried \"things are getting worse\" in the coronavirus pandemic. Concern remained highest in one of the worst-hit states: Florida. There, 76% of likely voters sampled said they had \"serious concerns\" about the pandemic. A doctor who spread false health information about coronavirus, and who Trump praised as \"spectacular\" despite her misinformation, has had some of her beliefs captured in a CNN chyron. Here's more about the doctor from Guardian reporter David Smith: Donald Trump has praised as \"spectacular\" a doctor who wrongly dismissed the use of face masks to combat the coronavirus as well as reportedly claiming that alien DNA is used in medical treatments and some gynecological problems are caused by people dreaming about having sex with demons. A group of lab coat-wearing doctors posted an online video on Monday to make a string of inaccurate assertions about the coronavirus that contradicted official government guidelines. Among them was a woman who identified herself as Dr Stella Immanuel and said: \"You don't need masks. There is a cure.\" The US president tweeted a version of the video, which rapidly gained tens of thousands of views on Facebook and YouTube before both companies took it down for containing false public health information. The president's son Donald Trump Jr had his Twitter account restricted by the company for 12 hours after calling the video a \"must watch\". At a White House press conference on Tuesday, Trump expressed puzzlement over why the so-called \"America's Frontline Doctors\" video had been removed, noting that Immanuel claimed to be treating hundreds of Covid-19 patients with the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which he has long championed despite federal public health advice that it is ineffective against coronavirus. \"I don't know why,\" he told reporters. \"I think they're very respected doctors. There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it and she's had tremendous success with it.\" The flag-draped coffin of former Democratic Representative John Lewis, the Civil Rights icon, is scheduled to be transported from the Capitol in Washington DC to Atlanta, Georgia this morning. Here's more from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: It will pass several notable spots in Atlanta, including the Rainbow Crosswalk at 10th Street and Piedmont Avenue, Chabad Intown Synagogue, will travel down John Lewis Freedom Parkway, the Martin Luther King Jr Historic District, the John Lewis \"HERO\" mural and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference headquarters. As was done in the nation's capital and three Alabama cities, members of the public will be allowed to file past Lewis' casket from 3 to 7 p.m. Wednesday, and again from 8 to 10 p.m. Good morning, US live blog readers, it's going to be a lively day in American political news. We will have a separate live blog for you on all the drama on Capitol Hill as the chiefs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are grilled (via video conference) in a historic anti-trust hearing, which begins at 12pm ET. In this regular live blog, here's what's afoot, stay tuned. More than 1,300 lives were lost from coronavirus nationwide in the US yesterday, making it the biggest one-day increase since May and the deadliest day of the summer so far. The US death toll from Covid-19 is approaching 150,000, while confirmed US cases are now above 4.3m. A total of 21 states are now considered to be in what the federal government considered a \"red zone\" for concerning rates of infection. The Trump administration has started talks with the Oregon governor's office and indicated that it would begin to draw down the presence of federal agents sent to quell two months of chaotic protests in Portland if the state stepped up its own enforcement, a senior White House official has said. Donald Trump said he never questioned Russian leader Vladimir Putin about US intelligence reports that Moscow paid the Taliban to kill American troops in Afghanistan, casting doubt on the reports in an interview with Axios on its HBO show. \"I have never discussed it with him,\" Trump said last night. The full interview airs next week. 37618 false false  Maanvi Singh (now) and Jessica Glenza (earlier)       Family gather at the funeral of Fernando Aquirre who died of Covid-19 at the age of 69, on 20 July.

Citizens wait in line to vote outside of a polling station in Louisville, Kentucky on Tuesday, June 23, 2020. In-person polling locations have been reduced from 3,700 to fewer than 200 amid a global pandemic.        Rice with Obama and Biden in 2016.

If America doesn't lead on this, others will,\" hesaid in the written testimony. \"Foreign companies or countries may act without the same regulatory oversight or commitment to transparency that we have.\"</p><p>Rep. Patrick McHenry, R.-N.C., the committee's ranking member, started the hearing by telling Zuckerberg \"you are here today to answer for the digital age\" regardless of whether it's \"fair.\" (McHenry later questioned whether it will be American innovation or that of others that will control the digital age of payment systems.)</p><p>Yet, during this time, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency suffered a setback in its own attempts to allow innovation in the digital age. The OCC's offer of a special-purpose banking charter for fintechs wasruled illegal by a New York judge, citing the agency for acting beyond its legal mandate.</p><p>The idea of special banking charters has long been opposed by both state regulators and the financial services industry, effectively dampening competition and innovation.</p><p>The House committee hearing was supposed to be about how Libra, under development by Facebook and its partners, would work in the global payments system. However, lawmakers instead questioned Facebook's past missteps, whether it's sharing data inappropriately, and its current policies on political ads and housing redlining.</p><p>Policymakers also emphasized that the U.S. dollar is the standard unit of international finance and provides a source of power to the nation's economy. Further, they noted that if the U.S. lost its currency dominance, economic sanctions would become irrelevant.</p><p>Zuckerberg made clear that Librawould not derail the U.S. currencyas the dominant global currency. But many lawmakers remained skeptical.</p><p>During the hearing, there lacked discussion on how the system would work, given that the currency unit in Libra would be backed one-for-one with a basket of currencies dominated by U.S. dollars and a reserve.</p><p>The biggest issue not addressed, however, was China. The Brookings Institution reported that China is on its way todeveloping a payments systemthat disintermediates its banking sector.</p><p>China is nearing completion of a central bank payments network and cryptocurrency anchored by the yuan. Unlike many central banks and private sector companies that are studying the capabilities,China is doing it.</p><p>The country has the economies of scale of nearly 1.4 billion potential depositors. A cryptocurrency issued by China's central bank can easily flow between its banks for lending purposes to retail and commercial customers, as well as directly to and from the central bank for customers' deposit record keeping.</p><p>One of the intriguing questions posed by Libra and other cryptocurrencies is whether a privately issued currency can serve as money in commercial transactions. This would be a money proxy, a stablecoin which is not issued by the government or its central bank.</p><p>Like China, Facebook is setting out to establish economies of scale. But unlike China that can dictate use to its 1.4 billion citizens, Facebook aims to provide efficiency and timeliness of payments through its existing global client base of nearly 2.4 billion monthly active users. Many of these users are without such services entirely.</p><p>Facebook is moving cautiously, given the amount of scrutiny it faces from past mistakes, and its credibility gap with both customers and regulators.</p><p>A basket of currencies is still to be determined. The Libra reserve fund is intended to support stability of the currency's price but its actual mechanism is pending as well.</p><p>Our U.S. regulators and government officials are right to question Zuckerberg as Facebook's single majority owner to direct, build and run a global payments system. After all, Facebook is a dominant for-profit big tech company that leverages its customer profiles for selling ads. It has no experience either as a financial entity or a payments processor.</p><p>But it's far better to oversee a U.S.-owned company with 2.4 billion customers as it innovates a new currency and payments system, than deal with one controlled by China, an adversary run by a single person with dictatorial powers over one billion people.</p><p>The U.S. has to be assured that any future payments system utilizes a currency that continues the nation's economic advantages. At the same time, U.S. regulators must free up U.S. companies to innovate and move through the digital age as expeditiously as possible, lest such efforts turn to China.</p><p>This would threaten the nation's currency dominance and the effective control of the international payments mechanism that currently allows the U.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CARDPM-0000016e-5fa6-d1b2-a16e-ffaf7e670000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CARDPM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XH4-1NM1-JCRW-50C7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305430</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

If America doesn't lead on this, others will,\" hesaid in the written testimony. \"Foreign companies or countries may act without the same regulatory oversight or commitment to transparency that we have.\"</p><p>Rep. Patrick McHenry, R.-N.C., the committee's ranking member, started the hearing by telling Zuckerberg \"you are here today to answer for the digital age\" regardless of whether it's \"fair.\" (McHenry later questioned whether it will be American innovation or that of others that will control the digital age of payment systems.)</p><p>Yet, during this time, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency suffered a setback in its own attempts to allow innovation in the digital age. The OCC's offer of a special-purpose banking charter for fintechs wasruled illegal by a New York judge, citing the agency for acting beyond its legal mandate.</p><p>The idea of special banking charters has long been opposed by both state regulators and the financial services industry, effectively dampening competition and innovation.</p><p>The House committee hearing was supposed to be about how Libra, under development by Facebook and its partners, would work in the global payments system. However, lawmakers instead questioned Facebook's past missteps, whether it's sharing data inappropriately, and its current policies on political ads and housing redlining.</p><p>Policymakers also emphasized that the U.S. dollar is the standard unit of international finance and provides a source of power to the nation's economy. Further, they noted that if the U.S. lost its currency dominance, economic sanctions would become irrelevant.</p><p>Zuckerberg made clear that Librawould not derail the U.S. currencyas the dominant global currency. But many lawmakers remained skeptical.</p><p>During the hearing, there lacked discussion on how the system would work, given that the currency unit in Libra would be backed one-for-one with a basket of currencies dominated by U.S. dollars and a reserve.</p><p>The biggest issue not addressed, however, was China. Brookings Institution reported that China is on its way todeveloping a payments systemthat disintermediates its banking sector.</p><p>China is nearing completion of a central bank payments network and cryptocurrency anchored by the yuan. Unlike many central banks and private sector companies that are studying the capabilities,China is doing it.</p><p>The country has the economies of scale of nearly 1.4 billion potential depositors. A cryptocurrency issued by China's central bank can easily flow between its banks for lending purposes to retail and commercial customers, as well as directly to and from the central bank for customers' deposit recordkeeping.</p><p>One of the intriguing questions posed by Libra and other cryptocurrencies is whether a privately issued currency can serve as money in commercial transactions. This would be a money proxy, a stablecoin which is not issued by the government or its central bank.</p><p>Like China, Facebook is setting out to establish economies of scale. But unlike China that can dictate use to its 1.4 billion citizens, Facebook aims to provide efficiency and timeliness of payments through its existing global client base of nearly 2.4 billion monthly active users. Many of these users are without such services entirely.</p><p>Facebook is moving cautiously, given the amount of scrutiny it faces from past mistakes, and its credibility gap with both customers and regulators.</p><p>A basket of currencies is still to be determined. The Libra reserve fund is intended to support stability of the currency's price but its actual mechanism is pending as well.</p><p>Our U.S. regulators and government officials are right to question Zuckerberg as Facebook's single majority owner to direct, build and run a global payments system. After all, Facebook is a dominant for-profit big tech company that leverages its customer profiles for selling ads. It has no experience either as a financial entity or a payments processor.</p><p>But it's far better to oversee a U.S.-owned company with 2.4 billion customers as it innovates a new currency and payments system, than deal with one controlled by China, an adversary run by a single person with dictatorial powers over one billion people.</p><p>The U.S. has to be assured that any future payments system utilizes a currency that continues the nation's economic advantages. At the same time, U.S. regulators must free up U.S. companies to innovate and move through the digital age as expeditiously as possible, lest such efforts turn to China.</p><p>This would threaten the nation's currency dominance and the effective control of the international payments mechanism that currently allows the U.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000016e-58c7-d3d8-ab6f-7bf750900000-218</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGM-84D1-JCRW-51V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

Patrick McHenry, R.-N.C., the committee's ranking member, started the hearing by telling Zuckerberg \"you are here today to answer for the digital age\" regardless of whether it's \"fair.\" (McHenry later questioned whether it will be American innovation or that of others that will control the digital age of payment systems.)</p><p>Yet, during this time, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency suffered a setback in its own attempts to allow innovation in the digital age. The OCC's offer of a special-purpose banking charter for fintechs wasruled illegal by a New York judge, citing the agency for acting beyond its legal mandate.</p><p>The idea of special banking charters has long been opposed by both state regulators and the financial services industry, effectively dampening competition and innovation.</p><p>The House committee hearing was supposed to be about how Libra, under development by Facebook and its partners, would work in the global payments system. However, lawmakers instead questioned Facebook's past missteps, whether it's sharing data inappropriately, and its current policies on political ads and housing redlining.</p><p>Policymakers also emphasized that the U.S. dollar is the standard unit of international finance and provides a source of power to the nation's economy. Further, they noted that if the U.S. lost its currency dominance, economic sanctions would become irrelevant.</p><p>Zuckerberg made clear that Librawould not derail the U.S. currencyas the dominant global currency. But many lawmakers remained skeptical.</p><p>During the hearing, there lacked discussion on how the system would work, given that the currency unit in Libra would be backed one-for-one with a basket of currencies dominated by U.S. dollars and a reserve.</p><p>The biggest issue not addressed, however, was China. Brookings Institution reported that China is on its way todeveloping a payments systemthat disintermediates its banking sector.</p><p>China is nearing completion of a central bank payments network and cryptocurrency anchored by the yuan. Unlike many central banks and private sector companies that are studying the capabilities,China is doing it.</p><p>The country has the economies of scale of nearly 1.4 billion potential depositors. A cryptocurrency issued by China's central bank can easily flow between its banks for lending purposes to retail and commercial customers, as well as directly to and from the central bank for customers' deposit recordkeeping.</p><p>One of the intriguing questions posed by Libra and other cryptocurrencies is whether a privately issued currency can serve as money in commercial transactions. This would be a money proxy, a stablecoin which is not issued by the government or its central bank.</p><p>Like China, Facebook is setting out to establish economies of scale. But unlike China that can dictate use to its 1.4 billion citizens, Facebook aims to provide efficiency and timeliness of payments through its existing global client base of nearly 2.4 billion monthly active users. Many of these users are without such services entirely.</p><p>Facebook is moving cautiously, given the amount of scrutiny it faces from past mistakes, and its credibility gap with both customers and regulators.</p><p>A basket of currencies is still to be determined. The Libra reserve fund is intended to support stability of the currency's price but its actual mechanism is pending as well.</p><p>Our U.S. regulators and government officials are right to question Zuckerberg as Facebook's single majority owner to direct, build and run a global payments system. After all, Facebook is a dominant for-profit big tech company that leverages its customer profiles for selling ads. It has no experience either as a financial entity or a payments processor.</p><p>But it's far better to oversee a U.S.-owned company with 2.4 billion customers as it innovates a new currency and payments system, than deal with one controlled by China, an adversary run by a single person with dictatorial powers over one billion people.</p><p>The U.S. has to be assured that any future payments system utilizes a currency that continues the nation's economic advantages. At the same time, U.S. regulators must free up U.S. companies to innovate and move through the digital age as expeditiously as possible, lest such efforts turn to China.</p><p>This would threaten the nation's currency dominance and the effective control of the international payments mechanism that currently allows the U.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNKR-0000016e-58c7-d3d8-ab6f-7bf750900000-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNKR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGF-JN11-F06X-W14F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent.

President Trump giving an upbeat outlook on when we can expect the coronavirus vaccine.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: As soon as the FDA approves the vaccine and as you know we are very close to that, we will be able to distribute at least 100 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020. We are on track to deliver and distribute the vaccine in a very, very safe and effective manner. We think we can start some time in October.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The announcement, a contrast from CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, who testified on Capitol Hill that a vaccine won't be ready for the public until next summer. President Trump clarified those statements during yesterday's briefing. He is really sad.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think he made a mistake when he said that. It's just incorrect information and I called him and he didn't tell me that and I think he got the message, maybe confused, maybe it was stated incorrectly. No, we are ready to go immediately as the vaccine is announced.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Joe Biden is weighing in after he and other Democrats made comments about whether they would get a vaccine approved by the Trump administration.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I trust vaccines, I trust the scientists, but I don't trust Donald Trump. I've been calling for an effective distribution plan to be laid out for months. They haven't put one in place for real yet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, President Trump heads to Wisconsin today to hold a great American comeback rally, while Joe Biden visits his childhood home in Scranton, Pennsylvania with Kamala Harris before taking part in a town hall meeting.</p><p>In California, meanwhile, new evacuation orders are in place this morning for the out of control Bobcat Fire. These flames burning Northeast of Los Angeles. Firefighters have been working around the clock for the last 11 days. Rising temperatures helping fuel the flames, which are coming dangerously close to the historical Mount Wilson Observatory. 3.2 million acres have burned across California so far this year.</p><p>One of two Los Angeles deputies shot during the ambush in Compton Saturday night back home this morning. The 24-year-old male officer was released from the hospital yesterday, his partner who helped save his life remains hospitalized. Her condition is unclear. Los Angeles Sheriff Alex Villanueva says, detectives are narrowing in on a possible suspect in that brazen attack.</p><p>And Sally turns deadly, the slow-moving storm devastating the Gulf Coast with catastrophic flooding.</p><p>Ray Bogan joins us now from Pensacola, Florida, where more than 2 feet of rain has already fallen. Ray, good morning to you.</p><p>RAY BOGAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Maria, good morning to you. What a difference 24 hours make. Yesterday Pensacola was completely flooded and now about all you will see this parking lot with a jeep in the middle of it. There was about 3 feet of water in sections of downtown Pensacola yesterday. So as slowly as this storm moved, this water came in very quickly and it went back out very quickly.</p><p>Now there are curfews from dawn to dusk here in - dusk to dawn in Escambia County. Tonight and for the next two nights because of the concerns for looting and there was a very visible police presence. They rescued at least 377 people here yesterday and there were times when there were so many people who were stuck in flooded homes that officials were putting out warnings that the 911 system was overloaded and they were asking people who were only in life-threatening situations to call.</p><p>Now, one of the big things they've tried to do is clear some of this debris, specifically on i10, that does two things. It allows truckers to start working their way east to west again, but it also allows the line crews to come in and get the electricity on. There are nearly 300,000 people (inaudible) and 242,000 people in Florida who were without power, but this is going to be a big resource sharing operation.</p><p>For instance, Entergy before the storm hit said, they had resources that were willing to come in from at least 25 states to help get the power turned back on. And one of the local county commissioners said, when he spoke with Senator Scott yesterday and Governor DeSantis, the big priority he put on is getting line workers in here to get the power turned back on.</p><p>Maria, so far there has been one death from this storm. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Ray. Thanks very much. Condolences to you and all in Pensacola. We'll be watching that.</p><p>Taking a look at markets this morning. We are looking at a selloff underway. Futures indicating a triple-digit decline at the start of trading this morning. As you see the Dow Industrials now down 245 points; NASDAQ is down 103; and the S&amp;P lower by 34.</p><p>The Dow ending yesterday in the green for a fourth trading session. The S&amp;P and NASDAQ closed near the lows of the day and the Dow gave up much of an earlier rally after the Federal Reserve indicated it expects to keep interest rates near zero for 3 more years.</p><p>Joining me now is Mahoney Asset Management's CEO, Ken Mahoney; also joining the conversation all morning this morning Fox Business' Dagen McDowell; and Cornerstone Macro's Co-Founder and Chief Economist, Nancy Lazar.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning. Thank you so much for being here. Good morning to you.</p><p>Ken, let me kick it off with you. What do you make of this market selling off on the Fed yesterday, meanwhile we knew that rates would be near zero for the next 3 years, what do you think investors are reacting to?</p><p>KEN MAHONEY, CEO, MAHONEY ASSET MANAGEMENT: Well, this morning is definitely a little hangover, because I think we have to understand why they are doing this. Because the economy is not doing maybe the V-shape recovery like we were thinking to do and it's more of an L-shape stock markets pushed in the V-shape recovery. They didn't say much about asset purchase, maybe there's little bit disappointment there, but keeping a punch bowl out there for few years does favor risk assets, i.e., equities, which is overall positive.</p><p>But you could have this kind of selling news and also if you think about kind of where we are, the Fed is kind of doing their work by themselves, right, on the fiscal side of things. They can't get it together, we can't get stimulus out, we can't get another PPP program out there. So I think the Fed is actually kind of doubling down, or quadrupling down on their efforts knowing the fiscal side of things that can't get anything done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see. Nancy Lazar, how do you see it, because I know you've been writing about a recovery in the second half, regardless of who is in the White House, you think that we're going to see jobs come back to America with the outsourcing coming back as well as a V-shape recovery?</p><p>NANCY LAZAR, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CHIEF ECONOMIST, CORNERSTONE MACRO: We have had a V-shape recovery. There's no question, they are not just in the market, but also employment, retail sales, industrial production going forward now that we're back to more normal levels, particularly say on retail sales. Things won't be quite as robust. They were downplaying the retail sales report yesterday, it only increased 0.6 percent.</p><p>Wait a second, that's out of 7 percent plus annual rate, that's a very, very healthy economy. So yes, I'm pretty optimistic on the outlook (inaudible).</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I want to talk to you about productivity during. Yes, go ahead, sorry.</p><p>LAZAR: I was just going to say that I think this is one of the healthiest economies we have seen, because jobs are coming back to the United States, this whole onshoring theme that we've been embracing now for several years. And then I think we are in a sustained healthy expansion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And as I was saying, I want to talk to you about productivity during the show this morning. I know that's been a really major issue that you're watching, so we will get back to that. But Ken, in terms of markets in particular, you're looking at Big Tech. We saw a pretty good selloff the other day and it feels like it was a 2 week thing, and if you blinked you missed it. You're watching Apple real closely, tell me why.</p><p>MAHONEY: I just kind of feel like as Apple goes, so does the market. A couple of years ago, when the China trade came up, it really impacted Apple and then the summer, they announced a 4-1stock split. And I think in the month of August, I think they will have 4 down days and Apple led that charge.</p><p>So again, of course, it's weighted heavily in the NASDAQ weighted heavily in the S&amp;P, not so weighted in the Dow Jones, now somewhere mid-tier because its price weighted. But as Apple goes, so does the market.</p><p>Now you saw though, since that split, (inaudible) did see 100 shares, now you have 400 shares. They may have taken 100 shares, 200 shares of the table, I think that's what has happened to Apple right now. Long-term prospects of rate, I kind of like where they are for the products, the cycle upgrade to 12, the iPhone 12 because of 5G coming out.</p><p>Wearables, we saw yesterday or a couple of days ago in their announcement. There are a lot of things great things going for, but in the short amount I think there is some supply there, also some money is taken out, FANG names lately even chasing down Snowflake and some of these other IPO.</p><p>So you're seeing a rotation little bit out of FANG names into now Snowflake's and some of the kind mid-tier or the technology companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: $820 million in the first day of trading, Ken Mahoney. Let's talk Snowflake for a moment. What kind of euphoria we saw yesterday in that IPO? What's behind all of this money moving into Snowflake?</p><p>MAHONEY: Yes. Well, I guess we're Warren Buffet owning a piece of Berkshire Hathaway, I think that gives people confidence as well. They will try to go head to head with Amazon. See, Amazon printing about 40 points lower this morning as well, because they have raised this money to pretty much go after Amazon's cloud business, go right after that.</p><p>And then again, I know these IPOs are exciting for a lot of investors jumping in. Again, we don't like that like to see more stabilization of a chart, kind of see some history around it. But it shows that the equity markets are very strong, where you can't have IPOs like this with a weak market and a very weak economy.</p><p>You have this type of mixture because of where we are in the cycle, because of what's happening. So even with the election uncertainty, everything is on just a lot of speculation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, what a day yesterday for Snowflake. Incredible.</p><p>All right, Ken. We will be watching that today to see what happens on day 2 of trading in Snowflake.</p><p>Great to see you this morning. Ken, thank you. Have a great day.</p><p>MAHONEY: You too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We are just getting started this morning.</p><p>Coming up, deal or no deal, what the Trump administration wants out of any agreement for TikTok.</p><p>Then at 7:00 a.m. Eastern, the word on Wall Street, what investors are watching this morning.</p><p>Plus Georgia Congressman Doug Collins is here on the latest on the investigation of the Russia probe, now that Lindsey Graham has announced and confirmed. Former FBI Director Jim Comey will be testifying.</p><p>Plus Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan weighs in on the stimulus stalemate.</p><p>In the 8:00 a.m. hour, we have Senator Rand Paul here on protests and riots hitting across the country. National Economic Council Director, Larry Kudlow, is here on the economic recovery as well. We will get his take on all of the above.</p><p>You are watching Mornings with Maria live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Crunch time for TikTok. President Trump will review the deal to transfer U.S. operations of the popular social media app TikTok from China's ByteDance to Oracle. U.S. officials are reportedly unsatisfied with the current proposal allowing ByteDance to retain the majority ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations.</p><p>Oracle will be able to review the app source code to ensure that there are no back doors to the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>Joining me right now is the Atlas Organization Founder and author of China's Vision Of Victory, Jonathan Ward. Jonathan, it's always great to talk with you about China for sure. You have worked so much and studied so much on China.</p><p>Let me ask you about this TikTok situation. I was really struck by the idea that that ByteDance would retain a majority ownership of the U.S. operations should Oracle become the partner. Do you think this flies with U.S. regulators?</p><p>JONATHAN WARD, FOUNDER, ATLAS ORGANIZATION: I don't think that makes too much sense, Maria, and here is why. There is another thing this where the Communist Party released a new policy directive about the private economy and they said that their goal was build up a backbone of private business people that could be useful in key situations. They said this was directed in all private companies and that the private companies have to participate in China's major national strategy, basically carry out the Chinese national interest and strengthen their ideological loyalty to the party.</p><p>So essentially, you have the increasing connection between the party and the private economy, so the idea that ByteDance, for example, is independent of any of that, doesn't make any sense. So at the end of the day, to really protect this thing, you're going to have to have American control. That makes more sense for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure. You wonder how that's going to happen. I mean we know about civil military fusion, you talked about this with me 3 years ago. And that of course says, that any innovation that comes into China must first go to the military.</p><p>There's this article that you and I have spoken about from The Journal, Chinese companies in Pentagon spotlight hire global banks to sell dollar bonds. Tell me about that and the impact and the significance of it rather?</p><p>WARD: Absolutely. I mean this is the problem with the intertwining of our two economies. At this point, you have major American investment banks essentially underwriting adversaries military industrial base, if one puts all the pieces together. You have the tech companies, I mean speaking of Microsoft and Oracle, Microsoft opened a new AI center in Beijing, rather in Shanghai with the Shanghai government to, as they say, accelerate breakthroughs in AI in China. I mean AI is one of the most important areas of military research for China.</p><p>And just last week you have the official Chinese defense ministry spokesperson saying that the United States is the greatest threat to world peace. You have another Chinese op-ed coming out saying China must be morally and militarily prepared for war.</p><p>So we are intertwined, we're building this place and this place seeks to supplant us, it's in conflict with all its neighbors from India to Japan to the South China Sea. And we really have to start pulling apart this strategic aspects of the economy. We can't have our bankers over there building their economy, we can't have our tech companies over there increasing their capacity. And ultimately, we are going to have to win the competition on innovation on military technology, on strategic industries, and on cheer size of GDP. We can't let China surpass this. Right now our companies are over there participating in that, so I think one of the key things--</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you've said many times that this economic soft war, if you will, that's going on between the U.S. and China is going to play out in the corporate board room, in the corporation. So have companies gotten the memo, they want to sell to 1.4 billion people, many of them are not necessarily acknowledging or recognizing the national security threats and the threat of the Chinese military to turn on the United States at some point.</p><p>WARD: Well, look, Maria, I think it's time to hold America's companies accountable on U.S. national security. I think what we really need is a bigger public discussion from America's CEOs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WARD: Where they can come out, talk to us about what their big ideas are for U.S. national security, for major power competition.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WARD: How are they going to do this, how exposed to the China problem? We can't let them hide from.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Jonathan, real quick, all of this in the face of these companies getting hacked. Chinese hackers are being brought to justice as we speak, prosecutors on sealed charges against 5 Chinese citizens, accusing them of hacking more than 100 companies, including social media firms, universities and telecom providers. The indictments do not say that the hackers work directly for the Chinese government, but of course, evidence including targeting pro-democracy officials in Hong Kong suggests state espionage, is that what this is about that it's all coming from the CCP and it's directing hackers as well? Real quick, Jonathan. We have to jump?</p><p>WARD: Well, sure. I mean, the CCP is the box stops here in China. I mean it's all kind of linked back to them. So our companies are in trouble. I mean they are being targeted, they know this, they need to start talking publicly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Jonathan, it's great to see you. Always a pleasure talking about this important topic with you. Jonathan Ward, joining us this morning. Thank you, Jonathan.</p><p>Stay with us. We will be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. More now on closing the income gap, new data from the census department shows that median household income grew nearly 7 percent last year, the largest annual increase on record.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board highlighting the data this morning in a new op-ed, titled \"the higher wages of growth\".</p><p>Dagen, this is an issue you and I have spoken about quite a bit. Incomes arising, the poverty rate falling last year, we were actually seeing an impact to the income inequality situation before COVID-19 showed up. Really good news.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Really good news and that's why I've said over and over again, I will talk policy all day long, but I will not talk about personality because it doesn't get us anywhere. But the policy changes brought in under the Trump administration have done just what you hit.</p><p>The median household income last year grew at the largest annual increase on record. And lower and middle-income folks, this is in the Wall Street Journal Editorial, we are finally sharing more of this country's wealth.</p><p>Listen to these numbers. Incomes increase more for Hispanics, blacks, Asians, foreign-born workers versus white Americans and native born Americans. And it's because people there was more opportunity, more jobs, wages for the lowest-skilled workers in this country were increasing at the fastest rate in 20 years.</p><p>And I will also highlight this that decline not only in the poverty rate to the lowest level in 60 years, but the decline in childhood poverty last year was nearly twice as much as during the entire presidency of Barack Obama.</p><p>We must highlight and Nancy can talk about what caused the sluggish growth and the lack of equality for during the Obama presidency and what changed under the Trump administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's right, because Nancy, the president really focused on cutting taxes, lowering regulations and all of that boosted wages. This is why I keep repeating this over and over on this program the last several months to make the point that this whole narrative of this tax cut plan helping the rich is just a political talking point and it's inaccurate, Nancy. Your views.</p><p>LAZAR: Those policies really encourage companies to reinvest in this country and its investments that create jobs by the private sector. And so these trends have been unfolding and you saw it in the unemployment rate, that 3.5 percent last year. This was not a sugar-high boost economic activity. It was companies reinvesting and creating jobs. When companies invest, there's a multiplier of positive job growth. Other industries hire if you expand your business, you make your business healthier, there are other businesses that need to support you. And so that's what we started to see.</p><p>You really have seen an increase in what we call the employment diffusion effects, and so it was really, really cool that you've been able to heal the economy. We went into this crisis at a pretty amazing level of record- low poverty in this country.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Maria, can I just add one really quick thing?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Please.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What the Obama administration did, not only was it hyper- regulation, which was a burden on businesses, it was higher taxes. And then the easy money policies, the administration leaning so hard on the Federal Reserve, well, that gave rise to greater wealth for the rich. And the biggest thing was government transfer payments after the recession in 2008- 2009, where people could go on unemployment for 99 weeks. And then many people wound up on disability after that. And again, we have an economic basis that not only encourages businesses to hire and people to go out and work, but provides opportunity in terms of income growth in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.

I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, September 17th. Let's take a look at markets this morning, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast, we're looking at a selloff this morning, futures indicating a decline, up 240 points right out of the gate on the Dow Industrials. The Nasdaq futures are down 103 and the S&amp;P futures lower by 33. The Federal Reserve causing markets to reverse course yesterday after saying it will leave interest rates near zero for at least 3 more years. What does that say about the slow-moving economic recovery?</p><p>Dow Industrials yesterday given up much of an earlier rally, finishing up just 36 points. The Nasdaq was lower, it completely reversed course to turn down 140 points by the close, and the S&amp;P was down 15. Global markets this morning also under pressure, European Indices, take a look, down across the board. The FTSE 100 down 44, CAC Quarante down 27 and the Dax Index lower by 57. The Bank of England out with its rate decision in about half an hour. Investors will be watching for any news of any added stimulus and an assessment of the economy in the Eurozone. In Asia overnight, right across the board there as well, Bank of Japan left its interest rates unchanged, saying though that the economy has began to pick up. Nonetheless, the Nikkei Average was down two-thirds of a percent and the worst performer was Hong Kong, Hang Seng down 1.5 percent. The Trump administration says it is pushing forward with U.S. sanctions on Iran. Jackie DeAngelis with the details now, Jackie.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS: Good morning to you, Maria, that's right. The State Department saying it plans to impose sanctions on those who violate the United Nations arms embargo with Iran which will now stay in place instead of expiring next month as part of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. You'll remember that President Trump quit the Obama-era deal in which Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. U.S. security officials say that Iran is still working on developing nuclear arms which Tehran denies. The U.N. Security Council has not confirmed whether or not it's on board with U.S.-enforced sanctions.</p><p>Meantime, Deutsche Bank breaking from its competitors, telling employees they don't have to return to the office until next Summer. Last week, of course, JPMorgan told some sales staff in New York to start returning to the office, and Bank of America is planning to have some of its staff return next month. And the Big Ten Conference changing course, saying there will be a college football season this year after all. The Big Ten is going to kick off its season the weekend of October 24th, and the NCAA, men and women's basketball will also be making a return. The season set to open before Thanksgiving Day. So, something to look forward to, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, sure is, Jackie, thank you so much. The fight against COVID-19, President Trump speaking at the White House on his outlook for the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The FDA approves the vaccine and as you know, we're very close to that. We would be able to distribute at least 100 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020. And we're on track to deliver and distribute the vaccine in a very safe and effective manner. We think we can start sometime in October.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: But CDC Director Robert Redfield says a vaccine won't be rolled out that quickly, prompting President Trump to respond this way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERT REDFIELD, DIRECTOR, CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL &amp; PREVENTION: When is it going to be generally available to the American public so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life? I think we are probably looking at third -- late second quarter, third quarter, 2021.</p><p>TRUMP: I think he made a mistake when he said that. It's just incorrect information. And I called him and he didn't tell me that, and I think he got the message, maybe confused, maybe it was stated incorrectly. No, we're ready to go immediately as the vaccine is announced.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden also speaking out, saying that he will trust the advice of scientists, but he won't trust President Trump. Joining me right now is Trump 2020 presidential campaign senior adviser Jason Miller. Jason, great to see you, what do you make of this back-and-forth? The president and now Redfield saying, no, not so soon on a vaccine.</p><p>JASON MILLER, SENIOR ADVISER, TRUMP 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: Maria, good morning and thank you for having me on. I think President Trump is exactly right that we're going to have a vaccine this year and we're going to return life back to normal in 2021. And these are two really key points because as I'm looking down in the corner of the screen here and we see where the market is, it would not be as high as it is right now if people didn't have confidence in President Trump to deliver us this vaccine, and to make sure we get life back to normal.</p><p>That's a key differential with the president and with Joe Biden who wants you to stay hidden in the basement the entire time. But I think it's also to point out there shouldn't be any politics in this. This should be about helping the American people getting the vaccine, returning life to normal. I was really disturbed by Joe Biden's recent anti-vaxxer rhetoric, it's always easy to say no, let's just wear masks for the rest of our lives, let's stay in the basement. That's not what Americans want, Maria. You have CEOs on this show every single day in the restaurant industry, the tourism industry, those do not get back to normal until life gets back to normal. That's critical.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and you're right. Dagen, jump in.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Jason, I don't know why you would pivot from the vaccine to talking about the stock market because front and center is just the simple issue that you have a vaccine -- and we hear this from Pfizer that they should have the data ready potentially on their phase re- trials which was expanded to 44,000 people here in the United States by the end of October. And that the FDA said it's ready to ship the COVID-19 vaccine 24 hours after authorization. Those are the facts, but then to pivot to the markets which is fickle, which is full of people who could bail out at any moment. Why connect the two? What's the use of that?</p><p>MILLER: Well, because they're inextricably linked, Dagen, and the fact of the matter is the economy, we have to get life back to normal, and that starts with getting people back to work, getting life back to normal. It's all tied in. You're exactly right, we have eight different vaccines that are in development, you're exactly right, there looks like Pfizer is on track for October, we've heard that from the CEO. All of the drug companies have come together and said there will be no politics in this process. It's going to be developed. The scientists will get it rolled out and it's going to be this year.</p><p>This is in stark contrast of what we've heard from some of the naysayers, as we then get the vaccine and that starts being distributed this year, then we can have life return to normal. That's what Americans want right now. It's all tied together and we have to -- we have to keep the economy open, and we have to get folks back to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, I do agree that the markets would not be where they are if markets and investors thought that we were going to see a change in policy, that we were going to see President Trump lose the election. I do believe that the market has a certain message, and the message of the market today is that we will likely see a second term, the race for the White House plays out every day. The president is headed to the battleground state of Wisconsin today, Jason, as you know, this coming as a new \"Washington Post\" and \"ABC News\" poll shows President Trump 6 points behind Joe Biden in the state. But this was a key state for President Trump back in 2016, he beat Hillary Clinton there by a tight margin. Jason, what's the message to voters there, and what do you make of these polls that continually show President Trump trailing Biden in these major news polls?</p><p>MILLER: Well, let me go and take in a little bit of reverse order, and that with the national polls that we're seeing, keep in mind all the -- almost all the national polls show this trailing Secretary Clinton back in 2016. And President Trump, when you look at actual battlegrounds, the electoral college, that's -- he ended up winning and doing much better than what the public polls were saying because they weren't picking up Trump voters. We see a lot of that here actually, we see the key battlegrounds like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona, much better shape in our internal polling and even some of the public polling that we do in most of what's in the headlines.</p><p>One other key thing about the national polls, keep in mind, the third way which is a leftist center democratic group did an analysis of 2016, said Democrats have about a 17 percent wasted vote, Republicans have about a 13 percent wasted vote from running out the score in either blue states or red states. So, when you see a national poll right off the top, know that President Trump is doing about 4 points or 5 points better just in the battle grounds.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll look at that. I like that one question in one of the polls recently that said what do you think your neighbor will do? Will you -- yes, 39 percent said my neighbor will vote for President Trump. That's like I'm asking for a friend. Jason miller, it's good to see you this morning, thank you so much sir, we will keep watching, obviously --</p><p>MILLER: I thank you, Maria --</p><p>BARTIROMO: An exciting moment for you and the campaign. Coming up, harsh penalties for rioters, how Attorney General William Barr reportedly wants prosecutors to handle the unrests across the country. Then Saturday Night Live casting its Joe Biden figure, find out who will be playing the former vice president this Fall, you won't believe this one. You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Sedition on the docket. The \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning reporting that Attorney General William Barr is pushing federal prosecutors to consider charging violent rioters with sedition, including potentially prosecuting individuals with plotting to overthrow the U.S. government. Joining me right now is former federal prosecutor and Fox News contributor Andrew McCarthy, and Andy, it's good to see you this morning. First, explain the law itself and give us your reaction.</p><p>ANDREW MCCARTHY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning, Maria. Yes, the unfortunate thing about the sedition statute which I used against terrorists who bombed the World Trade Center back in the 1990s is that the word \"sedition\" is in the title. Sedition is a word that gets people's tackles up because it's got association with the late 18th century Alien and Sedition Act. It's something of a vague term in terms of what it means whether it's necessarily violent or not violent.</p><p>The important thing, Maria, is that the word \"sedition\" does not actually appear in the charging language of the statute which makes it a crime to make war against the United States or use force against the government. It's almost -- you almost wished the statute was called, you know, war against the United States, force against the government because that's what's it's about, and that's why it's a perfect charge for this kind of situation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you do think it's a perfect charge for the situation. I mean, they are going there rioting, wanting to take buildings down. That is their goal --</p><p>MCCARTHY: Right --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Make sure to destroy federal --</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Property.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Right, what we had in the 1990s, Maria, was something that was very similar. We had terrorists who were operating domestically even though they were tied to foreign organizations. They were in the United States, they were targeting federal installations and big American targets like financial targets, like the World Trade Center, for example, their rhetoric made it clear, they considered themselves to be at war with the United States and they were targeting the government --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>MCCARTHY: As a government. In other words, they weren't just randomly trying to pick people up, they were talking about federal buildings, police buildings, political officials and the like, it's not a hard case to prove.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see, Andy. Let me switch gears and ask you about your take on the investigation into the origins of the Russia probe. We've got new numbers, show that Robert Mueller's staff turned in 27 government smartphones that were wiped off all of their data, 27 phones, Andy. I mean, if this is not obstruction of justice, I don't know what is. How is it possible that they can get away with wiping all their phones cleaned during the Mueller investigation?</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes, this is -- this is one of the most peculiar angles of this story that we've heard, Maria. And what I think is really disturbing is that, we had to find out about this from judicial watch. So in other words, these prosecutors handed their phones over to the Inspector General of the Justice Department who is conducting an investigation, you would have thought it would be part of the Inspector General's report, you know, if it's -- if there's a reason why they did this. You would think that he would explain it to us because there was a big to do -- remember over the phones of Strzok and Page, yet, we find out about this only because judicial watch litigated it.</p><p>And I think, you know, people need to answer some questions about why this happened because it's simply not a plausible explanation that 25 or 27 different phones all had the same problem, and it's hard to wipe a phone clean. You know, the -- to the extent that they talk for example about Andrew Weissmann's two phones which were wiped clean because he kept putting the pass code in wrong, and you have to put it in like 10 times wrong in order to wipe a phone --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right --</p><p>MCCARTHY: He did it twice. It's very hard to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it takes an hour or more to do that, so that clearly shows --</p><p>MCCARTHY: Oh, yes --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Intent. You want to clean your phone. And they did it after the text came public of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page which, of course, showed us a whole world of what was going on behind the scenes. Andy, we're waiting on John Durham, are you expecting indictments on all of this? I mean, we already have the first plea, guilty, from Kevin Clinesmith, and now we know that Jim Comey will be testifying in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee according to Lindsay Graham on September 30th.</p><p>MCCARTHY: Yes, well, as I've said before, Maria, I think when people testify in Congress, they have obviously a pretty good idea that the prosecutor doesn't have any interest in them as a criminal suspect, because otherwise you wouldn't go out and testify publicly. I expect there will be a report from Durham that describes a lot of abuse of power and misconduct that may not rise to the level of criminal violations, and there may be some more crimes indictments, but Attorney General Barr has said what he's looking for is meat and potatoes-type crimes like I lied to a court or I tampered with a document. He is not going to have any big, extravagant crimes very similar to what the Mueller investigation did to try to bring people into the net. I don't think that's going to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll see. I know there were a handful of lies and leaks, so we will wait to see John Durham's solutions and conclusions. Andrew McCarthy, great to see you this morning, thanks so much, we will keep following that --</p><p>MCCARTHY: Thanks, Maria --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, puppy love, a new dating app just for pets -- you're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, time for the Morning Buzz. First up, a familiar face coming to late night Saturday Night Live, actor Jim Carrey to play Joe Biden in the show's 46th season, premiering next month. Alec Baldwin is set to return as President Trump. All this should be good, Dagen, what do you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Jim Carrey has been kind of in this nonstop rolling, Trump-induced psychotic episode which is front and center on Twitter, he even tweeted in August, image of Abraham Lincoln committing suicide in response to the Republican National Convention. Alec Baldwin is left, but he looks right of Gerald Ford compared to Jim Carrey. Let's see how honest and actually funny this portrayal would be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I'm so glad you brought that up, you're right. I mean, it's real Trump derangement syndrome when you look at Jim Carrey's Twitter account. How about this? Puppy love for modern age, a new dating site Pinder, hitting the market, connecting lonely pets for a shot at love, Nancy, what do you think?</p><p>NANCY LAZAR, CO-FOUNDER &amp; CHIEF ECONOMIST, CORNERSTONE MACRO: I'm out of my league when it comes to social media, but this is just so cute. You know, the good news is -- one piece of good news during this COVID crisis is that I'm home, I'm home all day long and my little puppy, Rosy, loves the fact that I'm home. Unfortunately, I'm working all day long. So, I love this country, how creative we are and innovation has made this country quite frankly, why it's so healthy going into the crisis, and this is just another cute example. So my husband has always --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>LAZAR: Said, you know, our little puppy is a chick magnet, and so this is a very creative way of bringing people who love pets together.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's Dusty on the screen and I can -- I can assure you and confirm she too loves quarantine, Dusty does. Finally, are you looking to lose some extra lockdown pounds? An Indiana fitness company is offering $13,000 to any candidate who tests new diet routines and loses weight in 3 months, Dagen, 13 grand. What do you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, so I did the math on this, if you do -- so it's roughly 90 days and dieting is 24 hours a day, that works out -- if you do the 13 grand, which by the way, that includes a $5,000 bonus. That works out to be $6 an hour. I say that is not really good pay. And by the way, if you take -- if you remove the bonus, so you -- the salary is $8,000 excluding the bonus, that's $3.70 an hour. That is not a fair wage. Dieting is hard --</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then, frankly, your relative --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Should be compensated because you are going to be the most irritable individual on planet earth, and so you need to pay like your spouse, your kids because you're going to be insufferable. I'll leave it at that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I love it. Dagen, crunching the numbers on that. All right, still ahead, Georgia Congressman Doug Collins is here on the upcoming testimony from former FBI Director Jim Comey and Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan will join us on Washington's stimulus stalemates, all coming up next hour right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live on Fox Business.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020091701cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VT-7K81-JB20-G41R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7254\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 17, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000DAH9</classCode><className>BANK OF JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001YMR</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE BANK AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002F2B</classCode><className>BANK OF ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp; SECURITIES DEALING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC6282 INVESTMENT ADVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, &amp; FLOTATION COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC6081 BRANCHES &amp; AGENCIES OF FOREIGN BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS521110 MONETARY AUTHORITIES - CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>SIC6011 FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>DEUT (JSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>DBK (FRA)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>DBK (BIT)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>DBETN (JSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>DB (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>U.S.</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>U.N.

Especially for tech companies in the US, this uphill battle will become a lot steeper moving forward. </p><p>A new legislative proposal would bar major companies from exploring these two business models. This could also spell trouble for Facebook's Libra plans. A Very Intriguing ProposalTech companies in the United States have a tendency to grow well beyond the scope of current regulations. That situation becomes even more problematic if those tech companies decide to enter the financial side of the spectrum. A recent example comes in the form of Facebook planning to launch [1]its own digital currency. For now, that project has been put on hold, primarily because of regulatory pressure. This new proposal submitted by the House Financial Services Committee may put an interesting spin on things. The bill would effectively bar major tech players from offering financial services in general. These companies would also pay a fine of $1n per day of violating these rules, which should dissuade most companies from even attempting to ignore the rules. A pretty interesting proposal, for rather obvious reasons, and one that will put the entire tech industry on notice.Plenty of Opposition AheadWhenever a rather interesting proposal [2]like this one comes to the forefront, it will be a matter of time until other politicians oppose it. Especially the Republicans of the HFSC will make their voice be heard in this regard. They want to push innovation in every sector, even if that includes making technology companies even more powerful than they already are today. Whether or not that is a good thing, remains to be determined. Additionally, one has to keep in mind this proposal still needs to be approved by multiple parties before turning it into law. For now, it has yet to pass the house, let alone the Senate. It is still a very strong warning sign of what might yet be to come for the major technology companies in the United States. After all, tech and finance do not always mix well when centralized entities are involved in the process.Licensing Concerns are a FactorEven if this new draft bill would not be approved, technology companies still have to obtain a proper license prior to offering financial services and products. In the case of Facebook, there are genuine concerns regarding its digital currency, as numerous politicians have called out this venture specifically. There is always a chance the licensing process will become more difficult to tackle for technology companies in the future, depending on how the political landscape evolves. <url normalizedValue=\"https://rebrand.ly/nullCryptoMarketNo\">https://rebrand.ly/nullCryptoMarketNo</url> Impact on BitcoinAs one would expect, these political squabbles have no real impact on Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. While it could force some tech companies to drop their cryptocurrency plans, it remains to be seen how things will evolve exactly. Bitcoin is not considered to be part of the financial ecosystem in the US at this time, thus it seems unlikely this bill will impact the ecosystem in any meaningful way. Additionally, one might even go as far as claiming how this bill draft can be beneficial to the crypto industry. It shows tech companies should not try to mimic Bitcoin just as a way to gain more traction or make more money. Cryptocurrencies work on a different scale and level compared to traditional financial services and products. Anyone trying to copy this concept in a centralized manner will fight a steep uphill battle, which is only normal.Disclaimer: This is not trading or investment advice.

After a slow start Elizabeth Warren, the senior senator from Massachusetts, is enjoying a little polling bounce as reward for her proposals to break up big tech firms, impose a wealth tax on the ultra-rich and bring in universal child care. Upstarts have latched onto the strategy, too. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, would like to pack the Supreme Court with six more justices. Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur with a large online following, has made a universal basic income his defining issue. Actually accomplishing any of these things will prove much harder than advertised, because even if Democrats were to take the White House in 2020, they look unlikely to take control of the Senate.</p><p>It may seem obvious to point out that the eventual Democratic nominee will first have to defeat Mr Trump before remaking the American health-care system. Yet when debating their two dozen (and counting) choices, party activists sometimes sound as if dethroning Mr Trump, whom betting markets now give a 49% chance of re-election, is inevitable. Americans usually like to re-elect their presidents when the economy is doing well. In April the unemployment rate hit a 49-year low. The chance of some presidential meltdown delivering a crushing Democratic victory seems slight. Though Mr Trump remains unpopular--with approval ratings hovering around 42%--his supporters are unyielding. A slew of scandals, from the jailing of his close associates to the caging of migrant children at the border, have had little measurable effect on his popularity.</p><p>Even if Mr Trump lost, the Democrats' less-discussed Senate problem would persist. Although it is theoretically possible for a future Democratic president to assemble cross-party majorities to pass legislation, continued partisan trench-warfare seems more likely. It is difficult to imagine a single Republican voting for a wealth tax. For Matt Bennett of Third Way, a centre-left think-tank, chastened Republicans could revert to being \"partisan but not preposterous\" after Trumpism breaks its hold over the party. The debate might then fall between \"kitchen-table\" ideas, like gradual expansions of health-insurance coverage, which might stand a chance, and \"Brooklyn coffee-shop, thumb-sucker\" ones, like Medicare for All or abolishing the country's immigration-enforcement agency, which would not.</p><p>Democrats would therefore need a working Senate majority to get more ambitious schemes through. Out of 100 senators, 47 are reliable Democrats. To win back control of the chamber, the party would need to pick up a minimum of three seats and also win the presidency (since the vice-president's vote breaks ties). That does not sound too hard, but even a net gain of three seats looks a stretch because of the way the upper chamber over-represents rural America. Though it is early, betting markets rate Democrats' chances of winning a Senate majority at 31%.</p><p>To wrest seats away from incumbents in difficult territory, the party needs high-quality candidates to run. Yet top-tier candidates are instead opting to be second- or third-tier presidential candidates. Beto O'Rourke, who nearly upset Ted Cruz in his run for the Texas Senate, would be the prime candidate to challenge John Cornyn, the state's other Republican senator, but is instead aiming for the White House.</p><p>At least Mr O'Rourke is registering a few percentage points in the polls. The same cannot be said of Steve Bullock, the popular Democratic governor of Montana, who is opting to run for president rather than challenging Steve Daines, the state's lone Republican senator. About 69% of Americans do not yet know Mr Bullock well enough to rate his favourability, according to a recent poll from YouGov.</p><p>Stacey Abrams, who lost a close contest for governor in Georgia, and who has the diary schedule of someone who is running for something, has said she will not stand for the Senate. Even without the distracting draw of the White House, recruiting troubles persist: Josh Stein, the attorney-general of North Carolina, would be the obvious candidate to challenge Thom Tillis, but he has declined. Tom Vilsack, a prominent former governor of Iowa, has ruled out a challenge to Joni Ernst.</p><p>Even if they were to win a narrow Senate majority, that would not automatically result in the kind of new New Deal that Democratic activists seem to dream of. Surmounting the filibuster, which requires a super-majority of 60 votes for legislation, will be impossible without Republican votes. Ms Warren has endorsed eliminating the filibuster, as has Mr Buttigieg. Her Senate colleagues and competitors, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris, are more skittish, even though it is difficult to imagine some of their signature campaign issues--gun control for Mr Booker, paid family leave and abortion rights for Ms Gillibrand, and marijuana legalisation for Ms Harris--attracting eight or so breakaway Republican supporters.</p><p>Many current policy debates would be rendered practically meaningless by divided government, or even by a slim Democratic majority in the upper chamber. A hypothetical President Joe Biden and a President Elizabeth Warren would accomplish much the same in legislative terms, which is to say next to nothing. In that scenario, policy differences over foreign affairs and trade, where the president does have a lot of unilateral power, would matter more. But these are hardly being debated.</p><p>The people chosen by a President Biden or Warren to run the regulatory agencies would push in the same centre-left direction: reversing rollbacks of environmental protections under this administration, creating more expansive definitions of civil rights and pushing anti-trust regulators to be bolder. These are not insignificant powers. But proposals for sweeping social change, the kind that will be offered by candidates in the primary debates, would probably languish in committees.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EIUVWS-vwvwmain20190608t1620000017xmlxml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EIUVWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W90-WHY1-JCDS-32FW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253486</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1067\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.

Legal and media experts say Google and other internet firms enjoy the same constitutional protections on free speech as news outlets, precluding any government interference with the search results that displease the president. 'Each search engine's editorial judgment is much like many other familiar editorial judgments,' said Eugene Volokh, a University of California-Los Angeles law professor and author of a 2012 white paper on the constitutional First Amendment protection of search engines. </p><p>Volokh said in a blog post on Reason.com after Trump's remarks that algorithms developed by Google and others are 'editorial judgments about what users are likely to find interesting and valuable. And all these exercises of editorial judgment are fully protected by the First Amendment.' Eric Goldman, co-director of the High-Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said there is ample legal precedent for Google's free-speech rights. 'Search engines fully qualify for First Amendment protections for their search results. Numerous cases going back over 15 years have confirmed this,' Goldman said. 'Any effort by Trump to 'fix' search engine results will violate the First Amendment. It's not even a close question.' Trump's comments however stoked debate on the question when he assailed Google for what he termed 'rigged' results that hide news from conservative outlets and promote content from what he called 'left-wing' media. Google countered the remarks by saying that 'search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology.' The president's comments follow criticism from Republican lawmakers including House majority leader Kevin McCarthy who claimed that 'conservatives are too often finding their voices silenced' on online platforms. Trump on Tuesday issued an unspecified warning to tech firms, presumably related to his claims that they suppress conservative views. He repeated his claim yesterday, saying big tech firms 'treat conservatives and Republicans very unfairly,' but stopped short of calling for regulation. 'You know what we want? Not regulation, we want fairness,' he told reporters. Yesterday, Trump posted on Twitter what was purported to be a series of screen grabs that showed Google's home page promoted State of the Union addresses by former president Barack Obama but stopped when he took office, using the hashtag #StopTheBias. There is little evidence to show algorithms by online firms are based on politics, and many conservatives \u2014 including Trump himself \u2014 have large a social media following. Analysts say it would be dangerous to try to regulate how search engines work to please a government or political faction. 'Google is a private company with its own algorithms and the government has absolutely no control in how it conducts business,' said Ken Paulson, former USA Today editor who heads the Newseum's First Amendment Center and is dean of communications at Middle Tennessee State University. 'The broader threat to First Amendment freedoms comes when the most powerful man in the world repeatedly says that you can only trust him, not news organisations or the search engines that deliver their coverage.' But even without constitutional protection, the idea of regulating billions of Google searches would be an impossible task. 'We deliberately don't regulate every interaction in the economy because we know it's unfathomable,' said David Balto, a former Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department enforcement lawyer. Balto maintained that Trump's suggestion 'is an Orwellian concept that might fit well in '1984' but is totally inconsistent with our tenets of democracy.' Other analysts say the Trump comments are merely an attempt to rally his base and raise doubts about news organizations investigating him. 'Authoritarian regimes would love to have that power over search engines,' said Ed Black, president and CEO of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group that includes Google and Facebook. 'The US government should be an advocate against this type of censorship.'

On November 14, Yang wrote a blog post which put him in the focus of the latest cryptocurrency news[1] for stating his plans on regulating crypto. </p><p>As an entrepreneur, lawyer, philanthropist and a Democratic candidate in the 2020 United States presidential election, Yang is a popular authority in the US now. His blog post[2] is centered around the tech industry and how cryptocurrencies experience the levels of fraud they do because of the lack of adequate reactions. 'Other countries, which are ahead of us on regulation, are leading in this new marketplace and dictating the rules that we'll need to follow once we catch up,' he said. The US presidential candidate Andrew Yang also explained that cryptocurrencies and digital assets already compose a big portion of the economic activity. However the government response has lagged. 'A national framework for regulating these assets has failed to emerge, with several federal agencies claiming conflicting jurisdictions,' he said. In his own plan to regulate the tech industry and protect the US citizens from big tech companies 'which are prioritizing profits over our well-being' as he said, Yang promises to promote complete legislation on the crypto asset market space. The US presidential candidate Andrew Yang will also define what a token is, when a token is a security, and what are the tax implications of owning, selling and trading digital assets, among others. Yang also pointed out that in order to effectively regulate these technologies (blockchain and crypto), the US government first needs to understand them. The US presidential candidate is specifically referring to the Financial Services Committee (FSC) which is the body that questioned the Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for over six hours and was in the Libra news[3] for the upcoming Libra token. Yang concluded with the following statement: 'It's embarrassing to see the ignorance some members of Congress display when talking about technology, and anyone who watched Congress question Mark Zuckerberg is well aware of this. Without a base level of understanding, it's unreasonable to expect proper regulation of major tech companies, or the drafting of legislation that addresses the critical technological issues that we'll continue to face in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.'

Harris, a US senator and one of more than 20 Democrats seeking the party's nomination for the 2020 presidential election, said Facebook has prioritised growth over consumers' interests, especially on privacy. \"I think we have to seriously take a look at that (breaking up Facebook), yes,\" Harris said in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper. </p><p>She said very few people can get by in their communities, business or commerce without somehow using Facebook. \"So we have to recognise it for what it is. It is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated.\" Facebook has been under scrutiny from regulators around the world over data sharing practices as well as hate speech and misinformation on its networks. Some other US lawmakers, including Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, have pushed for action to break up big tech companies as well as federal privacy regulation. Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes called last week for the social network to be split into three parts. Facebook, which has more than two billion users on its social network, rejected Hughes' call. Spokesman Nick Clegg said Facebook accepted that with success comes accountability, \"but you don't enforce accountability by calling for the breakup of a successful American company.\" Early opinion polls show Harris in the top tier of Democrats who have announced presidential campaigns. She and several other Democratic candidates have spent large sums on Facebook ads. Warren and another senator seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, Amy Klobuchar, have proposed plans to increase antitrust scrutiny of the technology sector, with Warren vowing to break up Facebook, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google if elected. But Senator Cory Booker, another Democratic presidential candidate, said on Sunday \"we do not need a president that is going to use their own personal beliefs and tell you which companies we will break up. \"We need a president that's going to enforce anti-trust laws in this country, and I will be that person,\" Booker told ABC's \"This Week.\" President Donald Trump, a Republican, has also suggested that Amazon and social media networks like Facebook need tougher regulation. - Reuters/de</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11526930</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3J-4K11-DYWP-R009-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"406\"/><timeReceived>11:28 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

I want a government that's here to work for the people.\"</p><p>                     Bernie Sanders confirms he will run for US President\u00a0</p><p>The event was held not far from the site where Amazon had planned to build a major outpost, creating 25,000 jobs. The plans were scrapped in February, with Amazon blaming opposition from local leaders.</p><p>                     Warrensaid that big tech companies come into towns, cities and states and \"bully everyone into doing what they want\" and \"roll right over\" small businesses and startups that are a threat.</p><p>\"Giants are not allowed to buy out the competition. The competition needs the opportunity to thrive and grow,\" she said.</p><p>Earlier in the day, Warren said in apost on Mediumthat she would nominate regulators to unwind acquisitions such asFacebook's deals for WhatsAppandInstagram,Amazon's deals for Whole Foodsand Zappos, and Google's purchases of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.</p><p>                     Midterms see record number of women elected to Congress after two years of Trump\u00a0</p><p>She also proposed legislation that would require tech companies like Google and Amazon that offer an online marketplace or exchange to refrain from competing on their own platform. This would, for example, forbid Amazon from selling on its Amazon Marketplace platform.</p><p>Although Warren didn't explicitly mention Apple in her speech, she later toldThe Vergethat she thinks the iPhone maker should be broken apart too - specifically, that it should not get to both run the App Store and distribute apps in it.</p><p>\"Either they run the platform or they play in the store.

Never before have consumers and workers had more access to goods, services and opportunities online,\" said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel for NetChoice.</p><p>However, Tim Wu, a professor of law, science and technology at Columbia Law School, said in a tweet that it was \"heartening\" to see the idea of breaking up the tech giants gaining some traction.</p><p>Tech companies are some of the biggest political donors. Google spent $21 million to lobby in 2018 while Amazon spent $14.2 million and Facebook spent $12.62 million, according to their filings to US Congress.</p><p>Angering a deep-pocketed industry could hurt Democrats, but that is not likely to be a big concern for Warren, who made her political mark and plenty of enemies by going after big banks after the 2007-09 financial crisis.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MIRONL-52477277</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MIRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VM6-9MK1-F021-60VC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419001</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"585\"/><timeReceived>9:07 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Trinity Mirror, Plc.

I'm Bianca Nobilo in London.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With his administration facing crisis after crisis at home, U.S. President Donald Trump is kicking off the week with a show of solidarity from one of his strongest allies in Europe. He's hosting Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, at the White House today, a leader who shares his populist style of government. They'll meet just over an hour from now and then will head into closed door talks. A couple of hours later they'll give a news conference. It will be the first time in a week that Mr. Trump takes questions from reporters. After that, Mr. Trump will take part in the swearing in ceremony for the new secretary of Veterans Affairs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Conte share several similar views on controversial issues including immigration and a friendlier approach to Russia. CNN's Delia Gallagher has more now from Rome.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DELIA GALLAGHER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): President Trump may see some European countries as foes but in Italy's Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, he's got a friend.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The new prime minister of Italy is great. I got to meet him. Very strong on immigration, like I am, by the way.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Closing ports and borders to illegal immigrants is one area where Trump and Italy see eye to eye. Italy's Interior Minister, Matteo Salvini, visited the U.S. President in 2016 on the campaign trail. And ripped more than a few pages out of Trump's playbook for his own election campaign, even the winning slogan, Italians first.</p><p>MATTEO SALVINI, ITALIAN MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR: Prima gli italiani.</p><p>GALLAGHER: More than 600,000 refugees, most from North Africa, have landed in Italy in recent years. But in June more than 600 refugees at sea were turned away from Italy. Salvini was defiant. They will only see Italy on a post card, he said. They were eventually accepted in Spain.</p><p>Professor Federigo Argentieri, says Italy's government is similar to Trump's in random decision making and an apparent incoherent plan.</p><p>FEDERIGO ARGENTIERI, PROFESSOR, JOHN CABOT UNIVERSITY: Trump has understood or at least he's being told that Italy must be coddled, so to speak, because so far, the only real similarity in Western Europe.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Although Italy has refused Trump's request to give more money to NATO, they're behind the President in his support of Vladimir Putin. Prime Minister Conte tweeted, I agree with the President. Russia should be back in the G8. Matteo Salvini's made no secret of his admiration for Putin, calling him one of the best politicians of our time. And publishing a photo on Facebook wearing a Putin t-shirt in Moscow's Red Square.</p><p>Italy's government coalition received 69 percent of the vote in March elections but not all Italians agree with their leader's support of President Trump. Sabrina, a legal assistant in Rome, said Trump hasn't made the best impression or bella figura internationally. Especially separating immigrant children from their families.</p><p>Bella figura or not, in Italy's government leaders, President Trump has got a friend in Europe, something hard to come by these days.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBILO: And Delia is with us live from Rome with more. We're also joined by White House reporter Jamie Diamond. Delia, let's start with you. How much of a boost to the Italian Prime Minister is this really? I mean, is Trump's a bit of a poisoned chalice for him?</p><p>GALLAGHER: Well, look, Bianca, this is a government, which as you said in the piece, received 69 percent of the vote between the Five-Star Movement and the Right-Wing League Coalition, 69 percent of Italians voted for the Conte government. And they ran on a heavily anti-immigrant and anti or at least EU skeptic platform. Trying to arrest back power as it were from Brussels. That's something we heard a lot during the campaign.</p><p>So, what's really important about this meeting is not just what it can do for Italy but what it is going to do for the stability of the European Union and this kind of changing and shifting of alliances.</p><p>[11:05:00] Italy is one of the founding members of the EU. It is the third largest economy in the euro zone. And the EU is dependent on Italy's full support. So, if that seems to be drifting away slightly and there is a new opening towards populous rhetoric and measures and anti-immigrant measures, and a new opening towards Russia, that's shifting some of the historical alliances that the EU depends on -- Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: Yes, a lot of shifting alliances. And Delia, if you can just bear with me, I want to get your thoughts on something here. So, Italy's far right Deputy Prime Minister has been echoing the words of Benito Mussolini on what would've been the fascist dictator's birthday on Sunday. Matteo Salvini tweeting out, so many enemies, so much honor. Almost parroting Mussolini's phrase, many enemies, much honor.</p><p>Now Delia, that's not exactly a subtle nod but I guess the surprising thing is how emboldened he felt to do this.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Well, this gives you an idea of the feeling here in Italy that a politician can get away with, to a certain extent -- he's received criticism for it -- quoting Mussolini. Look, Matteo Salvini is really one of the political powerhouses in this government. He has a lot of support. He is the one who was responsible for closing the ports and that received 59 percent of support from Italians and not only from the right. So, he is somebody who has taken a page from President Trump, uses Twitter extensively and uses highly inflamed rhetoric such as that one yesterday on Mussolini's birthday. But he is somebody who still has a great deal of support in this country -- Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: OK, let's bring in Jeremy Diamond now at the White House. Jeremy, how important is it do you think to the President to have his messaging resonate in Europe and around the world and to have other world leaders like the Prime Minister of Italy be supportive of his policies?</p><p>JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Well, it's certainly coming at a time where the President has had several tiffs with some of the U.S.'s more traditional European allies, whether that's Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, even some disagreements with the French President, Emmanuel Macron, towards the NATO summit. He is now coming face-to-face with a European leader with whom he has a lot in common. They are both antiestablishment. They are both populist. They both had very little political experience before coming into office. And so, they will be able to find ground not only over the policies like immigration that you guys were just talking about there, but also over their personalities and the types of people they are.</p><p>However, there will be a sticking point in this relationship over NATO funding. You know, the President has impressed upon NATO allies the importance of reaching this 2 percent defense spending of GDP threshold and Italy is one of those countries that has not yet met that threshold and is in dire financial straits. So, that's going to be difficult for them to meet eye to eye on. However, you know, if the Italian Prime Minister can steer the discussion towards the migration crisis in Europe, which he and the President have similar views on, then perhaps they'll be able to get along just fine.</p><p>NOBILO: Thanks, Jeremy, Jeremy Diamond at the White House and Delia Gallagher for us in Italy. Thank you both.</p><p>Well meantime, the first trial stemming from the Russian investigation starts tomorrow. Ex-Trump campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, is accused of fraud. Over the weekend the President sent out a series of tweets attacking special counsel Robert Mueller. One accused Mueller of conflicts of interest. The President's attorney, Rudy Giuliani, told CNN Mueller has some explaining to do.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RUDY GIULIANI, PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ATTORNEY: You put out something like that you have every right to say, OK, you explain it, Mueller. Stand up and be a man.</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN CO-ANCHOR \"NEW DAY\": Wait a minute, this doesn't make sense. How can the President make this claim and not support it?</p><p>GIULIANI: He doesn't have to.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Why is it up to Robert Mueller to have to support the President's tweet?</p><p>GIULIANI: Because he has the conflict. Not the President.</p><p>CAMEROTA: What's the conflict?</p><p>GIULIANI: I can't tell you. I'm not sure I know exactly what the conflict is. I have a good idea what it is. It's one that would have kept me out of the investigation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: CNN White House correspondent, Abby Phillip, has been following the President's tweet storm. Now Abby, the President obviously tweets effusively and often, so what should we really be looking at here in these last series of tweets?</p><p>ABBY PHILLIP, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bianca, the interesting thing about the President's tweets over the weekend was how pointedly he went after Robert Mueller. And went after him by name. Something that he actually very rarely does. But you're seeing here a full court press against Mueller by the President and his allies. Reinforced this morning by Rudy Giuliani speaking to CNN and attacking Mueller and also attacking the President's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. Who's made it clear that he is willing to cooperate with investigators.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHILLIP (voice-over): With special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation inching closer and closer to Trump's inner circle, the President ramping up his attacks against the probe and directly targeting Mueller by name.</p><p>[11:10:00] In a series of tweets, the President accusing Mueller of having conflicts of interest. Including an alleged contentious business relationship with Mr. Trump. The White House did not respond to CNN's request for information. But ethics experts from the Justice Department determined last year that Mueller's assignment is appropriate.</p><p>President Trump's latest criticism coming days after sources told CNN, that the President's former lawyer, Michael Cohen, is prepared to tell Mueller that then candidate Trump knew in advance and approved the Trump Tower meeting with Russians promising dirt on Hillary Clinton months before the 2016 election.</p><p>The President has repeatedly denied that he had any knowledge of the meeting. Cohen also authorizing the release of a recording of a conversation with Mr. Trump discussing a potential payment to a \"Playboy\" model who claims she had an affair with him. Something the President denies.</p><p>MICHAEL COHEN, FORMER DONALD TRUMP ATTORNEY (audio recording): I need to open up a company for the transfer of all the back info regarding our friend David.</p><p>PHILLIP: President Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, telling CBS the tapes of 183 Cohen conversations exists. But that only one captures a conversation with the President.</p><p>GIULIANI: There are 12 others -- maybe 11 or 12 others out of the 183 in which the President is discussed at any length by Cohen, mostly with reporters, all clearly cooperating what the President has said in detail on many of those tweets.</p><p>So, these are tapes I want to you read. I want you to hear them.</p><p>PHILLIP: Giuliani continuing to assail Cohen's character.</p><p>GIULIANI: The man is a pathological manipulator, a liar.</p><p>PHILLIP: Despite repeatedly praising him.</p><p>GIULIANI: He doesn't have any incriminating evidence about the President or himself. The man is an honest, honorable lawyer.</p><p>PHILLIP: President Trump also taking to Twitter to again threaten a government shutdown if Congress does not fund his border wall and change the nation's immigration laws. The threat coming after the President met with Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, and House Speaker, Paul Ryan, last week to talk about government funding. After that meeting both leaders downplaying the possibility of a shutdown.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED HOST: So, you're not worried about a government shutdown before the midterms?</p><p>MITCH MCCONNELL (R), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: No, that's not going to happen.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHILLIP: And as the probe intensifies around President Trump, he's becoming increasingly agitated. But we are also hearing a new argument from his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, this morning who told CNN that he does not even know if collusion itself is a crime. Hacking, he said, is a crime. That's something very different from what we've heard from the President thus far. Who talks about no collusion all the time.</p><p>Meanwhile, we will have an opportunity potentially to question President Trump on several occasions today where he's hosting the Italian Prime Minister this afternoon. They're going to have a press conference and several pool sprays. So, there is perhaps going to be an opportunity for President Trump to explain what kind of conflicts he says Robert Mueller actually has -- Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: And Abby, you note that the President's seeming agitation this week. And it's been about a week since Kaitlin Collins, the CNN reporter was barred from the White House event. There's been a lot of spotlight on the President's reticence to engage with the media. There are these opportunities for the media to ask him the questions today. What do you think we can expect from how he's going to approach that?</p><p>PHILLIP: Well, that's a really good question. I mean, it's been about a week since Kaitlin was in the office trying to ask the President questions and he hasn't answered any questions since that time. CNN is going to be in the room today on behalf of the rest of the television networks and we will have reporters in the room as is common practice for these events. It is very likely that there will be questions shouted at the President asking him to respond to some of these things. We don't know how the White House is going to respond. It's clear that that incident last week really caused a huge stir and perhaps it's not what they anticipated when they decided to do that. So, we'll see if he decides to answer those questions or if they try some other way to prevent reporters from asking. But we'll certainly be trying.</p><p>NOBILO: Abby Phillip in Washington, thank you.</p><p>Still to come tonight a day so many Zimbabweans have been dreaming about for decades. Elections without long time President Robert Mugabe. But can today's vote usher in a new era for the impoverished country? All the details of these historic polls for you just ahead.</p><p>[11:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FARAI SEVENZO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A great deal of jubilation. They all say that November 18th is Independence Day. Everywhere. They're coming from all over the place. Tremendous. Look at this. It's unbelievable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: From those joyous moments celebrating longtime President Robert Mugabe's resignation to now, Zimbabweans lining up in record numbers to vote in what many there hope is something the country has never seen before, a free and fair election. This is the first time in 37 years that Mugabe is not on the ballot paper. The political strong man was forced to resign last year amid military pressure and calls for his impeachment under his rules Zimbabwe struggled with a failing economy and soaring unemployment rates. As Farai Sevenzo reports, many people see this election as a chance to finally turn the country around.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEVENZO (voice-over): Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, was gripped by election fever this last weekend. The city became a tale of two political rallies, campaigning ended Saturday for the first election since Robert Mugabe resigned under the threat of impeachment last November. He had been in power for 37 years. Followers of the opposition MDC-Alliance gathered in part to come and hear from their leader Nelson Chamisa. Around the same time Zanu-PF supporters of the ruling party once led by Mugabe came to hear from their man, current President Emmerson Mnangagwa on the eve of the historic election with a record 23 Presidential candidates. Mugabe suddenly appeared on people's TV screens. He called a press conference not to praise the new dispensation but to put one more knife in his back.</p><p>ROBERT MUGABE, FORMER ZIMBABWEAN PRESIDENT: I cannot vote for those who have tormented me. No, I can't. I will make my choice among the other 22.</p><p>SEVENZO: Zanu-PF's candidate immediately released a video addressing the Mugabe intervention.</p><p>Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zanu-PF candidate, Zimbabwean President: Now that this is clear to all that Chamisa has forged a deal with Mugabe, we can no longer believe that his intentions are to transform Zimbabwe.</p><p>SEVENZO: The man at the center of Mugabe's dubious praise drew massive crowds to his final rally.</p><p>(on camera): As you can see the numbers have been absolutely massive at Nelson Chamisa's rallies. Now whether these parade numbers in a sea of red will translate into a majority of the vote come Monday is anybody's game.</p><p>[11:20:00] (voice-over): I wanted to know from opposition supporters what they would do if their man lost these elections.</p><p>RESPONSE CHIWOKO MDC SUPPORTER (through translator): If Chamisa loses, it means they would have cheated him. We do not want to be continually intimidated. We are tired, and we don't want anymore.</p><p>SEVENZO: A road away, the Zanu-PF faithful where all awaiting their leader.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's the old veteran, he's the one who fought for our country.</p><p>SEVENZO (on camera): It's he too old? After five years he'll be 80 years old.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is not old. We need his matured brain.</p><p>SEVENZO (voice-over): CNN caught up with the opposition leader on the last day of campaigning.</p><p>NELSON CHAMISA, MDC ALLIANCE LEADER: Maturity is not a creature of age. Maturity is a creature of your ideas. Mugabe, you know, was known to be a man who was not willing to open the doors of democracy. But Mnangagwa is wise because he's sophisticated. He was in government for 38 years. You can't tell us that he's now a born again. When was he born again?</p><p>SEVENZO: The task of rebuilding Zimbabwe will be a tough one. The hope is the country will not go up in flames whoever wins.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBILO: So, polls closing in just under two hours from now. Let's go over to Farai Sevenzo who is live in Harare for us. Farai, it's great to have you with us. You've been following all of this. So, tell me how is the election day looking in terms of security, voter turnout? We hear it's high. I note the European Union chief observer has said today it seemed in some areas to be going very smoothly and then in other parts of the country very disorganized. So, what can you tell us?</p><p>SEVENZO: Yes, characterization of any African election especially one that's been so keenly anticipated, Bianca. I mean, first of all, the very fact that I'm living somewhere -- working, I beg your pardon, with some men who are up at the crack of dawn, maybe 3:00, 4:00 to join queues to vote. And when they arrived at 4 o'clock in the morning, the queues were already 200 people deep. So, it reminds me a lot in covering Africa of perhaps South Africa in 1994 or even let's go back to August in Nairobi, in Kenya when they voted in that first election. Queues around the block.</p><p>Now, you must remember that the Zimbabwean political scene has never seen anything quite like this. In Robert Mugabe's rule people used to be forced to be bussed to those rallies that you saw in my package. But this time around this open campaigning, there's a real keenness among the voters that they want to have their say. Listened to and note it down on paper. So, at the moment the atmosphere is a little bit chaotic in some areas. We just heard, it hasn't been verified, that one ballot took place in Norton was burned down. I can't verify that.</p><p>But these are kind of things that are spreading all over social media. And of course, all of the big characters of this political life including Mr. Mugabe, who is going to be 95 in February, Mr. Mnangagwa, the current President, and Chamisa, they all voted and everyone else in these queues that I've seen have all been sharing bander and talking openly which is never, you must remember never, ever used to be this open, this voting process.</p><p>NOBILO: Farai, that's momentous, that change alone. You've talked a little bit about the atmosphere and obviously, the complexity of African elections which you know. But do you sense that there is that feeling of celebration which there was when Mugabe resigned? Do you sense that as well? A lot of young people in particular excited about these elections.</p><p>SEVENZO: Well, you know, I met a lot of young people, young nephews and nieces of mine who have voted for the first time because they're 18. And of course, as you know, the majority of the people who are voting in this nation are under the age of 35. So, it becomes about opening up the electorate, opening up the paper sign for these young people to experience what democracy is.</p><p>Now, when we start talking about being celebratory as it was in November when we covered some of Mugabe's demise, that fall from grace is not the same. This is going to be a very complicated adding up process. Mr. Chamisa is 40 years old has managed to amass a whole lot of disgruntled people. Workers out of jobs, factory workers who haven't seen those factories opened in years people. People are desperate to get jobs and some dignity into their lives. He's managed to talk to them in the same way that his former leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, trade unionist who managed to get to the very soul of his people and provide Robert Mugabe with his first real opposition.</p><p>And then on the other hand, you talk about Emmerson Mnangagwa who has been selling and rebranding this country into something new. Everywhere the mantra is Zimbabwe is open for business.</p><p>[11:25:00] And of course, the very reason that there are so many observers in this country at this point in time, anyone who wants to observe has been allowed in. I as a member of the media, have accreditation, loads of people, a man from a Japanese newspaper. Everyone is watching this election. But what happens when one of them loses? That is the fear. Will they lose in grace or will it be a contentious through the courts and of course, back to the horrible days of 2008 when it took three months to count Robert Mugabe's votes. And then it turned out in a rerun in which the opposition boycotted. That's the kind of fear in the history of this country that people are really desperate to avoid.</p><p>NOBILO: And Farai, whoever does win this election what would you say are the biggest challenges that will be immediately facing them?</p><p>SEVENZO: Well, let's start with jobs. You know, if many of the population that are under 35 are also the majority of the voters, they need to be employed. Then let's go to the economy. We are dealing always with Zimbabwe the country that gave the world's first $1 trillion note and now then went to dollarization and then created another currency called the bond note, which is supposed to be paid with the U.S. dollar but doesn't quite make it. Because you can go downtown streets of downtown Harare and with your $100 you can purchase $135, $140, 150 bond notes. So, the level isn't quite right.</p><p>Then there's the farming. This is a land that is very, very deeply rooted in the land and in the land issue. You remember those chaotic farm invasions. Now, when those happened, they were supposed to distribute the land. But of course, we know that Robert Mugabe's patronage made that some have more than one farm, five farms, six farms, 20 farms, the rumor goes on. So, whoever takes his country on must start trying to develop everybody's pocket and wallet and well-being rather than look after their own.</p><p>NOBILO: Farai Sevenzo, thank you so much for your reporting from Harare. It's great to hear about your nieces and nephews voting for the first time as well. Thank you, will continue to follow this. It is a land mark vote. And you can follow it not just on television but also online as we wait for the results. You can head over to CNN.com for an in-depth look at what these elections mean for Zimbabweans. As well as to watch interviews with the leaders of the main political parties there.</p><p>Live from London, this is CONNECT THE WORLD. And just ahead, the U.K. wants to crack down on fake news. But at what cost? We're live in London with the details on a plan to regulate social media.</p><p>[11:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NOBILO: You're watching CNN, and this is CONNECT THE WORLD. I am Bianca Nobilo. Welcome back.</p><p>Well, a grim warning for members of the British government, so-called fake news, is a threat to the U.K.'s democracy. A parliamentary committee has been investigating the spread of disinformation and this new report claims it has, quote, disturbing evidence of hacking and voter suppression involving political campaigns as early as 2010. The proposed solution, greater regulation of social media. That investigation began after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. And our Samuel Burke has been following it all from the very beginning and he joins me now. So, Samuel, what did we learn from this committee?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN MONEY BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Well, Bianca, we now know that the U.K. Parliament just doesn't want to go after Facebook by fiscal means. They want to use legal tools and Europe has had a lot of bark but now that bite is starting to sink in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BURKE: It's a blueprint for regulation sure to reverberate across Silicon Valley. This 89-page report released Sunday by a British parliamentary committee. The report called on companies like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to face financial and legal liability for failing to police fake news on their platform.</p><p>DAMIAN COLLINS, BRITISH CONSERVATIVE MP: We have to create this sense of liability for them to say if you don't proactively look for and monitor, powerful content and I think they are to classify the real hard, fake news, real lies being spread during the election of harmful content. If you don't know how to identify that and the sources of it, then you could be liable for that information having been spread. And I think if we introduce that liability into law we'll see them take it more seriously.</p><p>BURKE: The committee recommended new taxes on social media companies and stiff fines when they promote political ads that lack transparency.</p><p>COLLINS: The tech companies are saying themselves they want to give more transparency. What we can do is write it into our laws.</p><p>BURKE: If adopted the recommendations would radically change the way tech companies are treated in the U.K., less like passive platforms and more like publishers.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO FACEBOOK: I think that it is inevitable that there will need to be some regulation.</p><p>BURKE: But British lawmakers said they weren't satisfied with efforts by social media companies to regulate themselves.</p><p>COLLINS: What they do is they preempt regulation. They don't like being regulated. So, if they think the threat of regulation is real they will try and design their own way of solving the problem.</p><p>BURKE: The committee which has been working closely with members of the U.S. Congress also proposed measures to combat election interference. And it slammed Facebook in particular for failing to fully investigate how and if Russia uses its platform to influence voters.</p><p>In a statement to CNNFacebook said, the committee has raised some important issues. We share the goal of ensuring that political advertising is fair and transparent and that electoral rule changes are need. We will work closely with the U.K. government as we develop these new transparency tools.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN MONEY ANCHOR, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: The chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, is $16 billion poorer than when he woke up this morning.</p><p>BURKE: Last week the stock prices of Facebook and Twitter each fell almost 20 percent after both companies said they were spending heavily to combat misinformation and clean up fake accounts on their platforms.</p><p>COLLINS: When you look to the near future and this problem is probably going to get worse using, you know, virtual reality all the way to reality techniques. You can already create fake speech given by someone in a place they never were to an audience they never met and pass it off real and share that online. Now we can either help the tech companies to stop that information spreading. Otherwise that could have a real outcome on elections in the future.</p><p>BURKE: Big tech's willingness to help out will surely be tested now that regulation is growing closer to becoming law.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BURKE: And a point I can't reiterate enough, Bianca, is that the U.S. Congress is working in conjunction with the U.K. Parliament. Just after this report came out we got our hands-on documents from Senator Mark Warner in the United States.</p><p>[11:35:00] If we just put up on the screen points that he's looking into blueprints for social media regulations, federal funding for media literacy programs -- many of us in the media have been pushing for that. Increased identifiers for authentic accounts, so maybe something more than just that the blue check mark and making platforms legally liable for defamation claims. It's really interesting to see how they're working with each other on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>NOBILO: It is. And so, you've outlined they're some of the potential proposed solutions to the issue, but do you think that this is the likely to actually happen in practice? Perhaps the fact the U.K. and U.S. are working in concert is an indication that it does this time.</p><p>BURKE: Exactly, I think in the past you've seen Europe with a lot of bark. But now that we're Seeing a GDPR, for example, those new privacy rules, and the fact Damian Collins, who is the MP that just saw in that report, has been going at this so relentlessly for so long. I think you someone who has real serious policy heft, not just political heft. And so, I think for that reason we at least know now what the possible tools are. Investors can look is this. It may not come to fruition, but we know what the possible tools that can be used on both sides of the Atlantic are.</p><p>NOBILO: Samuel Burke, thank you so much. We know you'll continue to follow that for us.</p><p>Donald Trump says he had a great meeting with the publisher of \"The New York Times\" about fake news. But that the publisher is now speaking out saying the U.S. President's version of the meeting is, well, essentially fake itself. AG Sulzberger came to the White House earlier this month for what was supposed to be an off the record meeting. But after Mr. Trump tweeted about it, \"The New York Times\" said it felt compelled to clarify what actually happened.</p><p>Mr. Trump said they discussed how the media are putting out, quote, vast amounts of fake news and how that fake news has morphed into the phrase enemy of the people which he calls sad. So, let's bring in CNN's Hadas Gold now to give us \"The New York Time's\" version of those talks. Hadas, I know that you've been following this closely. What have you learned about what happened in that meeting from the perspective of \"The New York Times\"?</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN MONEY POLITICS, MEDIA AND BUSINESS REPORTER: Right, Bianca, this all happened early Sunday morning when President Trump sent out that tweet that you just put up on the screen. Explaining that he had out of the blue met with AG Sulzberger and that they had discussed, as you noted, fake news and the term enemy of the American people.</p><p>But what happened a few hours later was \"The New York Times\" came out and said, actually this version, this tweet that you're seeing, is not exactly what happened in this meeting. \"The New York Times\" said that Donald Trump and the White House actually were the ones who invited AG Sulzberger down to have this meeting. Now that's not unusual, major publishers often meet. And this is what AG Sulzberger told us. He said that he told President Trump that although the phrase fake news is untrue and harmful he's far more concerned about President Trump labeling journalists the enemy of the people. And he warned him that this inflammatory language is contributing to a rise and threats against journalists and will lead to violence.</p><p>And Sulzberger went on to explain that he told President Trump that if -- he's more than welcome to have complaints and criticisms about his coverage and that he can always talk to the publisher about that. But then when he uses the rhetoric, especially around the world, especially abroad, it's very dangerous and it can lead to violence against reporters. And, in fact, in a further interview with \"The New York Times\" Sulzberger explained that he told Mr. Trump a lot of news rooms have had to enhance their security with armed guards. And that President Trump seemed surprised that wasn't already the plan in place to help protect reporters.</p><p>So, it seems as though this was an educational meeting and Sulzberger defended even going out to visit President Trump saying that when the President invites you, you want to go specially to have this sort of open conversation. But clearly, Sulzberger warnings did not stick because just a few hours after all of this we saw more tweets from the President about the fake news and about \"The New York Times\" and how he even called them unpatriotic. So, this war with the press continues.</p><p>NOBILO: Hadas, speaking of this war with the press, there has been in recent days and weeks, there have been displays of unity from the media. I think in particular of Fox getting behind CNN last week when Kaitlin Collins was banned from that event. Do you notice a more concerted effort for media outlets to work together to resist this anti-press rhetoric developing?</p><p>GOLD: Well, that sense of unity that we saw last week was definitely notable but it's not new. Because in previous years when any administration has tried been certain outlets, this happened to Fox under the Obama administration, all the news outlets sort of banned together and said this was relating to an interview that the White House was offering with the Treasury Secretary. They said, we're not going to sit for this interview unless Fox is included as well. So, it is notable we're all coming together in this moment. But it's definitely not new.</p><p>[11:40:00] What I will be looking for this will happen from the White House. We are almost guaranteed the White House will ban somebody else. Will do something, will try to pull credentials, some of the things they have warned about over and over again. Then what happens? Will we see news outlets vote to not cover something? Will we see news outlets really come forth and put out more than just statements and actually create some action to come out with all of this? Because this is going to happen again. It's unprecedented to see a White House ban a reporter like what happened with Kaitlin. Especially when she wasn't doing anything unusual. She was just asking questions in a pool spray. If anyone listens to that video they would see that she was not acting out of turn. She was not disrespectful at all.</p><p>NOBILO: Yes, that is true. Well, Hadas Gold, thank you very much for your reporting. We'll continue to watch how that unfolds.</p><p>Another big media story in the U.S., the CEO of CBS is facing allegations of sexual misconduct. The company's board of directors is meeting today to discuss the claims against Les Moonves. He said in a statement that he has quote, promoted a culture of respect and opportunity for all employees. But he also acknowledged there were times, decades ago, when I may have made some women uncomfortable. The journalist who broke the story spoke to CNN today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RONAN FARROW, THE NEW YORKER: We are talking about encounters in which women alleged they were pinned down and struggled to escape. It serious stuff, but I also want to point out that in some of these cases more than the initial incident these are women who said what was scarring were the threats of retaliation, that there appeared to be a pattern of saying, you know this is going to harm your career.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: There's a lot more to come this hour. Next, we're connecting you to these scenes. Tourists thousands of feet up the side of a volcano when a huge earthquake hits triggering landslides all around them. We'll show you where hundreds of people are still trapped, next.</p><p>Plus, it's one of the great modern mysteries. Now after more than four years are we closer to finding out what happened to MH-370? Ahead, what investigators are saying now.</p><p>ANDERSON: You're watching CNN, and this is CONNECT THE WORLD. I am Bianca Nobilo filling in for Becky Anderson. Welcome back.</p><p>Right now, rescue workers are looking through scenes like this trying to find survivors after a massive earthquake hit a popular tourist spot in Indonesia. Shaking villages and towns into wreckage. At least 16 were killed and hundreds more badly hurt. CNN Kristie Lu Stout, takes us inside what it's like to be caught up inside a natural disaster as it happens.</p><p>[11:45:00] (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN ANCHOR, NEWS STREAM (voice-over): Moments after the quake struck hikers scrambled to get down the mountain with clouds of dust rising from landslides all around. There are more than 800 people including many foreign tourists hiking on Mount Rinjani at the time. Rescuers set out on Monday morning to help find hundreds of people still trapped. Elsewhere, Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, visited survivors to hand out emergency supplies and promised more aid.</p><p>JOKO WIDODO, INDONESIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): As for Rinjani, the search and rescue agency, disaster mitigating agency and the military are working together. Hopefully it will be over soon.</p><p>LU STOUT: Around a 1,000 buildings were damaged including many people's homes.</p><p>ANCI, QUAKE SURVIVOR (through translator): We are sitting here at the side of the road because our house collapsed in the quake. So, my family and I have to sleep here. There are other villages sleeping at other locations around here too. We were afraid of aftershocks.</p><p>LU STOUT: The earthquake was centered 50 kilometers northeast of Mataram and a at relatively shallow depth of seven kilometers it was felt on the neighboring island of Bali. Many homes here are not built to withstand strong tremors and rescuers have to be careful of aftershocks while searching the rubble.</p><p>SUARDI, LOMBOK ISLAND OFFICIAL (through translator): Many houses collapsed in the quake as a 6.4 magnitude earthquake is relatively strong. In addition, the epicenter is very close to the northern area of the island. The third reason is that the housing structures are not firm enough. Lacking reinforced steel bars and a solid foundation.</p><p>LU STOUT: People often feel earthquakes in Indonesia. It is in the ring of fire region of heightened seismic and volcanic activity. But this quake was stronger than usual and happened while many people were sleeping. The Indonesian Red Cross are helping to treat the injured and along with the police and volunteers are searching for those still missing. Kristie Lu Stout, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBILO: After more than four years and the biggest search in the history of air travel, investigators still don't know what happened to Malaysia Airline's flight 370. A report today provided no real answers and no solace to the friends and family of the 239 onboard. The plane disappeared on his way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing of March 2014. CNN's Will Ripley has been reporting on the story since early on and he joins us now from Hong Kong. Well, it's great to have you on the show. This report seemingly doesn't provide any finality or explanation. But has the investigation made any form of progress?</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, they've made progress in the sense they've laid out a number of different theories that they can discount. For example, the plane being taken over by someone from another location with remote control. They said that didn't happen. There was somebody who likely turned the plane and then maybe at some point it switched to autopilot.</p><p>But what they don't know was that person the captain or the first officer? Did somebody break into the cockpit? Were they in a situation where they were trying to rescue the 239 people onboard from some sort of a critical equipment failure that would have caused communications equipment to switch off and cause the plane to drastically change altitude and whatnot or was this a more sinister act? Those questions were the questions that we were asking in the initial days and weeks after MH 370 disappeared and here we are now 1,606 days later and we are still asking those questions. So, the end result you have this 495-page report that's very heavy on facts, but it doesn't have what families need the most, Bianca, which is answers.</p><p>NOBILO: Exactly, Will. I mean, you and I keep on asking these questions but, of course, it is the friends and family that are desperate for the answers. So, what happens now?</p><p>RIPLEY: So, there have been two searches. There was the search that the Australian Transport Authority conducted, and they searched more than 120,000 square kilometers. They wrapped that up earlier this year in January. Then Malaysia hired a private company. They did a very extensive 90-day search. They searched 112,000 square kilometers, saying they claimed were the most advanced technology available now. So, you have more than 230,000 square kilometers and sub Indian Ocean search, the area that is believed to be the most likely location of the plane. And they have found absolutely nothing.</p><p>What they have found are 27 pieces of debris that washed up on Africa's East Coast. As far north as Tanzania, as far south as South Africa, but only three of the pieces, three pieces of the wing that your seeing on the screen have actually been confirmed to be from MH 370. The other two dozen pieces are considered to be highly likely. And until they find the main cabin of the plane, which is where the passengers are, where the black boxes are, they really may not have any more answers for the families.</p><p>And they haven't announced plans to resume a search at this time. They simply don't think that they have any more area left to search right now. And so, this might be a situation where decades down the road we talk about this because somebody stumbles upon this plane. But it's just a reminder for all of us of the vastness of the ocean, the small size of this plane.</p><p>[11:50:01] But for the people, 227 passengers, 12 crew members, who are somewhere in the ocean presumably and their families, of course. I mean, is just going to be day after day of this continued kind of uncertainty and really agony for many of them.</p><p>NOBILO: Yes, it will. Well, Will Ripley in Hong Kong, thank you for the latest there on an incredibly complicated and frustrating situation. Thank you.</p><p>Still ahead on CONNECT THE WORLD, terrifying wildfires in California double in size. We're on the ground with the latest as firefighters desperately work to contain the blaze.</p><p>NOBILO: You're watching CNN, and this is CONNECT THE WORLD. I'm Bianca Nobilo. Welcome back.</p><p>To the western United States, where more than a dozen wildfires are taking lives and consuming property in California, the biggest, the Carr fire, is in Shasta County in the northern part of the state. It doubled in size over the weekend turning the sky a terrifying orange color. It's been burning for a week now and its still only 20 percent contained. These fires have created unimaginable tragedy for some families. Dan Simon is in Redding, California near the Carr fire.</p><p>Dan, these fires have taken so much from people and you, I know, have spoken to a man who lost his wife and two great-grandchildren. What did he tell you?</p><p>DAN SIMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, hi, Bianca. This is one of the most difficult interviews I have ever conducted. This is a man who is broken, who has lost the most important things, the most important people in his life. Now, I can tell you that 76-year-old Ed Bledsoe and his wife Melody, they were raising their two great-grandchildren, they have been raising them since birth. We're talking about 5-year-old James, who they called junior, and 4-year-old Emily. Now on Thursday night about 7:00 p.m. Ed left his house to run into town, really to run a quick errand, and about 15 minutes later he received a frantic phone call that his house was about to go up in flames. Now inside the house were his wife and his two great- grandchildren. I'll let Ed pick up the story from there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED BLEDSOE, WIFE AND TWO GRANDCHILDREN DIED IN CARR FIRE: I talked to junior on the phone until he died. He kept saying, grandpa, come get me. He said, come and get me. The fire is coming in the back door. Come on, grandpa. I said I'm right down the road. He said come and get us. Emily said, I love you, grandpa. Grandma said I love you grandpa. And then Junior said, I of love you. Come and get us. Come and get us. I said I'm on my way. My wife was the greatest woman in the world and my grandkids were excellent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[11:55:07] SIMON: Well, as you can imagine he is feeling a tremendous amount of guilt over what happened, but we should point out that nobody ever told him that he should evacuate. That just goes to show you how fast this fire really took over some communities. Bianca, let me explain where we are. We are in the town of Redding. We are in a subdivision. And you can see this house behind me is gone. There is so much destruction throughout the community. We're talking more than 700 homes that have gone up in flames. But fortunately, we're now seeing some improvement with this fire. The containment number is 20 percent now. That may not sound like a lot but 24 hours ago we were at 5 percent containment. And we're told that the fire is burning away towards inhabited communities, in other words, it's in a rural area.</p><p>NOBILO: Dan, thank you so much for your incredibly important and harrowing reporting from California. Thank you.</p><p>And before we go, a German cruise company is facing a backlash after one of its employees shot and killed a polar bear. And we want to warn you the image we're about to show is disturbing. It happened when the cruise line made a stop in the Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic. Guards employed by the ship were on the ground to make sure there were no polar bears nearby before the passengers came onshore. But failed to spot one bear who then attacked a guard. The other guards fired on the bear after they tried but failed to scare the bear away. The injured guard was airlifted out and is reportedly in a stable condition.</p><p>I'm Bianca Nobilo and that was CONNECT THE WORLD.

The company would not confirm the nature of the inquiry or discuss what kind of documents the DOJ is seeking.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to the Washington Post and New York Times, both citing sources familiar with the investigation, Google, Apple, Yahoo, Genentech and several other tech companies are subject to a probe by the U.S. government to determine if the companies agreed not to hire away top talent from one another.</p><p>Spokesmen for the Justice Department, Yahoo and Apple declined to comment. Googledid not return requests for comment.</p><p>The reports say that the investigation is in a preliminary stage, and no formal charges against any of the companies have yet been levied.</p><p>Analysts say non-compete agreements are often signed with employees in response to lawsuits surrounding high-profile executives switching companies. Several of those cases have popped up recently, with companies complaining that top talent could leak secrets to competitors.</p><p>In April, EMC sued Hewlett-Packard for swiping away its storage head, Dave Donatelli. And late last year, IBM sued Apple for hiring away its vice president, Mark Papermaster.</p><p>\"After lawsuits, agreements are sometimes written so they don't end up in a situation where they're constantly suing each other,\" said Martin Reynolds, a tech industry analyst at Gartner. \"Companies are obviously interested in the protection of their intellectual capital.\"</p><p>Non-compete contracts with employees are perfectly legal, but experts say that a similar agreement between two or more companies could constitute a violation of federal antitrust laws.</p><p>\"Those agreements would hurt employees by limiting their mobility and pay,\" said Richard Brosnick, an antitrust attorney at Butzel Long. \"But the Justice Department would be more interested in their broad economic impact, because those negotiations could entrench monopolies.\"</p><p>A deal between a dominant search company and a dominant telecom company to not hire away one another's employees, for example, could help solidify each company's position in their respective markets.</p><p>Monopoly crackdown: The news comes just three weeks after Christine Varney, assistant attorney general of the DOJ's antitrust division, said the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>would be \"aggressively pursuing\" monopoly and antitrust cases against dominant companies. In mid-May, Varney reversed a Bush-era law that made the bringing of antitrust cases against single firms more difficult.</p><p>Several rumors about antitrust investigations have been creeping up recently, most notably talk of a review of whether it was proper for Google CEO Eric Schmidt to be on Apple's board of directors.</p><p>N. Venkatranam, antitrust expert and head of the IT group at the Boston University School of Management, said the latest news is likely more of a shot across the bow than a case that the Justice Dept. will pursue to the end.</p><p>\"This will be very hard to litigate, because non-action cannot be seen as collusionary,\" said Venkatranam. \"The Justice Department could be using this as a ploy so these companies don't enter into these kinds of agreements in the future.\"</p><p>Tech's long antitrust history: Antitrust cases against big tech companies had been more common before George W. Bush became president in 2001. During the Clinton administration, the landmark United States vs. Microsoft case found that the software giant illegally forced out Netscape and Opera from Internet browser competition.</p><p>A perception grew in this decade that the U.S. courts had become less favorable to antitrust cases than European courts, and many plaintiffs opted to take complaints abroad in recent years.</p><p>Among the bigger decisions, Microsoft was fined $1.2 billion by the European Commission in February 2008 after it was found to be pricing out rivals and refusing to comply with the court's 2004 antitrust decision. In that earlier case, Microsoft was fined $650 million.</p><p>Last month, European Union antitrust regulators fined Intel Corp. a record $1.5 billion for unfairly paying computer makers to delay or even cancel products that contained chips made by rival AMD.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20090603tech_antitrust1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VVH-3G71-2PK5-R01Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"745\"/><timeReceived>1:29 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>June 3, 2009 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000AI6X</classCode><className>BUTZEL LONG PC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HEWLETT-PACKARD CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In a sign of widening scrutiny after Facebook Inc's proposed Libra digital coin aroused widespread objection, the bill proposes a fine of US$1 million per day for violation of such rules. Such a sweeping proposal would likely spark opposition from Republican members of the house who are keen on innovation, and would likely struggle to gather enough votes to pass the lower chamber. </p><p>Even if it were to pass the full house, it would still have to pass the senate which would also likely be an uphill struggle. Nevertheless, the draft proposal sends a strong message to large tech firms increasingly eyeing the financial services space. The draft legislation, \"Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act\", describes a large technology firm as a company mainly offering an online platform service with at least US$25 billion in annual revenue. \"A large platform utility may not establish, maintain, or operate a digital asset that is intended to be widely used as medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, or any other similar function, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,\" it proposes. Facebook, which would qualify to be such an entity, said last month it would launch its global cryptocurrency in 2020. Facebook and 28 partners, including Mastercard Inc, PayPal Holdings Inc and Uber Technologies Inc, would form the Libra Association to govern the new coin. No banks are currently part of the group. Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump criticized Libra and other cryptocurrencies and demanded that companies seek a banking charter and make themselves subject to U.S. and global regulations if they wanted to \"become a bank.\" His comments came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers that Facebook's plan to build a digital currency called Libra could not move forward unless it addressed concerns over privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability.

In a sign of widening scrutiny after Facebook's proposed Libra digital coin[1] aroused widespread objection, the bill proposes a fine of $1 million per day for violation of such rules. </p><p>Such a sweeping proposal would likely spark opposition from Republican members of the house who are keen on innovation, and would likely struggle to gather enough votes to pass the lower chamber. Even if it were to pass the full house, it would still have to pass the senate which would also likely be an uphill struggle. Nevertheless, the draft proposal sends a strong message to large tech firms increasingly eyeing the financial services space. The draft legislation, 'Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act', describes a large technology firm as a company mainly offering an online platform service with at least $25 billion in annual revenue. 'A large platform utility may not establish, maintain, or operate a digital asset that is intended to be widely used as medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, or any other similar function, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,' it proposes. Facebook, which would qualify to be such an entity, said last month it would launch its global cryptocurrency in 2020. Facebook and 28 partners, including Mastercard, PayPal and Uber, would form the Libra Association to govern the new coin. No banks are currently part of the group. Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump criticized Libra and other cryptocurrencies and demanded that companies seek a banking charter and make themselves subject to U.S. and global regulations if they wanted to 'become a bank.' His comments came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers that Facebook's plan to build a digital currency called Libra could not move forward unless it addressed concerns over privacy[2], money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability.

The proposal aims to curb Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which offers big tech platforms like Alphabet's Google and Facebook protections from liability over content posted by users. The bill would need congressional approval and is not likely to see action until next year at the earliest. </p><p>There are several pieces of legislation doing the rounds in Congress that seek to curb the same immunity. It was not immediately clear whether the Justice Department will support any single piece of legislation already out there.\u00a0The Justice Department proposal primarily states that when internet companies \"willfully distribute illegal material or moderate content in bad faith, Section 230 should not shield them from the consequences of their actions.\" It proposes a series of reforms to ensure internet companies are transparent about their decisions when removing content and when they should be held responsible for speech they modify. It also revises existing definitions of Section 230 with more concrete language that offers more guidance to users and courts. It also incentivises online platforms to address illicit content and pushes for more clarity on federal civil enforcement actions.\u00a0Attorney General William Barr said in a statement the administration was urging \"Congress to make these necessary reforms to Section 230 and begin to hold online platforms accountable both when they unlawfully censor speech and when they knowingly facilitate egregious criminal activity online.\" In June, the Justice Department proposed that Congress will take up legislation to curb this immunity. This was after Trump in May signed an executive order that seeks new regulatory oversight of tech firms' content moderation decisions and backed legislation to scrap or weaken Section 230.\u00a0<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1548240</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60Y8-FWX1-JBYT-H0H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"341\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 29, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Most notably, social media behemoth Facebook FB[1] has plummeted after its latest earnings report missed expectations on revenue, revealed slowing user growth, and contained weak guidance.TwitterTWTR[2] and NetflixNFLX[3] have also experienced issues after reporting misses on earnings. Although these companies have provided remarkable returns in the past, and this may just be a small bump in the road, these firms certainly don't look like the risk-free investments they might have appeared to be recently.Amid all of this uncertainty in the technology sector, financial payments technology, or FinTech, may be a beacon of hope.Analysts at Morgan Stanley MS[4] recently upgraded the payments and processing industry to an investment rating of attractive, with growth expected in future quarters, despite the bank cooling on the tech sector as a whole.In a research report, executive director James Faucette stated that payment companies are, 'some of the best businesses there are.'Faucette specifically pointed to Visa V[5] and MasterCardMA[6] as two companies that can sustain any economic slowdowns. While traditionally thought of as card companies, both Visa and MasterCard are now being labeled as players in the FinTech space due to their increasingly robust electronic payment solutions.Clearly the shift to digitalization has paid off, as shares of MasterCard have grown more than 50% the last 12 months and Visa shares have increased around 37% over the same time period.More purely technology-focused payment companies, like Paypal PYPL[7] and Square SQ[8], have benefitted even more from the growth of electronic transactions and FinTech.In its second-quarter earnings report, PayPal reported revenue of $3.86 billion, up 23% year over year. </p><p>Paypal's EPS of $0.58 increased 26% year over year and beat Zacks Consensus Estimates. Square stock has been on an astounding rise, more than doubling over the past year. The company has a strong presence in the digital payment space and has a wide range of online payment products.Square is set to report its earnings tomorrow, Aug 1. If the company can meet or outperform its expectations, it will be a huge testament to the strength of the FinTech space, especially in a time of turmoil for the broader tech sector.As another good sign for FinTech, on Tuesday the US treasury supported the creation of a federal charter[9] that would advance the industry. In the 222 page report, Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said that, 'Creating a regulatory environment that supports responsible innovation is crucial for economic growth and success, particularly in the financial sector.'The proposed changes would help current FinTech companies operate more efficiently, while also pushing the digitalization in other financial fields, such as mortgage lending.Bottom Line FinTech will keep prospering from society's transition away from cash and towards digital payment options. Companies involved in digital payments appear to be safer bets than big tech giants as concerns about the sector rise.Investors should also pay close attention to which other companies providing financial services are gravitating towards digitalization. Goldman SachsGS[10] CEO Lloyd Blankfien has said that his bank is a 'technology firm' and Morgan Stanley just created a new tech 'Head of Transformation' role in the company. These tech-focused changes should be valued highly and might drive growth on Wall Street. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.
