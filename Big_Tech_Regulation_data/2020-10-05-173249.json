The pandemic and its many effects on the global economy and international relations loom large over both a turbulent America and its trading partners, including Canada.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cross-border M&amp;A: 2020 activity and regulatory outlook</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">M&amp;A dealmaking experienced a sharp decline earlier this year as a result of the pandemic, though some deal activity has resumed heading into the last half of the year<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote1\"/><label>1</label><bodyText><p>\"Global M&amp;A rebounds in Q3: Refinitiv\", Investment Executive.

We have seen U.S. investment into Canada drop significantly in both deal volume and value (see Figure 1).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Figure 1 - U.S. investment in Canada</p><p>Source: Bloomberg. Based on pending, announced or completed M&amp;A transactions. Figures current to September 15, 2020.</p><p>Meanwhile, Canadian investment into the United States also suffered as a result of the pandemic, though year-over-year activity in terms of volume saw a slightly softer decline (see Figure 2). While \"southbound\" cross-border dealmaking has slowed this year, deals continue to get done, though transaction sizes are substantially smaller on average than other recent years.</p><p>Figure 2 - Canadian investment in the U.S.</p><p>Source: Bloomberg. Based on pending, announced or completed M&amp;A transactions. Figures current to September 15, 2020.</p><p>Against this backdrop, and with the U.S. elections just around the corner, we look at some of the issues at stake in the election and how they may affect business between the U.S. and Canada. Of course, these issues turn not only on the outcome of the presidential elections. Even if Biden ascends to the presidency, most of his campaign proposals are not likely to be implemented unless both houses of the U.S. Congress have a Democratic majority.</p><p>Regulatory environment generally</p><p>One of the defining features of the Trump administration has been a reduction of bureaucratic process and regulation related to business. As discussed below, the Trump administration has also aggressively leveraged the CFIUS regime, particularly with regard to Chinese investment in U.S. technology companies, to enforce the administration's policy goals.</p><p>While specifics remain unknown on how a Biden administration might approach regulation of M&amp;A processes in the United States, it is conceivable that it will bring a new level of empowerment for regulators in managing the economyparticularly in traditional areas of Democratic concern such as environmental regulation, healthcare and labor.</p><p>With that might come a desire for increased regulatory scrutiny, and more disclosure and transparency expected from transacting companies, as well as a higher diligence burden corresponding to increased regulatory risk in areas that the Trump administration has been less focused on regulating.</p><p>Tax</p><p>Tax is a point of notable difference for the two presidential candidates and their parties. While many U.S. businesses have benefited from President Trump's business-friendly Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Biden has announced an ambitious tax plan that would make a variety of changes that legislation.</p><p>Key to Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was decreasing the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. Biden has said he'd meet that difference halfway, with a proposed increase to 28%. This change, if enacted, could have significant impact on U.S. businesses' cashflow and, accordingly, on Canadian businesses or investors looking to invest south of the border.</p><p>Biden has also announced plans to significantly increase taxes on high earner individuals. He would increase the top tax rate for compensation and ordinary income from 37% to 39.6% and increase the tax rate on long-term capital gain and qualified dividends from 20.0% to 39.6% for such individuals, a change that some expected would be a catalyst to M&amp;A activity in 2020 as business owners seek to exit before rates go up. However, as shown above, that expectation has not been borne out by the numbers to date, presumably given the larger impact on transaction timing resulting from the pandemic.</p><p>To reiterate, as with other Biden proposals, any significant tax changes will require that Democrats retain control of the U.S. House of Representatives (which is expected) and take control of the Senate (which is uncertain).</p><p>CFIUS and foreign investment</p><p>The Trump administration has been targeting Chinese ownership of and investment in technological applications that collect the personal data of U.S. persons (President Trump's approach to video-sharing app TikTok is the latest high-profile example)<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote2\"/><label>2</label><bodyText><p>\"Taking on TikTok: CFIUS on the front page (and in the fine print)\", Torys bulletin. September 21, 2020. Available here.</p></bodyText></footnote>. To do this, the administration has been leveraging the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) in its role to safeguard U.S. national security concerns related to foreign investment.</p><p>In the near term, Canadian investors should consider CFIUS oversight over similar technology and data-intensive businesses, particularly when in connection with Chinese investment. CFIUS's focus on China, however, presents Canadian investors, many of whom are currently deemed \"excepted investors\" relieved of certain CFIUS requirements, with opportunities to facilitate their investments in the United States.</p><p>While it remains to be seen whether CFIUS will continue to play an outsized, and politicized, role in the event the upcoming U.S. election results in a change of administration, scrutiny of Chinese investment in the U.S. accelerated under former President Obama and, therefore, can be expected to remain a bipartisan priority well into the future.</p><p>The energy sector and climate change</p><p>If elected, Joe Biden appears set to invest more in renewable energy infrastructure and in particular has said that he would oppose the Keystone pipeline project from moving forward. Altogether this would be expected to have a further chilling effect on the state of oil and gas industry, not just in the United States, but also in Canada, where support for key pipelines between the two countries is widely seen as a critical step for improvement of Canada's long-beleaguered oil and gas sector. While projects will still likely have a path forward, approach to energy resources and investment in the United States will likely change under a Biden presidency.</p><p>Private equity</p><p>During the economic crisis created by the pandemic, private equity sponsors have increased their focus on distressed investments, seeking to capitalize particularly on assets that may be in temporary distress<footnote><anchor id=\"fnote3\"/><label>3</label><bodyText><p>\"Current observations of COVID-19's impact on private fund sponsors and limited partners\", Torys bulletin. May 29, 2020. Available here.</p></bodyText></footnote>. Similarly, they have pivoted to sectors that have weathered the crisis well, including healthcare, biotech and renewables. We would expect these trends to continue irrespective of the outcome of the U.S. elections.</p><p>As mentioned above, Biden's tax plan contemplates raising corporate taxes to 28% and the corresponding decrease to corporate cash flows may negatively impact company valuations, including for PE-owned businesses.</p><p>Likewise, Biden's plan to increase the long-term capital gains tax rate could well inform the timing of exit transactions for PE-owned companies, assuming the larger pandemic environment doesn't get in the way.</p><p>Private equity sponsors have long been wary about how a Democratic trifecta in Washington D.C. would treat their carried interests. While Biden's tax proposals do not expressly comment on eliminating the current tax treatment for carried or profits interests, Biden has proposed an increase to the long-term capital gain rate for those earning more than $1 million. That, in essence, has the effect of taxing carried interest at ordinary income tax rates. If enacted, these changes may result in private equity firms revising their investment models, and that in turn could have broader implications on valuations for transaction participants.</p><p>Infrastructure</p><p>While Biden's current stated plan for infrastructure is relatively light on details, he has committed to investing $2 trillion during his first term on modern, sustainable infrastructure and clean energy. His infrastructure plan focuses on expected sectors, including roads, water systems, municipal transit networks and universal broadband access, but also on areas outside the traditional definition of infrastructure. For example, the Biden plan would create incentives to upgrade residential and commercial buildings to make them more resistant to extreme weather and would fund research and development in precision agriculture.</p><p>Biden's infrastructure plan is linked to his promises related to combatting climate change and rebuilding the American middle class. One of the stated goals is to create millions of new union jobs building and upgrading American infrastructure. On this basis, companies benefitting from his infrastructure and clean energy investments will need to meet the labor protections in Senator Merkley's Good Jobs for 21st Century Energy Act, applying and strictly enforcing Davis-Bacon prevailing wage guidelines.</p><p>Despite broad bi-partisan support for investment in infrastructure and Trump's 2016 campaign promises related to infrastructure, lawmakers in Washington have been unable to agree on an infrastructure bill during Trump's tenure. Trump's infrastructure plans have typically focused on transportation, broadband infrastructure and U.S. energy independence. Trump has emphasized reducing regulatory barriers and streamlining permitting processes for infrastructure projects as key components of his approach. He has also supported using a limited amount of federal funding to leverage more state, local and private funding for infrastructure.</p><p>Regulation of Big Tech</p><p>Big Tech has ended up in the political spotlight for a number of reasons: allegations of monopolistic practices, controversial use of data and privacy policy; the role of Big Tech in regulating free speech and the spread of misinformation are among those issues. As we look forward, these issues are likely to remain part of political debatealthough neither Trump nor Biden have made specific statements suggesting that breaking up Big Tech or enhancing their regulation are top priorities in their platforms.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In a year marked by instability, and government response to the pandemic in countries around the world, the outcome of the U.S. election will be felt throughout the business community and may well end up impacting how businesses evaluate, negotiate and close transactions. Canadian businesses and U.S.companies with business in Canada will want to consider how they will adapt their cross-border strategies to the outcome of this historic election.</p><p>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Although the US economy has entered a deep recession, the stockmarket index has recovered all of its losses from the early days of the pandemic and has set new record highs in recent days. Within the index, there is a disconnect between a small number of major tech companies whose valuations have grown significantly, and the rest, who have lost ground this year. This means that the robust performance of the market is vulnerable to any negative effects to the valuation of any of these firms. This may work against the political willingness to impose tighter regulation on the tech sector in the coming year, given the sector's role in propping up the rest of the stockmarket.</p><p>The US death toll from the coronavirus stood at just over 176,000 on August 23rd, around one-fifth of the global total of 802,693. The US daily death toll has fallen below 1,000 for the first time in a month on a seven-day moving average basis, compared with a low of 475 in early July and a previous peak of about 2,300 in mid-April. The national number of cases has also begun to fall again in the past week, to about 43,000, from a peak of 65,000 in late July. The proportion of tests that are positive is dropping too, from about 8.5% in mid-July to 6.5% in mid-August. The World Health Organisation recommends a positive rate of 5% or below as an indicator of whether governments are testing enough to have an accurate measure of the scale of local outbreaks. The number of deaths in Canada stood at 9,073 on August 23rd. On a seven-day moving average basis, the number of daily deaths is in the high single figures, from a peak of 175 in early May.</p><h>August 24th: tech sector drives stockmarkets higher</h><p>The US economy is in a deep recession, but the stockmarket has been remarkably resilient. The S&amp;P 500 index set two record highs last week, meaning that it has made up all of the losses incurred previously during the pandemic. This is unusual; for example it took more than five years for the index to post a new high after the global financial crisis. There is no good news on the economy: unemployment is high, tens of millions of other jobs are in peril and thousands of firms are only managing to cope owing to unprecedented state support.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are clearly some supporting factors for the stockmarket, even if they do not seem robust. These might include: extremely accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve (the US central bank), which has sent a wall of investment cash towards the stockmarket; that the pandemic has so far suited the country's five big tech companies, which comprise 20% of the value of the S&amp;P 500; the assumption that the pandemic will be overcome by a vaccine in the near future; and the hope that the federal government will continue to push fiscal stimulus measures until the economy can cope independently. Accordingly, investors may want to pay more attention to the policies of the two presidential hopefuls towards greater regulation of the sector than to anything that happens in the real economy.</p><h>August 24th-27th: the Trump takeover</h><p>Following the Democratic Party's virtual convention last week, it is the turn of the Republicans, beginning on August 24th. The Republican Party's event is expected to be similar in style to that of the Democrats, with a series of pre-recorded to-camera speeches by party bigwigs. Few details have been released so far, partly because the party wants to hold some surprises back and partly because work is ongoing. Two trends immediately leap out, however. One is the dominance of the president and his family: both Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, will give speeches, as will four of his adult children and his daughter-in-law. Mr Trump is a remarkably polarising figure nationally, but he is still hugely popular within the party. According to the latest poll by Gallup, 90% of those identifying as Republicans approve of his performance. Slightly surprisingly, or perhaps reflecting the extreme partisanship of American politics, this number has been rising steadily during his presidential term. Stacking the convention with members of the Trump family will go down well with existing Republican voters, although not necessarily undecided voters.</p><p>The other major trend is the prominence given to three figures who would be among the leading contenders to succeed Mr Trump if he is re-elected in November. That the vice-president, Mike Pence, will address the party is not a surprise, but the speeches given by a former ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, and a senator from Arkansas, Tom Cotton, will be closely watched. But above all, this will be a convention about Mr Trump, who will speak on all four nights, in search of a spark to overturn an intimidating deficit in the polls.</p><h>August 24th: a capable pair of hands</h><p>Last week the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, lost his longest-serving minister when Bill Morneau resigned the finance portfolio. Mr Morneau had come under heavy pressure for not disclosing his personal ties to a charity that was awarded a government contract. He also repaid more than C$40,000 (US$30,400) to the state after it was discovered that he had outstanding travel expenses for overseas trips related to the charity (Mr Morneau claims that he forgot to repay the expenses, but has now done so). Alongside the scandal, there appears to have been a difference of opinion with Mr Trudeau over the continuation of support for the economy during the pandemic. Mr Morneau is believed to have been more reticent than the prime minister is to extend government programmes, which have led to a dramatic widening of the budget deficit. The design of some of the stimulus has also been criticised by parliamentary committees.</p><p>Mr Morneau's replacement is the deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, who is Mr Trudeau's most highly regarded minister and closest ally. The prime minister had previously moved Ms Freeland to lead the trade negotiations with the US, and then promoted her again to foreign minister, and then to his deputy. She has been a steadfast supporter of Mr Trudeau and is thought to be more amenable to maintaining current fiscal policy for longer. The ministerial switch is likely to benefit policy continuity in the short term, as well as to strengthen the prime minister, whose approval ratings have weakened during the charity scandal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EIUVWS-vwvwmain20200824t1645000006xmlxml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EIUVWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NW-XCN1-JCDS-316G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253486</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1069\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2020 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.

That's been an increasingly vocal complaint from content creators and regional governments north of the border as Netflix and Amazon continue to take full advantage of generous Canadian shooting incentives and state-of-the-art facilities in an environment that is largely free of regulation. Now, as the streaming wars intensify with the arrival of Disney+, Apple TV+, Peacock and HBO Max, pressure is mounting for the streamers to start giving back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"They are already spending money in Canada. All we're asking is for them to do it in a more organized way [toward] Canadian cultural content available for Canadians, and for audiences around the world,\" Steven Guilbeault, the Canadian heritage minister responsible for broadcasting, told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">THR</emphasis> while attending the Prime Time conference in Ottawa in January.</p><p>Unlike local broadcasters and cable players that put a share of their revenue toward subsidizing local TV producers, Netflix and other U.S. tech giants remain unregulated in Canada. Such local subsidies result in significant funding for Canadian TV shows like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Schitt's Creek</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Anne With an E</emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Orphan Black</emphasis> that sell widely into the U.S. and other world markets.</p><p>Defying long-standing calls from regional indie producers and broadcasters to impose a direct levy on the revenues of Netflix, Google and Amazon, upcoming legislation to revamp broadcast and telecom rules is expected to leave such U.S. big-tech players mostly unregulated and untaxed.</p><p>Courtesy of Amazon Studios</p><p>Amazon's sci-fi series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tales From the Loop</emphasis> recently wrapped shooting in Manitoba, Canada.</p><p>An exception to the above is an expected legislative mandate that tech giants must collect a goods and services sales tax (GST) from their customers, which Canadians routinely pay on all goods and services.</p><p>\"I think that's about fairness,\" Guilbeault says. \"Everybody is paying the GST in Canada \u2014 I don't see why some of the richest companies in the world shouldn't pay GST in Canada.\"</p><p>But it's likely GST funds will not go directly toward subsidizing Canadian content, which means that streaming services won't be going far enough to change their business models to satisfy traditional TV distributors.</p><p>\"We have long been concerned by the undue regulatory burden faced by Canadian broadcasters versus foreign internet broadcasters, and we hope the government will move forward with creating a more equitable competitive environment,\" says Doug Murphy, president and CEO of local broadcaster Corus Entertainment.</p><p>Canada has so far not shown any inclination in following France, which recently proposed a 3 percent levy on sales generated by digital giants. The U.K. and Italy are considering national plans for digital taxation as well.</p><p>Canada, by contrast, has far more at stake because so many U.S. streamers shoot their productions north of the border. The challenge for those pressuring the streamers is that few want to risk a direct confrontation with a sector that is already pumping millions into the Canadian economy (an estimated $1.4 billion in 2019 alone). Money from streaming TV's arms race flowing to Canadian programming sits well with local producers who increasingly work with American digital platforms to spread their content worldwide. But at the federal level, the issue is expected to be front and center during legislative sessions this year.</p><p>\"We're not telling them what categories of content to produce, we're not telling them where to produce it \u2014 we're just telling them that they have to take a certain amount of the money they're already spending in Canada and make sure it complies with Canadian-content requirements,\" Guilbeault says.</p><p>Netflix already appears to be making concessions. Later this year the streamer will debut its first indigenous Canadian movie, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Jusqu'au D\u00e9clin</emphasis>, directed by Patrice Lalibert\u00e9 in Quebec.</p><p>\"We all have a role to play in supporting the future of film and television being created in Canada,\" a rep for Netflix says in a statement. \"We look forward to working with the government as it proceeds to modernize Canada's broadcasting and telecommunications laws.\"</p><p>By opting to push for mandated spending commitments by foreign streamers over direct taxation, Guilbeault has taken his cue from Janet Yale, a former cablecaster and industry lobbyist who led a seven-member panel that in late January unveiled a 235-page report on restructuring Canada's broadcast sector for the streaming era. Yale's report argued against an extra levy on U.S. streamers operating in Canada. \"Streaming services like Netflix would have spending obligations. It's not a tax,\" Yale tells <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">THR</emphasis>. \"They would directly spend and invest in content that meets Canadian-content requirements.\" Adds Brad Danks, CEO of Canadian cable channel and service OutTV, which has programs available to stream online and on Roku, Apple TV+, iOS and Android apps, \"The idea of protecting our market has gone away. The goal is to create an ecosystem that allows Canadian companies to flourish.\"</p><p>Asking foreign tech players to invest in local programming has a precedent: Netflix in 2017 negotiated a five-year deal with Ottawa to establish a production hub that avoided taxes and local content obligations. In return, the streamer committed to spending $400 million on its own content shot in Canada by 2022. In late 2019, the streamer reported that it had met that threshold three years ahead of schedule; its local expenditures included pricey shoots for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Umbrella Academy</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chilling Adventures of Sabrina</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Another Life</emphasis>.</p><p>That investment comes as Amazon, Hulu and other U.S. streaming rivals increasingly make Canada their base for ambitious original productions.

(but) regarding the conduct in question, it would be inappropriate for the bureau to speculate as to whether it may represent a contravention of (Canadian law),\" Marcus Callaghan, a spokesperson for the Canadian regulator, said in a statement Monday.</p><p>\"The bureau must conduct a thorough and complete examination of the facts before deciding whether to challenge any type of alleged conduct.\"</p><p>According to the complainants, search engines - largely Google - represent between 26 per cent and 90 per cent of their redirected traffic. Google's display policy meant publishers had to allow Google to display article extracts, photos and more without compensation - otherwise they wouldn't be displayed at all.</p><p>This meant publishers and news agencies had no choice but to comply with Google's display policies because they would otherwise lose income in a sector already facing a bleak economic outlook, the French regulator ruled.</p><p>Google's actions amounted to \"an abuse of a dominant position, and caused serious and immediate harm to the press sector,\" according to the regulators' statement. Google must now negotiate a new arrangement with French publishers within three months to repay them for \"reuse of their protected contents,\" including retroactive payments dating to Oct. 24, 2019.</p><p>Dwayne Winseck, a professor at Carleton University's school of journalism and communication, said Google's past approach - giving media companies the choice between displaying their content for free, or losing traffic through Google's powerful service - amounted to \"no choice at all.\"</p><p>\"That's an imposition (Google has) been able to make on the base of its market power. So I see the (Autorit&amp;#233; de la concurrence) decision as a counter to that,\" Winseck said in an interview Monday.</p><p>Winseck said he doesn't not expect Canadian regulators to come to a similar conclusion in the short term. But he said they're at least aware of the problem, pointing to the findings of a government-commissioned independent review into Canada's media and communications environment released in January.</p><p>That review panel - chaired by industry veteran Janet Yale - recommended a new regulatory system to govern the relationship between big tech companies and \"content producers.\"</p><p>\"Canadians are increasingly accessing news online through social media platforms, which facilitate the sharing of content ... without any form of compensation to the journalists and media outlets that created the content,\" the report reads.</p><p>\"The problem is exacerbated by the imbalance in negotiating power between the dominant social media platforms and the great number of creators who actually produce the news.\"</p><p>But Michael Geist, a University of Ottawa law professor and leading researcher on internet and e-commerce issues, said the French regulators' ruling could establish a system where Google and other internet platforms must pay publishers - even if they don't use that publisher's content on their sites.</p><p>\"I think (the decision) raises some concerns about essentially deep government interference in a marketplace, when I think there are other approaches that could be used (to support publishers),\" Geist said in an interview.</p><p>\"We've seen the (Canadian) government come up with a number of plans and support mechanisms for the media sector. Whether that is sufficient or not I know is open to debate, but nevertheless they've acted in this way.\"</p><p>According to the 2017 \" The Shattered Mirror\" report from the Public Policy Forum, Canadians are accessing news stories more and more through aggregators such as Google News, Facebook and Twitter - and not the media organizations themselves.</p><p>Google and Facebook, in particular, now enjoy \"unprecedented power over distribution of the web's content fragments, including news,\" the report stated. This means they get the bulk of the ad revenue - two out of every three digital ad dollars spent in Canada - not the news sites.</p><p>The report said sites like Google exploit the content of news organization in a system they called \"vampire economics\" - siphoning revenue from the organizations, while using their content on news feeds and search results.</p><p>In a statement, Google said it would comply with the French regulator's orders, and told Reuters the company has been \"engaging with publishers\" since new European copyright laws came into force in France last year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020041357732066</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YND-D5P1-F103-32RH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"859\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

(but) regarding the conduct in question, it would be inappropriate for the bureau to speculate as to whether it may represent a contravention of (Canadian law),\" Marcus Callaghan, a spokesperson for the Canadian regulator, said in a statement Monday.</p><p>\"The bureau must conduct a thorough and complete examination of the facts before deciding whether to challenge any type of alleged conduct.\"</p><p>According to the complainants, search engines - largely Google - represent between 26 per cent and 90 per cent of their redirected traffic. Google's display policy meant publishers had to allow Google to display article extracts, photos and more without compensation - otherwise they wouldn't be displayed at all.</p><p>This meant publishers and news agencies had no choice but to comply with Google's display policies because they would otherwise lose income in a sector already facing a bleak economic outlook, the French regulator ruled.</p><p>Google's actions amounted to \"an abuse of a dominant position, and caused serious and immediate harm to the press sector,\" according to the regulators' statement. Google must now negotiate a new arrangement with French publishers within three months to repay them for \"reuse of their protected contents,\" including retroactive payments dating to Oct. 24, 2019.</p><p>Dwayne Winseck, a professor at Carleton University's school of journalism and communication, said Google's past approach - giving media companies the choice between displaying their content for free, or losing traffic through Google's powerful service - amounted to \"no choice at all.\"</p><p>\"That's an imposition (Google has) been able to make on the base of its market power. So I see the (Autorit&amp;#233; de la concurrence) decision as a counter to that,\" Winseck said in an interview Monday.</p><p>Winseck said he doesn't expect Canadian regulators to come to a similar conclusion in the short term. But he said they're at least aware of the problem, pointing to the findings of a government-commissioned independent review into Canada's media and communications environment released in January.</p><p>That review panel - chaired by industry veteran Janet Yale - recommended a new regulatory system to govern the relationship between big tech companies and \"content producers.\"</p><p>\"Canadians are increasingly accessing news online through social media platforms, which facilitate the sharing of content ... without any form of compensation to the journalists and media outlets that created the content,\" the report reads.</p><p>\"The problem is exacerbated by the imbalance in negotiating power between the dominant social media platforms and the great number of creators who actually produce the news.\"</p><p>But Michael Geist, a University of Ottawa law professor and leading researcher on internet and e-commerce issues, said the French regulators' ruling could establish a system where Google and other internet platforms must pay publishers - even if they don't use that publisher's content on their sites.</p><p>\"I think (the decision) raises some concerns about essentially deep government interference in a marketplace, when I think there are other approaches that could be used (to support publishers),\" Geist said in an interview.</p><p>\"We've seen the (Canadian) government come up with a number of plans and support mechanisms for the media sector. Whether that is sufficient or not I know is open to debate, but nevertheless they've acted in this way.\"</p><p>According to the 2017 report from the Public Policy Forum, \" The Shattered Mirror,\" Canadians are accessing news stories more and more through aggregators such as Google News, Facebook and Twitter - and not the media organizations themselves.</p><p>Google and Facebook, in particular, now enjoy \"unprecedented power over distribution of the web's content fragments, including news,\" the report stated. This means they get the bulk of the ad revenue - two out of every three digital ad dollars spent in Canada - not the news sites.</p><p>The report said sites like Google exploit the content of news organization in a system they called \"vampire economics\" - siphoning revenue from the organizations, while using their content on news feeds and search results.</p><p>In a statement, Google said it would comply with the French regulator's orders, and told Reuters the company has been \"engaging with publishers\" since new European copyright laws came into force in France last year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTRNWS-2020041357732754</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTRNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YND-D5P1-F103-32SS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438721</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Free Daily News Group Inc.

The puppies had been posted online for sale.</p><p>Most of the seized dogs, many of them puppies, were Havanese. Police said the dogs showed signs of severe neglect and potential illness. Some of the puppies were discovered hidden in a closet and underneath a hutch.</p><p>The puppies are currently undergoing physical examinations at the city's animal control facility.</p><p>Gloria Sears is charged under both the Criminal Code and Animal Protection Act for causing animals to be in distress and for failing to provide adequate care.\u00a0</p><p>Ruling could undercut asylum cases:\u00a0lawyers</p><p>WASHINGTON ? A ruling from the U.S. attorney general could upend the asylum claims of thousands of Central Americans and other asylum seekers who say they deserve protection in the United States because they belong to families that are victims of drug cartels\u00a0in their homelands.</p><p>The nation's top prosecutor, Attorney General William Barr, issued the ruling Monday, partially reversing a 2017 Board of Immigration Appeals decision in the asylum case of a Mexican national who said a drug cartel targeted him and his family. Barr said that just because members of ordinary families fall victim to \"private criminal activity\" does not mean they can claim asylum protections in the United States.</p><p>The Catholic Legal Immigration Network, a nonprofit organization that represents the Mexican citizen, called the decision \"shameful\" and said it will make it more difficult for immigrants to qualify for asylum.\u00a0Lawyers will probably challenge Barr's decision in federal court.</p><p>Lawmaker targets 'social media addiction'\u00a0</p><p>WASHINGTON ? The youngest senator in Congress, and one of its toughest crusaders against Big Tech, proposed legislation Tuesday meant to curb social media addiction by regulating the techniques that prolong engagement on the platforms.</p><p>The bill by freshman Sen.

The puppies had been posted online for sale. Most of the seized dogs, many of them puppies, were Havanese. Police said the dogs showed signs of severe neglect and potential illness.

Barr said that just because members of ordinary families fall victim to \"private criminal activity\" does not mean they can claim asylum protections in the United States.

It's not a strategy that will work twice: His main opponents are younger than he is, First Nations and environmentalists have impugned his progressive credentials because he supports the Trans Mountain pipeline extension, and the SNC-Lavalin affair (more on that later) has tarnished his image and divided the Liberal ranks. But with an economy that's generally healthier than how he found it, despite large deficits, Mr. Trudeau can still craft a message of stability and prosperity for the \"middle class\" voters he courted last time. And as the world grapples with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/climate-emergency-motion-1.5179802\">https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/climate-emergency-motion-1.5179802</url> he is also trying to persuade Canadians that the Liberal carbon-pricing framework is a more credible path to a sustainable future than the Conservatives' plan.</p><p>Andrew Scheer, Conservatives</p><p>When the Conservatives, chastened by Stephen Harper's defeat, chose Mr. Scheer as leader, he was at first dismissed as \"Harper lite\" and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/andrew-scheer-conservative-party/article36509608/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/andrew-scheer-conservative-party/article36509608/</url> whose political beliefs were hard to pin down. Since then, he's found some powerful wedge issues to hammer - such as carbon pricing and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-controversial-environmental-review-bill-receives-royal-assent/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-controversial-environmental-review-bill-receives-royal-assent/</url> both of which he wants to scrap. But eliciting clear answers on, for instance,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-scheer-will-not-reopen-abortion-debate-conservatives-say/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-scheer-will-not-reopen-abortion-debate-conservatives-say/</url> or his personal views on LGBTQ issues has been more difficult. Mr. Scheer has also had to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-andrew-scheer-says-bigots-extremists-and-racists-arent-welcome-in/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-andrew-scheer-says-bigots-extremists-and-racists-arent-welcome-in/</url> against racist and anti-immigrant groups seen to be supporting the Conservative cause, and to deflect questions about       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/scheer-walks-out-on-media-when-asked-about-campaign-managers-rebel-ties/article36610946/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/scheer-walks-out-on-media-when-asked-about-campaign-managers-rebel-ties/article36610946/</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-andrew-scheers-secret-meeting-with-oil-executives-concerning-says/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-andrew-scheers-secret-meeting-with-oil-executives-concerning-says/</url> Mr. Scheer's hope is that Canadians either agree with him or are more fed up with Mr. Trudeau than they are afraid of a Conservative restoration.</p><p>Jagmeet Singh, NDP</p><p>In the 2015 election, Mr. Trudeau managed a left flanking manoeuvre on the New Democrats, who had moved more to the centre under then-leader Tom Mulcair. The party <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/jagmeet-singh-chosen-as-new-federal-ndp-leader/article36451452/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/jagmeet-singh-chosen-as-new-federal-ndp-leader/article36451452/</url> a young and dapper Sikh politician from the Ontario NDP, hoping he could bring federal New Democrats back to their progressive roots. Since then, he's had only a few months to face off against Mr. Trudeau in the House of Commons, where he didn't have a seat until a by-election earlier this year. He's argued that an NDP \"New Deal for People\" is a better plan than the Liberals' for creating jobs and reducing economic inequality. He's also said       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-ndp-leader-singh-accused-of-sending-wrong-message-by-ruling-out/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-ndp-leader-singh-accused-of-sending-wrong-message-by-ruling-out/</url> if the party gets the balance of power, which some surprised New Democrats interpreted as a concession that he doesn't expect to win. \"I'm running to become prime minister,\" Mr. Singh later clarified.</p><p>Elizabeth May, Greens</p><p>When Elizabeth May took the leadership of the Greens in 2006, it was a party with no seats and little hope of breaking through into the House of Commons. But amid increasingly dire warnings from scientists about climate change, and small but significant victories by her provincial Green counterparts in Atlantic Canada and Ontario, Ms. May has seen historically high polling numbers ahead of the 2019 election. Now, she hopes to sell Canadians on an aggressive plan to phase out fossil-fuel use by the middle of this century and make more inroads into the legislature. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-is-elizabeth-may-ready-for-the-green-partys-big-moment-ahead-of-the/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-is-elizabeth-may-ready-for-the-green-partys-big-moment-ahead-of-the/</url> she's disillusioned in Mr. Trudeau's leadership on the environment and that, in this election, she's not afraid of pulling votes away from the Greens' traditional Liberal allies.</p><p>Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois</p><p>Since the NDP and Liberals all but wiped it out in the past two elections, the federal separatist bloc has been a shadow of its past self, with too few seats even for official party status. The Bloc has cycled through eight acting or permanent leaders since 2011, the latest of which is Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet, who got the job this past January when no other candidates contested him for it. Unlike most of his predecessors, Mr. Blanchet, a former Quebec cabinet minister with the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, won't be able to count on strong support from his provincial counterparts, who were decimated in the election that brought Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault's CAQ to power last year.</p><p>Maxime Bernier, People's Party</p><p>From disgraced former cabinet minister to Conservative leadership hopeful to fringe-party candidate, Maxime Bernier has had a tumultuous political life since the 2015 election. After he narrowly lost the Tories' top job to Mr. Scheer in 2017, he denounced the new leader as too centrist and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-maxime-bernier-quits-to-launch-new-party-criticizes-morally-corrupt/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-maxime-bernier-quits-to-launch-new-party-criticizes-morally-corrupt/</url> to create a hard-right libertarian faction, the People's Party. His anti-immigration message and climate-change denialism have invited comparisons to U.S. President Donald Trump. Mr. Bernier's party, however, generally polls at 1 or 2 per cent.</p><p>#</p><p>The issues</p><p>Climate and taxes</p><p>Climate change caused by human-made greenhouse gas emissions is an urgent threat to Canadians' security, economy and society, not just in the near future, but now. Wildfire seasons are getting longer and more devastating; rising sea levels threaten to overwhelm the infrastructure of coastal cities; and scientists warn of a global refugee crisis caused by ecological, agricultural and social collapse. All the major parties agree climate change is a problem, but disagree about how to combat it. The Liberals introduced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canadas-carbon-tax-a-guide/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canadas-carbon-tax-a-guide/</url> but have struggled to get provinces to co-operate and will likely fall short of Canada's commitments in the Paris accords. Mr. Scheer, backed by premiers who've had the federal tax imposed on them,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.conservative.ca/cpc/andrew-scheers-climate-plan/\">https://www.conservative.ca/cpc/andrew-scheers-climate-plan/</url> and instead use tax incentives to target large emitters, but his plan doesn't promise to reach the Paris goals at all.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ndp.ca/climate-and-jobs\">https://www.ndp.ca/climate-and-jobs</url> would keep the Liberal tax but have industrial emitters pay more, while       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greenparty.ca/en/platform/bold-climate-action\">https://www.greenparty.ca/en/platform/bold-climate-action</url> is to apply a consistent price for all emitters, pay Canadians annual carbon dividends and keep raising the price until a full transition to renewable energy is complete.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-federal-election-2019-where-the-four-main-parties-stand-on-climate/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-federal-election-2019-where-the-four-main-parties-stand-on-climate/</url></p><p>Climate change and the oil patch</p><p>Fossil fuels may be the biggest culprits in climate change, but they're also Alberta's biggest industry, and the Canadian energy sector is reluctant to give them up - in fact, it's been pressing for more pipeline capacity to bring oil to global markets. To win Alberta's support for the carbon-pricing plan in 2016, the Trudeau government promised to go ahead with the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Alberta to B.C., going so far as to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-trans-mountain-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-how-the-deal-was-done/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-trans-mountain-a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-how-the-deal-was-done/</url> from Kinder Morgan when First Nations and the B.C. government opposed it. After years of legal battles over its environmental approval, the project currently has the green light again from the Trudeau Liberals, but its uncertain future and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/kinder-morgan-trans-mountain-pipeline-bc-coast/article35043172/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/kinder-morgan-trans-mountain-pipeline-bc-coast/article35043172/</url> have made it polarizing issue. The Conservatives want to push ahead with the pipeline expansion, while the NDP and Greens want to stop it.</p><p>There are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-leaders-moderators-confirmed-for-2019-english-french-debates-2/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-leaders-moderators-confirmed-for-2019-english-french-debates-2/</url> one in English on Oct. 7 and one in French on Oct. 10.

The Liberal, Conservative, NDP, Green and Bloc leaders have confirmed they'll be there, and Mr. Bernier of the People's Party has been invited too.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau has also agreed to attend a TVA-hosted debate with the other leaders on Oct. 2. He skipped another non-commission debate held by Maclean's magazine and Citytv on Sept. 12, and will also miss the Munk Centre foreign-policy debate on Oct. 1.</p><p>#</p><p>The digital spin, and how to watch out for it</p><p>In the years since Canada's most recent federal election, Western countries have been waking up to the dangers of digital disinformation.

Canadian citizens who are 18 or older are eligible to vote. If this is your first time voting federally, then congratulations! <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.elections.ca/content2.aspx?section=reg&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e\">https://www.elections.ca/content2.aspx?section=reg&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e</url> to register with Elections Canada in advance, or sign up in person at your polling place or returning office. If you've voted before or paid federal taxes, chances are Elections Canada already has you on their list. But riding boundaries are subject to change, so you should double-check which one you're registered in, especially if you've moved recently. When and where do I vote? If you're registered, you'll get a card in the mail with the address of your polling place and the dates of advance polls. When you go to vote, be sure to bring identification to prove who you are.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.elections.ca/content2.aspx?section=id&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e\">https://www.elections.ca/content2.aspx?section=id&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e</url> that Elections Canada accepts. When do we know who wins? This fall, 338 federal seats are up for grabs, and to form a majority government, a party needs 170 or more of them. At dissolution, the Liberals have 177, the Conservatives 95, the NDP 39, the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois 10 and the Greens 2. The first polls in Atlantic Canada will close at around 7 p.m. (ET), then proceed east to west throughout the evening. But depending on how close the results are, there may not be a final decision until late at night or the following morning.

They are also highlighting original journalism because people want high quality information.\"</p><p>Hinds said Google is also responding to higher regulatory scrutiny of Big Tech, and this could be a pre-emptive strike to hold off potential repercussions from lawmakers down the road. Platforms such as Google and Facebook have been under the microscope from antitrust regulators and law makers for their role in disinformation, privacy, fake news and decimating local journalism.</p><p>\"I tend to be unimpressed by these token gestures,\" said Daniel Bernhard, executive director of Friends of Canadian Broadcasting. \"Ultimately, the responsibility lies with government. If we want to defend quality journalism we can't just wait for Google to help out. In this respect Canada has fallen far behind the rest of the world.\"</p><p>Bernhard argued that Google still shows different audiences different search results, while its subsidiary YouTube has been criticized for driving some viewers to extreme or fringe sources of information.</p><p>\"They refuse to submit to any standards of accountability for the quality of information they promote and they lobby hard against platform liability,\" says Bernhard.</p><p>Richard Gingras, vice-president of news for Google, wrote in a blog post that the platform's response to maintaining quality news is \"constantly evolving.\" The platform will use an army of 10,000 global \"raters\" to evaluate and improve algorithims.</p><p>One rating that may favor legacy media, looks at a publisher's overall reputation for original reporting, including whether they have won Pulitzer Prizes or other awards.</p><p>\"We hope these updates to elevate original reporting will provide people with a deeper understanding of their changing communities and the conversations going on around them. Giving everyone better access to orginal journalism,\" says Gingras.</p><p>Jeffrey Dvorkin, the director of the journalism program at the University of Toronto (Scaborough) campus, says in principle, Google's move to highlight original reporting is a good thing.</p><p>\"I sense that Google is trying very hard to move the discussion past regulation and over their diminished reputation, and I wish them well. This is not a bad step,\" says Dvorkin. \"The platforms certainly need to do a better job of restoring trust.\"</p><p>However Dvorkin cautions that may mean the rush to publish first becomes even more paramount to publishers, which would entail risk and could lead to poorer quality journalism. The journalism professor pointed to a New York Times story about Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh that had to be corrected this week, causing major blowback.</p><p>\"The pressure to be first is more intense sometimes than the pressure to be correct. And that could cause problems down the line.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

They are also highlighting original journalism because people want high quality information.\"</p><p>Hinds said Google is also responding to higher regulatory scrutiny of Big Tech, and this could be a pre-emptive strike to hold off potential repercussions from lawmakers down the road. Platforms such as Google and Facebook have been under the microscope from antitrust regulators and law makers for their role in disinformation, privacy, fake news and decimating local journalism.</p><p>\"I tend to be unimpressed by these token gestures,\" said Daniel Bernhard, executive director of Friends of Canadian Broadcasting. \"Ultimately, the responsibility lies with government. If we want to defend quality journalism we can't just wait for Google to help out. In this respect Canada has fallen far behind the rest of the world.\"</p><p>Bernhard argued that Google still shows different audiences different search results, while its subsidiary YouTube has been criticized for driving some viewers to extreme or fringe sources of information.</p><p>\"They refuse to submit to any standards of accountability for the quality of information they promote and they lobby hard against platform liability,\" says Bernhard.</p><p>Richard Gingras, vice-president of news for Google, wrote in a blog post that the platform's response to maintaining quality news is \"constantly evolving.\" The platform will use an army of 10,000 global \"raters\" to evaluate and improve algorithms.</p><p>One rating that may favour legacy media, looks at a publisher's overall reputation for original reporting, including whether they have won Pulitzer Prizes or other awards.</p><p>\"We hope these updates to elevate original reporting will provide people with a deeper understanding of their changing communities and the conversations going on around them. Giving everyone better access to original journalism,\" says Gingras.</p><p>Jeffrey Dvorkin, the director of the journalism program at the University of Toronto (Scarborough) campus, says in principle, Google's move to highlight original reporting is a good thing.</p><p>\"I sense that Google is trying very hard to move the discussion past regulation and over their diminished reputation, and I wish them well. This is not a bad step,\" says Dvorkin. \"The platforms certainly need to do a better job of restoring trust.\"</p><p>However Dvorkin cautions that may mean the rush to publish first becomes even more paramount to publishers, which would entail risk and could lead to poorer quality journalism. The journalism professor pointed to a New York Times story about Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh that had to be corrected this week, causing major blowback.</p><p>\"The pressure to be first is more intense sometimes than the pressure to be correct. And that could cause problems down the line.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

The numbers are close to the plus or minus 3 per cent margin of error, 19 times out of 20.

The survey was conducted from July 26 to 28.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's a key question for any government with voters. Are you better off today than you were four years ago? And right now it's split,\" says Lorne Bozinoff, president of Forum Research in an interview.</p><p>Bozinoff says the 48 per cent is a \"good number\" for the Liberals heading into the October federal election. \"The 52 per cent who say things should be better is going to be split between people voting for the other parties. But they have 48 per cent to work with.\"</p><p>Respondents likely to say Canada is doing better skew younger (18 to 44) have higher post graduate education and are the most concerned with the environment. Those who say Canada is doing worse are generally older (45-64), male, and are the most concerned with immigration, according to the poll.</p><p>\"The economy has done pretty well, and people feel pretty confident about their job prospects, so that's a large component of what people are answering when they think of that question,\" says Bozinoff.</p><p>A Forum poll released in July shows the Tories and Liberals tied if an election were held today, with the Conservatives garnering 33 per cent support, and the Liberals 31 per cent. If the sentiment were projected into seats, that would give the Conservatives a slim minority government with 152 seats compared with 150 for the Liberals.</p><p>The popularity gap between the Liberals and the Conservatives has narrowed considerably since earlier in the year when the Liberals were taking a beating from the SNC-Lavalin scandal that saw the resignation of Attorney-General Jody Wilson-Raybould.

But he does have some of that charisma left and he seems to connect better with Canadians than Andrew Scheer on a personality basis.\"</p><p>The importance of environmental issues has also helped Liberal popularity. According to Forum, the environment remains, along with the economy, the top issue for Canadians. Just over one quarter of Canadians (26 per cent) say the environment is the top issue for them, a dramatic increase of 11 points when only 15 per cent (using a smaller sample size) said it was an important issue in February.</p><p>Meanwhile, 25 per cent of Canadians say the economy is the top issue, followed by health care in third place at 14 per cent, and taxes at 8 per cent.</p><p>\"Almost always you will see that the economy is the number one issue followed by health care. So this is significant. But also it isn't an anomaly, the environment has really become a key issue,\" says Bozinoff. \"And you can see this reflected already in the rise of the progressives, including the Greens and New Democrats and the Liberals.\"</p><p>The Liberals have pushed forward with their carbon pricing scheme, which places a minimum price of $20 per tonne of emissions across Canada. The Conservatives, meanwhile have said the plan is a pure tax grab, increasing costs for consumers. They released their own climate change plan in June, with a blueprint to make heavy industrial emitters contribute to clean tech research, but did not say how much emissions would ultimately be reduced by.</p><p>\"Public opinion tends to change slowly on things like Party standings.

According to Forum, the environment remains, along with the economy, the top issue for Canadians. Just over one quarter of Canadians (26 per cent) say the environment is the top issue for them, a dramatic increase of 11 points when only 15 per cent (using a smaller sample size) said it was an important issue in February.</p><p>Meanwhile, 25 per cent of Canadians say the economy is the top issue, followed by health care in third place at 14 per cent, and taxes at 8 per cent.</p><p>\"Almost always you will see that the economy is the number one issue followed by health care. So this is significant. But also it isn't an anomaly, the environment has really become a key issue,\" says Bozinoff. \"And you can see this reflected already in the rise of the progressives, including the Greens and New Democrats and the Liberals.\"</p><p>The Liberals have pushed forward with their carbon pricing scheme, which places a minimum price of $20 per tonne of emissions across Canada.

The numbers are close to the plus or minus 3 per cent margin of error, 19 times out of 20. Within that group 15 per cent say Canada is doing much better, while 29 per cent say the country is doing much worse. The survey was conducted from July 26 to 28.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's a key question for any government with voters. Are you better off today than you were four years ago? And right now it's split,\" says Lorne Bozinoff, president of Forum Research in an interview.</p><p>Bozinoff says the 48 per cent is a \"good number\" for the Liberals heading into the October federal election. \"The 52 per cent who say things should be better is going to be split between people voting for the other parties. But they have 48 per cent to work with.\"</p><p>Respondents likely to say Canada is doing better skew younger (18 to 44) have higher post graduate education and are the most concerned with the environment. Those who say Canada is doing worse are generally older (45-64), male, and are the most concerned with immigration, according to the poll.</p><p>\"The economy has done pretty well, and people feel pretty confident about their job prospects, so that's a large component of what people are answering when they think of that question,\" says Bozinoff.</p><p>A Forum poll released in July shows the Tories and Liberals tied if an election were held today, with the Conservatives garnering 33 per cent support, and the Liberals 31 per cent. If the sentiment were projected into seats, that would give the Conservatives a slim minority government with 152 seats compared with 150 for the Liberals.</p><p>The popularity gap between the Liberals and the Conservatives has narrowed considerably since earlier in the year when the Liberals were taking a beating from the SNC-Lavalin scandal that saw the resignation of Attorney-General Jody Wilson-Raybould. The minister was overseeing a corruption and fraud case against the Montreal-based engineering giant.</p><p>\"The Liberals handled the SNC-Lavalin issue terribly. What should have been over and done went on and on for weeks and months. But once they got that behind them, things started to turn around,\" says Bozinoff. \"However, this is not going to be like the last election for Trudeau. The glamour is certainly tarnished. But he does have some of that charisma left and he seems to connect better with Canadians than Andrew Scheer on a personality basis.\"</p><p>The importance of environmental issues has also helped Liberal popularity. According to Forum, the environment remains, along with the economy, the top issue for Canadians. Just over one quarter of Canadians (26 per cent) say the environment is the top issue for them, a dramatic increase of 11 points when only 15 per cent (using a smaller sample size) said it was an important issue in February.</p><p>Meanwhile, 25 per cent of Canadians say the economy is the top issue, followed by health care in third place at 14 per cent, and taxes at 8 per cent.</p><p>\"Almost always you will see that the economy is the number one issue followed by health care. So this is significant. But also it isn't an anomaly, the environment has really become a key issue,\" says Bozinoff. \"And you can see this reflected already in the rise of the progressives, including the Greens and New Democrats and the Liberals.\"</p><p>The Liberals have pushed forward with their carbon pricing scheme, which places a minimum price of $20 per tonne of emissions across Canada. The Conservatives, meanwhile have said the plan is a pure tax grab, increasing costs for consumers. They released their own climate change plan in June, with a blueprint to make heavy industrial emitters contribute to clean tech research, but did not say how much emissions would ultimately be reduced by.</p><p>\"Public opinion tends to change slowly on things like Party standings. But on the social issues such as the environment it can move quickly,\" says Bozinoff. \"Across North America there is an increased interest in environmental issues. People have been through a lot this year that is weather-related and that is being reflected in the polls.\"</p><p>News footage of forest fires in Los Angeles, a heat wave in Europe, tornadoes in Ottawa and flooding on the Toronto islands have all brought the point home, says the pollster. In April, federal government scientists released a survey showing Canada is warming at twice the global average because of climate change.</p><p>\"This has all been very powerful and impactful.

Clickherefor details.</p><p>When you make a bank transaction, you're unlikely to receive any recommendation or advice, even though the bank may have more relevant data about your money than Amazon does.</p><p>Banks struggle with customer analytics. They have a lot of data, but they also have old databases, fiefdoms that don't want to share customer data with one another and a problem in identifying the best ways to use the data.</p><p>If banks want to get serious about providing the same type ofpersonalized insightthat big tech companies do, they'll need to get serious about adopting artificial intelligence first.</p><p>\"The Googles, Amazons, Facebooks and Apples have set the standard,\" said Stephanie Sadowski, managing director at Accenture. \"The moment banks start to leverage this data to deepen the relationship and personalize it, we'll start to see them use AI in a push fashion\" the way Amazon does.</p><p>For example, through AI-powered analytics, a bank may notice that customers could get a higher return on their money by moving some cash to a different account. The fintech startup wallet.ai offers suggestions of this nature,as do virtual assistants from companieslikePersonetics, Kasisto and North Side.</p><p>\"It's going to be a customer expectation that you tailor your conversation to my needs and my preferences,\" said Alvi Abuaf, senior vice president and head of financial services consulting at Capgemini Consulting. \"When customers interact with Google, Amazon or other players like that, they know what they're being offered is very much customized to them.\"</p><p>The MandateSome argue that banks have to get better at customer analytics to stay relevant, compete and grow.</p><p>\"There's no question that customer analytics and specifically AI for marketing and cross-selling purposes will be a key success factor for banks going forward,\" Abuaf said.</p><p>Intense competition from fintech companies is one driver, especially as those fintechs increasinglyget access to banks' data through aggregators and open APIs.</p><p>And Europe's Directive on Payment Services (PSD2), which forces banks to share their customer data with others, may start to have an impact across the pond.</p><p>\"Will it come here as a regulation? I don't know,\" Abuaf said. \"Will it come here as a market-driven direction? Absolutely.\"</p><p>The ChallengeBanks often get criticized for not being good at customer analytics. But observers say that might be a function of priorities.</p><p>\"Over the last 10 years or so, banks have accumulated a lot of data and they haven't figured out what to do with it yet,\" Abuaf said. \"That's not because they're not capable, but mainly because they've been focused on regulatory issues.\"</p><p>Capgemini's view is that that will change in the next year as banks start focusing on growth, new products and new services. As they do, they'll recognize the value they have in that data.</p><p>Banks currently tend to use simulations, customer segmentation and life-stage moments, said Luc Burgelman, CEO of the customer analytics software company NGDATA.</p><p>Such older techniques don't achieve that coveted individualized \"segment of one\" insight.</p><p>Google and Facebook don't use these older techniques. \"Why simulate reality when you can look at reality?\" Burgelman said.</p><p>Another specific challenge for financial companies is that their data is temporal, noted Scott Hawser, CEO of Nutonian, another provider of AI-driven customer analytics software. \"Every customer experience and market condition is changing with time,\" he said.</p><p>Data analytics projects tend to take too long to keep up with this fast-moving data, Hawser suggested.</p><p>\"A dozen Ph.D.s sit in a room and build models and translate them to something the business can take action on,\" he said. \"That entire life cycle is far too long, it doesn't meet the needs of the business or the consumer.\"</p><p>Banks also have a basic data challenge: customer data tends to be locked in disparate databases based on products. And customers might be identified differently in each system. One might identify the customer by legal name, another might use Social Security number, a third might use a bank-generated customer ID number.</p><p>What AI Can DoThere are a few ways artificial intelligence technology can help banks overcome these shortcomings.</p><p>Some AI-driven programs, including those from NGDATA and DataXylo, are designed to take care of that customer identifier problem. They use fuzzy logic to match customer records despite the out-of-sync customer tags.</p><p>\"We use a combination of deterministic and probabilistic approach, so if certain attributes like your date of birth are matching, those records could be clustered together,\" explained Abhishek Yadav, co-founder and CEO of DataXylo.

The 33-year-old CEO and co-founder of Facebook, the world's largest social media platform, decided to own up for failure to keep a leash on Facebook. Late March, Zuckerberg announced that he will testify before Congress in the wake of Cambridge Analytica scandal[1], which exposed user data of 87 million Facebook users. His agreement to face US Congress also had the fore bearings of revelation that Russia's Internet Research Agency successfully managed to implant misinformation among American citizens using Facebook ahead of 2016 Presidential election. </p><p>In its 14-year history, Facebook[2] had gone from being the poster child of technology startup to a community as populous as that of India and China combined to dismantling the democracy. Of course, it led to an outcry and forced regulators around the world to take note. It is becoming clearer by the day that Facebook can no longer be restricted to being just a social community. It has the potential to make or break peace. And taking control ain't easy. During the two day long Congressional hearings which lasted for ten long hours, Zuckerberg transformed himself from a young software developer to the business professional the legislators wanted to meet. He took a page from the playbook of 44th US President Barack Obama and dressed in navy suit, white shirt and a light blue shirt. He also seemed really calm and apologetic of what happened on the platform. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bgr.in/features/facebook-cambridge-analytica-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-data-scandal/\">http://www.bgr.in/features/facebook-cambridge-analytica-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-data-scandal/</url> Also Read Facebook-Cambridge Analytica: Everything you need to know about the data scandal[3] 'Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company. For most of our existence, we focused on all of the good that connecting people can do. And, as Facebook has grown, people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love, for making their voices heard and for building communities and businesses,' Zuckerberg said as he spoke for the first time at the US Senate. 'But it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm, as well. And that goes for fake news, for foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy,' he added. During the two day testimony in front of the US Senate and House Committee, Zuckerberg[4] reiterated his passion for Facebook and how he hopes to make world a better place by connecting people around the world. Zuckerberg also spoke in length about how Facebook works and what is the source of its $40 billion revenue. There were multiple takeaways during the two days when Zuckerberg switched from his traditional attire to suit and chuckled in front of people with power to regulate the platform: 1. These US Senators and Congressmen don't really know how Facebook works2. The five minute window to quiz Zuckerberg was just not enough for even legislators who support Facebook3. Regulating Facebook and other internet companies was on the card but it didn't play out that big4. Zuckerberg could not tell if it has any real competitor5. Mark Zuckerberg as CEO of Facebook could not answer total shareholder equity6. Last but not the least, Zuckerberg believes that AI can save the platform. During the first day of testimony before the Senate, the word AI was referenced 25 times while it was used nine times when Zuckerberg testified before the House Committee on April 11. Zuckerberg almost implied that AI is the end to all the woes that have plagued the platform in the past year. This particular belief, however, did not come with backing statements and Facebook itself has not shed light on how and where AI is deployed apart from the fact that it is being used actively to take down hate speech and terror content. That leads us to a really big question: Can AI really save Facebook? Before we find answer to that question, it is important to go through some of the exchanges between Zuckerberg and Senators during the two-day testimony. Senator John Thune: As we discussed in my office yesterday, the line between legitimate political discourse and hate speech can sometimes be hard to identify, and especially when you're relying on artificial intelligence and other technologies for the initial discovery. Can you discuss what steps that Facebook currently takes when making these evaluations, the challenges that you face and any examples of where you may draw the line between what is and what is not hate speech? Zuckerberg: Yes, Mr. Chairman. I'll speak to hate speech, and then I'll talk about enforcing our content policies more broadly. So \u2014 actually, maybe, if \u2014 if you're okay with it, I'll go in the other order. So, from the beginning of the company in 2004 \u2014 I started in my dorm room; it was me and my roommate. We didn't have AI technology that could look at the content that people were sharing. So \u2014 so we basically had to enforce our content policies reactively. People could share what they wanted, and then, if someone in the community found it to be offensive or against our policies, they'd flag it for us, and we'd look at it reactively. Now, increasingly, we're developing AI tools that can identify certain classes of bad activity proactively and flag it for our team at Facebook. Some problems lend themselves more easily to AI solutions than others. So hate speech is one of the hardest, because determining if something is hate speech is very linguistically nuanced, right? Contrast that, for example, with an area like finding terrorist propaganda, which we've actually been very successful at deploying AI tools on already. Hate speech \u2014 I am optimistic that, over a 5 to 10-year period, we will have AI tools that can get into some of the nuances \u2014 the linguistic nuances of different types of content to be more accurate in flagging things for our systems. Senator Patrick Leahy: You know, six months ago, I asked your general counsel about Facebook's role as a breeding ground for hate speech against Rohingya refugees. Recently, UN investigators blamed Facebook for playing a role in inciting possible genocide in Myanmar. And there has been genocide there. You say you use AI to find this. This is the type of content I'm referring to. It calls for the death of a Muslim journalist. Now, that threat went straight through your detection systems, it spread very quickly, and then it took attempt after attempt after attempt, and the involvement of civil society groups, to get you to remove it. Why couldn't it be removed within 24 hours? Zuckerberg: Yes. We're working on this. And there are three specific things that we're doing. One is we're hiring dozens of more Burmese-language content reviewers, because hate speech is very language-specific. It's hard to do it without people who speak the local language, and we need to ramp up our effort there dramatically. Second is we're working with civil society in Myanmar to identify specific hate figures so we can take down their accounts, rather than specific pieces of content. And third is we're standing up a product team to do specific product changes in Myanmar and other countries that may have similar issues in the future to prevent this from happening. Senator John Cornyn: Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, for being here. I know in \u2014 up until 2014, a mantra or motto of Facebook was move fast and break things. Is that correct? Zuckerberg: I don't know when we changed it, but the mantra is currently move fast with stable infrastructure, which is a much less sexy mantra. Senator Christopher Coons: My core question is isn't it Facebook's job to better protect its users? And why do you shift the burden to users to flag inappropriate content and make sure it's taken down? Zuckerberg: Senator, there are a number of important points in there. And I think it's clear that this is an area, content policy enforcement, that we need to do a lot better on over time. The history of how we got here is we started off in my dorm room with not a lot of resources and not having the AI technology to be able to proactively identify a lot of this stuff. So just because of the sheer volume of content, the main way that this works today is that people report things to us and then we have our team review that. And as I said before, by the end of this year, we're going to have more than 20,000 people at the company working on security and content review, because this is important. Over time, we're going to shift increasingly to a method where more of this content is flagged up front by AI tools that we develop. Senator Jeff Flake: There are obviously limits, you know, native speakers that you can hire or people that have eyes on the page. Artificial intelligence is going to have to take the bulk of this. How \u2014 how much are you investing in working on \u2014 on that tool to \u2014 to do what, really, we don't have or can't hire enough people to do? Zuckerberg: Senator, I think you're absolutely right that over the long term, building AI tools is going to be the scalable way to identify and root out most of this harmful content. We're investing a lot in doing that, as well as scaling up the number of people who are doing content review. One of the things that I've mentioned is this year we're \u2014 or, in the last year, we've basically doubled the number of people doing security and content review. We're going to have more than 20,000 people working on security and content review by the end of this year. So it's going to be coupling continuing to grow the people who are doing review in these places with building AI tools, which is \u2014 we're \u2014 we're working as quickly as we can on that, but some of this stuff is just hard. That, I think, is going to help us get to a better place on eliminating more of this harmful content. Senator Gary Peters: You also know that artificial intelligence is not without its risk and that you have to be very transparent about how those algorithms are constructed. How do you see artificial intelligence, more specifically, dealing with the ecosystem by helping to get consumer insights, but also keeping consumer privacy safe. Zuckerberg: Senator, I think the \u2014 the core question you're asking about, AI transparency, is a really important one that people are just starting to very seriously study, and that's ramping up a lot. And I think this is going to be a very central question for how we think about AI systems over the next decade and beyond. Right now, a lot of our AI systems make decisions in ways that people don't really understand. Senator Gary Peters: And so, is your company \u2014 you mentioned principles. Is your company developing a set of principles that are going to guide that development? And would you provide details to us as to what those principles are and how they will help deal with this issue? Zuckerberg: Yes, senator. We have a whole AI ethics team that is working on developing basically the technology. It's not just about philosophical principles; it's also a technological foundation for making sure that this goes in the direction that we want. The above interaction along with follow-up answers offered by Mark Zuckerberg outlined a common theme that the company has deployed AI tools and wants to build even better tools in the future. The idea here is use these AI tools to tackle issues like spread of fake news, terror content and even foreign influence to disrupt an election. While Zuckerberg briefly spoke about ethical use of AI, he did not offer to elaborate on what his company is building. Also, these AI systems won't be working to fix the common problem with Facebook - privacy. This leads to a number of questions including is Facebook relying too much on AI. To answer that, it is important to understand the basics of AI and other underlying technologies.What is Artificial Intelligence?Artificial Intelligence[5] is a new technology that aims to store and process information similar to human brain. While AI has become a buzzword in the past few years, the underlying technology has been around for several decades. AI, as a technology, is basically a combination of machine learning (ML) and neural networks. Neural Networks, as the name implies, is a technology that aims to mimic the neural schema of a human brain to learn and relearn information. Machine Learning is a broader technology used to design algorithms that process data, make predictive analysis and help reach decisions. In a Medium post last month, Michael Jordan, Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences and the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley, wrote, 'In terms of impact on the real world, ML is the real thing.'       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bgr.in/features/ai-machine-learning-changing-how-we-communicate-with-businesses/\">http://www.bgr.in/features/ai-machine-learning-changing-how-we-communicate-with-businesses/</url> Also Read AI and Machine Learning are changing the way we communicate with businesses[6] In a way, Jordan is right. A lot of thing being passed around today is basically machine learning in the name of AI. For example, object recognition is nothing but machine learning which uses computer algorithms to study multiple datasets and uses predictive analysis to reach a conclusion. 'As datasets and computing resources grew rapidly over the ensuing two decades, it became clear that ML would soon power not only Amazon but essentially any company in which decisions could be tied to large-scale data,' Jordan explains.What AI can do right now?Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning[7] to be specific is already deployed by companies like Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon to enhance your experience. In fact, ML is at the core of Amazon's existence since it relies extensively on large-scale data and gives user-specific data using neural networks and sequential analysis. The most immediate form of AI comes on our mobile devices which all have a digital assistant of some sort. On Android, there is Google Assistant while on Apple's iOS, there is Siri. There is also smart speakers from Amazon which uses its own Alexa. These digital assistants use computational algorithm to understand user behavior and then offers them results like weather and commute to work at a specific time without their need to quarantine the system. AI is also used to do things like speech recognition and object recognition and are deployed in wide array of industries.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bgr.in/features/worried-about-facebook-tracking-you-heres-how-you-can-prevent-it/\">http://www.bgr.in/features/worried-about-facebook-tracking-you-heres-how-you-can-prevent-it/</url> Also Read Worried about Facebook tracking you? Here's how you can prevent it[8] Is relying entirely on AI a good strategy?This is the question that Facebook is shying away from answering in depth right now. During the Congressional testimony and Tuesday's appearance before the European Parliament[9], Mark Zuckerberg often said that he will answer their questions in written statements at a later stage. For most part, Facebook does not seem very good with follow-ups and its executives have mostly laughed at the scenario of its top honcho appearing before the committee. 'AI systems and tools can be used to do a consistent first pass at identifying hate or toxic speech, and automatically suppressing what is thought to be clearly toxic. We can reach very high levels of accuracy with such systems. However, no (AI) system can be 100 percent correct,' told Siddhartha Chatterjee, Chief Technology Officer of NSE-listed Persistent Systems. Chatterjee adds that a lot of policing of social media posts is currently done using manual methods such as keyword searches. Since humans are involved in existing manual method, there is a possibility of people getting tired and inconsistent in applying rules. Here is a possible fix to the existing mechanism:a. In case there is doubt, one or more humans can step in and make a judgment,b. In case any post is suppressed, there is a way for the user to get the suppression reviewed,c. There is a continuous virtuous feedback cycle which ensures that such AI systems learn as they go and become better with timed. There is always a path for users to provide feedback on your processes, and for the feedback to be analyzed and acted uponWhat's a fail-safe way to eliminate human bias?Facebook has been constantly criticized by legislators for supporting only one set of voice. It has been said to favor liberal voices and eliminate conservatives from the communication. While the bias has been said to affect speech on its platform, the effect could be far flung and affect the algorithms as well. In order to eliminate or reduce bias, Facebook and other software companies must need to identify it. Chatterjee says having a diverse pool of people involved in software development will help, for any software, not just AI software. He believes one answer is to ensure that we not only test the behavior of AI program for correctness and completeness but also for (lack of) bias. Chatterjee explains, 'The bias could creep in from data (e.g., when we miss data about some groups of people, say, or from the algorithms, or the way algorithms are applied. We have some tools, for example tools that identify 'tone' in written language about gender, and how best to reach to a larger diverse range of candidates. We need more such tools, and we need to make these more integrated in our tool set, so we can always apply these tools and checklists.' On the sidelines of Facebook's annual developers conference, F8 in San Francisco[10], select journalists were detailed how company is integrating ethics into its AI implementation. While it has not detailed how ethics will be programmed into its AI algorithms and how it defines ethics at the core of any of its utilities, it does offer a glimpse into the future of all AI programs. 'We need to ask ourselves not only what computers can do but what computers should do,' Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella remarked at Build 2018[11], company's annual developer conference. 'AI systems have an added ethical burden in that there may be decisions taken by AI systems that affect lives, and those will need to be tracked and kept right,' Chatterjee adds.Can tech companies responsibly use data on social media?Chatterjee says there is a lot of information that can be gleaned from public data and put to social good. 'At an individual level: Done right, such data can be used to ensure advertisements reach the right targets, so both advertisers and consumers are happier. Coupons and discounts can be better targeted.' The public data can also be used to offer right news stories and customized user suggestions based on their activity. Big tech companies also use volumetric analysis to locate areas that are hit by epidemic or a disaster. Facebook already uses similar technology to let its users mark themselves 'as safe' during a disaster. The data posted on social media platforms can also be constructively used in areas such delivering health service. 'By tracking mentions of diseases and symptoms on social media, we can track the spread of such diseases, and plan appropriate social health responses. For example, something similar was used in China during the Avian flu outbreak in 2013, using information from Weibo,' explains Chatterjee.Problems A PlentyFacebook's problems are a plenty and its immediate focus seems to be to prevent spread of fake news on its platform and jeopardize another election around the world. However, its extreme reliance on AI tools shows its inability to own up to some of those problems. It also raises flags on how the company is disengaging itself from public discourse on key topics like ethical use of AI and limiting access to information shared by users on its platform.

Can it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEXT MONTH Amazon will turn 9,500 days old. But for Jeff Bezos, the company's founder and chief executive, it is always \"Day 1\". Amazon, he has insisted since its founding in 1994, must forever behave like a feisty startup: innovate aggressively and expand relentlessly. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Adherence to this rule has made Amazon as convenient to consumers as it is feared by businesses which stand in its way. Today roughly $11,000-worth of goods change hands on Amazon's e-commerce platform every second. The company delivered 3.5bn packages last year, one for every two human beings on Earth. Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud-computing division, enables more than 100m people to make Zoom calls during the day and a similar number to watch Netflix at night. In all, Amazon generated $280bn in revenues last year.</p><p> This year Amazon has become not just convenient, but essential. The  smiling brown package left at the threshold as the neon-vested delivery worker backs swiftly away has become the hallmark of the locked-down pandemic. Shopless and officeless life would be unimaginable without deliveries and cloud-based work\u2014and insufferable without distractions like video-streaming. Investors see this as an acceleration of a long-term trend towards life online from which the world will not turn back. \"The explosive demand created by covid-19 catapults Amazon straight into 2025,\" says Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital, a venture-capital firm.</p><p> Amazon's market capitalisation doubled to $734bn between 2016 and 2018. Since then it has close to doubled again. Its shares trade at 118 times earnings, compared with 25-35 times for Apple and Microsoft, the other members of the trillion-dollar-company club. Up and down Wall Street, brokers tell clients to hold Amazon shares if they have them, or buy them if they don't. </p><p>But Amazon is not without problems. Rivals have emerged in both e-commerce and the cloud. Questions are being raised about its treatment of workers and independent merchants on its platform. Politicians in many capitals would like to see it broken up. So would some investors, on the basis that they would see higher returns that way. \"Day 2\", which Mr Bezos characterises as \"Stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline\", has not yet dawned. But it is well past noon on Day 1.</p><p>No firm bestrides the physical and digital worlds in the way Amazon does. In the physical world, it has a logistics system second to none. The 150m customers who subscribe to its Prime service get all their purchases delivered promptly\u2014as well as perks like free streaming of videos and films\u2014for a flat fee, with same-day delivery in some places. The convenience leads them to shop more. The logistics system is also used to fulfil orders for other companies. In 2018 \"third-party\" sales accounted for 58% of sales through the platform.</p><p> The scale of its retail operation gives Amazon an unparalleled collection of data on the desires and decision-making of hundreds of millions of shoppers\u2014the sort of data that advertisers love. Amazon's advertising revenues are now $11bn; its 7% share of the global online-ad market is larger than any save Google's (38%) and Facebook's (22%). </p><p>In the digital world Amazon dominates the cloud-computing business. In 2003 two engineers suggested that Amazon's in-house IT infrastructure could be provided as a service to other companies, as space on its website and use of its logistics system were. That intrigued Andy Jassy, Mr Bezos's technical adviser at the time. Today Mr Jassy is AWS's chief executive. The division has established the company's credentials as a developer of serious technology on a very large scale, rather than just a user of it. It also provides lots of cash. Last year AWS contributed $35bn to Amazon's sales\u2014and a fat $9.2bn in operating profits. </p><p>The AWS piggy bank has supported both expansion in retail\u2014in 2017 Amazon paid $14bn for Whole Foods, an upscale supermarket chain\u2014and new projects which the company's engineers cook up at a prodigious rate. One of the whizziest is Project Kuiper, a satellite-broadband venture; another is Haven Healthcare, a not-for-profit aimed at reducing health-care costs, created with JPMorgan Chase, a bank, and Berkshire Hathaway, a conglomerate. </p><p>Amazon is still growing briskly, especially so for a set of multi-billion-dollar businesses. But growth is no longer accelerating in a day-one-ish way. Start with retail. Between 2016 and 2019 growth in global sales of goods, Amazon's own and third parties', on its websites slowed from an annual rate of 27% to 18%, calculates Sanford C. Bernstein, a broker. The effects of covid-19 might drive it back up to 23% for 2020 as a whole, but the long-term trend is not expected to change. </p><p>And the coronaviral sales boost has come at a cost. The company is hiring 175,000 new workers in America to cope with surging demand; it has invested heavily in covid-proofing its operations; and it has sacrificed earnings by prioritising the delivery of essential items, which tend to have lower margins, while barring many lucrative non-essentials from warehouses and removing ads for them to tamp down demand. Even as sales rose by 26% between January and March, profits fell by 29% compared with the previous year.</p><p>With its range narrowed and shipping slowed, Amazon could not keep up with soaring online demand (see chart 2). In America and elsewhere shoppers turned to rivals, often on a \"click and collect\" basis. According to data from Rakuten Intelligence, an independent subsidiary of a Japanese e-commerce firm, Amazon's share of online spending in America was 34% in mid-April, down from 42% before covid-19. For years Amazon has led the way as an e-commerce pioneer, says Mark Shmulik of Bernstein; now every big retailer will turn to the web as never before. Long-established retailers like Target and Walmart are already making hay.</p><p>Big resurgent rivals are not Amazon's only competition. Shopify, a Canadian firm, offers retailers a way to sell online\u2014and obsesses over the experience it provides to the companies which use it just as much as Amazon obsesses over its customers. It has gone from nowhere a few years ago to 5.9% of America's online-retail market, second only to Amazon. It is now to become the back-end for Facebook Shops, the social networking giant's new e-commerce venture. Taking a lead from Alibaba, China's dominant online retailer, Facebook hopes to provide a setting where people will browse and socialise in a way that no one does on Amazon.  </p><p>Amazon can no longer count on Prime to fuel prodigious growth at home; most American households that can afford the $120 fee are already members. Future retail growth will therefore depend on markets elsewhere. These currently account for 29% of the company's total non-AWS revenues. In western Europe, Amazon is entrenched and has been doing well. But an ageing, economically sluggish continent is not exactly a long-term growth and profits motor. Many of the region's consumers tend to browse online then buy offline. Meanwhile, things in emerging markets are not going to plan. </p><p>A year ago, after 15 years of trying, Amazon gave up on China. In 2012 it had managed to win an e-commerce market share of 7% there, but Alibaba and the other local success story, JD.com, squeezed it out, poaching customers with screaming deals and promotions. Had Amazon fought harder it might still have lost; it is possible, even likely, that the Communist Party would not long have tolerated a big American retail presence. But it does bear some blame: it failed to recruit talented locals, and made too many decisions in Seattle. </p><p>Elsewhere in the emerging world Amazon is still burning billions with no returns in sight. Its $6.5bn investment in India looks troubled. The nationalist government of Narendra Modi is making life hard for foreign firms\u2014and easier for its local champion, Reliance Jio (in which Facebook is investing $5.7bn). In Latin America Amazon's 3% share of online retail is barely one-fifth that of MercadoLibre, an Argentine firm better at dealing with bad roads, banditry and other local pitfalls. Because profits from western Europe are not enough to offset losses in the developing world, Amazon's international division has been losing money for years.</p><p>Investors have mostly shrugged off Amazon's global retail slowdown. The reason is simple\u2014AWS. Its operating income usually adds up to well over half of Amazon's total\u2014in the most recent quarter it accounted for 77%. Bernstein estimates that Amazon's retail business had an operating margin of -1% in 2019, and AWS 26%. But the cloud is getting crowded. Alibaba, Google and Microsoft have expanded their cloud offerings (though Alibaba Cloud still earns almost all its revenue in China). Globally, AWS's share of cloud-computing declined from 53.7% to 47.8% between 2016 and 2018, according to Gartner, a research firm, while Microsoft's nearly doubled to 15.5%. Revenue growth at AWS has slowed sharply, from 49% in the second quarter of 2018, year on year, to 33% in the first quarter of 2020 (see chart 3 on next page).  </p><p>The AWS cloud is considered superior to the others in terms of reliability and speed. Azure experiences more service outages, for example. AWS also allows its customers to do more sophisticated things. But the rivals are good enough for most purposes, and improving. Large firms may prefer to deal with Microsoft because they have been dealing with it as a software provider for decades. George Gilbert of TechAlpha Partners, a consultancy, says that whereas AWS offers a wide range of platform services that suit the most technology-centric customers, Microsoft concentrates on integrating its services<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>in order to make them accessible to mainstream customers.</p><p>AWS has the resources to defend its market-leading position. But in the cloud wars any handicap could cost it dearly. Its parent may be becoming one such drag. For years being part of Amazon was a huge advantage for AWS, says Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs, a bank. It needed cash from the rest of the group, as well as technology and data. But Mr Bezos's habit of moving into new industries means that there are now ever more rivals leery of giving their data to it. Potential customers worry that buying services from AWS is tantamount to paying a land-grabber to invade your ranch. Walmart has told its tech suppliers to steer clear of AWS. Boards of firms in industries which Amazon may eye next have directed their IT departments \"to avoid the use of AWS where possible\", according to Gartner.</p><p>This has fuelled talk that AWS might be better off pursuing its future as a separate company. In addition to putting a healthy distance between itself and the Amazon expansion machine, AWS would no longer need to cross-subsidise the firm's less lucrative ventures. The transparency that would be offered into the financials of each business by a break-up would allow fund managers a better insight into how the new firms fulfil their investing criteria. In financial markets, a separation has been expected for the past year or so, according to the head of global internet banking at a leading financial institution.</p><p> Mr Jassy says that AWS was always designed to be separable from the rest of Amazon. If things get to the point where being inside Amazon is more disadvantage than advantage, says Mr Terry, AWS could go its own way. </p><p>Not that AWS gets nothing from being part of Amazon, however. Some data-driven technologies work better at scale. Data from Alexa, the virtual assistant Amazon makes available through its Echo smart speakers, helps feed Amazon's voice-recognition algorithms, which can then be sold as a service to AWS customers, as well as back to shoppers. More shoppers and more data mean better algorithms, and so on. Yet such benefits could easily be set aside if AWS's position inside Amazon continues to give powerful rivals such as Microsoft and Google a winning sales pitch.</p><p>Letting go of AWS would mark by far the most dramatic reorganisation in Amazon's unremittingly accretive history. Analysts reckon the unit accounts for a third or more of Amazon's value. A plausible valuation of $500bn would see it start out as one of America's ten most valuable firms. And despite slowing growth it is still expanding twice as fast as the retail bit. If it grew at 20-30% a year for a decade\u2014which is more slowly than in the past\u2014while maintaining its margins, it could turn into the world's biggest profit-generator.</p><p>There is no historical precedent for a half-a-trillion-dollar firm growing that fast for that long. But the notion is not entirely outlandish. Less than 10% of the estimated $4trn in annual global IT spending has so far migrated to the cloud. Mr Jassy is not alone in arguing that \"the overwhelming majority\" of computing is going to end up there one day. A company focused entirely on making that happen could become vast. </p><p>How would Amazon fare without AWS? In some ways, the change might be salutary: some close to Amazon feel that it has grown too big. Elements of unproductive bureaucracy and politicking are creeping in, they report. A lot of high-level Amazon meetings these days are about lobbying for promotion rather than innovation or operational excellence, says a former executive. A slimmed-down and refocused company might be on a better footing. </p><p>It would, though, also be one with much less cash to back its further growth. As well as helping pay for the purchase of Whole Foods, AWS money has paid for international expansion and heavy investment in \"last-mile\" delivery, among other things. If the e-commerce rump were to inherit a hefty chunk of the company's $59bn cash pile it might be able to keep spending\u2014but not for long, at its recent rates. An Amazon without AWS \"might not be one I would want to own\", says a representative of a big institutional shareholder in Amazon. </p><p>Mr Bezos's views on a break-up are unknown (he declined to be interviewed for this article). He may believe that AWS and the rest of the group are symbiotic and would both suffer if separated. Even if he does not, though, it is a fair bet that he would be reluctant to let go of a cash-cow that enables Amazon to pursue new ventures. In time, the ad business might grow to fill that role. Last year it boasted an operating margin of 49%, and it is standing up to the current collapse of the advertising market better than its larger online rivals. But it is still small compared with AWS. </p><p>Whatever Mr Bezos's views are, though, they will not be the final word that once they would have been. For a few years Seattle tech insiders have reckoned that Mr Bezos has been preparing to give up the top job to become executive chairman. He has already shed some of the management burden. In 2016, when Mr Jassy became chief executive of AWS, he named Jeff Wilke as \"chief executive worldwide consumer\". </p><p>Though the pandemic has now brought Mr Bezos back into day-to-day involvement in the e-commerce operation, in recent years he has mostly confined himself to new projects such as Amazon Go, a till-less supermarket, and, earlier, Alexa. He has also been devoting a fifth of his working week to Blue Origin, his private rocket company, which is currently working on satellite launchers to compete with those of SpaceX and a Moon lander for NASA. </p><p>There is also the matter of his private life. In January last year Mr Bezos tweeted a bombshell: he and his wife, MacKenzie, were getting divorced. Days later the\u00a0National Enquirer\u00a0published details of an extramarital affair. The news shook the tight group of executives who run the company alongside him.\u00a0Amazon's meritocratic culture depends on \"truth-seeking\", says a former senior executive. But it only works \"if people at the top behave accordingly\", he adds. \"Jeff's episode put a dent in the company's values.\"\u00a0Investors, for their part, fretted that Mr Bezos's eventful personal life had become a distraction. </p><p>If Amazon fissions, Mr Jassy and Mr Wilke will be the obvious candidates to run the two firms\u2014if, that is, one or other of them does not leave before then (they are both high on every recruiter's wish list). Mr Bezos might stay on to oversee both companies as executive chairman. Amazon's board will want to hang on to his magic touch for as long as possible, says a headhunter who knows the firm well. </p><p>But over time his influence may dwindle. He remains the company's biggest shareholder\u2014and thus the richest man in the world. His divorce settlement cut his economic stake from 16% to 12% (though he kept the voting rights of the portion he gave up). Still, every year he sells a slug of stock to fund Blue Origin, so in some years' time he may come to own less than a tenth of his creation. Excluding the big three passive fund managers, the four largest institutional investors in Amazon already control 10% of the stock. And unlike many technology firms, Amazon has no dual-class shares that would let Mr Bezos control the board regardless of the size of his stake.</p><p>There might be other attractions to new leadership. While on Wall Street and in Seattle investors and insiders talk of one way of splitting up the company, in Washington, DC, they talk of another. A growing chorus of politicians, accompanied by an ensemble of antitrust experts, accuse Amazon of abusing the market power its size and reach provide. </p><p> Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator and scourge of big tech, has proposed sundering Amazon's private-label business\u2014which produces goods for sale on the site\u2014from that of third-party sellers on its platform. The company would also have to sell Whole Foods and Zappos, an e-commerce rival it bought over a decade ago. Two Republican senators, Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, also speak of breaking up big tech, for different reasons. Donald Trump reserves especial spite for Mr Bezos on the basis that he owns the Washington Post, a newspaper critical of the president.</p><p>Anti-Amazon feeling grew stronger in April, after the Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon employees used data on third-party sellers to pinch ideas for the private-label business. Amazon has launched an internal inquiry into the incident, which violated the company's own guidelines. But lawmakers who had been investigating Amazon, Alphabet (Google's parent), Facebook and Apple for antitrust violations, still threatened to subpoena Mr Bezos if he did not voluntarily appear at an upcoming hearing. (In June Amazon signalled it was ready to send Mr Bezos.) The European Commission is reportedly preparing to file formal antitrust charges against Amazon over its treatment of third-party sellers in the coming weeks. </p><p>In America Amazon's market share is nearly two-fifths in e-commerce, but only 6% in all of retail. The firm's low prices and high-quality service certainly do consumers no harm. But even Amazon insiders say accusations of stealing small firms' ideas are becoming harder to brush off. </p><p>So are criticisms with respect to Amazon's treatment of its workers, a large proportion of whom are African-American or Hispanic. During the pandemic a number of warehouse employees have been publicising safety shortcomings to activists and the media. According to a tally by an Amazon worker, there have been 1,079 coronavirus cases among American warehouse workers. Amazon has said that the firm's rates of infection and quarantine are never higher than those of the communities in which its facilities are located, and sometimes lower. In May a group of 13 state attorneys-general asked Amazon to hand over data on covid-related infections and deaths at its warehouses. </p><p>In May a furore erupted after Amazon fired two tech employees who worked on user-experience design, after they organised a live-stream for warehouse workers to explain their pandemic safety fears. Democratic senators have demanded more information from Amazon on the dismissals. So have a handful of shareholders. </p><p>The incident prompted the resignation of Tim Bray, a respected senior vice-president at AWS (and co-inventor of XML, an internet data-description language). The sackings, and those of other activists at the firm, Mr Bray wrote, were evidence of a \"vein of toxicity\" running through Amazon's culture. A leading engineer inside Amazon's Grand Challenge team, a secretive skunk-works unit working on ambitious projects, says morale is rock-bottom. He plans to leave.</p><p>The risk of Amazon's labour practices inviting more regulatory scrutiny\u2014and, possibly worse, alienating brainboxes\u2014is not lost on investors. The firm needs to be \"very, very careful\", says the institutional shareholder's representative. Amazon raised workers' wages by $2 an hour from mid-March until June 1st and allowed warehouse employees worried about infection to go on unpaid leave without the risk of being sacked. It made 150 changes to the way its warehouses function to ensure social distancing and more cleaning. </p><p>Still, says the shareholder rep, rather than leading by example on labour Amazon \"seems to be playing catch-up\". Mr Bezos, who has added $54bn to his net worth thanks to his company's buoyant share price while low-paid warehouse workers toil through the pandemic, \"needs to lean over backwards to make sure workers are properly treated\", cautions a leading Silicon Valley venture capitalist. </p><p>The antitrust cudgel may in fact be an attempt to force Amazon to spruce up its labour track record. How far regulators are willing to go will depend on the public mood. Americans' reliance on the company and the goodwill it has generated with consumers may help it, says an antitrust expert close to Congress. An AWS spin-off, if it occurred, might obviate the need for drastic antitrust action. </p><p>Mr Bezos has managed to keep Amazon from ageing beyond Day 1 for longer than most companies can dream of. But not even the best magician can stop the passage of time. One day, Day 2 will come. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-RR8KJ8L</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:605C-GMR1-DY2R-2011-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3669\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

To put things in perspective, the Technology Select Sector SPDR is up nearly 35% year to date, easily outperforming its closest peers by nearly 15%.Most of the recent equity market rally can be attributed to a small clutch of stocks, namely the FAAMG group and Netflix, Inc.NFLX[1]. Of these, only Alphabet Inc.GOOGL[2] is up 37% year to date while all the others, including iPhone maker Apple Inc.</p><p>AAPL[3] are up more than 50% over the same period.But if one stocks stands out amongst them all, it is Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN[4]. With the stock setting a searing pace of gains, the question arises; can the iconic e-tailer sustain this momentum into the next year? Or are there any rude surprises on the horizon?Steady Gains, Smart DecisionsIt's been a year of steady gains for the online behemoth with Amazon moving from a position of strength to one of dominance. Currently, its online presence poses a threat to the existence of the entire brick and mortar retail space. To provide a small illustration, in 2017 alone, Sears Holdings Corporation SHLD[5] shuttered more than 350 Sears and K-mart stores. (Read: Is There a Brick ...rtar Route to Retail Success?[6])Moreover, in June, the online retail behemoth announced it was buying premium supermarket chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. Analysts are now betting that Amazon will soon make major forays into the grocery space because of its logistics and data mining expertise. This could cause nearly 10% of grocery purchases to move online. (Read: Grocery Gunfight: Can Incumbents Fend Off Amazon?[7])Now, Amazon is likely to dominate not only the ecommerce market, but it is also likely to grab an even larger market share of traditional retail. It also possesses the ability to push its own products over third party offerings, delivering a further fillip to its profits. The Amazon Prime service is one of its major advantages in the retail arena, acting as a key differentiator from all of its competitors.All these positives have come together to help the stock surge more than 58% year to date. Moreover, Amazon Web Services is now the leading public cloud platform and has a near 75% market share in the U.S.Nearly all these bullish factors were reflected in its third quarter performance. Earnings per share of 52 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 51 cents and were up 30% sequentially. Revenues of $43.7 billion beat the consensus mark by $1.6 billion and were up 15.3% sequentially and 33.7% year over year.Could Net Neutrality, Privacy Laws Act as Spoilers?Going into 2018, are there really any factors which could as spoilers to the Amazon party? Two likely disruptors for the tech space next year are the repeal of net neutrality rules and the EU's strict new privacy standards. Initially, these factors were projected to cause a significant increase in costs and create other impediments for tech firms.However, the repeal is actually a positive development for tech majors like Google, Facebook and Amazon. This is because these Internet giants possess deep pockets and can easily pay the tolls levied by ISPs in the absence of net neutrality rules. Meanwhile, smaller competitors and startups will feel the pinch since they are unlikely to have the funds necessary to afford such fees.The likes of Amazon are also likely to remain unaffected by the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU's new privacy standards. This is because having well-defined rules actually helps them to frame company policies and build adequate systems around them. Since they don't have the monetary constraints that smaller companies do, they are better equipped to be in compliance when the GDPR becomes enforceable. (Read: How the EU's New Privacy Law Will Impact Big Tech in 2018[8])And finally, there is the old bogey of pricey valuations, one which Amazon is also not spared from. With a PEG ratio of 7.11, Amazon is clearly pricier than the S...00, which has a PEG ratio of 1.99.Further, Amazon's PEG ratio is higher than that of the broader industry[9], which has a ratio of 2.47. But the ongoing bull market has dispelled such concerns over valuation time and time again. Tech majors have delivered ever stronger earnings performances, as was in evidence during Amazon's third quarter results, to justify such exorbitant valuations. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[10].In ConclusionThe favorite of analysts and retail investors, Amazon has enjoyed a year of strong gains and major successes. Next year promises to be no difficult since the company is well placed to combat any likely impediments to its ongoing growth.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes \"All In\" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

The founder of Spotify has long argued that the iPhone maker does not fight fair because it takes a 15% to 30% cut of subscription fees on Spotify apps downloaded from Apple's App Store, but waives the cost for its own music streaming service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week the 36-year-old Swede stepped up his fight, launching an antitrust complaint with the European Commission. His gambit was well-timed, coming a day after the British government published a damning 150-page report that called for a crackdown on Apple and the other big tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jason Furman, a former adviser to Barack Obama, who oversaw the report, called for a new competition body to rein in a \"few companies\" that have \"limited competition and consumer choice and innovation\".</p><p>Big tech is in the cross hairs like never before. Last weekend, Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who wants to run for president, demanded the break-up of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. She said: \"We need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favour and their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.\"</p><p>As if on cue, it emerged last week that several state attorney generals were working on a potential antitrust investigation into Google.</p><p>The developments inspired great debate about what form the coming crackdown should take. Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google have all kept shtoom. Yet in Washington and Brussels they are lobbying furiously, attempting to head off a regulatory tsunami that could threaten their existence.</p><p>In her call to arms, Warren harked back to the 1990s when America sued Microsoft for abusing its dominance of desktop computing. That, she wrote, \"helped clear a path for internet companies like Google and Facebook\".</p><p>This is, at best, only partly true. Microsoft was certainly distracted by the case, which dragged on for years. As tech commentator Ben Thompson of Stratechery pointed out, Microsoft lost its grip, not because of the government, but because it was so focused on the personal computer that it missed the new game that was emerging - the internet itself. That game would be won not on software licensing revenue - Microsoft's bread and butter - but advertising.</p><p>Thompson wrote: \"This is a value chain that never even occurred to Microsoft, and why would it? The entire company was predicated on controlling operating systems for physical computers, controlling the [program interfaces] on top, and earning revenue through licensing; it was fabulously profitable, and as history shows again and again, being fabulously profitable with an existing value chain is the best way to fail to recognise a new market opportunity.\"</p><p>It is a point worth noting. Warren's blanket demand to break up big tech is eye-catching but is based on a misinterpretation of history and presumes a uniformity among her targets that does not exist. While the tech giants certainly benefit from the winner-takes-all dynamics of the web, they are different - Apple makes phones, Facebook and Google are ad-driven behemoths, Amazon is a retailer. The one-size-fits-all approach to antitrust that has dominated in America for a century will have to be reimagined.</p><p>Congress kicked off the trustbusting era in 1890 with the Sherman Antitrust Act, aimed at robber barons of the day such as Standard Oil's John D Rockefeller. A significant last act, in 1914, saw the creation of the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>The regime's guiding principle has always been consumer protection, which boils down to a simple test: are people paying artificially high prices?</p><p>The services offered by Google and Facebook are free. Apple's App Store offerings are very cheap; Amazon's prices are often low and usually competitive. That is one reason that, of the more than 400 acquisitions those four - plus Microsoft - have made in the past decade, none has been challenged.</p><p>One change in the offing, then, is philosophical. Regulators are considering rules that allow for a more nuanced interpretation of consumer harm and a broader set of parameters that govern mergers and company behaviour, with the hope that regulators will end up inmore tools to prevent the worst abuses.</p><p>A trickier area is the division between the companies and the marketplaces they operate in, which gets to Ek's point. Spotify has 96m customers who pay a monthly fee for streaming music, which puts it streets ahead of Apple's rival music business, with roughly 60m subscribers.</p><p>While Spotify must hand over a big chunk of fees for any Spotify account accessed through the iPhone app, Apple Music pays no such charge. What's more, Apple has made it harder for developers that want to be on the iPhone to use any purchasing system other than Apple's, guaranteeing it gets a cut while giving its own competing products a free ride.</p><p>In a speech in Berlin last week, Ek likened competing with Apple to playing table tennis \"blindfolded while they change the rules throughout the game\".</p><p>Apple dismissed Ek's argument, claiming that Spotify used the App Store to \"dramatically grow their business\" and that now it wants \"all the benefits of the App Store ecosystem without making any contributions to that marketplace\".</p><p>Yet Spotify is not alone. In December, Netflix stopped accepting payments through the iPhone app for the same reason - a flashpoint in a rivalry that will escalate next week when Apple is expected to unveil a TV and film streaming service that it hopes will be a Netflix killer.</p><p>Increasingly, Apple, Amazon and the rest are deploying what critics claim are their ill-gotten gains to plunge into other industries. Apple is taking on Hollywood. Amazon is barging into groceries and healthcare. Facebook is trying - and so far failing - to make a dent in hardware.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, surprisingly, has taken the boldest step yet to head off the tide. The 34-year-old said this month that the nature of Facebook was changing. Largely in reaction to data breaches, bullying and election meddling that Facebook failed to control, people are turning away from its core - a one-to-many platform full of newsfeed posts. They are downsizing to group chats, one-to-one conversations and messaging.</p><p>Rather than hold on for dear life to the model that drove one of the biggest success stories in the history of business, Zuckerberg is euthanising it. He announced that he would re-engineer Facebook so that all messages will, eventually, be encrypted. That means no one - not Facebook, not, in theory, advertisers - will be able to see what you are saying. What that will do to Facebook's ad business is far from clear.</p><p>Benedict Evans of the Silcon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz wrote: \"You could see this as an attempt to remove the problem rather than patch it. Russians can't go viral in your newsfeed if there is no newsfeed. 'Researchers' can't scrape your data if Facebook doesn't have your data. You solve the problem by making it irrelevant.\"</p><p>Facebook's problems are far from over. It emerged last week that federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into deals under which Facebook gave companies access to consumer data, sometimes without consent.</p><p>Yet, unlike Microsoft, it appears that Zuckerberg may at least finally be looking in the right direction.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-52631973</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNC-RJP1-F021-627T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1221\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 17, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFJT</classCode><className>SPOTIFY LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The founder of Spotify has long argued that the iPhone maker does not fight fair because it takes a 15% to 30% cut of subscription fees on Spotify apps downloaded from Apple's App Store, but waives the cost for its own music streaming service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week the 36-year-old Swede stepped up his fight, launching an antitrust complaint with the European Commission. His gambit was well-timed, coming a day after the British government published a damning 150-page report that called for a crackdown on Apple and the other big tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jason Furman, a former adviser to Barack Obama, who oversaw the report, called for a new competition body to rein in a \"few companies\" that have \"limited competition and consumer choice and innovation\".</p><p>Big tech is in the cross hairs like never before. Last weekend, Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who wants to run for president, demanded the break-up of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. She said: \"We need to stop this generation of big tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favour and their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.\"</p><p>As if on cue, it emerged last week that several state attorney generals were working on a potential antitrust investigation into Google.</p><p>The developments inspired great debate about what form the coming crackdown should take. Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google have all kept shtoom. Yet in Washington and Brussels they are lobbying furiously, attempting to head off a regulatory tsunami that could threaten their existence.</p><p>In her call to arms, Warren harked back to the 1990s when America sued Microsoft for abusing its dominance of desktop computing. That, she wrote, \"helped clear a path for internet companies like Google and Facebook\". This is, at best, only partly true. Microsoft was certainly distracted by the case, which dragged on for years. As tech commentator Ben Thompson of Stratechery pointed out, Microsoft lost its grip, not because of the government, but because it was so focused on the personal computer that it missed the new game that was emerging - the internet itself. That game would be won not on software licensing revenue - Microsoft's bread and butter - but advertising.</p><p>Thompson wrote: \"This is a value chain that never even occurred to Microsoft, and why would it? The entire company was predicated on controlling operating systems for physical computers, controlling the [program interfaces] on top, and earning revenue through licensing; it was fabulously profitable, and as history shows again and again, being fab-ulously profitable with an existing value chain is the best way to fail to recognise a new market opportunity.\"</p><p>It is a point worth noting. Warren's blanket demand to break up big tech is eye-catching but is based on a misinterpretation of history and presumes a uniformity among her targets that does not exist.

The one-size-fits-all approach to antitrust that has dominated in America for a century will have to be reimagined.</p><p>Congress kicked off the trustbusting era in 1890 with the Sherman Antitrust Act, aimed at robber barons of the day such as Standard Oil's John D Rockefeller. A significant last act, in 1914, saw the creation of the Federal Trade Commission. The regime's guiding principle has always been consumer protection, which boils down to a simple test: are people paying artificially high prices? The services offered by Google and Facebook are free. Apple's App Store offerings are very cheap; Amazon's prices are often low and usually competitive. That is one reason that, of the more than 400 acquisitions those four - plus Microsoft - have made in the past decade, none has been challenged.</p><p>One change in the offing, then, is philosophical.

What's more, Apple has made it harder for developers that want to be on the iPhone to use any purchasing system other than Apple's, guaranteeing it gets a cut.</p><p>In a speech in Berlin last week, Ek likened competing with Apple to playing table tennis \"blindfolded while they change the rules throughout the game\".</p><p>Apple dismissed Ek's argument, claiming that Spotify used the App Store to \"dramatically grow their business\" and that now it wants \"all the benefits of the App Store ecosystem without making any contributions to that marketplace\".</p><p>Yet Spotify is not alone. In December, Netflix stopped accepting payments through the iPhone app for the same reason - a flashpoint in a rivalry that will escalate next week when Apple is expected to unveil a TV and film streaming service that it hopes will be a Netflix killer.</p><p>Increasingly, Apple, Amazon and the rest are deploying what critics claim are their ill-gotten gains to plunge into other industries. Apple is taking on Hollywood. Amazon is barging into groceries and healthcare. Facebook is trying - and so far failing - to make a dent in hardware.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, surprisingly, has taken the boldest step yet to head off the tide. The 34-year-old said this month that the nature of Facebook was changing. Largely in reaction to data breaches, bullying and election meddling that Facebook failed to control, people are turning away from its core - a one-to-many platform full of newsfeed posts. They are downsizing to group chats, one-to-one conversations and messaging.</p><p>Rather than hold on for dear life to the model that drove one of the biggest success stories in the history of business, Zuckerberg is euthanising it. He announced that he would re-engineer Facebook so that all messages will, eventually, be encrypted. That means no one - not Facebook, not, in theory, advertisers - will be able to see what you are saying. What that will do to Facebook's ad business is far from clear.</p><p>Benedict Evans of the Silcon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz wrote: \"You could see this as an attempt to remove the problem rather than patch it.</p><p>\"Russians can't go viral in your newsfeed if there is no newsfeed. 'Researchers' can't scrape your data if Facebook doesn't have your data. You solve the problem by making it irrelevant.\"</p><p>Facebook's problems are far from over. It emerged last week that federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into deals under which Facebook gave companies access to consumer data, sometimes without consent. Yet, unlike Microsoft, it appears that Zuckerberg may at least finally be looking in the right direction.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat who is seeking the nomination to run for president, has called for Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google to be broken upAMY E PRICE</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-147429441</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNF-HF21-JCBW-N126-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1213\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 17, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFJT</classCode><className>SPOTIFY LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

The founder of Spotify has long argued that the iPhone maker does not fight fair because it takes a 30% cut of any money spent on Spotify through the App Store, but waives the fee for its own music service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week the 36-year-old Swede stepped up his fight, launching an antitrust complaint with the European Commission. His gambit was well-timed, coming a day after the British government published a damning 150-page report that called for a crackdown on Apple and the other big tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jason Furman, a former adviser to Barack Obama, who oversaw the report, called for a new competition body to rein in a \"few companies\" that have \"limited competition and consumer choice and innovation\". Under the plan, tech giants could be forced to offer access to key data-sets to smaller rivals. He also urged regulators to come up with sweeping rules that could be applied globally.</p><p>Big tech is in the cross hairs like never before. Last weekend, US presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren called for the break-up of Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook and the unwinding of big acquisitions. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else,\" she said. \"And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\"</p><p>The pronouncements inspired great debate about what form the forthcoming crackdown should take. Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google have all kept shtoom. Yet in Washington and Brussels they are lobbying furiously, attempting to head off a regulatory tsunami that could threaten their existence.</p><p>In her call to arms, Warren harked back to the 1990s when America sued Microsoft for abusing its dominance of desktop computing. That, she wrote, \"helped clear a path for internet companies like Google and Facebook to emerge\".</p><p>This is, at best, only partly true. Micro-soft was certainly distracted by the case, which dragged on for years. As tech commentator Ben Thompson of Stratechery pointed out, Microsoft lost its grip, not because of the government, but because it was so focused on the personal computer while completely missing the new game that was emerging - the internet itself. That game would be won not on software licensing revenue - Microsoft's bread and butter - but advertising.</p><p>Thompson said: \"This is a value chain that never even occurred to Microsoft, and why would it? The entire company was predicated on controlling operating systems for physical computers, controlling the [program interfaces] on top, and earning revenue through licensing; it was fabulously profitable, and as history shows again and again, being fabulously profitable with an existing value chain is the best way to fail to recognise a new market opportunity.\"</p><p>It is a point worth noting. Warren's blanket demand to break up big tech is eye-catching but is based on a misinterpretation of history and presumes a uniformity among her targets that does not exist. While the tech giants certainly benefit from the winner-takes-all dynamics of the web, they are different - Apple makes phones, Facebook and Google are ad-driven behemoths, Amazon is a retailer. The one-size-fits-all approach to antitrust that has dominated in America for a century will have to be reimagined.</p><p>Congress kicked off the trustbusting era in 1890 with the Sherman Antitrust Act, aimed at robber barons of the day such as Rockefeller's Standard Oil. A significant last act, in 1914, saw the creation of the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>The regime's guiding principle has always been consumer protection, which boils down to a simple test: are people paying artificially high prices? The services offered by Google and Facebook are free. Apple's App Store offerings are very cheap; Amazon's prices are often low and usually competitive. That is one reason that, of the more than 400 companies those four, plus Microsoft, have bought in the past decade, not one has been challenged.</p><p>One change in the offing, then, is philosophical. Regulators are considering rules that allow for a more nuanced interpretation of consumer harm, and adding other criteria, such as a national interest test, to give regulators the tools they need to prevent the worst abuses.</p><p>A trickier area is the division between the companies and the marketplaces they operate in, which gets to Ek's point. Spotify has 96m customers who pay a monthly fee for streaming music, which puts it streets ahead of Apple's rival music business, with roughly 60m subscribers.</p><p>While Spotify must hand over 30% of fees for any Spotify account accessed through the iPhone app, Apple Music pays no such charge. What's more, Apple explicitly prohibits developers who want to be on the iPhone from using any in-app purchase mechanism other than its own, guaranteeing it gets its cut while giving its own competing products a free ride.</p><p>In a speech in Berlin last week, Ek likened competing with Apple to playing table tennis \"blindfolded while they change the rules throughout the game\".</p><p>The problem is growing. In December, Netflix stopped accepting payments through the iPhone app for this very reason - a flashpoint in a rivalry that will escalate next week when Apple is expected to unveil a television and film streaming service that it hopes will be a Netflix killer.</p><p>Increasingly Apple, Amazon and the rest are deploying what critics claim are their ill-gotten gains to plunge into other industries. Apple is taking on Hollywood. Amazon is barging into groceries and healthcare. Facebook is trying - and so far failing - to make a dent in hardware.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, surprisingly, has taken the boldest step yet to head off the tide. The 34-year-old said this month that the nature of Facebook is changing. People, largely in reaction to data breaches, bullying and election meddling that Facebook failed to control, are turning away from its traditional core - a one-to-many platform full of newsfeed posts. They are downsizing: group chats, one-to-one conversations and ephemeral messaging. So, rather than hold on for dear life to the model that drove one of the biggest success stories in the history of business, Zuckerberg is euthanising it.</p><p>He announced that he will re-engineer Facebook so that all messages will, eventually, be encrypted. That means that no one - not Facebook, not, in theory, advertisers - can see what you are saying. What that does to Facebook's ad business, founded on granular details of its users, is far from clear.</p><p>Benedict Evans of Andreessen Horowitz wrote: \"You could see this as an attempt to remove the problem rather than patch it.</p><p>\"Russians can't go viral in your newsfeed if there is no newsfeed. 'Researchers' can't scrape your data if Facebook doesn't have your data. You solve the problem by making it irrelevant.\"</p><p>Facebook's problems are far from over. It emerged last week that federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into deals under which Facebook gave companies access to consumer data, sometimes without consent. Yet, unlike Microsoft, it appears that Zuckerberg may finally be looking in the right direction at least.</p><p>Russians can't go viral in your newsfeed if there is no newsfeed</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, has called for Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google to be broken up as they have 'bulldozed competition'</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-147429695</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNF-HF21-JCBW-N0M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1201\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 17, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFJT</classCode><className>SPOTIFY LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website[2] Facebook is always in the news, but not always for edifying reasons. Recently, the Trump administration sued Facebook for targeting housing ads to people in a discriminatory manner. In 2018, a great deal of coverage focused on how the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica misappropriated thousands of Facebook data points on more than 200 million users and may have used that data in efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Meanwhile, publishing executives continue to gripe about Facebook practices that have brought much of their industry to death's door. </p><p>As bad news piles up, some politicians and critics have begun to call for a breakup of big tech companies. But thus far, a step-by-step explanation of how its business model works and the relevant economic arguments have largely been missing. My paper, 'The Antitrust Case Against Facebook[3],' details the quintessential market power fact-patterns that standard economics and competition law have made familiar. Facebook's ability to inflict harm today on both consumers and news publishers rests heavily, though not exclusively, on a single practice that Facebook engages in: surveillance. Facebook not only tracks users while they are on its site; it also follows them after they leave Facebook itself. This singular ability to surveil customers\u2014across millions of independent and sometimes competitive businesses\u2014is the source of Facebook's unusually high profit margins in digital advertising, as well as its ability to inflict harm on market participants. Facebook could not get away with this when it faced real competition. It is important to understand what Facebook did to establish its dominant market position. For ten years, privacy (not surveillance) was Facebook's proclaimed competitive advantage. This always included the specific promise not to track users across the Internet. But in 2014, after Facebook locked in the market, and competitors exited, its leadership abruptly changed their minds about tracking. To conduct the tracking, it leveraged an extensive framework for surveillance that it spent years building while deflecting concern that it might have been building up capacities for precisely this purpose. Consumers today face a classic Hobson's choice: Use Facebook and submit to the loss of privacy, or forgo all use of the only social network used by most of their friends, family, and acquaintances. Facebook's monopolistic position implies that familiar economic meanings of the word 'price' undergo a subtle transformation in meaning. When one signs up for a 'free' Facebook account, the 'price' is what the user agrees to in Facebook's terms and conditions. When you use any free media service, somewhere in the fine print, you are made to understand that advertising will a part of that bargain. Today, though, if you use Facebook, you also agree that Facebook will 'track' you. Meaning, Facebook will monitor what you research, read, shop for, purchase, or even input across millions of sites and mobile applications on the Internet. According to a recent Wall Street Journal investigation[4], agreeing to this tracking includes allowing Facebook to ingest the most sensitive and personal details that you enter on unrelated mobile applications. For example, when you enter your heart rate or information about your ovulation cycle onto one of the many popular health apps, these apps share that data with Facebook almost immediately. For those that use an Android phone, the surveillance goes deeper in a different direction. Facebook apparently scrapes a record of your phone calls\u2014effectively rendering use of the Facebook social network the equivalent of having a pen register on your device. If the people would not allow a government to track citizens, why is their free market resulting in the same outcome? What many don't remember is that when the social network market faced competition\u2014when dozens of companies competed in an attempt to win market share, and all competing products were priced at zero\u2014privacy quickly emerged as a key differentiator. When Facebook entered the market it specifically promised[5] users: 'We do not and will not use cookies to collect private information from any user.' Levels of user privacy weren't only relevant to Facebook's market entry; they were at the crux of the Facebook-user bargain from 2004 through 2014. Facebook consistently promised consumers it would not track their digital footprints off of Facebook itself. Facebook tried to renege on this promise in 2007 but the market was competitive enough, and had enough consumer choice, to thwart that attempt. Consumer pushback forced Facebook's retreat. Then, when the company launched its 'like' buttons in 2010, consumers were concerned that Facebook might leverage the buttons to conduct surveillance. Facebook placated consumers by assuring[6] them that 'like' buttons would not be used for tracking. Facebook's conduct from 2004 through 2012, provides the benchmark of quality\u2014at least with respect to commercial surveillance\u2014that the restraining forces of competition demanded. Competition didn't only restrain Facebook's ability to track users. It restrained every social network from trying to engage in this behavior. Speaking on behalf of then-competitor MySpace, owned by News Corp., one analyst commented[7] on this dynamic: 'News Corp. and Fox recognize the importance of allowing people to be alone with their friends, so they do not feel like they are being looked at by Big Brother. They understand how many competitors they have nipping at their heels right now, so they are doing everything they can not to alienate users.' In other words, competition protected people from today's Orwellian practices. While competition ensured that the market produced something that was good for consumers, the exit of competition greenlit a change in conduct by the sole surviving firm. By early 2014, dozens of rivals that initially competed with Facebook had effectively exited the market. In June of 2014, rival Google announced[8] it would shut down its competitive social network, ceding the social network market to Facebook. For Facebook, the network effects of more than a billion users on a closed-communications protocol further locked in the market in its favor. These circumstances\u2014the exit of competition and the lock-in of consumers\u2014finally allowed Facebook to get consumers to agree to something they had resisted from the beginning. Almost simultaneous with Google's exit, Facebook announced[9] (also in June of 2014) that it would begin to track users' behavior on websites and apps across the Internet and use the data gleaned from such surveillance to target and influence consumers. Shortly thereafter, it started tracking non-users too. It uses the 'like' buttons and other software licenses to do so. It was only after an historic public offering, the acquisition of more than a billion users who had been promised privacy, and the exit of competitors, that Facebook was finally able to compel consumers to consent to this state of affairs. It is important to note that Facebook's ability to get people to agree to this level of surveillance is also the basis of Facebook's ability to harm consumers and publishers. Surveillance translates into influence[10]: Information gathered about people can be used to try to influence election outcomes, which is now well known. But information gleaned from surveillance can also be used against people in other ways. If Facebook is monitoring usage of the health apps on your mobile phone, and therefore knows intimate details about your health, it can steer housing or job ads away from you based on this knowledge. Facebook's policy of tracking users across the Internet hurts competition, too. Facebook tracks what a publication's readers are reading, and then turns around and uses that information to undercut that very publication in advertising markets. For example, if Facebook tracks that you are reading an article about foreign policy on The Economist's website, it can turn around and sell ads directed at you for a lower cost than what The Economist could (since The Economist has to pay the writers to create the content). This cross-site tracking is the underlying mechanism that explains why Facebook and Google gain almost every incremental dollar that enters the digital advertising market. Meanwhile, establishment media organizations like The Guardian are now asking readers for donations[11], while start-ups like BuzzFeed have resorted to layoffs[12]. The problem is that people may not have chosen Facebook as the market winner had Facebook been honest about its intentions. For more than 10 years, Facebook induced users to choose Facebook over other social networks by promising high levels of privacy. But, as I catalogue in the paper, many of those promises were false, even at the time. For example, the company was getting users to choose Facebook based on promises that it would not track them, but at the same time filed a patent to do precisely that. When Facebook toyed with tracking consumers in 2007 but consumer push-back forced it to retreat, consumers became suspicious of the company's long-term privacy intentions. To assuage users, Facebook promised[13] it would let users vote on future privacy changes. 'We're making it so that we can't just put in a new terms of service without everyone's permission,' said Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg. 'We think these changes will increase the bonding and trust users place in the service.' But after Facebook further locked in the market, it revoked users' ability to vote on privacy changes. Facebook's course of misleading conduct resulted in precisely the type of harm that antitrust law concerns itself with: the exit of rivals and the subsequent extraction of monopoly rents at the expense of consumer welfare. While deceptive conduct is not usually the concern of antitrust law, it can be a form of anticompetitive behavior[14] in markets that exhibit strong direct network effects. Misleading, deceptive, or otherwise unethical conduct at the early stages can induce market participants to choose the firm that they think increases their welfare, but which actually locks in the market for that firm to their detriment. Under the Sherman Act, the U.S.' antitrust law, it is illegal for companies to willfully acquire monopoly power in a market by engaging in behavior that is anticompetitive\u2014including behavior that is 'unethical' or 'deceptive.' While politicians and regulators grapple with how to make sense of consumer privacy concerns and the power of Big Tech, competition principles explain why Facebook can today extract this exchange from a democratic people\u2014and how it might be stopped from doing so. It is time for regulators, judges, or public policy to remedy this momentous case of bait and switch.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/04/can-antitrust-law-rein-in-facebooks-data-mining-profit-machine.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/04/can-antitrust-law-rein-in-facebooks-data-mining-profit-machine.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> This entry was posted in Free markets and their discontents[15], Guest Post[16], Surveillance state[17], Technology and innovation[18] on April 18, 2019[19] by Yves Smith[20].

If you want to know something, you \"Google it,\" for free, presumably knowing you'll be served targeted advertising. But today's online world isn't only a product of technological progress; it's also the result of any number of legal cases and policy decisions that could easily have gone another way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Imagine a world where, in the early 2000s, Microsoft programmed Internet Explorer, then the dominant browser, so that users who typed in \"Google\" would be sent to MSN Search or see a warning message about Google's privacy policy and an invitation to use Microsoft's product instead. In 2018, this is hard to imagine \u2014 that's not the way the Internet works! But it could have been: At one point the idea was the subject of \"informal conjectures\" at Microsoft, The New York Times recently reported.</p><p>\"Microsoft could have killed Google in the cradle,\" says prominent Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer Gary Reback. Back in the 1990s, Reback spent years helping to convince the Justice Department to file charges against Microsoft, which was then using its dominance of the personal-computer software market to give Internet Explorer an advantage over other browsers. If not for the scrutiny Microsoft faced in antitrust cases in both the United States and Europe, Reback says \u2014 if the government hadn't stepped in to stop the company from disadvantaging competitors \u2014 Google might never have become popular enough to be a verb.</p><p>Or, for that matter, the subject of its own antitrust controversy. Google has grown so fast, partly by buying more than 200 companies, that it has a level of power that policymakers and scholars are only now starting to understand. Over the last few years, Google has been accused of disadvantaging its own competition by using its search engine to steer users toward its other businesses \u2014 to its own local listings instead of Yelp's, for example. Last June, the European Commission fined the company $2.7 billion for this. Google is appealing the decision.</p><p>Google has as much as 90 percent of the search market, and says its algorithms are designed to get users the right information as fast as possible. But it's far more than a search engine, of course. The company controls the most popular online video site (YouTube, which is also the second biggest web site overall, by some measures), the most popular mapping app (Google Maps), and the most popular Web browser (Chrome, which has more than 60 percent of the market). It also owns the most popular mobile operating system, Android, and five of the 10 most popular smartphone apps of 2017. Along with Facebook, it dominates the online advertising business. Other divisions of its parent company, Alphabet Inc., sell Internet access, develop self-driving cars, and invest in life-extension technology.</p><p>US antitrust law was originally developed in the Progressive Era to ensure that sprawling companies with so much market power couldn't use it to choke off competition. Since the 1980s, though, courts have decided antitrust cases mostly based on how the behavior in question would affect consumers \u2014 and especially whether it leads to higher prices. That makes it difficult to deal with Google, since most of its products are free to use.</p><p>Recently, though, there have been signs that antitrust law may shift in a more aggressive direction: The Justice Department tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to stop AT&amp;T's purchase of Time Warner. And a nascent movement led by the Open Markets Institute, a small but influential Washington-based think tank, is trying to reverse several decades of court decisions in order to bring the law back to its Progressive Era roots. Some of those involved call it the \"New Brandeis\" movement, after Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis, an outspoken opponent of monopolies.</p><p>Rather than focus on consumer pricing, or even consumers at all, these New Brandeis thinkers want to preserve competition itself. Some of them are even pressing to separate the divisions of companies that own infrastructure, real or virtual, from those that use it \u2014 so an Internet store that dominates online commerce wouldn't be able to sell so many of its own goods, and a company that dominates search couldn't consistently point users to a suite of sites it also owns. That would mean fundamentally changing the way the Internet works. It could even mean breaking up Google.</p><p>* * *</p><p>For the last couple of decades, American antitrust policy has been a bit of a policy backwater, of interest mostly to academics and economists. \"In law school, when I told people I was interested in antitrust, their eyes would glaze over,\" says Lina Khan, the Open Markets Institute's director of legal policy. Now, according to a January New York Law Journal headline, \"Antitrust is Cool Again.\" That shows how quickly things are changing: Khan, 29, just graduated from Yale Law School last year.</p><p>Khan, who plans to clerk for a federal appellate judge, has already provided a good share of the intellectual fuel for the nascent New Brandeis movement. In January 2017 she published a 24,000-word article in the Yale Law Journal about \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox\" that's been cited in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and dozens of other mainstream publications. In it, Khan argues that the current antitrust standard doesn't deal well with companies like Amazon, which can price goods below cost in order to build market share, then expand into an array of adjacent businesses and build an online infrastructure their rivals depend on that gives them access to the data their transactions generate.</p><p>Khan got interested in the concentration of economic power as an undergrad at Williams College, where she became \"captivated\" by the financial crisis. In 2011, she went to work for Open Markets executive director Barry Lynn, a former journalist who had devoted himself to sounding the alarm about the growing concentration of corporate power, initially in the 2010 book \"Cornered: The New Monopoly Capitalism and the Economics of Destruction.\" Khan, who was born in London and raised there and in suburban Westchester County, N.Y., began her career working for Lynn and writing reported features about business and regulation for the Washington Monthly. Her academic articles are so compelling because she combines factual reporting with historically grounded legal arguments. (\"It's easy to forget,\" she mentions offhand, \"but antitrust was the key issue in the 1912 election.\")</p><p>Khan and her colleagues at Open Markets think the current antitrust standard lets big corporations dominate the industries they're in. \"We've been living through an experiment, and the results are all around us,\" says Khan, who rejoined Lynn's organization after Yale. There are four major US airlines and three major drugstore chains, and mega-retailers like Walmart and Amazon have the power to dictate terms to their suppliers.</p><p>\"Rather than focus on consumer welfare, or any metric,\" Khan says, \"antitrust needs to focus on competition.\" Like other progressive antitrust scholars, Khan \u2014 who's spoken about her ideas with progressive icons Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders \u2014 believes the law needs to serve as a referee to ensure fair competition, not promote lower prices or any other specific outcome.</p><p>These New Brandeis ideas represent a significant departure from the current state of US law, but they would have sounded familiar to the Progressive Era creators of antitrust law. The Sherman Antitrust Act was passed in 1890, to preserve a free market at a time when railroads and banks were consolidating. \"If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life,\" said Senator John Sherman, the law's main author. In 1911, the Supreme Court broke up Standard Oil, which had come to dominate the US energy business through its control of pipelines and railroads. As recently as the 1980s, the breakup of AT&amp;T's telephone monopoly opened up the telecommunications market.</p><p>By then, the shift to more relaxed antitrust enforcement was already well underway. In his 1978 book \"The Antitrust Paradox,\" scholar and judge Robert Bork argued that the tough antitrust policy of the time stood in the way of economic efficiency. He insisted that the Sherman Act demanded a focus on consumer welfare, as expressed through lower prices.</p><p>The Supreme Court soon adopted Bork's approach, which has dominated US legal thinking ever since. Until recently, even Democrats didn't pay much attention to antitrust issues. The Federal Trade Commission closed its investigation of Google in 2013 after the company agreed to fairly minor changes, although an internal report later shared accidentally with The Wall Street Journal recommended taking action in court. As recently as 2015, President Obama implied that European Union regulators were hounding US technology companies because theirs couldn't compete.</p><p>The Open Markets Institute is essentially waging a counter-revolution against Bork's views. \"People say that our ideas are radical, but those are the radical ideas,\" says Lynn. \"We want to get back to the original Jeffersonian ideas behind antitrust laws.\" It's likely to be a long fight.</p><p>Khan argues in \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox\" \u2014 note the riff on Bork's title \u2014 that the current economic models of antitrust don't capture the market power of online platforms that pursue growth over profit in order to become intermediaries their rivals depend on. She pursues this line of thinking further in a forthcoming Columbia Law Review article, \"The Separation of Platforms and Commerce,\" which looks at how competition law dealt with other infrastructure businesses and argues that \"gatekeeper platforms\" limit competition online. She argues that the integration of some platforms gives them \"the ability not only to block access, discriminate, and leverage in the traditional sense, but also to enjoy systemic information advantages that let them extort value from other businesses.\"</p><p>Her conclusion: Dominant companies shouldn't compete directly in commerce with other firms on their own platforms. This would mean that Amazon could sell its own goods, or run a platform for third-party sellers, but not both. The same logic suggests that Google should be broken up, at least to the point that its search business would be separated from some of the other sites to which it refers traffic.</p><p>This idea seems radical \u2014 even to lawyers advocating antitrust enforcement against Google \u2014 since the modern media and technology business is built on an idea of synergy that took hold in the 1990s. But even many lawyers who don't agree with Khan or Open Markets admire the way they've brought vitality to what had become a staid debate. \"I think it's refreshing that people on the left are taking a serious interest in antitrust,\" Reback says.</p><p>When it comes to addressing the power of telecom companies, many Internet policy experts favor some form of net neutrality, since it would prevent broadband giants like Comcast and Verizon from \"picking winners,\" by making some sites load faster or slower. By the same logic, shouldn't Google's search engine also be prevented from picking winners \u2014 that is, promoting its own sites over rivals'?</p><p>Google says it hasn't changed its algorithm in order to disadvantage competitors. (The European Commission found otherwise.) \"Our responsibility is to deliver the best results possible to our users, not specific placements for sites within our results,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement. Google can argue that the changes to its search serve users \u2014 seeing Google Flights when you're looking for air travel is certainly convenient. But such thinking would give the company an open door to use its dominance in search to expand into any number of businesses.</p><p>\"Networks are so important that the government needs to preserve openness and neutrality,\" says Khan, who speaks in the full paragraphs of a law professor but with the energy of a young activist. \"I think of structural separations as achieving the same ends of net neutrality \u2014 we don't want the private entity that controls the infrastructure to pick winners and losers. There are certain core conflicts of interest that need to be addressed through a breakup.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Is antitrust law really so broken? Even skeptics of the big tech platforms worry that changing the current antitrust standard could lead to chaos until courts established a new one. \"Some people say we need to rethink the law, but we could get a lot more out of the law we have,\" says Reback, who represents companies that are pushing for antitrust action against Google.</p><p>Khan and other New Brandeis thinkers see market concentration as a question of economic power that inevitably leads to political influence. They found evidence for this close to home: In August, Lynn was forced out of the New America Foundation, which receives funding from Google, after he praised the EU's decision to fine the company. He immediately set up the Open Markets Institute with most of the same staff. Although the organization has no formal focus on technology issues, Lynn sees them as the most urgent. \"Wal-Mart is a huge problem,\" he says, \"but Google, Facebook, and Amazon represent an immediate threat to our democracy.\"</p><p>To libertarians who believe in the Bork standard, such thinking is just \"hipster antitrust,\" a disparaging nickname for New Brandeis thinking popularized by Joshua Wright, the executive director of the Global Antitrust Institute at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School. (There's even a parody twitter account, @WokeAntitrust, which Khan is hip enough to find amusing.) To Wright, Open Markets' approach represents a return to the bad old days of the 1960s, \"when antitrust was used as a cure-all for societal woes ranging from economic inequality to protecting small businesses,\" he says. \"It is fundamentally a movement to reject economic analysis as a way of guiding an evidence-based policy approach.\"</p><p>Antitrust skeptics argue that the scale and power of Google and other technology companies doesn't mean they're doing anything wrong \u2014 quite the opposite, since they're so popular with consumers. Others say that the New Brandeis movement has come to see antitrust enforcement as a way to tackle issues, like privacy, that should be addressed by legislation. Many also believe that disruptive innovation will always preserve competition more effectively than the government. (The Justice Department's case against Microsoft didn't result in significant sanctions in the end, and many technology executives believe it didn't accomplish much.) Does Google's search engine really give it so much power now that so many consumers access the Internet on smartphones driven by apps? Is it really fair to compare the company to Standard Oil, which controlled its own physical infrastructure? And isn't Google's search engine still vulnerable to the next great innovation, like Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa?</p><p>Maybe. But Google and other technology giants buy up a lot of potential competitors. And the way that consumer technology companies market convenience seems to reinforce their dominance. Ask Alexa to play a song and, under the default setting, it will go to Amazon's music service unless the user specifies otherwise. (That setting can be changed so it automatically plays music from another service.) What makes the issue especially thorny is that this kind of simplicity also makes technology more valuable to consumers. Does Amazon program Alexa this way to make it easier to use or to give its own products an advantage? The answer is yes.</p><p>For more than a decade, Google has shaped the way online commerce works in similar \u2014 but often subtle \u2014 ways. Until October, for example, the company prioritized search results for newspapers and other publications that allowed users to read an initial article without paying, under a program called \"first click free.\" Newspapers faced pressure to make their paywalls work a certain way, or get listed lower in Google's search results.</p><p>Likewise in February, Google launched an ad blocker in Chrome that filtered out some of the more annoying kinds of online ads. Search results that consumers can access for free may be more useful, and it's hard to find defenders of intrusive pop-up ads. Still, it's clear that Google is guiding the Internet economy according to its own preferences. What company wants to sell ads in a format that the most popular web browser will block?</p><p>The growing influence of Google and other tech giants fuels further consolidation. Companies that have to negotiate with them inevitably want to bulk up to get more leverage themselves \u2014 which was one reason AT&amp;T gave for its proposed purchase of Time Warner \u2014 but that inevitably gives a few big companies even more power.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The most immediate question about the future of US antitrust law isn't how the theoretical debate gets resolved \u2014 it's how long it remains theoretical. The tech giants are facing pressure, and not just from the left.</p><p>Last month Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin suggested that the Justice Department should look into the power of companies like Google. Missouri's Republican attorney general opened an investigation into Google last fall. The Federal Trade Commission has been urged to reopen its inquiry. Meanwhile, the European Commission is pursuing two other inquiries into how the company uses its Android and AdSearch platforms.</p><p>Any antitrust case brought in the United States \u2014 and this is a question of if, rather than when \u2014 could take a very long time to produce a fairly modest outcome. But just the decision to open a case could give Google an incentive to create some space for competition. It could also be one of the only ways to limit the power of Internet giants at a time when Congress is too divided to get much done. \"People like me see antitrust as law enforcement, not regulation,\" Reback says. \"It's the free-market alternative to regulation.\"</p><p>For a long time, tech platforms didn't face much regulatory scrutiny, since they presented themselves \u2014 often accurately \u2014 as disruptors of established businesses. But the fact that technological change is both inevitable and desirable doesn't mean that the Internet was preordained to work as it currently does. Right now, the role of referee isn't played by antitrust law but by giant technology platforms \u2014 even as they also compete on the field.</p><p>\"This story is told as a technology story, but it's also a market power story \u2014 these companies are pioneers, so people tend to conflate them with the technology,\" Khan says. \"But when they talk about airlines, they know that air service is a huge boon, but airlines still need to be regulated in some ways. This is partially about imagining alternatives.\"</p><p>By Robert Levine</p><p>Robert Levine is the author of \"Free Ride: How Digital Parasites Are Destroying the Culture Business, and How the Culture Business Can Fight Back.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-9842a856-68e2-11e8-808f-692041aa6de8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SK7-G4R1-DYHJ-335S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3233\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 17, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Marchers, dressed all in yellow, carried purple lotus plants, yin-yang symbols, and other traditional Buddhist icons. But it was their giant banners, held aloft or mounted on small floats, that indicated this was not just a religious rally. \"Keep away from the Chinese Communist Party. Stop the persecution of Falun Gong.\" A religious movement that emerged in China in the mid-1990s, Falun Gong surged in popularity nationwide before it was banned and brutally suppressed on the mainland in 1999. But it continues to operate in Hong Kong thanks to the territory's greater human rights protections. For decades now, Falun Gong protests against the Chinese government have been a common sight on the city's streets, with practitioners setting up gory mock surgery scenes to raise awareness about , and handing out free copies of the Falun Gong-linked newspaper, Epoch Times. Protesters have also targeted Chinese politicians and offices in the city, and regularly take part in mass anti-government rallies and marches. A woman watches as supporters of the Falun Gong spiritual group, banned in mainland China, take part in a march in Hong Kong on April 27, 2019, to observe the 20th anniversary of a large demonstration in Beijing which led to a crackdown against the movement. Crossing the border by bus from China and seeing Falun Gong practitioners handing out anti-Communist Party leaflets was once one of the most visible signs of Hong Kong's relative autonomy from Beijing. All that could soon be deemed illegal under a sweeping new security law passed by China for Hong Kong last month that criminalized \"acts of secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities, and collusion with foreign or external forces to endanger national security.\" Similar laws in China have been used to go after Falun Gong practitioners, which Beijing denounces as an \"evil cult\" that \"preaches heretical fallacies that are anti-humanity and anti-science\" through the control of people's minds. Falun Gong practitioners reject these charges and maintain they have been unfairly targeted and suppressed by the Chinese authorities. Thousands of Falun Gong practitioners are believed to be held \"at various prisons and extralegal detention centers\" in mainland China, according to Washington-based rights group Freedom House -- an accusation Beijing also denies. \"The new National Security Law will act like a sharp knife hanging over the (association) and the heads of every Falun Gong practitioner in Hong Kong,\" said Ingrid Wu, spokeswoman for the Hong KongFalun Dafa Association. \"We are very concerned.\" Hong Kong officials have claimed the new law is necessary and will only affect a handful of individuals. In early July, Chief Executive Carrie Lam pushed back against the suggestion the law would undermine people's freedoms. \"The legal principles that we attach a lot of importance to, like presumption of innocence and no retrospective effect and so on, are being upheld,\" she said. \"Instead of spreading fear, the law will actually remove fear and let Hong Kong people return to a normal, peaceful life.\" A government spokeswoman did not respond to emailed questions about concerns regarding religious freedom under the law. Hong Kong has long been a safe haven for entities which could never operate in China, from banned religious movements and labor rights NGOs, to big tech firms blocked by the Great Firewall. The fate of groups like Falun Gong -- fierce opponents of Beijing who, while not the immediate targets of the law still come within its broad remit -- will test those assurances to the hilt. Falun Gong practitioners have long been a vocal and organized part of Hong Kong's broader anti-government movement. New age religion Founded by Li Hongzhi in northeastern China in the early 1990s, Falun Gong blends traditional Chinese qigong practices and new age beliefs. It was once promoted by the Chinese government and state media as part of a nationwide qigong craze, but as Falun Gong grew in size, attracting millions of followers, the authorities turned on the group. Li encouraged a blistering public relations strategy in a bid to win over the critics, and between 1996 and 1999, the group staged some 300 protests and demonstrations, historian David Ownby writes in \"Falun Gong and the Future of China.\" This culminated in an audacious, and strategically disastrous, demonstration around central government headquarters in Beijing involving around 10,000 practitioners. It was the biggest protest the capital had seen since the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, and was the beginning of the end for Falun Gong in China. The protesters in Beijing were calling for the removal of restrictions placed on the faith, but the Chinese authorities responded with a massive crackdown and huge propaganda push demonizing Falun Gong. \"I was shocked,\" said Rose, a Hong Kong-based Falun Gong practitioner. \"I had friends who were traveling between Hong Kong and Beijing, they told me a crackdown was about to take place, but I said this was impossible, Falun Gong was just a belief, nothing political.\" Originally from mainland China, Rose began practicing Falun Gong after moving to Hong Kong in the late 1990s. CNN is withholding her full name due to fears of prosecution under the new security law. Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi seen in New York in 1999. He left China several years before the group was banned there. After Falun Gong was banned, Rose's husband and several of her close friends urged her to keep a low profile, to just do her exercises and readings at home. But she was sure there had been some sort of mistake, and so, just has her fellow practitioners had done in Beijing, she sought to appeal to the government, to make the case for Falun Gong. \"A group of us went to the Liaison Office,\" she said. \"But no one came out, we stayed there for 24 hours.\" The Liaison Office is the Chinese government's Hong Kong headquarters, long a symbol of Beijing's influence over the city. Days turned into weeks, then months. Every day, Rose and a small group of fellow practitioners gathered outside the office on 160 Connaught Road to attempt to have their message heard. One day the protesters were joined by a group of Swiss practitioners who had originally hoped to travel to Beijing to protest but were denied visas. Police attempted to remove the group, which, according to court documents never numbered more than 16, and was \"peaceful and largely static.\" Police moved to clear the protest, however, and charged the Falun Gong protesters with obstruction, among other offenses. The case eventually wound up at the Court of Final Appeals, where Hong Kong's top justices ruled strongly in favor of the right to protest and use \"reasonable force to resist being subjected to unlawful detention.\" The case was a major victory not just for Falun Gong but for anti-government protesters in general, securing -- until last year's anti-government protests -- the right to stage protests outside the Liaison Office. A woman adjusts banners in support of Falun Gong in Tung Chung, an area popular with tourists from the mainland, in Hong Kong on April 25, 2019. New restrictions While Falun Gong practitioners are not the primary target of the new security law -- which is at times clearly designed to criminalize acts seen during last year's anti-government protests -- they and other groups like them could still fall foul of its broad remit. In particular, the new offense of subversion makes it illegal in many circumstances to advocate \"overthrowing the body of central power of the People's Republic of China.\" Given that the PRC government is indelibly intertwined with the Communist Party, Falun Gong efforts to get people to quit the Communist Party in protest, or otherwise harm its activities, could be deemed criminal. The new crime of \"collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\" could also be used to target Falun Gong. While not a top-down religion like the Catholic Church or other similar faiths with large numbers of followers in Hong Kong, Falun Gong is headquartered in the United States, where Li Hongzhi has lived since 1996, and this is where the group's main media and lobbying arms are also located. Under Article 29 of the new law, anyone who \"conspires with a foreign country or an institution, organization or individual outside (China), or directly or indirectly receives instructions, control, funding or other kinds of support\" from such organizations, could be prosecuted if they are found to be \"provoking by unlawful means hatred among Hong Kong residents towards the Central People's Government or the Government of the Region, which is likely to cause serious consequences.\" Pedestrians walk past banners criticising the Falun Gong spiritual movement displayed along a pavement in Causeway Bay, a popular shopping district, in Hong Kong on April 25, 2019. With initial prosecutions under the security law all related to recent protests, Falun Gong practitioners could find themselves -- if the law's critics are correct -- being a test case of another sort, an expansion of the law's remit to ban activities that have long been verboten on the mainland. \"How the situation of Falun Gong practitioners in Hong Kong evolves in the coming months and how much of the repression leaks over from the mainland is a very important space to watch,\" said Sarah Cook, a senior research analyst at Freedom House and author of \"The Battle for China's Spirit: Religious Revival, Repression, and Resistance under Xi Jinping.\" Outside of the protest movement, Falun Gong is among the most vocal and visible opposition to the Communist Party, in both Hong Kong and elsewhere around the world. While the group is somewhat detached from the mainstream opposition in Hong Kong due to its conservative religious beliefs, this has not stopped its presence in the city being symbolic, and many followers take a sort of pride that even Falun Gong can operate in Hong Kong, given the huge antipathy Beijing has towards the group. \"The ability of people in Hong Kong to practice Falun Gong legally and openly is important both symbolically and practically,\" said Erping Zhang, a US-based spokesman for the group. Zhang said that as well as the new crimes created under the law, he was concerned about the broad rights it gives Chinese security services to operate in Hong Kong, even extending Chinese jurisdiction over certain cases and allowing people to be taken for trial on the mainland. \"It could truly take a horrific toll on Falun Gong practitioners in Hong Kong and create huge losses for those who have benefited from the practice and activists' awareness raising activities,\" he said. Cook, the Freedom House researcher, said that any curtailment of Falun Gong in the city \"would be a bad sign and a potentially worrying precursor to a crackdown on the broader religious community in Hong Kong.\" \"Within China we've sign time and again since 1999 how the rules, tactics, and even security forces initially created to persecute Falun Gong are then expanded to other targets,\" she added. \"It may only be a matter of time before we see that in Hong Kong too, unfortunately.\" But not all religious groups are alarmed. In a letter to the religious newspaper Church Times this month, Paul Kwong, Archbishop of Hong Kong, praised the new security law and pushed back against criticism from figures including Cardinal Maung Bo, president of the Asian Bishops' Conferences. \"Many critics do not accept the fact that we are part of China,\" Kwong said. \"They only emphasize two systems, not one country. I cherish our Hong Kong freedoms -- in particular the freedom of religion and way of life -- as much as anyone, and I don't think this law will change any of that. I am also proud to be living in China.\" A Falun Gong activist (left) holds a sign next to men from a mailand Chinese tour group in the Kowloon district of Hong Kong on January 6, 2019. Freedom of speech Numerous concerns have been raised about the new law's potential effects on freedom of speech in Hong Kong, with people already moving to scrub their social media and remove posters and pamphlets criticizing the government from shops and restaurants. Media groups have expressed alarm about the law, with the Foreign Correspondents' Club writing to the city's leader Lam \"seeking clarity on specific areas where the new law is vague and where terms are undefined, particularly regarding the press and freedom of speech.\" Lam previously said \"the law has clearly defined the four types of acts and activities which we need to prevent, curb and punish in accordance with the law.\" \"If the Foreign Correspondents' Club or all reporters in Hong Kong can give me a 100% guarantee that they will not commit any offenses under this piece of national legislation, then I can do the same,\" she added. Here again, Falun Gong may find themselves at the inadvertent frontlines of Hong Kong's battle for civil liberties. During a recent protest against the law on July 1, Falun Gong practitioners could be seen handing out flyers saying \"Heaven will destroy the Chinese Communist Party\" as well as copies of Epoch Times. The newspaper, which was founded by Falun Gong practitioners and remains closely linked to the group, is one of the most vocally anti-government publications in the city. Its Chinese edition refers to the coronavirus as the \"Chinese Communist Party virus,\" has called on the West to \"fight back\" against the Party, and regularly publishes stinging critiques of Beijing. Representatives for Epoch Times in Hong Kong and New York did not respond to a request for comment. Like Apple Daily, a pro-democracy tabloid owned by tycoon Jimmy Lai, currently facing charges related to last year's protests, Epoch Times could be a canary in the coal mine for Hong Kong's media freedoms. Both papers have cultivated influence in Washington -- something that could both help or harm them, leading to politicians speaking out in their defense, but also Beijing casting them as colluding with foreign forces. Lai has long been close to Republican Party politicians, leading to claims of his being a foreign agent in Chinese state media, while the English edition of the Epoch Times since 2016 has aggressively targeted Trump voters, with opinion content taking on an increasingly right-wing stance. In 2019, the paper was barred by Facebook from running ads on its platform, after finding it violated the company's policies with pro-Trump campaigns. Falun Gong members meditate as policemen watch demonstrators during a pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong on May 18, 2016. Uncertain future Hong Kong and Beijing officials have repeatedly claimed that the security law is both necessary and restrained, and will only affect a tiny handful of individuals in the city, mainly violent separatists. Paraphrasing former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher about Hong Kong's success after China took control, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said this week that under the new law \"horses will run faster, stocks will be more sizzling, and dancers will dance more happily.\" But with moves to ban books and expand police powers of surveillance and censorship, the scope of the law would appear to be expanding. Falun Gong practitioners, as well as many other groups in Hong Kong opposed to Beijing, may not immediately feel the sting of the new regulations, but they were poised for the worse. After years of suppression in China, however, the group is better prepared than most for how to function behind the scenes, even if that will require a complete overhaul of its Hong Kong operation. Zhang, the US-based spokesman, said that within China still, people \"continue to practice Falun Gong in private and many go out and discretely disseminate information to help other Chinese see through the CCP's lies and cover-ups.\" Many practitioners in Hong Kong are in the city because they fled China, and Wu, the local spokeswoman said some may choose to go overseas should the law target them. \"The Falun Gong community is diverse; each person makes their own decision based on their family and other situations,\" she said. \"But most of Falun Gong practitioners that I know plan to stay in Hong Kong. We feel it is our responsibility to continue our peaceful efforts of raising awareness of the persecution and calling for justice, and tell the world what is happening in Hong Kong.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Marchers, dressed all in yellow, carried purple lotus plants, yin-yang symbols, and other traditional Buddhist icons. But it was their giant banners, held aloft or mounted on small floats, that indicated this was not just a religious rally. \"Keep away from the Chinese Communist Party. Stop the persecution of Falun Gong.\" A religious movement that emerged in China in the mid-1990s, Falun Gong surged in popularity nationwide before it was banned and brutally suppressed on the mainland in 1999. But it continues to operate in Hong Kong thanks to the territory's greater human rights protections. For decades now, Falun Gong protests against the Chinese government have been a common sight on the city's streets, with practitioners setting up gory mock surgery scenes to raise awareness about , and handing out free copies of the Falun Gong-linked newspaper, Epoch Times. Protesters have also targeted Chinese politicians and offices in the city, and regularly take part in mass anti-government rallies and marches. A woman watches as supporters of the Falun Gong spiritual group, banned in mainland China, take part in a march in Hong Kong on April 27, 2019, to observe the 20th anniversary of a large demonstration in Beijing which led to a crackdown against the movement. Crossing the border by bus from China and seeing Falun Gong practitioners handing out anti-Communist Party leaflets was once one of the most visible signs of Hong Kong's relative autonomy from Beijing. All that could soon be deemed illegal under a sweeping new security law passed by China for Hong Kong last month that criminalized \"acts of secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities, and collusion with foreign or external forces to endanger national security.\" Similar laws in China have been used to go after Falun Gong practitioners, which Beijing denounces as an \"evil cult\" that \"preaches heretical fallacies that are anti-humanity and anti-science\" through the control of people's minds. Falun Gong practitioners reject these charges and maintain they have been unfairly targeted and suppressed by the Chinese authorities. Thousands of Falun Gong practitioners are believed to be held \"at various prisons and extralegal detention centers\" in mainland China, according to Washington-based rights group Freedom House -- an accusation Beijing also denies. \"The new National Security Law will act like a sharp knife hanging over the (association) and the heads of every Falun Gong practitioner in Hong Kong,\" said Ingrid Wu, spokeswoman for the Hong KongFalun Dafa Association. \"We are very concerned.\" Hong Kong officials have claimed the new law is necessary and will only affect a handful of individuals. In early July, Chief Executive Carrie Lam pushed back against the suggestion the law would undermine people's freedoms. \"The legal principles that we attach a lot of importance to, like presumption of innocence and no retrospective effect and so on, are being upheld,\" she said. \"Instead of spreading fear, the law will actually remove fear and let Hong Kong people return to a normal, peaceful life.\" A government spokeswoman did not respond to emailed questions about concerns regarding religious freedom under the law. Hong Kong has long been a safe haven for entities which could never operate in China, from banned religious movements and labor rights NGOs, to big tech firms blocked by the Great Firewall. The fate of groups like Falun Gong -- fierce opponents of Beijing who, while not the immediate targets of the law still come within its broad remit -- will test those assurances to the hilt. Falun Gong practitioners have long been a vocal and organized part of Hong Kong's broader anti-government movement. New age religion Founded by Li Hongzhi in northeastern China in the early 1990s, Falun Gong blends traditional Chinese qigong practices and new age beliefs. It was once promoted by the Chinese government and state media as part of a nationwide qigong craze, but as Falun Gong grew in size, attracting millions of followers, the authorities turned on the group. Li encouraged a blistering public relations strategy in a bid to win over the critics, and between 1996 and 1999, the group staged some 300 protests and demonstrations, historian David Ownby writes in \"Falun Gong and the Future of China.\" This culminated in an audacious, and strategically disastrous, demonstration around central government headquarters in Beijing involving around 10,000 practitioners. It was the biggest protest the capital had seen since the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, and was the beginning of the end for Falun Gong in China. The protesters in Beijing were calling for the removal of restrictions placed on the faith, but the Chinese authorities responded with a massive crackdown and huge propaganda push demonizing Falun Gong. \"I was shocked,\" said Rose, a Hong Kong-based Falun Gong practitioner. \"I had friends who were traveling between Hong Kong and Beijing, they told me a crackdown was about to take place, but I said this was impossible, Falun Gong was just a belief, nothing political.\" Originally from mainland China, Rose began practicing Falun Gong after moving to Hong Kong in the late 1990s. CNN is withholding her full name due to fears of prosecution under the new security law. Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi seen in New York in 1999. He left China several years before the group was banned there. After Falun Gong was banned, Rose's husband and several of her close friends urged her to keep a low profile, to just do her exercises and readings at home. But she was sure there had been some sort of mistake, and so, just has her fellow practitioners had done in Beijing, she sought to appeal to the government, to make the case for Falun Gong. \"A group of us went to the Liaison Office,\" she said. \"But no one came out, we stayed there for 24 hours.\" The Liaison Office is the Chinese government's Hong Kong headquarters, long a symbol of Beijing's influence over the city. Days turned into weeks, then months. Every day, Rose and a small group of fellow practitioners gathered outside the office on 160 Connaught Road to attempt to have their message heard. One day the protesters were joined by a group of Swiss practitioners who had originally hoped to travel to Beijing to protest but were denied visas. Police attempted to remove the group, which, according to court documents never numbered more than 16, and was \"peaceful and largely static.\" Police moved to clear the protest, however, and charged the Falun Gong protesters with obstruction, among other offenses. The case eventually wound up at the Court of Final Appeals, where Hong Kong's top justices ruled strongly in favor of the right to protest and use \"reasonable force to resist being subjected to unlawful detention.\" The case was a major victory not just for Falun Gong but for anti-government protesters in general, securing -- until last year's anti-government protests -- the right to stage protests outside the Liaison Office. A woman adjusts banners in support of Falun Gong in Tung Chung, an area popular with tourists from the mainland, in Hong Kong on April 25, 2019. New restrictions While Falun Gong practitioners are not the primary target of the new security law -- which is at times clearly designed to criminalize acts seen during last year's anti-government protests -- they and other groups like them could still fall foul of its broad remit. In particular, the new offense of subversion makes it illegal in many circumstances to advocate \"overthrowing the body of central power of the People's Republic of China.\" Given that the PRC government is indelibly intertwined with the Communist Party, Falun Gong efforts to get people to quit the Communist Party in protest, or otherwise harm its activities, could be deemed criminal. The new crime of \"collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\" could also be used to target Falun Gong. While not a top-down religion like the Catholic Church or other similar faiths with large numbers of followers in Hong Kong, Falun Gong is headquartered in the United States, where Li Hongzhi has lived since 1996, and this is where the group's main media and lobbying arms are also located. Under Article 29 of the new law, anyone who \"conspires with a foreign country or an institution, organization or individual outside (China), or directly or indirectly receives instructions, control, funding or other kinds of support\" from such organizations, could be prosecuted if they are found to be \"provoking by unlawful means hatred among Hong Kong residents towards the Central People's Government or the Government of the Region, which is likely to cause serious consequences.\" Pedestrians walk past banners criticising the Falun Gong spiritual movement displayed along a pavement in Causeway Bay, a popular shopping district, in Hong Kong on April 25, 2019. With initial prosecutions under the security law all related to recent protests, Falun Gong practitioners could find themselves -- if the law's critics are correct -- being a test case of another sort, an expansion of the law's remit to ban activities that have long been verboten on the mainland. \"How the situation of Falun Gong practitioners in Hong Kong evolves in the coming months and how much of the repression leaks over from the mainland is a very important space to watch,\" said Sarah Cook, a senior research analyst at Freedom House and author of \"The Battle for China's Spirit: Religious Revival, Repression, and Resistance under Xi Jinping.\" Outside of the protest movement, Falun Gong is among the most vocal and visible opposition to the Communist Party, in both Hong Kong and elsewhere around the world. While the group is somewhat detached from the mainstream opposition in Hong Kong due to its conservative religious beliefs, this has not stopped its presence in the city being symbolic, and many followers take a sort of pride that even Falun Gong can operate in Hong Kong, given the huge antipathy Beijing has towards the group. \"The ability of people in Hong Kong to practice Falun Gong legally and openly is important both symbolically and practically,\" said Erping Zhang, a US-based spokesman for the group. Zhang said that as well as the new crimes created under the law, he was concerned about the broad rights it gives Chinese security services to operate in Hong Kong, even extending Chinese jurisdiction over certain cases and allowing people to be taken for trial on the mainland. \"It could truly take a horrific toll on Falun Gong practitioners in Hong Kong and create huge losses for those who have benefited from the practice and activists' awareness raising activities,\" he said. Cook, the Freedom House researcher, said that any curtailment of Falun Gong in the city \"would be a bad sign and a potentially worrying precursor to a crackdown on the broader religious community in Hong Kong.\" \"Within China we've sign time and again since 1999 how the rules, tactics, and even security forces initially created to persecute Falun Gong are then expanded to other targets,\" she added. \"It may only be a matter of time before we see that in Hong Kong too, unfortunately.\" But not all religious groups are alarmed. In a letter to the religious newspaper Church Times this month, Paul Kwong, Archbishop of Hong Kong, praised the new security law and pushed back against criticism from figures including Cardinal Maung Bo, president of the Asian Bishops' Conferences. \"Many critics do not accept the fact that we are part of China,\" Kwong said. \"They only emphasize two systems, not one country. I cherish our Hong Kong freedoms -- in particular the freedom of religion and way of life -- as much as anyone, and I don't think this law will change any of that. I am also proud to be living in China.\" A Falun Gong activist (left) holds a sign next to men from a mailand Chinese tour group in the Kowloon district of Hong Kong on January 6, 2019. Freedom of speech Numerous concerns have been raised about the new law's potential effects on freedom of speech in Hong Kong, with people already moving to scrub their social media and remove posters and pamphlets criticizing the government from shops and restaurants. Media groups have expressed alarm about the law, with the Foreign Correspondents' Club writing to the city's leader Lam \"seeking clarity on specific areas where the new law is vague and where terms are undefined, particularly regarding the press and freedom of speech.\" Lam previously said \"the law has clearly defined the four types of acts and activities which we need to prevent, curb and punish in accordance with the law.\" \"If the Foreign Correspondents' Club or all reporters in Hong Kong can give me a 100% guarantee that they will not commit any offenses under this piece of national legislation, then I can do the same,\" she added. Here again, Falun Gong may find themselves at the inadvertent frontlines of Hong Kong's battle for civil liberties. During a recent protest against the law on July 1, Falun Gong practitioners could be seen handing out flyers saying \"Heaven will destroy the Chinese Communist Party\" as well as copies of Epoch Times. The newspaper, which was founded by Falun Gong practitioners and remains closely linked to the group, is one of the most vocally anti-government publications in the city. Its Chinese edition refers to the coronavirus as the \"Chinese Communist Party virus,\" has called on the West to \"fight back\" against the Party, and regularly publishes stinging critiques of Beijing. Representatives for Epoch Times in Hong Kong and New York did not respond to a request for comment. Like Apple Daily, a pro-democracy tabloid owned by tycoon Jimmy Lai, currently facing charges related to last year's protests, Epoch Times could be a canary in the coal mine for Hong Kong's media freedoms. Both papers have cultivated influence in Washington -- something that could both help or harm them, leading to politicians speaking out in their defense, but also Beijing casting them as colluding with foreign forces. Lai has long been close to Republican Party politicians, leading to claims of his being a foreign agent in Chinese state media, while the English edition of the Epoch Times since 2016 has aggressively targeted Trump voters, with opinion content taking on an increasingly right-wing stance. In 2019, the paper was barred by Facebook from running ads on its platform, after finding it violated the company's policies with pro-Trump campaigns. Falun Gong members meditate as policemen watch demonstrators during a pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong on May 18, 2016. Uncertain future Hong Kong and Beijing officials have repeatedly claimed that the security law is both necessary and restrained, and will only affect a tiny handful of individuals in the city, mainly violent separatists. Paraphrasing former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher about Hong Kong's success after China took control, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said this week that under the new law \"horses will run faster, stocks will be more sizzling, and dancers will dance more happily.\" But with moves to ban books and expand police powers of surveillance and censorship, the scope of the law would appear to be expanding. Falun Gong practitioners, as well as many other groups in Hong Kong opposed to Beijing, may not immediately feel the sting of the new regulations, but they were poised for the worse. After years of suppression in China, however, the group is better prepared than most for how to function behind the scenes, even if that will require a complete overhaul of its Hong Kong operation. Zhang, the US-based spokesman, said that within China still, people \"continue to practice Falun Gong in private and many go out and discretely disseminate information to help other Chinese see through the CCP's lies and cover-ups.\" Many practitioners in Hong Kong are in the city because they fled China, and Wu, the local spokeswoman said some may choose to go overseas should the law target them. \"The Falun Gong community is diverse; each person makes their own decision based on their family and other situations,\" she said. \"But most of Falun Gong practitioners that I know plan to stay in Hong Kong. We feel it is our responsibility to continue our peaceful efforts of raising awareness of the persecution and calling for justice, and tell the world what is happening in Hong Kong.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

But it continues to operate in Hong Kong thanks to the territory's greater human rights protections. </p><p>For decades now, Falun Gong protests against the Chinese government have been a common sight on the city's streets, with practitioners setting up gory mock surgery scenes to raise awareness about allegations of organ harvesting, and handing out free copies of the Falun Gong-linked newspaper, Epoch Times. Protesters have also targeted Chinese politicians and offices in the city, and regularly take part in mass anti-government rallies and marches. </p><p>Crossing the border by bus from China and seeing Falun Gong practitioners handing out anti-Communist Party leaflets was once one of the most visible signs of Hong Kong's relative autonomy from Beijing. </p><p>All that could soon be deemed illegal under a sweeping new security law passed by China for Hong Kong last month that criminalized \"acts of secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities, and collusion with foreign or external forces to endanger national security.\"</p><p>Similar laws in China have been used to go after Falun Gong practitioners, which Beijing denounces as an \"evil cult\" that \"preaches heretical fallacies that are anti-humanity and anti-science\" through the control of people's minds.</p><p>Falun Gong practitioners reject these charges and maintain they have been unfairly targeted and suppressed by the Chinese authorities. Thousands of Falun Gong practitioners are believed to be held \"at various prisons and extralegal detention centers\" in mainland China, according to Washington-based rights group Freedom House -- an accusation Beijing also denies. </p><p>\"The new National Security Law will act like a sharp knife hanging over the (association) and the heads of every Falun Gong practitioner in Hong Kong,\" said Ingrid Wu, spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Falun Dafa Association. \"We are very concerned.\" </p><p>Hong Kong officials have claimed the new law is necessary and will only affect a handful of individuals. In early July, Chief Executive Carrie Lam pushed back against the suggestion the law would undermine people's freedoms. </p><p>\"The legal principles that we attach a lot of importance to, like presumption of innocence and no retrospective effect and so on, are being upheld,\" she said. \"Instead of spreading fear, the law will actually remove fear and let Hong Kong people return to a normal, peaceful life.\"</p><p>A government spokeswoman did not respond to emailed questions about concerns regarding religious freedom under the law. </p><p>Hong Kong has long been a safe haven for entities which could never operate in China, from banned religious movements and labor rights NGOs, to big tech firms blocked by the Great Firewall. The fate of groups like Falun Gong -- fierce opponents of Beijing who, while not the immediate targets of the law still come within its broad remit -- will test those assurances to the hilt.</p><p>New age religion </p><p>Founded by Li Hongzhi in northeastern China in the early 1990s, Falun Gong blends traditional Chinese qigong practices and new age beliefs. It was once promoted by the Chinese government and state media as part of a nationwide qigong craze, but as Falun Gong grew in size, attracting millions of followers, the authorities turned on the group. </p><p>Li encouraged a blistering public relations strategy in a bid to win over the critics, and between 1996 and 1999, the group staged some 300 protests and demonstrations, historian David Ownby writes in \"Falun Gong and the Future of China.\" </p><p>This culminated in an audacious, and strategically disastrous, demonstration around central government headquarters in Beijing involving around 10,000 practitioners. It was the biggest protest the capital had seen since the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, and was the beginning of the end for Falun Gong in China. </p><p>The protesters in Beijing were calling for the removal of restrictions placed on the faith, but the Chinese authorities responded with a massive crackdown and huge propaganda push demonizing Falun Gong. </p><p>\"I was shocked,\" said Rose, a Hong Kong-based Falun Gong practitioner. \"I had friends who were traveling between Hong Kong and Beijing, they told me a crackdown was about to take place, but I said this was impossible, Falun Gong was just a belief, nothing political.\" </p><p>Originally from mainland China, Rose began practicing Falun Gong after moving to Hong Kong in the late 1990s. CNN is withholding her full name due to fears of prosecution under the new security law. </p><p>After Falun Gong was banned, Rose's husband and several of her close friends urged her to keep a low profile, to just do her exercises and readings at home. But she was sure there had been some sort of mistake, and so, just has her fellow practitioners had done in Beijing, she sought to appeal to the government, to make the case for Falun Gong. </p><p>\"A group of us went to the Liaison Office,\" she said. \"But no one came out, we stayed there for 24 hours.\" </p><p>The Liaison Office is the Chinese government's Hong Kong headquarters, long a symbol of Beijing's influence over the city.</p><p>Days turned into weeks, then months. Every day, Rose and a small group of fellow practitioners gathered outside the office on 160 Connaught Road to attempt to have their message heard. </p><p>One day the protesters were joined by a group of Swiss practitioners who had originally hoped to travel to Beijing to protest but were denied visas. Police attempted to remove the group, which, according to court documents never numbered more than 16, and was \"peaceful and largely static.\" </p><p>Police moved to clear the protest, however, and charged the Falun Gong protesters with obstruction, among other offenses. The case eventually wound up at the Court of Final Appeals, where Hong Kong's top justices ruled strongly in favor of the right to protest and use \"reasonable force to resist being subjected to unlawful detention.\" </p><p>The case was a major victory not just for Falun Gong but for anti-government protesters in general, securing -- until last year's anti-government protests -- the right to stage protests outside the Liaison Office. </p><p>New restrictions </p><p>While Falun Gong practitioners are not the primary target of the new security law -- which is at times clearly designed to criminalize acts seen during last year's anti-government protests -- they and other groups like them could still fall foul of its broad remit. </p><p>In particular, the new offense of subversion makes it illegal in many circumstances to advocate \"overthrowing the body of central power of the People's Republic of China.\" Given that the PRC government is indelibly intertwined with the Communist Party, Falun Gong efforts to get people to quit the Communist Party in protest, or otherwise harm its activities, could be deemed criminal. </p><p>The new crime of \"collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\" could also be used to target Falun Gong. While not a top-down religion like the Catholic Church or other similar faiths with large numbers of followers in Hong Kong, Falun Gong is headquartered in the United States, where Li Hongzhi has lived since 1996, and this is where the group's main media and lobbying arms are also located. </p><p>Under Article 29 of the new law, anyone who \"conspires with a foreign country or an institution, organization or individual outside (China), or directly or indirectly receives instructions, control, funding or other kinds of support\" from such organizations, could be prosecuted if they are found to be \"provoking by unlawful means hatred among Hong Kong residents towards the Central People's Government or the Government of the Region, which is likely to cause serious consequences.\" </p><p>With initial prosecutions under the security law all related to recent protests, Falun Gong practitioners could find themselves -- if the law's critics are correct -- being a test case of another sort, an expansion of the law's remit to ban activities that have long been verboten on the mainland. </p><p>\"How the situation of Falun Gong practitioners in Hong Kong evolves in the coming months and how much of the repression leaks over from the mainland is a very important space to watch,\" said Sarah Cook, a senior research analyst at Freedom House and author of \"The Battle for China's Spirit: Religious Revival, Repression, and Resistance under Xi Jinping.\" </p><p>Outside of the protest movement, Falun Gong is among the most vocal and visible opposition to the Communist Party, in both Hong Kong and elsewhere around the world. While the group is somewhat detached from the mainstream opposition in Hong Kong due to its conservative religious beliefs, this has not stopped its presence in the city being symbolic, and many followers take a sort of pride that even Falun Gong can operate in Hong Kong, given the huge antipathy Beijing has towards the group. </p><p>\"The ability of people in Hong Kong to practice Falun Gong legally and openly is important both symbolically and practically,\" said Erping Zhang, a US-based spokesman for the group. </p><p>Zhang said that as well as the new crimes created under the law, he was concerned about the broad rights it gives Chinese security services to operate in Hong Kong, even extending Chinese jurisdiction over certain cases and allowing people to be taken for trial on the mainland. </p><p>\"It could truly take a horrific toll on Falun Gong practitioners in Hong Kong and create huge losses for those who have benefited from the practice and activists' awareness raising activities,\" he said. </p><p>Cook, the Freedom House researcher, said that any curtailment of Falun Gong in the city \"would be a bad sign and a potentially worrying precursor to a crackdown on the broader religious community in Hong Kong.\" </p><p>\"Within China we've sign time and again since 1999 how the rules, tactics, and even security forces initially created to persecute Falun Gong are then expanded to other targets,\" she added. \"It may only be a matter of time before we see that in Hong Kong too, unfortunately.\" </p><p>But not all religious groups are alarmed. In a letter to the religious newspaper Church Times this month, Paul Kwong, Archbishop of Hong Kong, praised the new security law and pushed back against criticism from figures including Cardinal Maung Bo, president of the Asian Bishops' Conferences. </p><p>\"Many critics do not accept the fact that we are part of China,\" Kwong said. \"They only emphasize two systems, not one country. I cherish our Hong Kong freedoms -- in particular the freedom of religion and way of life -- as much as anyone, and I don't think this law will change any of that. I am also proud to be living in China.\"</p><p>Freedom of speech</p><p>Numerous concerns have been raised about the new law's potential effects on freedom of speech in Hong Kong, with people already moving to scrub their social media and remove posters and pamphlets criticizing the government from shops and restaurants. </p><p>Media groups have expressed alarm about the law, with the Foreign Correspondents' Club writing to the city's leader Lam \"seeking clarity on specific areas where the new law is vague and where terms are undefined, particularly regarding the press and freedom of speech.\" </p><p>Lam previously said \"the law has clearly defined the four types of acts and activities which we need to prevent, curb and punish in accordance with the law.\" </p><p>\"If the Foreign Correspondents' Club or all reporters in Hong Kong can give me a 100% guarantee that they will not commit any offenses under this piece of national legislation, then I can do the same,\" she added. </p><p>Here again, Falun Gong may find themselves at the inadvertent frontlines of Hong Kong's battle for civil liberties. During a recent protest against the law on July 1, Falun Gong practitioners could be seen handing out flyers saying \"Heaven will destroy the Chinese Communist Party\" as well as copies of Epoch Times. The newspaper, which was founded by Falun Gong practitioners and remains closely linked to the group, is one of the most vocally anti-government publications in the city.</p><p>Its Chinese edition refers to the coronavirus as the \"Chinese Communist Party virus,\" has called on the West to \"fight back\" against the Party, and regularly publishes stinging critiques of Beijing. </p><p>Representatives for Epoch Times in Hong Kong and New York did not respond to a request for comment. </p><p>Like Apple Daily, a pro-democracy tabloid owned by tycoon Jimmy Lai, currently facing charges related to last year's protests, Epoch Times could be a canary in the coal mine for Hong Kong's media freedoms. Both papers have cultivated influence in Washington -- something that could both help or harm them, leading to politicians speaking out in their defense, but also Beijing casting them as colluding with foreign forces.</p><p>Lai has long been close to Republican Party politicians, leading to claims of his being a foreign agent in Chinese state media, while the English edition of the Epoch Times since 2016 has aggressively targeted Trump voters, with opinion content taking on an increasingly right-wing stance. </p><p>In 2019, the paper was barred by Facebook from running ads on its platform, after finding it violated the company's policies with pro-Trump campaigns. </p><p>Uncertain future</p><p>Hong Kong and Beijing officials have repeatedly claimed that the security law is both necessary and restrained, and will only affect a tiny handful of individuals in the city, mainly violent separatists. </p><p>Paraphrasing former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher about Hong Kong's success after China took control, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said this week that under the new law \"horses will run faster, stocks will be more sizzling, and dancers will dance more happily.\" </p><p>But with moves to ban books and expand police powers of surveillance and censorship, the scope of the law would appear to be expanding. </p><p>Falun Gong practitioners, as well as many other groups in Hong Kong opposed to Beijing, may not immediately feel the sting of the new regulations, but they were poised for the worse. After years of suppression in China, however, the group is better prepared than most for how to function behind the scenes, even if that will require a complete overhaul of its Hong Kong operation. </p><p>Zhang, the US-based spokesman, said that within China still, people \"continue to practice Falun Gong in private and many go out and discretely disseminate information to help other Chinese see through the CCP's lies and cover-ups.\" </p><p>Many practitioners in Hong Kong are in the city because they fled China, and Wu, the local spokeswoman said some may choose to go overseas should the law target them. </p><p>\"The Falun Gong community is diverse; each person makes their own decision based on their family and other situations,\" she said. \"But most of Falun Gong practitioners that I know plan to stay in Hong Kong. We feel it is our responsibility to continue our peaceful efforts of raising awareness of the persecution and calling for justice, and tell the world what is happening in Hong Kong.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

But she was sure there had been some sort of mistake, and so, just has her fellow practitioners had done in Beijing, she sought to appeal to the government, to make the case for Falun Gong.</p><p>\"A group of us went to the Liaison Office,\" she said. \"But no one came out, we stayed there for 24 hours.\"</p><p>The Liaison Office is the Chinese government's Hong Kong headquarters, long a symbol of Beijing's influence over the city.</p><p>Days turned into weeks, then months. Every day, Rose and a small group of fellow practitioners gathered outside the office on 160 Connaught Road to attempt to have their message heard.</p><p>One day the protesters were joined by a group of Swiss practitioners who had originally hoped to travel to Beijing to protest but were denied visas. Police attempted to remove the group, which, according to court documents never numbered more than 16, and was \"peaceful and largely static.\"</p><p>Police moved to clear the protest, however, and charged the Falun Gong protesters with obstruction, among other offenses. The case eventually wound up at the Court of Final Appeals, where Hong Kong's top justices ruled strongly in favor of the right to protest and use \"reasonable force to resist being subjected to unlawful detention.\"</p><p>The case was a major victory not just for Falun Gong but for anti-government protesters in general, securing -- until last year's anti-government protests -- the right to stage protests outside the Liaison Office.</p><p/><p>New restrictions</p><p>While Falun Gong practitioners are not the primary target of the new security law -- which is at times clearly designed to criminalize acts seen during last year's anti-government protests -- they and other groups like them could still fall foul of its broad remit.</p><p>In particular, the new offense of subversion makes it illegal in many circumstances to advocate \"overthrowing the body of central power of the People's Republic of China.\" Given that the PRC government is indelibly intertwined with the Communist Party, Falun Gong efforts to get people to quit the Communist Party in protest, or otherwise harm its activities, could be deemed criminal.</p><p>The new crime of \"collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\" could also be used to target Falun Gong. While not a top-down religion like the Catholic Church or other similar faiths with large numbers of followers in Hong Kong, Falun Gong is headquartered in the United States, where Li Hongzhi has lived since 1996, and this is where the group's main media and lobbying arms are also located.</p><p>Under Article 29 of the new law, anyone who \"conspires with a foreign country or an institution, organization or individual outside (China), or directly or indirectly receives instructions, control, funding or other kinds of support\" from such organizations, could be prosecuted if they are found to be \"provoking by unlawful means hatred among Hong Kong residents towards the Central People's Government or the Government of the Region, which is likely to cause serious consequences.\"</p><p/><p>With initial prosecutions under the security law all related to recent protests, Falun Gong practitioners could find themselves -- if the law's critics are correct -- being a test case of another sort, an expansion of the law's remit to ban activities that have long been verboten on the mainland.</p><p>\"How the situation of Falun Gong practitioners in Hong Kong evolves in the coming months and how much of the repression leaks over from the mainland is a very important space to watch,\" said Sarah Cook, a senior research analyst at Freedom House and author of \"The Battle for China's Spirit: Religious Revival, Repression, and Resistance under Xi Jinping.\"</p><p>Outside of the protest movement, Falun Gong is among the most vocal and visible opposition to the Communist Party, in both Hong Kong and elsewhere around the world. While the group is somewhat detached from the mainstream opposition in Hong Kong due to its conservative religious beliefs, this has not stopped its presence in the city being symbolic, and many followers take a sort of pride that even Falun Gong can operate in Hong Kong, given the huge antipathy Beijing has towards the group.</p><p>\"The ability of people in Hong Kong to practice Falun Gong legally and openly is important both symbolically and practically,\" said Erping Zhang, a US-based spokesman for the group.</p><p>Zhang said that as well as the new crimes created under the law, he was concerned about the broad rights it gives Chinese security services to operate in Hong Kong, even extending Chinese jurisdiction over certain cases and allowing people to be taken for trial on the mainland.</p><p>\"It could truly take a horrific toll on Falun Gong practitioners in Hong Kong and create huge losses for those who have benefited from the practice and activists' awareness raising activities,\" he said.</p><p>Cook, the Freedom House researcher, said that any curtailment of Falun Gong in the city \"would be a bad sign and a potentially worrying precursor to a crackdown on the broader religious community in Hong Kong.\"</p><p>\"Within China we've sign time and again since 1999 how the rules, tactics, and even security forces initially created to persecute Falun Gong are then expanded to other targets,\" she added. \"It may only be a matter of time before we see that in Hong Kong too, unfortunately.\"</p><p>But not all religious groups are alarmed. In a letter to the religious newspaper Church Times this month, Paul Kwong, Archbishop of Hong Kong, praised the new security law and pushed back against criticism from figures including Cardinal Maung Bo, president of the Asian Bishops' Conferences.</p><p>\"Many critics do not accept the fact that we are part of China,\" Kwong said. \"They only emphasize two systems, not one country. I cherish our Hong Kong freedoms -- in particular the freedom of religion and way of life -- as much as anyone, and I don't think this law will change any of that. I am also proud to be living in China.\"</p><p/><p>Freedom of speech</p><p>Numerous concerns have been raised about the new law's potential effects on freedom of speech in Hong Kong, with people already moving to scrub their social media and remove posters and pamphlets criticizing the government from shops and restaurants.</p><p>Media groups have expressed alarm about the law, with the Foreign Correspondents' Club writing to the city's leader Lam \"seeking clarity on specific areas where the new law is vague and where terms are undefined, particularly regarding the press and freedom of speech.\"</p><p>Lam previously said \"the law has clearly defined the four types of acts and activities which we need to prevent, curb and punish in accordance with the law.\"</p><p>\"If the Foreign Correspondents' Club or all reporters in Hong Kong can give me a 100% guarantee that they will not commit any offenses under this piece of national legislation, then I can do the same,\" she added.</p><p>Here again, Falun Gong may find themselves at the inadvertent frontlines of Hong Kong's battle for civil liberties. During a recent protest against the law on July 1, Falun Gong practitioners could be seen handing out flyers saying \"Heaven will destroy the Chinese Communist Party\" as well as copies of Epoch Times. The newspaper, which was founded by Falun Gong practitioners and remains closely linked to the group, is one of the most vocally anti-government publications in the city.</p><p>Its Chinese edition refers to the coronavirus as the \"Chinese Communist Party virus,\" has called on the West to \"fight back\" against the Party, and regularly publishes stinging critiques of Beijing.</p><p>Representatives for Epoch Times in Hong Kong and New York did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Like Apple Daily, a pro-democracy tabloid owned by tycoon Jimmy Lai, currently facing charges related to last year's protests, Epoch Times could be a canary in the coal mine for Hong Kong's media freedoms. Both papers have cultivated influence in Washington -- something that could both help or harm them, leading to politicians speaking out in their defense, but also Beijing casting them as colluding with foreign forces.</p><p>Lai has long been close to Republican Party politicians, leading to claims of his being a foreign agent in Chinese state media, while the English edition of the Epoch Times since 2016 has aggressively targeted Trump voters, with opinion content taking on an increasingly right-wing stance.</p><p>In 2019, the paper was barred by Facebook from running ads on its platform, after finding it violated the company's policies with pro-Trump campaigns.</p><p/><p>Uncertain future</p><p>Hong Kong and Beijing officials have repeatedly claimed that the security law is both necessary and restrained, and will only affect a tiny handful of individuals in the city, mainly violent separatists.</p><p>Paraphrasing former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher about Hong Kong's success after China took control, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said this week that under the new law \"horses will run faster, stocks will be more sizzling, and dancers will dance more happily.\"</p><p>But with moves to ban books and expand police powers of surveillance and censorship, the scope of the law would appear to be expanding.</p><p>Falun Gong practitioners, as well as many other groups in Hong Kong opposed to Beijing, may not immediately feel the sting of the new regulations, but they were poised for the worse. After years of suppression in China, however, the group is better prepared than most for how to function behind the scenes, even if that will require a complete overhaul of its Hong Kong operation.</p><p>Zhang, the US-based spokesman, said that within China still, people \"continue to practice Falun Gong in private and many go out and discretely disseminate information to help other Chinese see through the CCP's lies and cover-ups.\"</p><p>Many practitioners in Hong Kong are in the city because they fled China, and Wu, the local spokeswoman said some may choose to go overseas should the law target them.</p><p>\"The Falun Gong community is diverse; each person makes their own decision based on their family and other situations,\" she said. \"But most of Falun Gong practitioners that I know plan to stay in Hong Kong. We feel it is our responsibility to continue our peaceful efforts of raising awareness of the persecution and calling for justice, and tell the world what is happening in Hong Kong.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20200708hongkongchinafalungongintlhnk1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CW-BV61-DY60-M00C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2588\"/><timeReceived>8:29 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 8, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>hong-kong-china-falun-gong-intl-hnk</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Scope</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkFFNzEwMUYzNEU3NDdGRTg4RUM2OUM0ODI1ODg2QjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000434</classCode><className>CULTS &amp;

Marchers, dressed all in yellow, carried purple lotus plants, yin-yang symbols, and other traditional Buddhist icons. But it was their giant banners, held aloft or mounted on small floats, that indicated this was not just a religious rally. \"Keep away from the Chinese Communist Party. Stop the persecution of Falun Gong.\" A religious movement that emerged in China in the mid-1990s, Falun Gong surged in popularity nationwide before it was banned and brutally suppressed on the mainland in 1999. But it continues to operate in Hong Kong thanks to the territory's greater human rights protections. For decades now, Falun Gong protests against the Chinese government have been a common sight on the city's streets, with practitioners setting up gory mock surgery scenes to raise awareness about , and handing out free copies of the Falun Gong-linked newspaper, Epoch Times. Protesters have also targeted Chinese politicians and offices in the city, and regularly take part in mass anti-government rallies and marches. A woman watches as supporters of the Falun Gong spiritual group, banned in mainland China, take part in a march in Hong Kong on April 27, 2019, to observe the 20th anniversary of a large demonstration in Beijing which led to a crackdown against the movement. Crossing the border by bus from China and seeing Falun Gong practitioners handing out anti-Communist Party leaflets was once one of the most visible signs of Hong Kong's relative autonomy from Beijing. All that could soon be deemed illegal under a sweeping new security law passed by China for Hong Kong last month that criminalized \"acts of secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities, and collusion with foreign or external forces to endanger national security.\" Similar laws in China have been used to go after Falun Gong practitioners, which Beijing denounces as an \"evil cult\" that \"preaches heretical fallacies that are anti-humanity and anti-science\" through the control of people's minds. Falun Gong practitioners reject these charges and maintain they have been unfairly targeted and suppressed by the Chinese authorities. Thousands of Falun Gong practitioners are believed to be held \"at various prisons and extralegal detention centers\" in mainland China, according to Washington-based rights group Freedom House -- an accusation Beijing also denies. \"The new National Security Law will act like a sharp knife hanging over the (association) and the heads of every Falun Gong practitioner in Hong Kong,\" said Ingrid Wu, spokeswoman for the Hong KongFalun Dafa Association. \"We are very concerned.\" Hong Kong officials have claimed the new law is necessary and will only affect a handful of individuals. In early July, Chief Executive Carrie Lam pushed back against the suggestion the law would undermine people's freedoms. \"The legal principles that we attach a lot of importance to, like presumption of innocence and no retrospective effect and so on, are being upheld,\" she said. \"Instead of spreading fear, the law will actually remove fear and let Hong Kong people return to a normal, peaceful life.\" A government spokeswoman did not respond to emailed questions about concerns regarding religious freedom under the law. Hong Kong has long been a safe haven for entities which could never operate in China, from banned religious movements and labor rights NGOs, to big tech firms blocked by the Great Firewall. The fate of groups like Falun Gong -- fierce opponents of Beijing who, while not the immediate targets of the law still come within its broad remit -- will test those assurances to the hilt. Falun Gong practitioners have long been a vocal and organized part of Hong Kong's broader anti-government movement. New age religion Founded by Li Hongzhi in northeastern China in the early 1990s, Falun Gong blends traditional Chinese qigong practices and new age beliefs. It was once promoted by the Chinese government and state media as part of a nationwide qigong craze, but as Falun Gong grew in size, attracting millions of followers, the authorities turned on the group. Li encouraged a blistering public relations strategy in a bid to win over the critics, and between 1996 and 1999, the group staged some 300 protests and demonstrations, historian David Ownby writes in \"Falun Gong and the Future of China.\" This culminated in an audacious, and strategically disastrous, demonstration around central government headquarters in Beijing involving around 10,000 practitioners. It was the biggest protest the capital had seen since the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, and was the beginning of the end for Falun Gong in China. The protesters in Beijing were calling for the removal of restrictions placed on the faith, but the Chinese authorities responded with a massive crackdown and huge propaganda push demonizing Falun Gong. \"I was shocked,\" said Rose, a Hong Kong-based Falun Gong practitioner. \"I had friends who were traveling between Hong Kong and Beijing, they told me a crackdown was about to take place, but I said this was impossible, Falun Gong was just a belief, nothing political.\" Originally from mainland China, Rose began practicing Falun Gong after moving to Hong Kong in the late 1990s. CNN is withholding her full name due to fears of prosecution under the new security law. Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi seen in New York in 1999. He left China several years before the group was banned there. After Falun Gong was banned, Rose's husband and several of her close friends urged her to keep a low profile, to just do her exercises and readings at home. But she was sure there had been some sort of mistake, and so, just has her fellow practitioners had done in Beijing, she sought to appeal to the government, to make the case for Falun Gong. \"A group of us went to the Liaison Office,\" she said. \"But no one came out, we stayed there for 24 hours.\" The Liaison Office is the Chinese government's Hong Kong headquarters, long a symbol of Beijing's influence over the city. Days turned into weeks, then months. Every day, Rose and a small group of fellow practitioners gathered outside the office on 160 Connaught Road to attempt to have their message heard. One day the protesters were joined by a group of Swiss practitioners who had originally hoped to travel to Beijing to protest but were denied visas. Police attempted to remove the group, which, according to court documents never numbered more than 16, and was \"peaceful and largely static.\" Police moved to clear the protest, however, and charged the Falun Gong protesters with obstruction, among other offenses. The case eventually wound up at the Court of Final Appeals, where Hong Kong's top justices ruled strongly in favor of the right to protest and use \"reasonable force to resist being subjected to unlawful detention.\" The case was a major victory not just for Falun Gong but for anti-government protesters in general, securing -- until last year's anti-government protests -- the right to stage protests outside the Liaison Office. A woman adjusts banners in support of Falun Gong in Tung Chung, an area popular with tourists from the mainland, in Hong Kong on April 25, 2019. New restrictions While Falun Gong practitioners are not the primary target of the new security law -- which is at times clearly designed to criminalize acts seen during last year's anti-government protests -- they and other groups like them could still fall foul of its broad remit. In particular, the new offense of subversion makes it illegal in many circumstances to advocate \"overthrowing the body of central power of the People's Republic of China.\" Given that the PRC government is indelibly intertwined with the Communist Party, Falun Gong efforts to get people to quit the Communist Party in protest, or otherwise harm its activities, could be deemed criminal. The new crime of \"collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security\" could also be used to target Falun Gong. While not a top-down religion like the Catholic Church or other similar faiths with large numbers of followers in Hong Kong, Falun Gong is headquartered in the United States, where Li Hongzhi has lived since 1996, and this is where the group's main media and lobbying arms are also located. Under Article 29 of the new law, anyone who \"conspires with a foreign country or an institution, organization or individual outside (China), or directly or indirectly receives instructions, control, funding or other kinds of support\" from such organizations, could be prosecuted if they are found to be \"provoking by unlawful means hatred among Hong Kong residents towards the Central People's Government or the Government of the Region, which is likely to cause serious consequences.\" Pedestrians walk past banners criticising the Falun Gong spiritual movement displayed along a pavement in Causeway Bay, a popular shopping district, in Hong Kong on April 25, 2019. With initial prosecutions under the security law all related to recent protests, Falun Gong practitioners could find themselves -- if the law's critics are correct -- being a test case of another sort, an expansion of the law's remit to ban activities that have long been verboten on the mainland. \"How the situation of Falun Gong practitioners in Hong Kong evolves in the coming months and how much of the repression leaks over from the mainland is a very important space to watch,\" said Sarah Cook, a senior research analyst at Freedom House and author of \"The Battle for China's Spirit: Religious Revival, Repression, and Resistance under Xi Jinping.\" Outside of the protest movement, Falun Gong is among the most vocal and visible opposition to the Communist Party, in both Hong Kong and elsewhere around the world. While the group is somewhat detached from the mainstream opposition in Hong Kong due to its conservative religious beliefs, this has not stopped its presence in the city being symbolic, and many followers take a sort of pride that even Falun Gong can operate in Hong Kong, given the huge antipathy Beijing has towards the group. \"The ability of people in Hong Kong to practice Falun Gong legally and openly is important both symbolically and practically,\" said Erping Zhang, a US-based spokesman for the group. Zhang said that as well as the new crimes created under the law, he was concerned about the broad rights it gives Chinese security services to operate in Hong Kong, even extending Chinese jurisdiction over certain cases and allowing people to be taken for trial on the mainland. \"It could truly take a horrific toll on Falun Gong practitioners in Hong Kong and create huge losses for those who have benefited from the practice and activists' awareness raising activities,\" he said. Cook, the Freedom House researcher, said that any curtailment of Falun Gong in the city \"would be a bad sign and a potentially worrying precursor to a crackdown on the broader religious community in Hong Kong.\" \"Within China we've sign time and again since 1999 how the rules, tactics, and even security forces initially created to persecute Falun Gong are then expanded to other targets,\" she added. \"It may only be a matter of time before we see that in Hong Kong too, unfortunately.\" But not all religious groups are alarmed. In a letter to the religious newspaper Church Times this month, Paul Kwong, Archbishop of Hong Kong, praised the new security law and pushed back against criticism from figures including Cardinal Maung Bo, president of the Asian Bishops' Conferences. \"Many critics do not accept the fact that we are part of China,\" Kwong said. \"They only emphasize two systems, not one country. I cherish our Hong Kong freedoms -- in particular the freedom of religion and way of life -- as much as anyone, and I don't think this law will change any of that. I am also proud to be living in China.\" A Falun Gong activist (left) holds a sign next to men from a mailand Chinese tour group in the Kowloon district of Hong Kong on January 6, 2019. Freedom of speech Numerous concerns have been raised about the new law's potential effects on freedom of speech in Hong Kong, with people already moving to scrub their social media and remove posters and pamphlets criticizing the government from shops and restaurants. Media groups have expressed alarm about the law, with the Foreign Correspondents' Club writing to the city's leader Lam \"seeking clarity on specific areas where the new law is vague and where terms are undefined, particularly regarding the press and freedom of speech.\" Lam previously said \"the law has clearly defined the four types of acts and activities which we need to prevent, curb and punish in accordance with the law.\" \"If the Foreign Correspondents' Club or all reporters in Hong Kong can give me a 100% guarantee that they will not commit any offenses under this piece of national legislation, then I can do the same,\" she added. Here again, Falun Gong may find themselves at the inadvertent frontlines of Hong Kong's battle for civil liberties. During a recent protest against the law on July 1, Falun Gong practitioners could be seen handing out flyers saying \"Heaven will destroy the Chinese Communist Party\" as well as copies of Epoch Times. The newspaper, which was founded by Falun Gong practitioners and remains closely linked to the group, is one of the most vocally anti-government publications in the city. Its Chinese edition refers to the coronavirus as the \"Chinese Communist Party virus,\" has called on the West to \"fight back\" against the Party, and regularly publishes stinging critiques of Beijing. Representatives for Epoch Times in Hong Kong and New York did not respond to a request for comment. Like Apple Daily, a pro-democracy tabloid owned by tycoon Jimmy Lai, currently facing charges related to last year's protests, Epoch Times could be a canary in the coal mine for Hong Kong's media freedoms. Both papers have cultivated influence in Washington -- something that could both help or harm them, leading to politicians speaking out in their defense, but also Beijing casting them as colluding with foreign forces. Lai has long been close to Republican Party politicians, leading to claims of his being a foreign agent in Chinese state media, while the English edition of the Epoch Times since 2016 has aggressively targeted Trump voters, with opinion content taking on an increasingly right-wing stance. In 2019, the paper was barred by Facebook from running ads on its platform, after finding it violated the company's policies with pro-Trump campaigns. Falun Gong members meditate as policemen watch demonstrators during a pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong on May 18, 2016. Uncertain future Hong Kong and Beijing officials have repeatedly claimed that the security law is both necessary and restrained, and will only affect a tiny handful of individuals in the city, mainly violent separatists. Paraphrasing former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher about Hong Kong's success after China took control, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said this week that under the new law \"horses will run faster, stocks will be more sizzling, and dancers will dance more happily.\" But with moves to ban books and expand police powers of surveillance and censorship, the scope of the law would appear to be expanding. Falun Gong practitioners, as well as many other groups in Hong Kong opposed to Beijing, may not immediately feel the sting of the new regulations, but they were poised for the worse. After years of suppression in China, however, the group is better prepared than most for how to function behind the scenes, even if that will require a complete overhaul of its Hong Kong operation. Zhang, the US-based spokesman, said that within China still, people \"continue to practice Falun Gong in private and many go out and discretely disseminate information to help other Chinese see through the CCP's lies and cover-ups.\" Many practitioners in Hong Kong are in the city because they fled China, and Wu, the local spokeswoman said some may choose to go overseas should the law target them. \"The Falun Gong community is diverse; each person makes their own decision based on their family and other situations,\" she said. \"But most of Falun Gong practitioners that I know plan to stay in Hong Kong. We feel it is our responsibility to continue our peaceful efforts of raising awareness of the persecution and calling for justice, and tell the world what is happening in Hong Kong.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Yearsley's company, Akin, is using AI to create bots that can converse with humans in a lifelike way. Blankenstein's company, Unleash Live, uses AI for real-time analysis of video footage coming from security cameras and drones.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both of them have built their companies around the notion there is money to be made, a business niche to be exploited, by ensuring their AI is ethical, and doesn't use personal information to manipulate or surveil the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And both of them might have taken some comfort in events that have unfolded in the US this past week, had their belief in ethical AI not been proved out under such dramatic and tragic circumstances.</p><p>Following mass protests against racially motivated police brutality,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/ibm-makes-ai-free-for-answering-covid-19-questions-20200402-p54ggv\">IBM</url>, then Amazon, then Microsoft all put the brakes on the use of AI in mass surveillance last week. They called for better regulation of the technology, and for work to be done on eliminating the race and gender bias that's widely acknowledged to exist in AI systems, before they allow police forces to use their AI-based facial recognition systems.</p><p>Such <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/what-if-your-employer-could-see-inside-your-head-20200211-p53zs9\">AI-based surveillance systems</url>, says Toby Walsh, a professor of artificial intelligence at the University of NSW, are now at risk of becoming \"toxic assets\" for the companies that develop and sell them, to the point where many companies will be forced to abandon the technology altogether.</p><p>\"Face recognition, along with other misuses of surveillance, is going to be a topic that will trouble us increasingly. These won't be the last tech companies that decide to get out, and rightly so.</p><p>\"AI-based surveillance is just too troubling in many respects,\" he says.</p><p>For Blankenstein's Unleash Live, though, getting out of that technology won't be an issue. The Sydney-based company refused to get into it in the first place, or into any type of AI that uses personal information.</p><p>Promise to staff</p><p>Unleash Live's AI might analyse the video feed coming from a security camera to help a city decide whether footpaths should be made wider, or to detect that hordes of people are running from some incident that law enforcement or emergency services should be notified about, but the company has made it a selling point that it will never collect or analyse personal information.</p><p>Its platform can never be used by the government to identify people, he says.</p><p>Not only were the ethical implications of mass, computer-based surveillance too troubling, Blankenstein told The Australian Financial Review, but, in any event, that market was already saturated with powerful companies that were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/world/asia/china-uses-ai-shame-and-lots-of-cameras-to-control-its-people-20180709-h12f3y\">all too willing to provide the technology to governments</url> and police forces around the world.</p><p>Unleash Live recruited its staff with the promise it would only undertake ethical AI, and many of the staff would quit should the company ever deviate from that, he said.</p><p>Australia's Human Rights Commissioner, Edward Santow, believes that, just as this country has successfully positioned itself as a supplier of safe food to the world, it could also position itself as a supplier of ethically safe technology, especially when it comes to artificial intelligence.</p><p>AI, he says, has some \"deeply troubling\" human rights implications, not just when it comes to the question of whether it has racial and gender bias, but also the bigger question of whether it should even be used for applications such as surveillance, even if the bias is eliminated.</p><p>\"Even if the technology was completely accurate and reliable, that still causes a number of human rights problems. Most obviously, it would significantly affect the right to privacy,\" he told the Financial Review.</p><p>\"For a country like Australia, a middle power that can't compete on scale with countries like the US or China, we need to be really clear on what our niche is.</p><p>\"And one niche is that our liberal democratic values are taken seriously. We've always punched above our weight on equality and fairness. We should make that a strength of our AI policy,\" Santow says.</p><p>Indeed, that's already proved to be a strength at Unleashed Live, says Blankenstein. The start-up regularly fields queries from companies that want to ensure its use of AI doesn't involve the use of personal information, and its privacy practices will be governed by Australian law.</p><p>Chilling effect on behaviour</p><p>But other countries, too, are making ethical AI part of their pitch to the world, says Santow, and Australia needs to act in the next 12 months, to develop a national technology framework that will support the goal.</p><p>Such a framework, which the Human Rights Commission is now working on, would help align regulation, government spending and incentives for private investment, all towards that one end.</p><p>\"The government has to get on the front foot when it comes to regulating against serious harms associated with AI and facial recognition,\" Santow says. \"And if they do, there is an opportunity for Australia. We can become known as a country that innovates consistently with our liberal democratic values, like a fair go and equality.\"</p><p>Ellen Broad, a senior fellow in technology policy at the ANU's 3AI institute - a think tank designed to promote responsible innovation - argues serious harms that can be done by AI aren't limited to the direct effects, such as AI-based massed surveillance leading to certain races being more heavily targeted than others.</p><p>The mere presence of AI in society can have a chilling effect that needs to be guarded against, she says. If people know that computers could be watching their every move, then they'll modify their behaviour and might be less willing to do things like exercise their right to privacy, even if computers aren't actually watching them.</p><p>AI, it turns out, has a frightening ability to bring about change in human behaviour, says Akin founder Liesl Yearsley.</p><p>Yearsley retired after selling her previous AI company, Cognea Artificial Intelligence, to IBM in 2014, but she says she has now come out of retirement to found Akin, in part because she's aware of how easily AI could be used to manipulate human behaviour to questionable or unsustainable ends.</p><p>The customer service bots that she built at Cognea, which might be used for tasks such as encouraging consumers to take on more credit card debt, were already capable of altering people's behaviour by anywhere between 30 per cent and 200 per cent, she says.</p><p>Unlike humans, AI bots are relentless in their ability to constantly optimise themselves towards a goal. If that goal is to make people consume more and more, as is the case with most AI systems, then heaven help the world, she says.</p><p>\"I don't want to live in a world 10 or 20 years from now where half of my decisions are being made by AI that have fundamentally divergent value systems to me.\"</p><p>Akin was founded, she says, as an experiment in turning AI's relentless optimisation capabilities towards positive goals, such as getting people to eat more healthily and to exercise more, rather than merely getting them to shop more.</p><p>Like Hanno Blankenstein, Yearsley is trying to prove that doing so doesn't just make good ethical sense, it makes good business sense, too.</p><p>\"If we can prove that there is a new model of big tech that actually works for humans and will be sustainable, then hopefully others will join that path.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520289040</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:604N-9081-JBJ7-N39F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1250\"/><timeReceived>04:03 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Why? The short answer to that is Donald and Rupert. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Scott done this time?</emphasis> Under instructions, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has issued a draft News Media Bargaining Code, designed to regulate the commercial relationship between the digital giants and the legacy mainstream media. It's already triggered a war of words between Google and the ACCC. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code?</emphasis> The code reflects the ACCC's attempt to rectify a power imbalance between news publishers and the two big digital platforms. Google search results and Facebook news feeds each provide links to news publishers' stories. These are the source of large volumes of traffic to news publishers' websites.\u00a0That traffic generates advertising revenue which is precious to the news publishers, and for many their primary source of income.  In contrast, Facebook and Google derive relatively little benefit from the ability to link to news content compared to the overall value of their business.   Neither side pays any money to the other for this traffic. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What the code aims to do</emphasis> The code proposes a complicated system whereby news publishers can register with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in order to obtain rights against Google and Facebook, enabling them to find out what information is collected about their audience and be notified of algorithm changes.\u00a0  The news publishers can also require Google or Facebook to bargain with them, in good faith, including about remuneration Google and Facebook should pay to them for being allowed to \"make available\" their news content. If they can't agree, there is mandatory arbitration. Non-compliance triggers pecuniary penalties, with the maximum going up to 10% of annual turnover. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wait, the tech companies pay the publishers?\u00a0Didn't you say it's not actually valuable to them?</emphasis> Yeah, we did.\u00a0This is the central stupidity; News Corp and Nine want the digital giants to underwrite their failing revenue model by paying for something Google and Facebook don't need, and the government has bought in.\u00a0It makes no logical sense, will warp the market artificially and won't save them in the long run anyway.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code is flawed (and why Google is all huffy)</emphasis> The code will force Google and Facebook to pay for the opportunity to \"make available\" the news publishers' content.  \"Make available\" isn't defined. Is it the mere publication of a hyperlink?\u00a0A headline?\u00a0A snippet?\u00a0The whole story? Why would they have to pay to publish a hyperlink? If Google or Facebook reproduces a substantial part of a news story, then they might logically pay for a copyright licence.\u00a0But the code is not about copyright.\u00a0(As a sidenote, the EU has used copyright law to require Google to pay for news snippets.)\u00a0  As a result, the code essentially makes it unlawful for Google and Facebook to do something which is (a) very unclear and (b) probably lawful for anyone else to do; that is, \"make available\" news content without paying for it.  Next, the code will apply to Google and Facebook indeterminately.\u00a0There's no scheduled review of their designation, no opportunity for submissions, no criteria which must be applied before they (or any other business) are designated as having the code apply.\u00a0The code also ignores the possibility of Google or Facebook ceasing to \"make available\" news content altogether. That's a huge area to leave grey, especially where attempts to make Google pay for news in other jurisdictions have resulted in Google withdrawing supply.  Then we get to price.\u00a0The code doesn't say how much Google and Facebook have to pay for this right to do something that everyone else can (probably) do for free.\u00a0It talks about the value that the digital platforms derive and the cost of producing the news.\u00a0It ignores the value of the audience that the digital platforms deliver to news publishers, which by Google's calculations is about 20 times greater than the value Google receives from its news function.  The practical effect of this solution to the wrong problem is that it will only make the news publishers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">more </emphasis>reliant on their relationship with Google and Facebook. It won't fix the power imbalance.\u00a0And it will make the news outlets less interested in dealing with any other digital platforms which aren't subject to such rigorous bargaining and remuneration obligations. Again, this delivers more power to Google and Facebook; this time against their competitors.  It's a classic Coalition government irony: in its ham-fisted attempt to rein in the digital monopolists, its main impact will be to further entrench their monopolies.\u00a0Good one, party of the free market. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can it work at all?</emphasis> Interesting question -- there is an inbuilt impossibility to all this. For Google and Facebook, and especially their boards, how exactly are they supposed to live with a mandatory bargaining code that exposes them to open-ended financial liability for something they don't actually value?\u00a0Reconciling that with their duties to their shareholders is not something we'd like to attempt.  That's one of the direct consequences of the brutal illogic of the proposed code. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's next</emphasis> The government will steam ahead with the code regardless of its flaws and anything Google says. It has built the David and Goliath narrative and now it needs to get the code through parliament and claim victory.  The argument will move then to the courts, who will have the unenviable job of trying to make some sense of this latest exemplar of compromised, irrational policy-making from the laziest government we've ever had. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60S1-PMK1-F0NT-H1V9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"982\"/><timeReceived>10:38:31 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 31, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Why? The short answer to that is Donald and Rupert. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Scott done this time?</emphasis> Under instructions, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has issued a draft News Media Bargaining Code, designed to regulate the commercial relationship between the digital giants and the legacy mainstream media. It's already triggered a war of words between Google and the ACCC. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code?</emphasis> The code reflects the ACCC's attempt to rectify a power imbalance between news publishers and the two big digital platforms. Google search results and Facebook news feeds each provide links to news publishers' stories. These are the source of large volumes of traffic to news publishers' websites.\u00a0That traffic generates advertising revenue which is precious to the news publishers, and for many their primary source of income.  In contrast, Facebook and Google derive relatively little benefit from the ability to link to news content compared to the overall value of their business.   Neither side pays any money to the other for this traffic. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What the code aims to do</emphasis> The code proposes a complicated system whereby news publishers can register with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in order to obtain rights against Google and Facebook, enabling them to find out what information is collected about their audience and be notified of algorithm changes.\u00a0  The news publishers can also require Google or Facebook to bargain with them, in good faith, including about remuneration Google and Facebook should pay to them for being allowed to \"make available\" their news content. If they can't agree, there is mandatory arbitration. Non-compliance triggers pecuniary penalties, with the maximum going up to 10% of annual turnover. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wait, the tech companies pay the publishers?\u00a0Didn't you say it's not actually valuable to them?</emphasis> Yeah, we did.\u00a0This is the central stupidity; News Corp and Nine want the digital giants to underwrite their failing revenue model by paying for something Google and Facebook don't need, and the government has bought in.\u00a0It makes no logical sense, will warp the market artificially and won't save them in the long run anyway.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code is flawed (and why Google is all huffy)</emphasis> The code will force Google and Facebook to pay for the opportunity to \"make available\" the news publishers' content.  \"Make available\" isn't defined. Is it the mere publication of a hyperlink?\u00a0A headline?\u00a0A snippet?\u00a0The whole story? Why would they have to pay to publish a hyperlink? If Google or Facebook reproduces a substantial part of a news story, then they might logically pay for a copyright licence.\u00a0But the code is not about copyright.\u00a0(As a sidenote, the EU has used copyright law to require Google to pay for news snippets.)\u00a0  As a result, the code essentially makes it unlawful for Google and Facebook to do something which is (a) very unclear and (b) probably lawful for anyone else to do; that is, \"make available\" news content without paying for it.  Next, the code will apply to Google and Facebook indeterminately.\u00a0There's no scheduled review of their designation, no opportunity for submissions, no criteria which must be applied before they (or any other business) are designated as having the code apply.\u00a0The code also ignores the possibility of Google or Facebook ceasing to \"make available\" news content altogether. That's a huge area to leave grey, especially where attempts to make Google pay for news in other jurisdictions have resulted in Google withdrawing supply.  Then we get to price.\u00a0The code doesn't say how much Google and Facebook have to pay for this right to do something that everyone else can (probably) do for free.\u00a0It talks about the value that the digital platforms derive and the cost of producing the news.\u00a0It ignores the value of the audience that the digital platforms deliver to news publishers, which by Google's calculations is about 20 times greater than the value Google receives from its news function.  The practical effect of this solution to the wrong problem is that it will only make the news publishers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">more </emphasis>reliant on their relationship with Google and Facebook. It won't fix the power imbalance.\u00a0And it will make the news outlets less interested in dealing with any other digital platforms which aren't subject to such rigorous bargaining and remuneration obligations. Again, this delivers more power to Google and Facebook; this time against their competitors.  It's a classic Coalition government irony: in its ham-fisted attempt to rein in the digital monopolists, its main impact will be to further entrench their monopolies.\u00a0Good one, party of the free market. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can it work at all?</emphasis> Interesting question -- there is an inbuilt impossibility to all this. For Google and Facebook, and especially their boards, how exactly are they supposed to live with a mandatory bargaining code that exposes them to open-ended financial liability for something they don't actually value?\u00a0Reconciling that with their duties to their shareholders is not something we'd like to attempt.  That's one of the direct consequences of the brutal illogic of the proposed code. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's next</emphasis> The government will steam ahead with the code regardless of its flaws and anything Google says. It has built the David and Goliath narrative and now it needs to get the code through parliament and claim victory.  The argument will move then to the courts, who will have the unenviable job of trying to make some sense of this latest exemplar of compromised, irrational policy-making from the laziest government we've ever had. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RK-S9N1-F0NT-H0HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"982\"/><timeReceived>10:38:31 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 31, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Why? The short answer to that is Donald and Rupert. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Scott done this time?</emphasis> Under instructions, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has issued a draft News Media Bargaining Code, designed to regulate the commercial relationship between the digital giants and the legacy mainstream media. It's already triggered a war of words between Google and the ACCC. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code?</emphasis> The code reflects the ACCC's attempt to rectify a power imbalance between news publishers and the two big digital platforms. Google search results and Facebook news feeds each provide links to news publishers' stories. These are the source of large volumes of traffic to news publishers' websites.\u00a0That traffic generates advertising revenue which is precious to the news publishers, and for many their primary source of income.  In contrast, Facebook and Google derive relatively little benefit from the ability to link to news content compared to the overall value of their business.   Neither side pays any money to the other for this traffic. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What the code aims to do</emphasis> The code proposes a complicated system whereby news publishers can register with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in order to obtain rights against Google and Facebook, enabling them to find out what information is collected about their audience and be notified of algorithm changes.\u00a0  The news publishers can also require Google or Facebook to bargain with them, in good faith, including about remuneration Google and Facebook should pay to them for being allowed to \"make available\" their news content. If they can't agree, there is mandatory arbitration. Non-compliance triggers pecuniary penalties, with the maximum going up to 10% of annual turnover. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wait, the tech companies pay the publishers?\u00a0Didn't you say it's not actually valuable to them?</emphasis> Yeah, we did.\u00a0This is the central stupidity; News Corp and Nine want the digital giants to underwrite their failing revenue model by paying for something Google and Facebook don't need, and the government has bought in.\u00a0It makes no logical sense, will warp the market artificially and won't save them in the long run anyway.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code is flawed (and why Google is all huffy)</emphasis> The code will force Google and Facebook to pay for the opportunity to \"make available\" the news publishers' content.  \"Make available\" isn't defined. Is it the mere publication of a hyperlink?\u00a0A headline?\u00a0A snippet?\u00a0The whole story? Why would they have to pay to publish a hyperlink? If Google or Facebook reproduces a substantial part of a news story, then they might logically pay for a copyright licence.\u00a0But the code is not about copyright.\u00a0(As a sidenote, the EU has used copyright law to require Google to pay for news snippets.)\u00a0  As a result, the code essentially makes it unlawful for Google and Facebook to do something which is (a) very unclear and (b) probably lawful for anyone else to do; that is, \"make available\" news content without paying for it.  Next, the code will apply to Google and Facebook indeterminately.\u00a0There's no scheduled review of their designation, no opportunity for submissions, no criteria which must be applied before they (or any other business) are designated as having the code apply.\u00a0The code also ignores the possibility of Google or Facebook ceasing to \"make available\" news content altogether. That's a huge area to leave grey, especially where attempts to make Google pay for news in other jurisdictions have resulted in Google withdrawing supply.  Then we get to price.\u00a0The code doesn't say how much Google and Facebook have to pay for this right to do something that everyone else can (probably) do for free.\u00a0It talks about the value that the digital platforms derive and the cost of producing the news.\u00a0It ignores the value of the audience that the digital platforms deliver to news publishers, which by Google's calculations is about 20 times greater than the value Google receives from its news function.  The practical effect of this solution to the wrong problem is that it will only make the news publishers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">more </emphasis>reliant on their relationship with Google and Facebook. It won't fix the power imbalance.\u00a0And it will make the news outlets less interested in dealing with any other digital platforms which aren't subject to such rigorous bargaining and remuneration obligations. Again, this delivers more power to Google and Facebook; this time against their competitors.  It's a classic Coalition government irony: in its ham-fisted attempt to rein in the digital monopolists, its main impact will be to further entrench their monopolies.\u00a0Good one, party of the free market. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can it work at all?</emphasis> Interesting question -- there is an inbuilt impossibility to all this. For Google and Facebook, and especially their boards, how exactly are they supposed to live with a mandatory bargaining code that exposes them to open-ended financial liability for something they don't actually value?\u00a0Reconciling that with their duties to their shareholders is not something we'd like to attempt.  That's one of the direct consequences of the brutal illogic of the proposed code. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's next</emphasis> The government will steam ahead with the code regardless of its flaws and anything Google says. It has built the David and Goliath narrative and now it needs to get the code through parliament and claim victory.  The argument will move then to the courts, who will have the unenviable job of trying to make some sense of this latest exemplar of compromised, irrational policy-making from the laziest government we've ever had. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SW-KD11-F0NT-H036-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"982\"/><timeReceived>10:38:31 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 31, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Why? The short answer to that is Donald and Rupert. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Scott done this time?</emphasis> Under instructions, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has issued a draft News Media Bargaining Code, designed to regulate the commercial relationship between the digital giants and the legacy mainstream media. It's already triggered a war of words between Google and the ACCC. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code?</emphasis> The code reflects the ACCC's attempt to rectify a power imbalance between news publishers and the two big digital platforms. Google search results and Facebook news feeds each provide links to news publishers' stories. These are the source of large volumes of traffic to news publishers' websites.\u00a0That traffic generates advertising revenue which is precious to the news publishers, and for many their primary source of income.  In contrast, Facebook and Google derive relatively little benefit from the ability to link to news content compared to the overall value of their business.   Neither side pays any money to the other for this traffic. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What the code aims to do</emphasis> The code proposes a complicated system whereby news publishers can register with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in order to obtain rights against Google and Facebook, enabling them to find out what information is collected about their audience and be notified of algorithm changes.\u00a0  The news publishers can also require Google or Facebook to bargain with them, in good faith, including about remuneration Google and Facebook should pay to them for being allowed to \"make available\" their news content. If they can't agree, there is mandatory arbitration. Non-compliance triggers pecuniary penalties, with the maximum going up to 10% of annual turnover. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wait, the tech companies pay the publishers?\u00a0Didn't you say it's not actually valuable to them?</emphasis> Yeah, we did.\u00a0This is the central stupidity; News Corp and Nine want the digital giants to underwrite their failing revenue model by paying for something Google and Facebook don't need, and the government has bought in.\u00a0It makes no logical sense, will warp the market artificially and won't save them in the long run anyway.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code is flawed (and why Google is all huffy)</emphasis> The code will force Google and Facebook to pay for the opportunity to \"make available\" the news publishers' content.  \"Make available\" isn't defined. Is it the mere publication of a hyperlink?\u00a0A headline?\u00a0A snippet?\u00a0The whole story? Why would they have to pay to publish a hyperlink? If Google or Facebook reproduces a substantial part of a news story, then they might logically pay for a copyright licence.\u00a0But the code is not about copyright.\u00a0(As a sidenote, the EU has used copyright law to require Google to pay for news snippets.)\u00a0  As a result, the code essentially makes it unlawful for Google and Facebook to do something which is (a) very unclear and (b) probably lawful for anyone else to do; that is, \"make available\" news content without paying for it.  Next, the code will apply to Google and Facebook indeterminately.\u00a0There's no scheduled review of their designation, no opportunity for submissions, no criteria which must be applied before they (or any other business) are designated as having the code apply.\u00a0The code also ignores the possibility of Google or Facebook ceasing to \"make available\" news content altogether. That's a huge area to leave grey, especially where attempts to make Google pay for news in other jurisdictions have resulted in Google withdrawing supply.  Then we get to price.\u00a0The code doesn't say how much Google and Facebook have to pay for this right to do something that everyone else can (probably) do for free.\u00a0It talks about the value that the digital platforms derive and the cost of producing the news.\u00a0It ignores the value of the audience that the digital platforms deliver to news publishers, which by Google's calculations is about 20 times greater than the value Google receives from its news function.  The practical effect of this solution to the wrong problem is that it will only make the news publishers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">more </emphasis>reliant on their relationship with Google and Facebook. It won't fix the power imbalance.\u00a0And it will make the news outlets less interested in dealing with any other digital platforms which aren't subject to such rigorous bargaining and remuneration obligations. Again, this delivers more power to Google and Facebook; this time against their competitors.  It's a classic Coalition government irony: in its ham-fisted attempt to rein in the digital monopolists, its main impact will be to further entrench their monopolies.\u00a0Good one, party of the free market. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can it work at all?</emphasis> Interesting question -- there is an inbuilt impossibility to all this. For Google and Facebook, and especially their boards, how exactly are they supposed to live with a mandatory bargaining code that exposes them to open-ended financial liability for something they don't actually value?\u00a0Reconciling that with their duties to their shareholders is not something we'd like to attempt.  That's one of the direct consequences of the brutal illogic of the proposed code. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's next</emphasis> The government will steam ahead with the code regardless of its flaws and anything Google says. It has built the David and Goliath narrative and now it needs to get the code through parliament and claim victory.  The argument will move then to the courts, who will have the unenviable job of trying to make some sense of this latest exemplar of compromised, irrational policy-making from the laziest government we've ever had. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SN-M7C1-F0NT-H02N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"982\"/><timeReceived>10:38:31 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 31, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Why? The short answer to that is Donald and Rupert. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Scott done this time?</emphasis> Under instructions, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has issued a draft News Media Bargaining Code, designed to regulate the commercial relationship between the digital giants and the legacy mainstream media. It's already triggered a war of words between Google and the ACCC. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code?</emphasis> The code reflects the ACCC's attempt to rectify a power imbalance between news publishers and the two big digital platforms. Google search results and Facebook news feeds each provide links to news publishers' stories. These are the source of large volumes of traffic to news publishers' websites.\u00a0That traffic generates advertising revenue which is precious to the news publishers, and for many their primary source of income.  In contrast, Facebook and Google derive relatively little benefit from the ability to link to news content compared to the overall value of their business.   Neither side pays any money to the other for this traffic. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What the code aims to do</emphasis> The code proposes a complicated system whereby news publishers can register with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in order to obtain rights against Google and Facebook, enabling them to find out what information is collected about their audience and be notified of algorithm changes.\u00a0  The news publishers can also require Google or Facebook to bargain with them, in good faith, including about remuneration Google and Facebook should pay to them for being allowed to \"make available\" their news content. If they can't agree, there is mandatory arbitration. Non-compliance triggers pecuniary penalties, with the maximum going up to 10% of annual turnover. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wait, the tech companies pay the publishers?\u00a0Didn't you say it's not actually valuable to them?</emphasis> Yeah, we did.\u00a0This is the central stupidity; News Corp and Nine want the digital giants to underwrite their failing revenue model by paying for something Google and Facebook don't need, and the government has bought in.\u00a0It makes no logical sense, will warp the market artificially and won't save them in the long run anyway.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code is flawed (and why Google is all huffy)</emphasis> The code will force Google and Facebook to pay for the opportunity to \"make available\" the news publishers' content.  \"Make available\" isn't defined. Is it the mere publication of a hyperlink?\u00a0A headline?\u00a0A snippet?\u00a0The whole story? Why would they have to pay to publish a hyperlink? If Google or Facebook reproduces a substantial part of a news story, then they might logically pay for a copyright licence.\u00a0But the code is not about copyright.\u00a0(As a sidenote, the EU has used copyright law to require Google to pay for news snippets.)\u00a0  As a result, the code essentially makes it unlawful for Google and Facebook to do something which is (a) very unclear and (b) probably lawful for anyone else to do; that is, \"make available\" news content without paying for it.  Next, the code will apply to Google and Facebook indeterminately.\u00a0There's no scheduled review of their designation, no opportunity for submissions, no criteria which must be applied before they (or any other business) are designated as having the code apply.\u00a0The code also ignores the possibility of Google or Facebook ceasing to \"make available\" news content altogether. That's a huge area to leave grey, especially where attempts to make Google pay for news in other jurisdictions have resulted in Google withdrawing supply.  Then we get to price.\u00a0The code doesn't say how much Google and Facebook have to pay for this right to do something that everyone else can (probably) do for free.\u00a0It talks about the value that the digital platforms derive and the cost of producing the news.\u00a0It ignores the value of the audience that the digital platforms deliver to news publishers, which by Google's calculations is about 20 times greater than the value Google receives from its news function.  The practical effect of this solution to the wrong problem is that it will only make the news publishers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">more </emphasis>reliant on their relationship with Google and Facebook. It won't fix the power imbalance.\u00a0And it will make the news outlets less interested in dealing with any other digital platforms which aren't subject to such rigorous bargaining and remuneration obligations. Again, this delivers more power to Google and Facebook; this time against their competitors.  It's a classic Coalition government irony: in its ham-fisted attempt to rein in the digital monopolists, its main impact will be to further entrench their monopolies.\u00a0Good one, party of the free market. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can it work at all?</emphasis> Interesting question -- there is an inbuilt impossibility to all this. For Google and Facebook, and especially their boards, how exactly are they supposed to live with a mandatory bargaining code that exposes them to open-ended financial liability for something they don't actually value?\u00a0Reconciling that with their duties to their shareholders is not something we'd like to attempt.  That's one of the direct consequences of the brutal illogic of the proposed code. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's next</emphasis> The government will steam ahead with the code regardless of its flaws and anything Google says. It has built the David and Goliath narrative and now it needs to get the code through parliament and claim victory.  The argument will move then to the courts, who will have the unenviable job of trying to make some sense of this latest exemplar of compromised, irrational policy-making from the laziest government we've ever had. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RC-T3H1-JD6R-T365-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"982\"/><timeReceived>10:38:31 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 31, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Why? The short answer to that is Donald and Rupert. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Scott done this time?</emphasis> Under instructions, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has issued a draft News Media Bargaining Code, designed to regulate the commercial relationship between the digital giants and the legacy mainstream media. It's already triggered a war of words between Google and the ACCC. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code?</emphasis> The code reflects the ACCC's attempt to rectify a power imbalance between news publishers and the two big digital platforms. Google search results and Facebook news feeds each provide links to news publishers' stories. These are the source of large volumes of traffic to news publishers' websites.\u00a0That traffic generates advertising revenue which is precious to the news publishers, and for many their primary source of income.  In contrast, Facebook and Google derive relatively little benefit from the ability to link to news content compared to the overall value of their business.   Neither side pays any money to the other for this traffic. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What the code aims to do</emphasis> The code proposes a complicated system whereby news publishers can register with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in order to obtain rights against Google and Facebook, enabling them to find out what information is collected about their audience and be notified of algorithm changes.\u00a0  The news publishers can also require Google or Facebook to bargain with them, in good faith, including about remuneration Google and Facebook should pay to them for being allowed to \"make available\" their news content. If they can't agree, there is mandatory arbitration. Non-compliance triggers pecuniary penalties, with the maximum going up to 10% of annual turnover. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wait, the tech companies pay the publishers?\u00a0Didn't you say it's not actually valuable to them?</emphasis> Yeah, we did.\u00a0This is the central stupidity; News Corp and Nine want the digital giants to underwrite their failing revenue model by paying for something Google and Facebook don't need, and the government has bought in.\u00a0It makes no logical sense, will warp the market artificially and won't save them in the long run anyway.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code is flawed (and why Google is all huffy)</emphasis> The code will force Google and Facebook to pay for the opportunity to \"make available\" the news publishers' content.  \"Make available\" isn't defined. Is it the mere publication of a hyperlink?\u00a0A headline?\u00a0A snippet?\u00a0The whole story? Why would they have to pay to publish a hyperlink? If Google or Facebook reproduces a substantial part of a news story, then they might logically pay for a copyright licence.\u00a0But the code is not about copyright.\u00a0(As a sidenote, the EU has used copyright law to require Google to pay for news snippets.)\u00a0  As a result, the code essentially makes it unlawful for Google and Facebook to do something which is (a) very unclear and (b) probably lawful for anyone else to do; that is, \"make available\" news content without paying for it.  Next, the code will apply to Google and Facebook indeterminately.\u00a0There's no scheduled review of their designation, no opportunity for submissions, no criteria which must be applied before they (or any other business) are designated as having the code apply.\u00a0The code also ignores the possibility of Google or Facebook ceasing to \"make available\" news content altogether. That's a huge area to leave grey, especially where attempts to make Google pay for news in other jurisdictions have resulted in Google withdrawing supply.  Then we get to price.\u00a0The code doesn't say how much Google and Facebook have to pay for this right to do something that everyone else can (probably) do for free.\u00a0It talks about the value that the digital platforms derive and the cost of producing the news.\u00a0It ignores the value of the audience that the digital platforms deliver to news publishers, which by Google's calculations is about 20 times greater than the value Google receives from its news function.  The practical effect of this solution to the wrong problem is that it will only make the news publishers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">more </emphasis>reliant on their relationship with Google and Facebook. It won't fix the power imbalance.\u00a0And it will make the news outlets less interested in dealing with any other digital platforms which aren't subject to such rigorous bargaining and remuneration obligations. Again, this delivers more power to Google and Facebook; this time against their competitors.  It's a classic Coalition government irony: in its ham-fisted attempt to rein in the digital monopolists, its main impact will be to further entrench their monopolies.\u00a0Good one, party of the free market. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can it work at all?</emphasis> Interesting question -- there is an inbuilt impossibility to all this. For Google and Facebook, and especially their boards, how exactly are they supposed to live with a mandatory bargaining code that exposes them to open-ended financial liability for something they don't actually value?\u00a0Reconciling that with their duties to their shareholders is not something we'd like to attempt.  That's one of the direct consequences of the brutal illogic of the proposed code. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's next</emphasis> The government will steam ahead with the code regardless of its flaws and anything Google says. It has built the David and Goliath narrative and now it needs to get the code through parliament and claim victory.  The argument will move then to the courts, who will have the unenviable job of trying to make some sense of this latest exemplar of compromised, irrational policy-making from the laziest government we've ever had. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RT-RG31-JD6R-T3VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"982\"/><timeReceived>10:38:31 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 31, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Why? The short answer to that is Donald and Rupert. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Scott done this time?</emphasis> Under instructions, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has issued a draft News Media Bargaining Code, designed to regulate the commercial relationship between the digital giants and the legacy mainstream media. It's already triggered a war of words between Google and the ACCC. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code?</emphasis> The code reflects the ACCC's attempt to rectify a power imbalance between news publishers and the two big digital platforms. Google search results and Facebook news feeds each provide links to news publishers' stories. These are the source of large volumes of traffic to news publishers' websites.\u00a0That traffic generates advertising revenue which is precious to the news publishers, and for many their primary source of income.  In contrast, Facebook and Google derive relatively little benefit from the ability to link to news content compared to the overall value of their business.   Neither side pays any money to the other for this traffic. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What the code aims to do</emphasis> The code proposes a complicated system whereby news publishers can register with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in order to obtain rights against Google and Facebook, enabling them to find out what information is collected about their audience and be notified of algorithm changes.\u00a0  The news publishers can also require Google or Facebook to bargain with them, in good faith, including about remuneration Google and Facebook should pay to them for being allowed to \"make available\" their news content. If they can't agree, there is mandatory arbitration. Non-compliance triggers pecuniary penalties, with the maximum going up to 10% of annual turnover. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wait, the tech companies pay the publishers?\u00a0Didn't you say it's not actually valuable to them?</emphasis> Yeah, we did.\u00a0This is the central stupidity; News Corp and Nine want the digital giants to underwrite their failing revenue model by paying for something Google and Facebook don't need, and the government has bought in.\u00a0It makes no logical sense, will warp the market artificially and won't save them in the long run anyway.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code is flawed (and why Google is all huffy)</emphasis> The code will force Google and Facebook to pay for the opportunity to \"make available\" the news publishers' content.  \"Make available\" isn't defined. Is it the mere publication of a hyperlink?\u00a0A headline?\u00a0A snippet?\u00a0The whole story? Why would they have to pay to publish a hyperlink? If Google or Facebook reproduces a substantial part of a news story, then they might logically pay for a copyright licence.\u00a0But the code is not about copyright.\u00a0(As a sidenote, the EU has used copyright law to require Google to pay for news snippets.)\u00a0  As a result, the code essentially makes it unlawful for Google and Facebook to do something which is (a) very unclear and (b) probably lawful for anyone else to do; that is, \"make available\" news content without paying for it.  Next, the code will apply to Google and Facebook indeterminately.\u00a0There's no scheduled review of their designation, no opportunity for submissions, no criteria which must be applied before they (or any other business) are designated as having the code apply.\u00a0The code also ignores the possibility of Google or Facebook ceasing to \"make available\" news content altogether. That's a huge area to leave grey, especially where attempts to make Google pay for news in other jurisdictions have resulted in Google withdrawing supply.  Then we get to price.\u00a0The code doesn't say how much Google and Facebook have to pay for this right to do something that everyone else can (probably) do for free.\u00a0It talks about the value that the digital platforms derive and the cost of producing the news.\u00a0It ignores the value of the audience that the digital platforms deliver to news publishers, which by Google's calculations is about 20 times greater than the value Google receives from its news function.  The practical effect of this solution to the wrong problem is that it will only make the news publishers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">more </emphasis>reliant on their relationship with Google and Facebook. It won't fix the power imbalance.\u00a0And it will make the news outlets less interested in dealing with any other digital platforms which aren't subject to such rigorous bargaining and remuneration obligations. Again, this delivers more power to Google and Facebook; this time against their competitors.  It's a classic Coalition government irony: in its ham-fisted attempt to rein in the digital monopolists, its main impact will be to further entrench their monopolies.\u00a0Good one, party of the free market. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can it work at all?</emphasis> Interesting question -- there is an inbuilt impossibility to all this.

Why? The short answer to that is Donald and Rupert. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Scott done this time?</emphasis> Under instructions, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has issued a draft News Media Bargaining Code, designed to regulate the commercial relationship between the digital giants and the legacy mainstream media. It's already triggered a war of words between Google and the ACCC. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code?</emphasis> The code reflects the ACCC's attempt to rectify a power imbalance between news publishers and the two big digital platforms. Google search results and Facebook news feeds each provide links to news publishers' stories. These are the source of large volumes of traffic to news publishers' websites.\u00a0That traffic generates advertising revenue which is precious to the news publishers, and for many their primary source of income.  In contrast, Facebook and Google derive relatively little benefit from the ability to link to news content compared to the overall value of their business.   Neither side pays any money to the other for this traffic. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What the code aims to do</emphasis> The code proposes a complicated system whereby news publishers can register with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in order to obtain rights against Google and Facebook, enabling them to find out what information is collected about their audience and be notified of algorithm changes.\u00a0  The news publishers can also require Google or Facebook to bargain with them, in good faith, including about remuneration Google and Facebook should pay to them for being allowed to \"make available\" their news content. If they can't agree, there is mandatory arbitration. Non-compliance triggers pecuniary penalties, with the maximum going up to 10% of annual turnover. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wait, the tech companies pay the publishers?\u00a0Didn't you say it's not actually valuable to them?</emphasis> Yeah, we did.\u00a0This is the central stupidity; News Corp and Nine want the digital giants to underwrite their failing revenue model by paying for something Google and Facebook don't need, and the government has bought in.\u00a0It makes no logical sense, will warp the market artificially and won't save them in the long run anyway.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code is flawed (and why Google is all huffy)</emphasis> The code will force Google and Facebook to pay for the opportunity to \"make available\" the news publishers' content.  \"Make available\" isn't defined. Is it the mere publication of a hyperlink?\u00a0A headline?\u00a0A snippet?\u00a0The whole story? Why would they have to pay to publish a hyperlink? If Google or Facebook reproduces a substantial part of a news story, then they might logically pay for a copyright licence.\u00a0But the code is not about copyright.\u00a0(As a sidenote, the EU has used copyright law to require Google to pay for news snippets.)\u00a0  As a result, the code essentially makes it unlawful for Google and Facebook to do something which is (a) very unclear and (b) probably lawful for anyone else to do; that is, \"make available\" news content without paying for it.  Next, the code will apply to Google and Facebook indeterminately.\u00a0There's no scheduled review of their designation, no opportunity for submissions, no criteria which must be applied before they (or any other business) are designated as having the code apply.\u00a0The code also ignores the possibility of Google or Facebook ceasing to \"make available\" news content altogether. That's a huge area to leave grey, especially where attempts to make Google pay for news in other jurisdictions have resulted in Google withdrawing supply.  Then we get to price.\u00a0The code doesn't say how much Google and Facebook have to pay for this right to do something that everyone else can (probably) do for free.\u00a0It talks about the value that the digital platforms derive and the cost of producing the news.\u00a0It ignores the value of the audience that the digital platforms deliver to news publishers, which by Google's calculations is about 20 times greater than the value Google receives from its news function.  The practical effect of this solution to the wrong problem is that it will only make the news publishers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">more </emphasis>reliant on their relationship with Google and Facebook. It won't fix the power imbalance.\u00a0And it will make the news outlets less interested in dealing with any other digital platforms which aren't subject to such rigorous bargaining and remuneration obligations. Again, this delivers more power to Google and Facebook; this time against their competitors.  It's a classic Coalition government irony: in its ham-fisted attempt to rein in the digital monopolists, its main impact will be to further entrench their monopolies.\u00a0Good one, party of the free market. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can it work at all?</emphasis> Interesting question -- there is an inbuilt impossibility to all this. For Google and Facebook, and especially their boards, how exactly are they supposed to live with a mandatory bargaining code that exposes them to open-ended financial liability for something they don't actually value?\u00a0Reconciling that with their duties to their shareholders is not something we'd like to attempt.  That's one of the direct consequences of the brutal illogic of the proposed code. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's next</emphasis> The government will steam ahead with the code regardless of its flaws and anything Google says. It has built the David and Goliath narrative and now it needs to get the code through parliament and claim victory.  The argument will move then to the courts, who will have the unenviable job of trying to make some sense of this latest exemplar of compromised, irrational policy-making from the laziest government we've ever had. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RK-F3K1-F0NT-H543-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"982\"/><timeReceived>10:38:31 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 31, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Why? The short answer to that is Donald and Rupert. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Scott done this time?</emphasis> Under instructions, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has issued a draft News Media Bargaining Code, designed to regulate the commercial relationship between the digital giants and the legacy mainstream media. It's already triggered a war of words between Google and the ACCC. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code?</emphasis> The code reflects the ACCC's attempt to rectify a power imbalance between news publishers and the two big digital platforms. Google search results and Facebook news feeds each provide links to news publishers' stories. These are the source of large volumes of traffic to news publishers' websites.\u00a0That traffic generates advertising revenue which is precious to the news publishers, and for many their primary source of income.  In contrast, Facebook and Google derive relatively little benefit from the ability to link to news content compared to the overall value of their business.   Neither side pays any money to the other for this traffic. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What the code aims to do</emphasis> The code proposes a complicated system whereby news publishers can register with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in order to obtain rights against Google and Facebook, enabling them to find out what information is collected about their audience and be notified of algorithm changes.\u00a0  The news publishers can also require Google or Facebook to bargain with them, in good faith, including about remuneration Google and Facebook should pay to them for being allowed to \"make available\" their news content. If they can't agree, there is mandatory arbitration. Non-compliance triggers pecuniary penalties, with the maximum going up to 10% of annual turnover. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wait, the tech companies pay the publishers?\u00a0Didn't you say it's not actually valuable to them?</emphasis> Yeah, we did.\u00a0This is the central stupidity; News Corp and Nine want the digital giants to underwrite their failing revenue model by paying for something Google and Facebook don't need, and the government has bought in.\u00a0It makes no logical sense, will warp the market artificially and won't save them in the long run anyway.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code is flawed (and why Google is all huffy)</emphasis> The code will force Google and Facebook to pay for the opportunity to \"make available\" the news publishers' content.  \"Make available\" isn't defined. Is it the mere publication of a hyperlink?\u00a0A headline?\u00a0A snippet?\u00a0The whole story? Why would they have to pay to publish a hyperlink? If Google or Facebook reproduces a substantial part of a news story, then they might logically pay for a copyright licence.\u00a0But the code is not about copyright.\u00a0(As a sidenote, the EU has used copyright law to require Google to pay for news snippets.)\u00a0  As a result, the code essentially makes it unlawful for Google and Facebook to do something which is (a) very unclear and (b) probably lawful for anyone else to do; that is, \"make available\" news content without paying for it.  Next, the code will apply to Google and Facebook indeterminately.\u00a0There's no scheduled review of their designation, no opportunity for submissions, no criteria which must be applied before they (or any other business) are designated as having the code apply.\u00a0The code also ignores the possibility of Google or Facebook ceasing to \"make available\" news content altogether. That's a huge area to leave grey, especially where attempts to make Google pay for news in other jurisdictions have resulted in Google withdrawing supply.  Then we get to price.\u00a0The code doesn't say how much Google and Facebook have to pay for this right to do something that everyone else can (probably) do for free.\u00a0It talks about the value that the digital platforms derive and the cost of producing the news.\u00a0It ignores the value of the audience that the digital platforms deliver to news publishers, which by Google's calculations is about 20 times greater than the value Google receives from its news function.  The practical effect of this solution to the wrong problem is that it will only make the news publishers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">more </emphasis>reliant on their relationship with Google and Facebook. It won't fix the power imbalance.\u00a0And it will make the news outlets less interested in dealing with any other digital platforms which aren't subject to such rigorous bargaining and remuneration obligations. Again, this delivers more power to Google and Facebook; this time against their competitors.  It's a classic Coalition government irony: in its ham-fisted attempt to rein in the digital monopolists, its main impact will be to further entrench their monopolies.\u00a0Good one, party of the free market. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can it work at all?</emphasis> Interesting question -- there is an inbuilt impossibility to all this. For Google and Facebook, and especially their boards, how exactly are they supposed to live with a mandatory bargaining code that exposes them to open-ended financial liability for something they don't actually value?\u00a0Reconciling that with their duties to their shareholders is not something we'd like to attempt.  That's one of the direct consequences of the brutal illogic of the proposed code. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's next</emphasis> The government will steam ahead with the code regardless of its flaws and anything Google says. It has built the David and Goliath narrative and now it needs to get the code through parliament and claim victory.  The argument will move then to the courts, who will have the unenviable job of trying to make some sense of this latest exemplar of compromised, irrational policy-making from the laziest government we've ever had. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60S1-CGV1-JD6R-T4H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"982\"/><timeReceived>10:38:31 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 31, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Why? The short answer to that is Donald and Rupert. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Scott done this time?</emphasis> Under instructions, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has issued a draft News Media Bargaining Code, designed to regulate the commercial relationship between the digital giants and the legacy mainstream media. It's already triggered a war of words between Google and the ACCC. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code?</emphasis> The code reflects the ACCC's attempt to rectify a power imbalance between news publishers and the two big digital platforms. Google search results and Facebook news feeds each provide links to news publishers' stories. These are the source of large volumes of traffic to news publishers' websites.\u00a0That traffic generates advertising revenue which is precious to the news publishers, and for many their primary source of income.  In contrast, Facebook and Google derive relatively little benefit from the ability to link to news content compared to the overall value of their business.   Neither side pays any money to the other for this traffic. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What the code aims to do</emphasis> The code proposes a complicated system whereby news publishers can register with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in order to obtain rights against Google and Facebook, enabling them to find out what information is collected about their audience and be notified of algorithm changes.\u00a0  The news publishers can also require Google or Facebook to bargain with them, in good faith, including about remuneration Google and Facebook should pay to them for being allowed to \"make available\" their news content. If they can't agree, there is mandatory arbitration. Non-compliance triggers pecuniary penalties, with the maximum going up to 10% of annual turnover. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wait, the tech companies pay the publishers?\u00a0Didn't you say it's not actually valuable to them?</emphasis> Yeah, we did.\u00a0This is the central stupidity; News Corp and Nine want the digital giants to underwrite their failing revenue model by paying for something Google and Facebook don't need, and the government has bought in.\u00a0It makes no logical sense, will warp the market artificially and won't save them in the long run anyway.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code is flawed (and why Google is all huffy)</emphasis> The code will force Google and Facebook to pay for the opportunity to \"make available\" the news publishers' content.  \"Make available\" isn't defined. Is it the mere publication of a hyperlink?\u00a0A headline?\u00a0A snippet?\u00a0The whole story? Why would they have to pay to publish a hyperlink? If Google or Facebook reproduces a substantial part of a news story, then they might logically pay for a copyright licence.\u00a0But the code is not about copyright.\u00a0(As a sidenote, the EU has used copyright law to require Google to pay for news snippets.)\u00a0  As a result, the code essentially makes it unlawful for Google and Facebook to do something which is (a) very unclear and (b) probably lawful for anyone else to do; that is, \"make available\" news content without paying for it.  Next, the code will apply to Google and Facebook indeterminately.\u00a0There's no scheduled review of their designation, no opportunity for submissions, no criteria which must be applied before they (or any other business) are designated as having the code apply.\u00a0The code also ignores the possibility of Google or Facebook ceasing to \"make available\" news content altogether. That's a huge area to leave grey, especially where attempts to make Google pay for news in other jurisdictions have resulted in Google withdrawing supply.  Then we get to price.\u00a0The code doesn't say how much Google and Facebook have to pay for this right to do something that everyone else can (probably) do for free.\u00a0It talks about the value that the digital platforms derive and the cost of producing the news.\u00a0It ignores the value of the audience that the digital platforms deliver to news publishers, which by Google's calculations is about 20 times greater than the value Google receives from its news function.  The practical effect of this solution to the wrong problem is that it will only make the news publishers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">more </emphasis>reliant on their relationship with Google and Facebook. It won't fix the power imbalance.\u00a0And it will make the news outlets less interested in dealing with any other digital platforms which aren't subject to such rigorous bargaining and remuneration obligations. Again, this delivers more power to Google and Facebook; this time against their competitors.  It's a classic Coalition government irony: in its ham-fisted attempt to rein in the digital monopolists, its main impact will be to further entrench their monopolies.\u00a0Good one, party of the free market. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can it work at all?</emphasis> Interesting question -- there is an inbuilt impossibility to all this.

Why? The short answer to that is Donald and Rupert. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's Scott done this time?</emphasis> Under instructions, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has issued a draft News Media Bargaining Code, designed to regulate the commercial relationship between the digital giants and the legacy mainstream media. It's already triggered a war of words between Google and the ACCC. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code?</emphasis> The code reflects the ACCC's attempt to rectify a power imbalance between news publishers and the two big digital platforms. Google search results and Facebook news feeds each provide links to news publishers' stories. These are the source of large volumes of traffic to news publishers' websites.\u00a0That traffic generates advertising revenue which is precious to the news publishers, and for many their primary source of income.  In contrast, Facebook and Google derive relatively little benefit from the ability to link to news content compared to the overall value of their business.   Neither side pays any money to the other for this traffic. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What the code aims to do</emphasis> The code proposes a complicated system whereby news publishers can register with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in order to obtain rights against Google and Facebook, enabling them to find out what information is collected about their audience and be notified of algorithm changes.\u00a0  The news publishers can also require Google or Facebook to bargain with them, in good faith, including about remuneration Google and Facebook should pay to them for being allowed to \"make available\" their news content. If they can't agree, there is mandatory arbitration. Non-compliance triggers pecuniary penalties, with the maximum going up to 10% of annual turnover. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wait, the tech companies pay the publishers?\u00a0Didn't you say it's not actually valuable to them?</emphasis> Yeah, we did.\u00a0This is the central stupidity; News Corp and Nine want the digital giants to underwrite their failing revenue model by paying for something Google and Facebook don't need, and the government has bought in.\u00a0It makes no logical sense, will warp the market artificially and won't save them in the long run anyway.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why the code is flawed (and why Google is all huffy)</emphasis> The code will force Google and Facebook to pay for the opportunity to \"make available\" the news publishers' content.  \"Make available\" isn't defined. Is it the mere publication of a hyperlink?\u00a0A headline?\u00a0A snippet?\u00a0The whole story? Why would they have to pay to publish a hyperlink? If Google or Facebook reproduces a substantial part of a news story, then they might logically pay for a copyright licence.\u00a0But the code is not about copyright.\u00a0(As a sidenote, the EU has used copyright law to require Google to pay for news snippets.)\u00a0  As a result, the code essentially makes it unlawful for Google and Facebook to do something which is (a) very unclear and (b) probably lawful for anyone else to do; that is, \"make available\" news content without paying for it.  Next, the code will apply to Google and Facebook indeterminately.\u00a0There's no scheduled review of their designation, no opportunity for submissions, no criteria which must be applied before they (or any other business) are designated as having the code apply.\u00a0The code also ignores the possibility of Google or Facebook ceasing to \"make available\" news content altogether. That's a huge area to leave grey, especially where attempts to make Google pay for news in other jurisdictions have resulted in Google withdrawing supply.  Then we get to price.\u00a0The code doesn't say how much Google and Facebook have to pay for this right to do something that everyone else can (probably) do for free.\u00a0It talks about the value that the digital platforms derive and the cost of producing the news.\u00a0It ignores the value of the audience that the digital platforms deliver to news publishers, which by Google's calculations is about 20 times greater than the value Google receives from its news function.  The practical effect of this solution to the wrong problem is that it will only make the news publishers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">more </emphasis>reliant on their relationship with Google and Facebook. It won't fix the power imbalance.\u00a0And it will make the news outlets less interested in dealing with any other digital platforms which aren't subject to such rigorous bargaining and remuneration obligations. Again, this delivers more power to Google and Facebook; this time against their competitors.  It's a classic Coalition government irony: in its ham-fisted attempt to rein in the digital monopolists, its main impact will be to further entrench their monopolies.\u00a0Good one, party of the free market. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can it work at all?</emphasis> Interesting question -- there is an inbuilt impossibility to all this. For Google and Facebook, and especially their boards, how exactly are they supposed to live with a mandatory bargaining code that exposes them to open-ended financial liability for something they don't actually value?\u00a0Reconciling that with their duties to their shareholders is not something we'd like to attempt.  That's one of the direct consequences of the brutal illogic of the proposed code. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What's next</emphasis> The government will steam ahead with the code regardless of its flaws and anything Google says. It has built the David and Goliath narrative and now it needs to get the code through parliament and claim victory.  The argument will move then to the courts, who will have the unenviable job of trying to make some sense of this latest exemplar of compromised, irrational policy-making from the laziest government we've ever had. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SW-8721-JD6R-T0R0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"982\"/><timeReceived>10:38:31 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 31, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Or, in this case, between unbridled economic markets and a new more-regulated framework for capitalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> More than her rivals, Warren has been outspoken and detailed about the need to break up any number of big companies that she claims are monopolies. Her candidacy is a challenge to the economic system, known as neoliberalism, that bred many of the ills that beset us today. Neoliberalism is an economic model that lowers trade barriers, deregulates capital markets and allows money to flow wherever it will \u2014 usually to where labor is cheapest. Over the past generation, both parties have given neoliberalism their support.</p><p> In fact, the system has underpinned the past 40 years or so of globalization. To be fair, it has lifted billions of people out of poverty, particularly overseas, mainly by opening global trade. As emerging markets have joined in the free-market system, a new global middle class has been born, and at a global level, inequality has decreased.</p><p> But it\u2019s also allowed for huge inequalities within individual countries and created bigger and more damaging financial crises around the world. What happens in one economy affects what happens in another thousands of miles away. When capital can flow in and out of countries at will, financial speculation can imperil economies half a world away.</p><p> The two biggest beneficiaries of globalization since 2000 have been, research shows, China and big companies. China benefited from the inflow of global capital looking for cheap labor. This contributed to growth and rising wages there, particularly in the manufacturing sector, which suffered by comparison in many other countries. (As a state-run system, China could manage some of the downsides of globalization more easily, ring-fencing strategic sectors or limiting capital inflows when necessary.)</p><p> The other winners are big companies that, thanks to their global footprints, are able to fly miles over the problems \u2014 and the laws \u2014 of any particular nation. They can move jobs, capital and profits wherever they like, which allows them to leverage all the benefits of the current system, without dealing with the downsides \u2014 in the form of growing inequality, skill shortages or rising populism \u2014 with which nations themselves have to wrestle.</p><p> Tech companies have enjoyed this neoliberal benefit \u2014 only on steroids. If capital can flow more easily across borders than either labor or goods, data \u2014 which is Big Tech\u2019s real currency \u2014 is like quicksilver: It moves even more freely. According to McKinsey Global Institute figures, about 80 percent of all corporate wealth is now living in 10 percent of companies, which are richest in data and intellectual property. Those assets can be located anywhere \u2014 which is why tech firms typically pay even less in taxes as a percentage of revenue than other types of multinational companies.</p><p> It\u2019s no surprise that public trust in the elites who run such firms is at record lows. The anti-elite sentiment was a powerful driver in producing the phenomenon of Trump and remains potent, in the United States and overseas. And yet the tech giants seem oblivious to this fact. That\u2019s partly because they came of age when the private sector was ascendant, when greed was good and when government showed little interest in regulation. Which might help explain why so many tech companies\u2019 PR is tin-eared: They simply don\u2019t remember a time when things were any different or have any idea of why they should be.</p><p> Warren is a logical tribune for this moment. She may have worked as a bankruptcy lawyer, but at heart, she\u2019s an economic nationalist. Her policies would empower the public sector to redistribute some of the wealth hoarded by multinational companies in recent years to a broader group of stakeholders \u2014 labor, yes, but also small and midsize businesses and local communities. A Warren administration would likely push to in-source some supply chains and connect the dots between educators and job creators with new vocational programs. Her health-care plan, which might be a step too far for many Americans, at least has the intellectual coherency of her convictions \u2014 it\u2019s a top-down, nationalized approach designed to give the entire population basic coverage.</p><p> Warren is not the only politician espousing a more-regulated capitalist system, one that would owe a lot, ironically, to what unfolded in the United States in the 1960s: a consciously regulated economy at the federal level. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has made similar-sounding suggestions, a sign that Republicans will try to go back to the future, too, whenever Trump departs the stage.</p><p> Over time, all manner of companies might be reined in \u2014 and in particularly the supranational tech firms that represent the apex of the old, neoliberal order. Their days as unregulated global behemoths \u2014 like those of the economic system that bred it \u2014 are numbered.</p><p> Rana Foroohar is global business columnist and associate editor at the</p><p> Financial Times, and author of \u201c Don\u2019t Be Evil: How Big Tech Betrayed Its</p><p> Founding Principles \u2014 and All of Us .\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKVT-1773C8A9F8B62C90</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898652579E7D1 NWBKVT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XHF-J471-DXVP-V2D2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409761</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"907\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 St. Albans Messenger.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

As customers flood Apple's stores with the launch of each new phone, a steady trickle of reports has brought to light the egregious labor violations and sickeningly fast production speeds[1] that go into creating the electronic devices we 'can't live without.'</p><p><br/> But even if we feel our tech products are indispensable, poor working conditions in the supply chain are not inevitable. The tech giants are incredibly attuned to the desires of their consumers, and many of those buying the products are increasingly asking for ethically sourced products. What's lacking is an industry-wide system that allows social justice concerns to be effectively integrated into production processes with the same seamless efficiency as our color preferences. In Europe, a coalition of labor and consumer advocacy groups is developing a framework[2] for European Union governments to do just that, by using their bulk-purchasing power to change the way labor issues factor into the cost of doing business.<br/> The EU already has trade protocols in place[3] for specific human rights violations, like conflict minerals. Now, the Electronics Watch coalition's new industry-mapping report[4] presents a system for making the EU's contract deals match its rhetoric for a much wider industry.<br/> The large-scale purchase of computers and other electronic products by EU agencies gives the institution considerable clout in the global market. If member states collectively pressured big tech brands to ensure stronger labor protections and higher wages, that could lead the market to put a premium on accountability in the supply chain, and union rights in Chinese factories, or fairer contracts for Malaysian migrant workers. Though brands outsource manufacturing labor to smaller suppliers, the Apples and Samsungs of the world are ultimately responsible[5] for setting price points throughout the production chain, as well as workers' paychecks.<br/> Historically, factory monitoring protocols have largely been handled by the brands leading the industry. This has generated reams of glossy reports on corporate social responsibility campaigns, but often little change in workers' wages or workplace rights. For example, China Labor Watch has repeatedly uncovered evidence[6] of child labor in Samsung's supplier factories, yet the company has repeatedly tried and seemingly failed to stamp out the clandestine hiring of underaged workers by suppliers. Underlying this pattern of flouting 'corporate social responsibility' is that the industry-led efforts are by definition voluntary, and thus always tied to the corporate bottom line.<br/> EW envisions a relatively independent framework based on leveraging domestic consumer power in tandem with grassroots activism in the manufacturing regions. Under this model, public procurement would build into procurement contracts a standard labor code of conduct, and this would be consistently enforced through collaborations through local watchdogs.<br/> Drawing on industry research and field investigations, EW's report[7] identifies various regulatory blind spots in tech exporting countries (largely concentrated in China, with smaller market shares in South Korea, Malaysia and other countries).<br/> First, workers earn extremely low wages and are driven to work excessive overtime to cover basic needs. Their income is further undermined by massive wage theft, as employers arbitrarily dock workers' pay or undercount their hours. Workers also struggle with unhealthy working conditions, with a high risk of developing cancer and other occupational diseases due to toxic exposure and lack of protective gear.<br/> And if a worker wants to challenge an unscrupulous employer, 'corporate grievance mechanisms are few and ineffective,' while unions are often either nonexistent or, in the case of China, government-controlled. Workers who seek to organize autonomously risk suppression and retaliation.<br/> Amid these structural forces, which systematically drive the downward spiral of labor standards across the Global South, EW envisions a new set of consumer standards, which revolves around ethical pressure from institutional buyers. The EW is developing an industry-wide code of labor conduct[8], to be rolled out in 2015, aimed at fostering industry-wide progress on labor rights. The system marshals governments' consumer clout using a model similar to campus-based student campaigns against sweatshop-made college products. But the accord is backed by a comprehensive, autonomous auditing system in the source countries, paired with local advocacy work for labor reform.<br/> Europe's total estimated public spending on tech products was about 94 billion euros in 2007[9]. Tying that investment to concrete improvements in labor conditions could exert significant influence on the industry and, over time, bend the cost curve. Currently, according to EW, ' Social criteria are not yet perceived as enough of a competitive advantage. To apply the pressure and the leverage they have, public procurers with an interest in socially responsible ICT products need to tread a common path.'<br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://subscribe.thenation.com/servlet/OrdersGateway?cds_mag_code=NANcds_page_id=127841cds_response_key=I14JSART2\">https://subscribe.thenation.com/servlet/OrdersGateway?cds_mag_code=NANcds_page_id=127841cds_response_key=I14JSART2</url><br/>From Europe, EW seeks to build out a global network of activist groups to provide 'long-term monitoring and improvement of affiliate factories,' rather than 'superficial one-time spot checks.' Local auditors will implement 'surveys, monitoring, investigations and improvements in factories producing goods for public sector affiliates,' as well as establishing 'a Europe-wide database, collating information on distributors, brands, and factories.' In addition, the group will press public organizations to arrange procurement deals that include 'responsible purchasing practices such as sufficient lead times and pricing that are effectively in line with the commitment to respect human rights.'<br/> To prevent conflict of interest, financing would come from purchasing institutions, not manufacturers, and the institutions will not be superficially 'rewarded' for a clean record on labor rights. Frederick Johannison of the EW coalition member Danwatch[10], explains via e-mail, 'EW doesn't give out certificates but ensures long term processes of improvements. So public procurers don't pay for approval or certification. One of the main differences is that EW is independent from the brands, unlike normal private auditors.'<br/> The EW initiative also incorporates collaboration with local labor organizations to help build campaigns at the grassroots level. In the end, nothing is more effective for fighting labor exploitation in factories than worker-led direct resistance. And currently, labor militancy seems to be building in exporting countries like China. According to Bjorn Claeson, an EW consultant with the International Labor Rights Forum, 'sustainable change in a workplace is possible to the extent that workers are organized and can report on violations, demand investigations, and contribute to solutions. Social auditors can never take the place of workers who are organized and empowered to monitor violations of their own safety and their own rights.'<br/> It's unclear whether Electronics Watch can drive major reforms in tech manufacturing, but a more ethical public procurement system can create the political space for social movements to challenge the industry status quo. If a transnational consumer-labor alliance can put pressure on brands from both ends of a massive market, the balance of power on the factory floor might finally start to shift.<br/> [1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/181562/wages-have-been-stolen-them-apple-workers-could-buy-1460-iphone-6s-month\">http://www.thenation.com/blog/181562/wages-have-been-stolen-them-apple-workers-could-buy-1460-iphone-6s-month</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://electronicswatch.org/en\">http://electronicswatch.org/en</url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/may/tradoc_151114.pdf\">http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2013/may/tradoc_151114.pdf</url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://electronicswatch.org/en/electronics-watch-releases-a-detailed-mapping-report-of-the-ict-industry_723634\">http://electronicswatch.org/en/electronics-watch-releases-a-detailed-mapping-report-of-the-ict-industry_723634</url> [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://electronicswatch.org/the-ict-sector-in-the-spotlight_723519.pdf\">http://electronicswatch.org/the-ict-sector-in-the-spotlight_723519.pdf</url> [6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/report/90\">http://www.chinalaborwatch.org/report/90</url> [7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://electronicswatch.org/the-ict-sector-in-the-spotlight_723519.pdf\">http://electronicswatch.org/the-ict-sector-in-the-spotlight_723519.pdf</url> [8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://electronicswatch.org/en/why-affiliate-_95134\">http://electronicswatch.org/en/why-affiliate-_95134</url> [9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://electronicswatch.org/the-ict-sector-in-the-spotlight_723519.pdf\">http://electronicswatch.org/the-ict-sector-in-the-spotlight_723519.pdf</url> [10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.danwatch.dk/en\">http://www.danwatch.dk/en</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TNTN10322014140112603245038147</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TNTN-5135</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DDY-CSM1-F03R-N2NK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1441\"/><timeReceived>8:54 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Nation's Blogs</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>October 22, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000D3XE</classCode><className>SAMSUNG GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Facebook also announced plans earlier this year to launchits own cryptocurrency, but lawmakers and regulators - already wary of Facebook's influence - have thrown up plenty of skepticism surrounding those plans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As more tech giants dip their toes into financial services, credit unions will have to navigate a unique relationship where they're competing with these tech institutions for consumers, while also using the platforms from companies that have become their competitors.</p><p>But could that drive some credit unions away?</p><p>\"I can see where some credit unions could say tech companies \"are going to compete with me, so I'm not going to compete with them, but that may be more emotionally driven than the market aspect,\" said A. Stewart Rose, president of Truebridge, a content marketing firm geared toward financial institutions.</p><p>Facebook currently has2.45 billion usersworldwide, but at least one study shows its userbase is shrinking. A study from Edison Research earlier this year showed 15 million Americans - many of them younger consumers - have stopped using Facebook since 2017. On the other hand, Edison found, use of Instagram and Snapchat - both highly visual mediums - is on the rise, particularly among younger demographics.</p><p>Some credit unions have pulled back on their Facebook usage. As reported, Tennessee-based Old Hickory Credit Unionstopped using Facebooknearly three years ago following shifts in how consumers use the service. Some users have also distanced themselves from Facebook following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Still, Facebook's ad revenue has alsonearly doubledsince the first quarter of 2017, indicating plenty of businesses still see the site as a viable place for marketing.</p><p>As backlash against Facebook has widened and the social media landscape has diversified, many CUs have also similarly diversified their outreach efforts, broadening their reach to include Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and more. This strategy allows for additional opportunities to engage with consumers and promote products and services, but some analysts have historically cautioned that CUs who don't utilize a social platform well may be doing themselves more harm than they would by staying off that platform entirely.</p><p>San Diego County Credit Union has over 121,000 across Facebook and Twitter, but the $8.4 billion-asset shop is focusing on growing its reach via other platforms. Nathan Schmidt, EVP of brand strategy and digital channels, said SDCCU is currently emphasizing YouTube and Instagram rather than the original big two sites.</p><p>SDCCU is essentially following in consumers' footsteps, gravitating away from traditional social platforms toward more visual outlets. The credit union's most popular YouTube video is a minute-long demonstration of its mobile wallet, which has garnered 364,000 views. Despite shifting away from old-school sites, Schmidt said San Diego County isn't abandoning Facebook and would only \"consider leaving a social media platform if it is no longer a relevant tool to engage with current and potential members.\"</p><p>With2.45 billion users, Facebook dominates the social media environment and is the largest social network worldwide. Meredith Olmstead, CEO and founder of FI GROW SOLUTIONS, suggested credit unions should also remember who really benefits from businesses using social media sites.</p><p>\"Facebook has always owned Facebook and Twitter owns Twitter, so you have very little control over their policies and procedures and they can change those rules and regulations if they want to,\" she said.</p><p>In line with that, Facebook recently changed its advertising terms, rejecting some ads from financial institutions in the wake of a legal settlement following allegations advertisers were violating fair lending regulations.

Candeub joined the agency as deputy assistant secretary of commerce in April (see 2005010060). Leadership has been fluid since David Redl left in May 2019. Doug Kinkoph had most recently been acting head and now returns to run the Office of Telecommunications and Information Applications. Having someone take charge at NTIA is \"sorely needed,\" said R Street Institute Resident Fellow-Technology and Innovation Jeffrey Westling. He noted Candeub's strong background with Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, though the agency hasn't dealt extensively with the tech liability shield. Candeub previously sought a Section 230 update, suggesting Big Tech should follow the same rules as other regulated industries. NTIA's role in President Donald Trump's social media executive order is largely complete (see 2007280053), as it filed its petition for rulemaking with the FCC, Westling said. Candeub is on a leave of absence from Michigan State University, where he's a professor of law and director of the Intellectual Property, Information and Communications Law Program.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KF-2MV1-JC8G-805B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"195\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 11, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;
