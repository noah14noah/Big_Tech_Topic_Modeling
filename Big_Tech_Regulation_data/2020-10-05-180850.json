Since Dec. 31, the Nasdaq Composite Index is up 6.7 per cent, while the S&amp;;P/TSX Composite Index gained more than seven per cent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The market's bounceback hasn't comforted Horizons ETFs portfolio manager Hans Albrecht, who describes it as a \"show-me-first market\" - one that requires positive results to convince investors to buy in. With Apple, Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. each reporting this week, it's set to get its first major test of 2019.</p><p>The FAANGs may be bloodied, but they are just as dominant as ever( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/investing/investing-pro/the-faangs-are-bloodied-but-just-as-dominant-as-ever\">https://business.financialpost.com/investing/investing-pro/the-faangs-are-bloodied-but-just-as-dominant-as-ever</url> )</p><p>Revisiting the value of value: Buying FAANG has made investing easy, maybe too easy( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/financial-post-magazine/revisiting-the-value-of-value-buying-faang-stocks-has-made-investing-easy-perhaps-too-easy\">https://business.financialpost.com/financial-post-magazine/revisiting-the-value-of-value-buying-faang-stocks-has-made-investing-easy-perhaps-too-easy</url> )</p><p>Moguls or slopestyle: What kind of portfolio do you have?( <url normalizedValue=\"https://business.financialpost.com/investing/investing-pro/moguls-or-slopestyle-what-kind-of-portfolio-do-you-have\">https://business.financialpost.com/investing/investing-pro/moguls-or-slopestyle-what-kind-of-portfolio-do-you-have</url> )</p><p>\"I think the market is on tenterhooks,\" said Albrecht, who runs a covered-call fund that is made up of some of the largest tech companies in the world. \"I think at any moment we could see a resumption of that selling.\"</p><p>Of the tech giants, Albrecht and KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Andy Hargreaves agree that Apple is the one investors should be most concerned with. In terms of its impact on the market, Apple's earnings could signal broader issues in the global market, Hargreaves said.</p><p>In a letter to investors, Apple CEO Tim Cook already warned that revenue for the company's first fiscal quarter, which ended on Dec. 29, would be 15 per cent weaker than expected, blaming the shortfall on iPhone sales in China.</p><p>Although the company, which shocked analysts last year by announcing it would no longer publish iPhone sales numbers before posting an earnings miss, has already announced its bad news, analysts are still in the dark over guidance. Should those numbers fail to impress, it would suggest to Hargreaves that the company's issues have seeped into its other products and other geographical locations. Even though Apple's stock has plunged more than 33 per cent since hitting a peak in October, it remains a risky play.</p><p>\"I'm still of the view that there's more risk there than opportunity for upside even with the big reset because the perception there is that it's still mostly a China issue ... and that the rest of the world is fine,\" Hargreaves said.</p><p>While poorly received guidance from Apple could offer yet another sign of a global slowdown and convince investors to sell, an earnings miss for Facebook would be treated differently, Hargreaves said. For the social media company, which has seen headline risk mainly over privacy concerns, a miss would instead be seen as a company-specific problem, lessening its potential to drag the market down.</p><p>According to BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Salmon, the stock is still expected to outperform as long as \"Custom Audiences capabilities are not hindered by regulation and negative press doesn't thwart agencies/brands, but visibility remains low.\"</p><p>Due to the possible return of volatility, Albrecht suggested investors should dip into the options market for protection. Buying puts on the individual names would leave investors at the mercy of inflated volatility, he said. He suggests buying six-month to one-year put options on the Nasdaq Composite Index with a 12 per cent strike range on the downside, he said. They're more expensive than short-term puts, he said, but would protect investors in the event the FAANG stocks are responsible for volatility returning to the market.</p><p>\"Spend your money on your insurance like you would for your house or your car and hope you don't need it,\" Albrecht said. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Six months on and with some big gains locked in, investors are starting to fret over the recovery ahead, with the Fed warning that the US economic recovery would suffer if there is no further stimulus and the UK set for a longer winter of discontent. On Thursday morning, European equities traded lower but pared early losses after the first hour of trading. Asia was notably weaker. German business confidence improved a fraction. Donald Trump said he could overrule the FDA's plans to introduce tougher standards for authorising a coronavirus vaccine.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                     The S&amp;P 500 closed near its lows of the day, falling over 2.3 per cent to 3,236 on broad market weakness as both tech/growth declined alongside cyclicals. The index is close to correction territory again - from its intra-day high at 3,588 the 10 per cent corrective move sits at 3,229, Monday's low point. On a closing basis, it's 3,222. What's remarkable is that through all this selling, Treasuries are unmoved - 10s continue to print around the 0.67 per cent region - why are bonds just not moving through all this equity market selling? </p><p>                     Whilst we can look at the rampant speculation and excessive valuations in big tech stocks unwinding over the course of September, we are seeing broader declines in other sectors that indicates deteriorating risk sentiment as we head into the autumn. There may be several reasons behind this - less certainty over a vaccine emerging soon, second wave fears, the realisation that consumer confidence and spending in the economy will slump unless governments continue to inject stimulus and the usual volatility before the US election. Trump continues to tease with comments around not committing to a smooth transition of power - of course there is no risk that he would somehow carry out a coup, but equally I fear there is almost no chance the election result will be confirmed on the night. Gore/Bush 2000 seems likely to be repeated but things are far nastier, far more polarised now than then. </p><p>                     More broadly perhaps we can put the sell-off in equities down to fading momentum in the economic recovery - PMIs are showing weakness, whilst other measures of economic activity indicate a levelling-off after the bounce back over the summer - at the same as there is no fresh stimulus emerging either on the fiscal or the monetary side. Whilst central banks continue to stress that they will do whatever it takes, few additional concrete steps have been taken lately. Washington appears gridlocked over fiscal support.</p><p>                     Fed speakers issued a series of warnings about the path of recovery in the US. Jay Powell warned Americans would burn through savings and find it harder to sell their homes. Boston Fed president Rosengren warned of a 'credit crunch' by the end of the year with community and regional banks likely to come under pressure from more bad loans as businesses are forced to close. Cleveland Fed president Mester also called for more fiscal stimulus to support the fragile recovery. Goldman Sachs lowered its quarter-on-quarter GDP growth estimate for Q4 to 3 per cent from 6 per cent, implying the economy contracting 2.5 per cent in the quarter. Powell and Treasury Sec Mnuchin speak later today. Also watch the weekly jobless claims numbers, with initial claims seen at 845k.</p><p>                     In the UK, chancellor Rishi Sunak is abandoning his planned Budget for a short-term round of targeted measures, which he will announce later today. This is likely to feature more targeted support for sectors like hospitality and travel. It's clear on both sides of the pond that unless there is more fiscal support, the economic recovery will go into neutral and stall. Only three weeks ago the government implored us to get back to the office to support city centres - what's strange is that they did this without realising that cases would rise. Their risk tolerance for the spread is extremely low, which indicates a government operating on the fly.</p><p>                     UK Company Announcements                   </p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"312\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"312\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cineworld (                           CINE)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">The cinema operator's shares tumbled 17 per cent after the release of its interim results, in which Cineworld warned that it may have to raise additional funds if the government's tightening of coronavirus restrictions force it to close its estate or delay film releases. Cineworld has already raised $361m in liquidity during the period.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">National Express (NEX)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">The transport operator is trading slightly ahead of its previous revenue forecast, which suggested turnover would sit at around half of pre-pandemic targets until the close of August. Its UK bus businesses continue to have their costs underwritten by the government, while National Express is now operating two-thirds of its US school bus service.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Avon Rubber                            (AVON)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">The group has been awarded a sole-source contract to develop and supply the next-generation 'integrated head protection system' to the US army. Worth up to $93m (\u00a373m), it follows on from an existing contract that is due to end in 2021. Meanwhile, the $130m acquisition of helmet supplier Team Wendy - which was announced earlier this month - is US awaiting regulatory approval and is expected to complete by the end of this year.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">United Utilities                           (UU.)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Revenue for the six months to 30 September is expected to be 5 per cent lower than a year earlier, partly thanks to changes to allowed regulatory returns but also because business closures have seen less water used during the pandemic. With an increase in infrastructure renewal expenditure, underlying operating profit is also guided to fall year-on-year.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Pets at Home (PETS)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">The pet retailer and service provider's shares leapt 15 per cent in early trading after upgrading its profit forecasts, ahead of consensus estimates of \u00a373m in pre-tax profits. Sales momentum has continued to grow since the summer in its retail and vet activities, providing double-digit sales growth in its eight weeks to 10 September.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">DFS (DFS)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">DFS fell into a full-year pre-tax loss of \u00a381.2m, as lower sales caused by the pandemic depressed margins, while the retailer recorded \u00a316.6m in charges linked to the review of its smaller brands.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mitchells &amp; Butlers (MAB)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">The government's Eat Out to Help Out scheme propelled Mitchells &amp; Butler's food sales in August, which rose by a fifth and returned the pub and restaurant group to small like-for-like sales growth for the month. Sales are down 3.1 per cent for the year to 19 September.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Go-Ahead Group (GOG)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">The transport operator fell into a pre-tax loss of \u00a30.2m for its year ending 27 June, having racked up \u00a357.1m in exceptional costs linked to asset impairment and restructuring in its bus and German rail activities.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Smiths Group (SMIN)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">The group has included the delayed interim dividend of 11p to a final dividend of 24p for a total dividend of 35p per share, down 46 per cent on the prior year, as sales for the conglomerate held firm, while free cash flow was on the rise despite the disruption wrought by Covid-19.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">CVS (CVSG)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Like-for-like sales growth of 8 per cent in the first eight months of the full financial year declined to 0.7 per cent because of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. But the first couple of months of the new year have \"been encouraging\" and management pointed to the \"favourable market and consumer trends\" of the animal market.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>                     Dollar strength is weighing on its major peers as well as gold and silver, although the greenback's advance just paused for a while this morning. Sterling has retreated to its weakest level for two months and is current sitting on the 38.2 per cent retracement with the 100-day line turning into near-term resistance. The pound remains exposed to several strong headwinds, including the risk of a no-deal Brexit, negative rates and a deeper and longer-lasting economic collapse than peers. Meanwhile gold fell below $1850 and has retreated 10 per cent from the recent all-time high but found support at the 100-day DMA. Silver has broken the trend line after some very nasty price action over the last few days, but it too has found support around its 100-day line.</p><p>                     Cable holds 1.2690 for now, 100-day line becomes resistance.                   </p><p>                     Dollar index advances with three white soldiers candle formation and possible gap close to 96?                   </p><p>                     Silver tests 100-day line                   </p><p>                     Neil Wilson is chief markets analyst at Markets.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-66235056</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X7-45C1-DY4H-K2GT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1462\"/><timeReceived>9:50 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Every Tech Company Wants to Be a Bank\u2014Someday, At Least[2] from Wired - Much has been written about how and why big tech will make moves into financial services. </p><p>This piece in Wired is one of the best I have read. OCC proposes 'Madden fix' to let loans keep original rates when transferred[3] from S...lobal - There has been movement on the 'Madden Fix' with the OCC proposing a rule change to clarify the valid-when-made doctrine so when a bank sells or assigns a loan the interest rate remains permissible after the loan changes hands.

Charter or not, fintechs are already 'banking'[12] from American Banker - I like Todd Baker's take on the paradox of #fintech banking regulation.

However, corporate market power is hard to measure and common indicators such as market concentration or profit rates can be misleading.Our Chart of the Week shows that the issue is broad and goes beyond Big Tech. It is based on an upcoming IMF working paper using data for publicly listed companies from 74 countries. </p><p>Specifically, the chart tracks average markups on goods and services across all companies, comparing pricing in advanced and emerging and developing economies. A markup is how much a company charges for its products compared with how much it costs to produce an additional unit of this product, expressed as a ratio. This provides a measure of market power.<url normalizedValue=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nXMzTL61SkE/WxlsMGNY_vI/AAAAAAAAJAw/uznFUUgRIrku8YF3s8kdOcxAjjbYzJeYwCLcBGAs/s1600/eng-may-30-cotw-corporategiants-1.png\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nXMzTL61SkE/WxlsMGNY_vI/AAAAAAAAJAw/uznFUUgRIrku8YF3s8kdOcxAjjbYzJeYwCLcBGAs/s1600/eng-may-30-cotw-corporategiants-1.png</url> The chart unveils two clear facts. First, markups among advanced economies have significantly increased since the 1980s, by 43 percent on average, and this trend has accelerated during the present decade. Second, among emerging market and developing economies, the rise of markups is much more moderate, a 5 percent increase on average since 1990.More in-depth analysis shows that the increase in markups in advanced economies is mostly driven by 'superstar' firms that managed to increase their market power further, while markups in other firms have essentially been flat. Interestingly, this pattern is found in all broad economic sectors, not just in information and communication technology.Should we be concerned about this rise in corporate market power in advanced economies? The short answer is yes, especially if this trend continues. Our paper finds that, starting from low levels, higher markups are initially associated withincreasinginvestment and innovation, but this relationship becomes negative when market power becomes too strong. Further, the link between markups and investment and innovation is more strongly negative in industries featuring higher degrees of market concentration.The paper also finds a negative association in firms between labor shares and markups, implying that the labor share of income declines in industries where market power rises. In other words, with higher market power, the share of firms' revenue going to workers decreases, while the share of revenue going to profits increases.What are the policy implications? These will depend on the factors behind this increase in global market power, which are still being debated. Possible culprits include the rise of intangible assets such as software, network effects (when a product's value to the user increases as the number of users of the product grows), or weaker anti-trust enforcement. More research is needed to discriminate between them.An upcomingconference[9], organized by the IMF, the World Bank, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, will delve into corporate market power, competition policies, product market (de)regulation, and their macroeconomic effects.Watch a video on 'Digitalization and the New Gilded Age[10]' during a seminar at the 2018 IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://players.brightcove.net/45228659001/rkPdEdoaW_default/index.html?videoId=5772879577001\">https://players.brightcove.net/45228659001/rkPdEdoaW_default/index.html?videoId=5772879577001</url>[11]IMFBlog[12]is a forum for the views of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff and officials on pressing economic and policy issues of the day.

That's what happened to Facebook in after-hours trading on July 25, 2018.David A. Kirsch[1], an entrepreneurship professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business, says the social media giant is getting squeezed from two directions. 'You're getting pressure on margins on the bottom line, and pressure on growth on the top line,' says Kirsch,co-author ofBubbles and Crashes: The Boom and Bust of Technological Innovation[2] (Stanford University Press, 2019).

While critics take aim at big oil, big pharma, big banks, big agribusiness and other industries, big tech largely has escaped the wrath. 'Where has big tech been in all of this? Just sitting with a Cheshire Cat grin on their faces, laughing all the way to the bank,' Kirsch says. Recent judgments against Google, chaos at Tesla, and fallout at Facebook with Cambridge Analytica have helped to wipe the smirk off their faces. Kirsch says questions surrounding data management and consumer privacy will force long-term, sweeping changes across the industry. \"We are the product, and people may at some point get tired of being the product,\" he says. \"And if they do become tired of being the product, then the business model is no longer sustainable.\" Kirsch says Facebook has lived for many years in a \"free-range state,\" where the company was able to make money off the scale of the platform without any responsibility for the content of the speech. \"Now they're having to take some responsibility for the speech on their platform,\" he says. Artificial intelligence can assist with flagging hate speech, libel and \"fake news.\" But platforms like Facebook eventually have to hire humans to vet content if they want to publish responsibly. \"And that costs money,\" Kirsch says. \"Their margins have to fall.\" Squeezed from Above The second factor driving Facebook's fall could be market saturation. \"Facebook has been growing at very, very high rates for quarter after quarter, year after year,\" Kirsch says. \"The numbers are staggering.\" The growth eventually must taper, especially with new restrictions from sources like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe. The question is how far stock prices will fall before Facebook hits bottom and rebounds. Overall, Kirsch says, the company's position remains strong. \"What could replace Facebook?\" he asks. \"For the time being, I don't see any threat. From that perspective this is just an adjustment.\" Article BySmith Brain Trust[5], University Of Maryland's Robert H.

That would not just hit the profits of social media sites, but all types of technology firms.</p><p>Shares in FTSE 250-listed cyber-security specialists Sophos Group slumped 5.4 per cent, or 25.2p, to 444.6p, making it the biggest faller among British tech companies. IQE, the Cardiff company that makes chips for Apple's iPhone, fell 4.9 per cent, or 6.6p, to 126.9p while software firms Aveva (down 1. per cent, or 20p, to 1880p) and Sage (down 0.8 per cent, or 5.4p, to 643.8p) also lost ground.</p><p>The Polar Capital Technology Trust, which invests in dozens of tech firms, including Facebook, dived 4.5 per cent, or 50p, to 1062p as investors fled the sector.</p><p>But the FTSE 100 avoided negative territory as a result of strong showings for healthcare and utilities firms. It ended the day up 0.64 per cent, or 44.6 points, at 7044.74.</p><p>Water company United Utilities' shares soared near the top of the flagship index a day after it announced bullish revenue and profits forecasts. Its shares shot up 8.3 per cent, or 55.6p, to 724p.</p><p>Miners propped up the blue-chip index as the dollar strengthened and the price of oil and metals fell. Evraz had the toughest day of UK-listed miners, falling 6.1 per cent, or 27.4p, to 425.2p. It was followed by Antofagasta (down 3.9 per cent, or 37p, to 910.8p), Anglo American (down 3.8 per cent, or 64.2p, to 1616.8p) and Glencore (down 2.9 per cent, or 10.35p, to 353.15p).</p><p>On to the Aim index.

A consortium of Chinese firms, led by Apec Energy, has bought a 50 per cent stake.</p><p>Steve Boldy, Lansdowne's chief executive, said: 'The Chinese consortium brings a wealth of technical and operational expertise and experience and we look forward to finalising the details of the drilling programme that is expected to move the project forward to development.' Lansdowne shares jumped 26.4 per cent, or 0.35p, to 1.68p while Providence's leapt 17 per cent, or 1.6p, to 11p.</p><p>Esports firm Gfinity went cap in hand to investors to fund video game events.

But investors were not impressed and shares slid 3.1 per cent, or 0.38p, to 11.75p.</p><p>Stellar results heated up the shares of refrigerated warehouse provider Norish.

Major Dow stocks like Apple and Intel with big exposure to Chinese markets took hard hits. Boeing dropped sharply on reports its troubled 737 Max plane  for use during the crucial holiday travel season.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The market's negative move comes as recent data and trade-related news suggest the U.S. economy may have a rough patch ahead.</p><p>Following the U.S. imposition Sunday of 15% tariffs on Chinese goods including clothes, electronics and tools, China retaliated by raising its own duties from 5% to 10% on American goods, including soybeans, drugs and crude oil.</p><p>Meanwhile, fresh data suggests an economic slowdown is on the way. The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index slid to 49.1, way below the 51.3 consensus estimate and below the expansion-contraction line of 50. It's the first time in three years that the widely followed index has dropped into contraction, and suggests that the manufacturing sector may be falling into recession.</p><p>Amid the glum news, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.2%, with many Dow stocks off, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 1.4%. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.9%, as the small-cap Russell 2000 Index moved down 1.3%. All three major indexes finished down for August: the Dow fell 1.7%, the S&amp;P lost 1.8%, and the Nasdaq shed 2.6%.</p><p>Volume was heavy late Tuesday. Both NYSE and Nasdaq turnover swelled just over 21% in afternoon trading.</p><p>Among Dow stocks, Apple dropped 1.6% and Intel fell 1% on the China news.

The VanEck\u00a0Vectors Semiconductor ETF plunged 1.7%, showing that the decline in chip stocks was broad.</p><p>Along with chip bellwether Intel,\u00a0Texas Instruments dropped 1.9%. Micron Technology fell 1.1%, while Nvidia tumbled 2.3%. Qualcomm shed 3.9%.</p><p>But, even among the gloomy news, not all stocks fell. With gold and silver once again in vogue due to economic turmoil, a number of mining names made solid gains.</p><p>FrancoNevada added 0.9%. It's No. 3 in its industry group, and has a 96 . But its  of 76 is a red flag for growth investors.</p><p>Meanwhile, industry leader\u00a0Kirkland Lake Gold rose 1.6%. Kirkland Lake has a stellar 99 Composite Rating and has been a mainstay on the . After testing its 50-day moving average in recent months, Kirkland Lake is now well-extended above its 37.84  out of an early summer .</p><p>Meanwhile, No. 2-rated SSR Mining jumped 3.5%.

SSR has a strong 98 Composite Rating, but a weakish 71 EPS Rating.</p><p>Martin Marietta, the focus of a recent\u00a0 rose 2.5%.</p><p>A number of utilities also hit or got close to new highs, including\u00a0NextEra Energy,\u00a0American Water Works\u00a0and\u00a0Evergy.</p><p>Among exchange traded funds,\u00a0Innovator IBD 50 ETF \u00a0The growth-stock-based ETF remains below its 50-day line.</p><p>Please follow Jones on Twitter at @IBD_TJones for more on growth stocks, financial markets and the economy.</p><p>YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:</p><p/><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-4935756</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYW-HDD1-DYTD-92J5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"576\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

The market was driven higher by technology, consumer discretionary and industrial company stocks, which more than offset the drop in drug makers. </p><p>BRIEFLY</p><p>STARBUCKS ENDING NEWSPAPER SALES: Newspapers at Starbucks are yesterday's news. Starbucks will quit selling The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today and local papers in more than 8,600 U.S. stores in September, citing \"changing customer behavior.\" This isn't the first time Starbucks has decided old media is too passe for its cafes. Remember CDs? Sales of those ended in 2015. </p><p>PRODUCER PRICES RISE MODESTLY: The Labor Department said Friday that its producer price index, which measures inflation before it reaches consumers, rose 0.1 percent last month, same as the increase in May. Wholesale prices rose 1.7 percent from June 2018. Toss out volatile food and energy prices and wholesale inflation rose 0.3 percent last month from May and 2.3 percent from a year earlier. </p><p>MORTGAGE RATES LITTLE CHANGED: U.S. long-term mortgage rates were mostly unchanged this week amid signals from the Federal Reserve that it is preparing to cut interest rates soon. Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday that the average rate on the benchmark 30-year mortgage stood at 3.75 percent, the same as the previous week. A year ago the rate stood at 4.53 percent.</p><p>APPLE FIXING WALKIE TALKIE APP BUG: Apple says it's fixing a security flaw affecting the Walkie Talkie app on Apple Watch. The company said Friday it has temporarily disabled a feature that could have allowed someone to listen through another person's iPhone without that person's consent. Apple says it's not easy to exploit the bug to spy on a customer and there's no evidence anyone has done so. The company says it plans to fix the problem quickly.</p><p>IRELAND ADDRESSES GOOGLE BREACH: Google faces a possible investigation by Irish data privacy regulators related to reports that contractors had been able to listen to audio of users of its digital assistant technology. The Irish Data Protection Commission is Google's main privacy watchdog in the EU and could, if serious violations are found, levy hefty fines under the bloc's new data protection rules.

Though written with a distinct aloofness, The Great Convergence reflects the Davos class's interpretation of the current economic order, and its conclusions lie behind every centrist politician who has suggested that working class jobs \"aren't coming back\" and that the great unwashed \"learn to code.\" The Age of Surveillance Capitalism gives voice and grand historical sweep to the post-2016 anxieties of the political, technological, and media elite about the extent to which large technology companies and social media are driving and profiting from extremism, \"fake news,\" and the destruction of democratic discourse in favor of \"hive collectives\" that terrify them on both the Left and the Right. While each book has serious insights to offer, what each leaves out reveals the delusions and taboos of our ruling class.</p><p>In The Great Convergence, Richard Baldwin argues that globalization underwent a fundamental shift at the end of the 20th century. If the first globalization was about a radical lowering in the cost of moving goods that made new kinds of economic structures profitable, the New Globalization was the result of a radical lowering of the cost of communications and moving \"ideas,\" by which Baldwin means everything from intellectual property and manufacturing know-how to up-to-the-minute data on parts inventories. The result was that capital and know-how could move labor (outsourcing) anywhere across the world, not only at the level of a final product, but for any aspect of the global supply chains that underlie modern economics.</p><p>Baldwin makes some subtle distinctions that are often lost in discussions about deindustrialization and outsourcing. Because success in the New Globalization is about the optimal production in global supply chains, the unit of international competition has shrunk from the sector or firm level to that of subcontractors and individual jobs. But, paradoxically, some of this unbundling actually makes it easier to keep manufacturing in developed nations; outsourcing the manufacture of automobile wiring harnesses to Vietnam means lost American jobs, but a vehicle whose every component was \"made in America\" would be globally uncompetitive. These changes have made 20th-century industrial policy hopelessly out of date. Tax cuts or subsidies for research and development will not necessarily have job-creating spillover effects if firms intend to offshore actual production while maintaining management and profits in the developed country.</p><p>Driven by the political and economic geography of global supply chains, the narrowness of the New Globalization is astounding. The titular convergence is the convergence of developing and developed world economies, but all relative growth in developing-world GDP and the vast majority of the billions of people lifted out of poverty in the 20th century came from just 11 developing nations that benefited directly or indirectly from the global supply chain revolution. The reason, according to Baldwin, is that the reduced cost of sharing ideas is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for unbundling, which still requires strong property and contract rights, reliable and reasonably skilled labor, accessible transportation (for when in-person visits are required), and entr\u00e9e into a particular global supply chain, particularly those of manufacturing behemoths Germany, Japan, and the United States. As a result, particular patterns of integration emerged: GermanyPoland, the United States-Mexico, and Japan-Taiwan-China.</p><p>But Baldwin's explanation for these colossal re-workings of the global economy fall short. He attributes almost the entire movement to the rise of information and communications technologies, lending everything an air of technological inevitability. The demise of American industry was just as inevitable in his telling as the emergence of global trade in the Age of Sail. The obvious alternatives are not considered. American manufacturing in China developed in the aftermath of the Chinese switching sides in the Cold War, and was part and parcel of an overarching and geopolitically aware development strategy. It was not technology that kept German and American companies out of Polish and Mexican towns only miles away, but the legal and political barriers.</p><p>A more radical narrative would look at the Great Convergence as the ultimate fruit of an atomistic, anti-nationalist vision for economic order. The postwar American project, in seeking to try to make the world safe for capitalism, faced two entangled challenges: to reduce barriers to trade, and to stave off working-class discontent. While at first export-oriented, it became clear by the 1980s that the combination was equally powerful in the other direction: reducing barriers to imports (driven by the GATT process) could place the working class into a vise between outsourcing and cost-reducing compromise. Labor recalcitrance could be punished by outsourcing, while outsourcing sent a message to American workers to get with the program and provided political cover for the pursuit of anti-labor policies for the sake of \"competitiveness.\" The end of the Cold War spread this vision around the world with alarming speed, because it left the United States and its allies in substantial control of international investment, development aid, and the global financial system. Contra Baldwin, the developing world changing its tune on trade protectionism was not due to education or enlightenment, but the firm carrots and sticks of the Washington Consensus.</p><p>That doesn't mean that information technology doesn't play an important role in this process. Baldwin is correct that new communications links make a certain intensity of competition of coordination more viable (like outsourcing just-in-time parts deliveries or customer service phone calls). But it plays a role in appeasing the disenfranchised working class as well; hundreds of thousands of young men who can't find decently paid work are compensating with alluring entertainment and video games. But outsourcing wasn't the inevitable result of technological change, and encouraging the \"onshoring\" of American jobs isn't just about productivity and labor costs, but about creating a level playing field that compensates for foreign protectionism, subsidies, financial manipulation, shoddy regulation, and a tax structure that rewards shipping American jobs overseas.</p><p>Where Baldwin provides an accessible framing of contemporary economics, Zuboff's Age of Surveillance Capitalism aims to conceptualize and clarify a new mode of capitalism. Her book is well-timed, as in the wake of 2016, Big Tech companies are under fire from the Right by conservatives upset about perceived platform bias and from the Left by those of our credulous elites who believe that Russian trolls buying political Facebook ads represents a vital threat to our democracy.</p><p>Zuboff's fundamental idea is that a new form of capitalism is emerging based around a new form of surplus- the capturing, storing, processing, and reselling of information about human behavior. This \"behavioral surplus\" is akin to the labor surplus of classical Marxist analysis (the gap between the cost of capital and labor and what products can be sold for), except that the exchange occurs not only within the realm of economic activity but in and across every area of life, as human activity is increasingly mediated through the digital realm. Whereas Marx's alienation of labor separated and commoditized human creativity from the human creator and their conditions of life, surveillance capitalism's alienation of behavior creates and commoditizes a golem of human life that is controllable and predictable (able to be repurposed for marketing, financial predictions, etc.) quite apart from, and perhaps opposed to the interests of, the human beings whose data is being threshed to create these predictive models.</p><p>The phenomenology of this book is better than its political economy. Zuboff captures something of the experience of living with surveillance capitalism, of having one's experiences captured, reprocessed, and resold to you with the poking and prodding and nudging of cybernetic systems. Zuboff's book is overflowing with sociological insight on subjects ranging from how the 1960s led to a change in how digital capitalism is experienced (by fostering a demand for individualization) to the role of the 2000 dot-com bust in forcing Google's premature embrace of advertising. Steady insight and clever anecdotes, matched with Zuboff's crisp writing, help maintain the reader's interest far longer than most inches-thick doorstoppers with \"capital\" in the title. But Zuboff seems enamored of the supposed \"unprecedentedness\" of her argument. She describes modern data scientists as the descendants of behavioral scientist B.F. Skinner but fails to contend with the classic critique of behavioralism: that it simply doesn't work. Nowhere in her 30-page index will one find mention of cybernetics, the postwar scientific discipline that gave rise to modern artificial intelligence research and had many of the same utopian aspirations as today's tech prophets, and faced many of the same critiques.</p><p>Zuboff constructs a new vocabulary to describe and elaborate her notions of \"behavioral surplus\" and the new institutional forms and practices it is leading to. At times, this comes across as tautological and hysterical. Zuboff seems to take for granted that Google displaying a search ad for Starbucks in the morning when one might be in want of a caffeinated buzz is a sinister \"interven [tion] in our experience to shape our behavior in ways that favor surveillance capitalists commercial outcomes,\" with new \"automated protocols designed to influence and modify human behavior at scale as the means of production is subordinated to a new and more complex means of behavioral modification\" Could not one describe a Coca-Cola radio ad playing on a hot summer's day the same way? As thinkers like Adorno understood generations ago, molding and hijacking desire is an essential aspect of modern capitalism. The surveillance capitalism might be using powerful new means, but it is hardly the \"mutation\" from some other hypothetical, more humanistic version of capitalism that Zuboff says it is.</p><p>This is a book to be wrestled with, and others are (Evgeny Morozovs biting 17,000-word review feels as long as the book). But no one has yet addressed what I believe to be the most telling problem with the book: that Zuboff is simply wrong about how companies like Google and Facebook make money. Zuboff asserts that, following Google's construction of a rudimentary ad personalization system, \"henceforth, revenues and growth would depend upon more behavioral surplus.\" This is, in fact, the central claim of the book: that a new form of capitalism that depends upon the capture and exploitation of behavioral surplus is emerging. But she provides zero evidence for this claim and, for a business school professor, seems uninterested in analyzing Google and Facebooks sources of profit. She interviews data scientists and innovators, but no MBAs, accountants, or lawyers.</p><p>Facebook and Google make money when users click on ads. Surveillancebased personalization increases the click-through-rate (the percentage of ads shown that are clicked on) from the low single digits.. .to the slightly higher single digits. The most important surveillancebased marginal improvements in ad performance are the most trivial. If you submit a Google search for an appliance part or visit an online shop, you'll see ads for dryer motors and such for a little while. You can find them with about the same accuracy as TV-demographic or periodical advertisements. Google and Facebook have actually made high-quality, targeted advertising much more accessible to small businesses-large corporations have always benefited from the kinds of \"behavioral modification\" Zuboff is worried about. A minuscule fraction of these ads, of course, are actually clicked on: about 2 percent for search ads (where you are actively looking for the thing being advertised) and a whopping 0.3 percent for display ads on websites. If Google gave up all of the \"surveillance\" behaviors Zuboff identified and limited themselves to personalizing ads based on search terms alone, the quality of ads would decline only marginally. The volume of clicked-on ads, and the prices advertisers are willing to pay for them, determine revenues.</p><p>If Google's profits do not, in fact, rely on \"behavioral surplus,\" where do they come from? Whence sustainable profits in capitalism always come: monopoly. Even as internet usage has exploded worldwide, Google maintains 92 percent of all search market share. But search is only a small portion of Google's overall ad sales. The fundamental currency of the internet is not surveillance or data but attention. As internet video was first becoming feasible, Google bought YouTube. As display and banner ads sales on websites became automated, Google acquired Doubleclick, the market leader in web advertising. Google's profits emerge not because they are so good at personalizing ads to you, but because almost every ad you see on the internet is actually a Google ad.</p><p>Peter Thiel has Googles number. In a remarkable exchange with then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Thiel pointed to Google's then-$50 billion pile of cash as evidence that Google is no longer a technology company, but a monopolist (protected by intellectual property, network effects, and the ability to acquire or destroy any real competitors). Within Zuboff's framework, Google should be making capital investments to acquire ever more data. It generally isn't doing that; its biggest investments are in machine learning, data centers, cloud infrastructure, real estate, and acquisitions. It is heavily focused on competing for market share in enterprise cloud computing services (through Google Cloud) and maintaining market share for the future of advertising-mobile and voice computing. Within the logic of financial capitalism, the share value of a company depends on persuasive narratives of future profit, usually tied to how financial analysts see the growth trajectory of different sectors and business models over time.</p><p>So even if all of Googles profits are now and will for the foreseeable future emerge from network position and monopolistic control of huge swathes of internet architecture, the company cannot ever admit that, because it would indicate the company's future revenue growth had slowed and that it was vulnerable to antitrust action. It must therefore maintain what Thiel called \"the ministry of propaganda\"- \"moonshot\" high technology efforts like flying cars and quantum computing to achieve profitable breakthroughs. They seem straight out of science fiction because they are science fiction.</p><p>The profits and share prices of big technology companies also benefit from two specific legal strategies. The first is that they are businesses suspiciously well-tailored to avoid the enforcement of antitrust action, especially in the United States, where radically laissez-faire theories have made cost to the consumer essentially the only criterion (free service, no cost to consumers). More importantly, the ephemerality of internet companies makes it easy to book profits wherever one wishes. American businesses can sell ads to American consumers on American servers run by American engineers, but Google can book the profits in Ireland by claiming that its profits come from its intellectual property held there.</p><p>When Zuboff is writing on Silicon Valley's utopian aspirations, subtle new forms of manipulation and control, and how surveillance and information systems are being used to shape our minds and desires, she is compelling. But despite writing a book about capitalism, Zuboff has failed to follow the money. No doubt companies like Google and Facebook represent a new development in the history of capitalism. But that is due to as much to the combination of rapid scalability, monopoly, and effect on human consciousness as to surveillance or data accumulation. She has identified a real new struggle for power and profit, but one whose greatest impacts are yet to come.</p><p>An overemphasis on the exotic blinds Zuboff to the quotidian manipulations of attention, market power, and profit that are actually driving our new Gilded Age. And a focus on for-profit surveillance leads to almost no grappling with the role the state will play. The province of control and discipline has always been far more the interest of the state, and the greatest innovator of surveillance power is the Communist Party of China. Zuboff assumes that surveillance and data-based control systems in the West will be market-led; advanced surveillance systems coming home from the War on Terror should make us question this conclusion.</p><p>Perhaps a far more troubling problem for Zuboff's model is that it excludes precisely the kinds of behavioral modification that ought to worry us. For Zuboff, the concern is the gap between personalization aimed at the user's interests and personalized targeting for the surveillance capitalists profit (again, advertising). And yet, targeted, paid advertisements make up an infinitesimal fraction of how users experience platforms like Facebook and Google. All the evidence suggests that the organic behavior of users, and the ways it is amplified and channeled as personalized content to other users for the purposes of maximizing engagement, is the real challenge of these platforms for their content, and one that corporations are truly at a loss as to how to counter. What James Poulos calls the techno-gnostic empire of memory, hyper-individuation, and behavioral control is going to be way bigger, weirder, and more coercive than Google.</p><p>Baldwin claims his titular Great Convergence is the inevitable result of technological imperatives. Zuboff offers some minor tinkers to restrain the surveillance parts of surveillance capitalism, but still clings to the vision of capitalism restored to \"serve our genuine interests\" as consumers. Neither reckons with the philosophical and historical roots of the present populism. The outsourcing of American j obs was not the product of technological inevitability, but geopolitical shifts and a bipartisan elite assault on American workers. The new Gilded Age is not the product of \"the capture of behavioral surplus\" (real challenges though it raises), but of the exploitation of the American legal and political system to lock in extravagant shareholder returns on the backs of the American taxpayer. While these books have much to offer, do not accept their counsels of despair. The American people may yet assert the primacy of politics over economics, of self-government over artificial and usurious profit, and restrain the financial and corporate order built upon their backs. ?</p><p>Jonathan Askonas is an assistant professor of politics at the Catholic University of America and fellow at the Center for the Study of Statesmanship.</p><p>If Google's profits do not rely on \"behavioral surplus,\" where do they come from?

Though written with a distinct aloofness, The Great Convergence reflects the Davos class's interpretation of the current economic order, and its conclusions lie behind every centrist politician who has suggested that working class jobs \"aren't coming back\" and that the great unwashed \"learn to code.\" The Age of Surveillance Capitalism gives voice and grand historical sweep to the post-2016 anxieties of the political, technological, and media elite about the extent to which large technology companies and social media are driving and profiting from extremism, \"fake news,\" and the destruction of democratic discourse in favor of \"hive collectives\" that terrify them on both the Left and the Right. While each book has serious insights to offer, what each leaves out reveals the delusions and taboos of our ruling class.</p><p>In The Great Convergence, Richard Baldwin argues that globalization underwent a fundamental shift at the end of the 20th century. If the first globalization was about a radical lowering in the cost of moving goods that made new kinds of economic structures profitable, the New Globalization was the result of a radical lowering of the cost of communications and moving \"ideas,\" by which Baldwin means everything from intellectual property and manufacturing know-how to up-to-the-minute data on parts inventories. The result was that capital and know-how could move labor (outsourcing) anywhere across the world, not only at the level of a final product, but for any aspect of the global supply chains that underlie modern economics.</p><p>Baldwin makes some subtle distinctions that are often lost in discussions about deindustrialization and outsourcing. Because success in the New Globalization is about the optimal production in global supply chains, the unit of international competition has shrunk from the sector or firm level to that of subcontractors and individual jobs. But, paradoxically, some of this unbundling actually makes it easier to keep manufacturing in developed nations; outsourcing the manufacture of automobile wiring harnesses to Vietnam means lost American jobs, but a vehicle whose every component was \"made in America\" would be globally uncompetitive. These changes have made 20th-century industrial policy hopelessly out of date. Tax cuts or subsidies for research and development will not necessarily have job-creating spillover effects if firms intend to off-shore actual production while maintaining management and profits in the developed country.</p><p>Driven by the political and economic geography of global supply chains, the narrowness of the New Globalization is astounding. The titular convergence is the convergence of developing and developed world economies, but all relative growth in developing-world GDP and the vast majority of the billions of people lifted out of poverty in the 20th century came from just 11 developing nations that benefited directly or indirectly from the global supply chain revolution. The reason, according to Baldwin, is that the reduced cost of sharing ideas is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for unbundling, which still requires strong property and contract rights, reliable and reasonably skilled labor, accessible transportation (for when in-person visits are required), and entree into a particular global supply chain, particularly those of manufacturing behemoths Germany, Japan, and the United States. As a result, particular patterns of integration emerged: Germany-Poland, the United States-Mexico, and Japan-Taiwan-China.</p><p>But Baldwins explanation for these colossal re-workings of the global economy fall short. He attributes almost the entire movement to the rise of information and communications technologies, lending everything an air of technological inevitability. The demise of American industry was just as inevitable in his telling as the emergence of global trade in the Age of Sail. The obvious alternatives are not considered. American manufacturing in China developed in the aftermath of the Chinese switching sides in the Cold War, and was part and parcel of an overarching and geopolitically aware development strategy. It was not technology that kept German and American companies out of Polish and Mexican towns only miles away, but the legal and political barriers.</p><p>A more radical narrative would look at the Great Convergence as the ultimate fruit of an atomistic, anti-nationalist vision for economic order. The postwar American project, in seeking to try to make the world safe for capitalism, faced two entangled challenges: to reduce barriers to trade, and to stave off working-class discontent. While at first export-oriented, it became clear by the 1980s that the combination was equally powerful in the other direction: reducing barriers to imports (driven by the GATT process) could place the working class into a vise between outsourcing and cost-reducing compromise. Labor recalcitrance could be punished by outsourcing, while outsourcing sent a message to American workers to get with the program and provided political cover for the pursuit of anti-labor policies for the sake of \"competitiveness.\" The end of the Cold War spread this vision around the world with alarming speed, because it left the United States and its allies in substantial control of international investment, development aid, and the global financial system. Contra Baldwin, the developing world changing its tune on trade protectionism was not due to education or enlightenment, but the firm carrots and sticks of the Washington Consensus.</p><p>That doesn't mean that information technology doesn't play an important role in this process. Baldwin is correct that new communications links make a certain intensity of competition of coordination more viable (like outsourcing just-in-time parts deliveries or customer service phone calls). But it plays a role in appeasing the disenfranchised working class as well; hundreds of thousands of young men who can't find decently paid work are compensating with alluring entertainment and video games. But outsourcing wasn't the inevitable result of technological change, and encouraging the \"onshoring\" of American jobs isn't just about productivity and labor costs, but about creating a level playing field that compensates for foreign protectionism, subsidies, financial manipulation, shoddy regulation, and a tax structure that rewards shipping American jobs overseas.</p><p>Where Baldwin provides an accessible framing of contemporary economics, Zuboffs Age of Surveillance Capitalism aims to conceptualize and clarify a new mode of capitalism. Her book is well-timed, as in the wake of 2016, Big Tech companies are under fire from the Right by conservatives upset about perceived platform bias and from the Left by those of our credulous elites who believe that Russian trolls buying political Facebook ads represents a vital threat to our democracy.</p><p>Zuboffs fundamental idea is that a new form of capitalism is emerging based around a new form of surplus--the capturing, storing, processing, and reselling of information about human behavior. This \"behavioral surplus\" is akin to the labor surplus of classical Marxist analysis (the gap between the cost of capital and labor and what products can be sold for), except that the exchange occurs not only within the realm of economic activity but in and across every area of life, as human activity is increasingly mediated through the digital realm. Whereas Marx's alienation of labor separated and commoditized human creativity from the human creator and their conditions of life, surveillance capitalism's alienation of behavior creates and commoditizes a golem of human life that is controllable and predictable (able to be repurposed for marketing, financial predictions, etc.) quite apart from, and perhaps opposed to the interests of, the human beings whose data is being threshed to create these predictive models.</p><p>The phenomenology of this book is better than its political economy. Zuboff captures something of the experience of living with surveillance capitalism, of having one's experiences captured, reprocessed, and resold to you with the poking and prodding and nudging of cybernetic systems. Zuboffs book is overflowing with sociological insight on subjects ranging from how the 1960s led to a change in how digital capitalism is experienced (by fostering a demand for individualization) to the role of the 2000 dot-com bust in forcing Google's premature embrace of advertising. Steady insight and clever anecdotes, matched with Zuboffs crisp writing, help maintain the reader's interest far longer than most inches-thick doorstoppers with \"capital\" in the title. But Zuboff seems enamored of the supposed \"unprecedentedness\" of her argument. She describes modern data scientists as the descendants of behavioral scientist B.F. Skinner but fails to contend with the classic critique of behavioralism: that it simply doesn't work. Nowhere in her 30-page index will one find mention of cybernetics, the postwar scientific discipline that gave rise to modern artificial intelligence research and had many of the same utopian aspirations as todays tech prophets, and faced many of the same critiques.</p><p>Zuboff constructs a new vocabulary to describe and elaborate her notions of \"behavioral surplus\" and the new institutional forms and practices it is leading to. At times, this comes across as tautological and hysterical. Zuboff seems to take for granted that Google displaying a search ad for Starbucks in the morning when one might be in want of a caffeinated buzz is a sinister \"intervention] in our experience to shape our behavior in ways that favor surveillance capitalists commercial outcomes,\" with new \"automated protocols designed to influence and modify human behavior at scale as the means of production is subordinated to a new and more complex means of behavioral modification.\" Could not one describe a Coca-Cola radio ad playing on a hot summers day the same way? As thinkers like Adorno understood generations ago, molding and hijacking desire is an essential aspect of modern capitalism. The surveillance capitalism might be using powerful new means, but it is hardly the \"mutation\" from some other hypothetical, more humanistic version of capitalism that Zuboff says it is.</p><p>This is a book to be wrestled with, and others are (Evgeny Morozov's biting 17,000-word review feels as long as the book). But no one has yet addressed what I believe to be the most telling problem with the book: that Zuboff is simply wrong about how companies like Google and Facebook make money. Zuboff asserts that, following Google's construction of a rudimentary ad personalization system, \"henceforth, revenues and growth would depend upon more behavioral surplus.\" This is, in fact, the central claim of the book: that a new form of capitalism that depends upon the capture and exploitation of behavioral surplus is emerging. But she provides zero evidence for this claim and, for a business school professor, seems uninterested in analyzing Google and Facebooks sources of profit. She interviews data scientists and innovators, but no MBAs, accountants, or lawyers.</p><p>Facebook and Google make money when users click on ads. Surveillancebased personalization increases the click-through-rate (the percentage of ads shown that are clicked on) from the low single digits... to the slightly higher single digits. The most important surveillancebased marginal improvements in ad performance are the most trivial. If you submit a Google search for an appliance part or visit an online shop, you'll see ads for dryer motors and such for a little while. You can find them with about the same accuracy as TV-demographic or periodical advertisements. Google and Facebook have actually made high-quality, targeted advertising much more accessible to small businesses--large corporations have always benefited from the kinds of \"behavioral modification\" Zuboff is worried about. A minuscule fraction of these ads, of course, are actually clicked on: about 2 percent for search ads (where you are actively looking for the thing being advertised) and a whopping 0.3 percent for display ads on websites. If Google gave up all of the \"surveillance\" behaviors Zuboff identified and limited themselves to personalizing ads based on search terms alone, the quality of ads would decline only marginally. The volume of clicked-on ads, and the prices advertisers are willing to pay for them, determine revenues.</p><p>If Google's profits do not, in fact, rely on \"behavioral surplus,\" where do they come from? Whence sustainable profits in capitalism always come: monopoly. Even as internet usage has exploded worldwide, Google maintains 92 percent of all search market share. But search is only a small portion of Google's overall ad sales. The fundamental currency of the internet is not surveillance or data but attention. As internet video was first becoming feasible, Google bought YouTube. As display and banner ads sales on websites became automated, Google acquired Doubleclick, the market leader in web advertising. Google's profits emerge not because they are so good at personalizing ads to you, but because almost every ad you see on the internet is actually a Google ad.</p><p>Peter Thiel has Google's number. In a remarkable exchange with then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Thiel pointed to Google's then-$50 billion pile of cash as evidence that Google is no longer a technology company, but a monopolist (protected by intellectual property, network effects, and the ability to acquire or destroy any real competitors). Within Zuboff's framework, Google should be making capital investments to acquire ever more data. It generally isn't doing that; its biggest investments are in machine learning, data centers, cloud infrastructure, real estate, and acquisitions. It is heavily focused on competing for market share in enterprise cloud computing services (through Google Cloud) and maintaining market share for the future of advertising--mobile and voice computing. Within the logic of financial capitalism, the share value of a company depends on persuasive narratives of future profit, usually tied to how financial analysts see the growth trajectory of different sectors and business models over time.</p><p>So even if all of Google's profits are now and will for the foreseeable future emerge from network position and monopolistic control of huge swathes of internet architecture, the company cannot ever admit that, because it would indicate the company's future revenue growth had slowed and that it was vulnerable to antitrust action. It must therefore maintain what Thiel called \"the ministry of propaganda\"--\"moonshot\" high technology efforts like flying cars and quantum computing to achieve profitable breakthroughs. They seem straight out of science fiction because they are science fiction.</p><p>The profits and share prices of big technology companies also benefit from two specific legal strategies. The first is that they are businesses suspiciously well-tailored to avoid the enforcement of antitrust action, especially in the United States, where radically laissez-faire theories have made cost to the consumer essentially the only criterion (free service, no cost to consumers). More importantly, the ephemerality of internet companies makes it easy to book profits wherever one wishes. American businesses can sell ads to American consumers on American servers run by American engineers, but Google can book the profits in Ireland by claiming that its profits come from its intellectual property held there.</p><p>When Zuboff is writing on Silicon Valley's utopian aspirations, subtle new forms of manipulation and control, and how surveillance and information systems are being used to shape our minds and desires, she is compelling. But despite writing a book about capitalism, Zuboff has failed to follow the money. No doubt companies like Google and Facebook represent a new development in the history of capitalism. But that is due to as much to the combination of rapid scalability, monopoly, and effect on human consciousness as to surveillance or data accumulation. She has identified a real new struggle for power and profit, but one whose greatest impacts are yet to come.</p><p>An overemphasis on the exotic blinds Zuboff to the quotidian manipulations of attention, market power, and profit that are actually driving our new Gilded Age. And a focus on for-profit surveillance leads to almost no grappling with the role the state will play. The province of control and discipline has always been far more the interest of the state, and the greatest innovator of surveillance power is the Communist Party of China. Zuboff assumes that surveillance and data-based control systems in the West will be market-led; advanced surveillance systems coming home from the War on Terror should make us question this conclusion.</p><p>Perhaps a far more troubling problem for Zuboff s model is that it excludes precisely the kinds of behavioral modification that ought to worry us. For Zuboff, the concern is the gap between personalization aimed at the user's interests and personalized targeting for the surveillance capitalist's profit (again, advertising). And yet, targeted, paid advertisements make up an infinitesimal fraction of how users experience platforms like Facebook and Google. All the evidence suggests that the organic behavior of users, and the ways it is amplified and channeled as personalized content to other users for the purposes of maximizing engagement, is the real challenge of these platforms for their content, and one that corporations are truly at a loss as to how to counter. What James Poulos calls the techno-gnostic empire of memory, hyper-individuation, and behavioral control is going to be way bigger, weirder, and more coercive than Google.</p><p>Baldwin claims his titular Great Convergence is the inevitable result of technological imperatives. Zuboff offers some minor tinkers to restrain the surveillance parts of surveillance capitalism, but still clings to the vision of capitalism restored to \"serve our genuine interests\" as consumers. Neither reckons with the philosophical and historical roots of the present populism. The outsourcing of American jobs was not the product of technological inevitability, but geopolitical shifts and a bipartisan elite assault on American workers. The new Gilded Age is not the product of \"the capture of behavioral surplus\" (real challenges though it raises), but of the exploitation of the American legal and political system to lock in extravagant shareholder returns on the backs of the American taxpayer. While these books have much to offer, do not accept their counsels of despair. The American people may yet assert the primacy of politics over economics, of self-government over artificial and usurious profit, and restrain the financial and corporate order built upon their backs.</p><p>by JONATHAN ASKONAS</p><p>Jonathan Askonas is an assistant professor of politics at the Catholic University of America and fellow at the Center for the Study of Statesmanship.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-597198276</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 597198276</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWJ-TM01-JCBJ-K450-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3252\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The American Conservative LLC</copyright><publicationName>The American Conservative</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 1540-966X</issn><volume>Vol. 18</volume><issueNumber>No. 5\"</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 1, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Political science</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Globalization</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>International economic relations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Monopolies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political activity</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political aspects</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Populism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Proletariat</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Protectionism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Working class</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Working class in television</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Public affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>International economic relations</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Netflixled a surge in high-tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Health care companies and banks rose as major companies including UnitedHealth and JPMorgan Chaseannounced their fourth-quarter results. </p><p>  The British pound wobbled after legislators soundly rejected Prime Minister <person><nameText>Theresa May's </nameText></person>plan governing her country's departure from the European Union. While the deal's defeat might herald more chaos for companies in Britain and Europe in the months ahead, the outcome of the vote was long expected and stocks didn't react much.</p><p>  The S&amp;P 500-stock index rose 27.69 points, or 1.1 percent, to 2,610.30, its first close above 2,600 since Dec. 13. The Dow Jones industrial average added 155.75 points, or 0.7 percent, to 24,065.59.</p><p>  The Nasdaq jumped 117.92 points, or 1.7 percent, to 7,023.83.</p><p>  Chinese leaders plan to reduce taxes, increase government spending, and provide financing to private and small enterprises in a bid to strengthen the world's second-largest economy. China is enduring its worst slowdown since the global financial crisis, partly because of a punishing tariff dispute with the United States.</p><p>  That helped technology companies, which make big chunks of their sales in China. Microsoft rose 2.9 percent to $105.01, and Broadcom climbed 2.2 percent to $256.49.</p><p>Netflixclimbed 6.5 percent to $354.75 as it announced the biggest price increase in its history to help pay for its huge investment in original shows and films and finance the heavy debt it has assumed to ward off rivals such as Amazon, Disney and AT&amp;T.</p><p>  That touched off strong gains for other big tech stocks: Facebook rose 2.4 percent to $148.95, Amazon gained 3.5 percent to $1,674.56, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, jumped 3.3 percent to $1,086.51.</p><p>Netflixhas jumped 32.5 percent in 2019 but was worth almost $420 a share in July.</p><p>Delta Air Lines became one of the first companies to detail how the partial shutdown of the federal government is affecting its business.

Its chief executive, <person><nameText>Ed Bastian, </nameText></person>said the shutdown is keeping Delta from using new Airbus jets because the planes must be certified by safety regulators. They have been furloughed since Dec. 22.</p><p>  An unusually high number of airport screeners have been missing work after they did not get paychecks last week, contributing to long lines at some airports.</p><p>Delta met Wall Street's expectations in the fourth quarter. Its stock gyrated and finished with a gain of 0.2 percent at $47.83.</p><p>  The paint maker Sherwin-Williams said it was ''disappointed'' with its sales in October and November, and its profit and sales in the fourth quarter fell short of Wall Street's estimates. Its stock fell 4.1 percent to $381.44. The home improvement retailer Home Depot gave up 1.3 percent to $176.47 while Lowe's slid 2.1 percent to $94.91.</p><p>  Oil prices rose as investors felt a bit better about China's economic growth. Benchmark United States crude added 3.2 percent to $52.11 a barrel in New York. The international standard, Brent crude, gained 2.8 percent to $60.64 a barrel in London.</p><p>  Wholesale gasoline jumped 3.5 percent to $1.41 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1.1 percent to $1.87 a gallon, and natural gas fell 2.5 percent to $3.50 per 1,000 cubic feet.</p><p>  Gold slipped 0.2 percent to $1,286.20 an ounce, and silver fell 0.4 percent to $15.62 an ounce. Copper was unchanged at $2.63 a pound.</p><p>  Bond prices inched lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.72 percent from 2.71 percent.</p><p>  The dollar rose to 108.57 yen from 108.20 yen.

Good morning, everyone. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo, it is Monday, July 22nd, your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern. Another big week of earnings, this time, we've got big tech names, including Facebook, Twitter, Google's parent, Alphabet, all reporting. This morning, the focus is on Halliburton. We have the numbers coming up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures reporting to a higher open this morning, growing tensions with Iran, Prime Minister Theresa May holding an emergency meeting following the seizure of a U.K. tanker by Iran's Revolutionary Guard, this latest incident sending oil prices higher, and the Lion King roaring at the box office, but it's not the only Disney film breaking records this weekend, details straight ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MORNINGS WITH MARIA starts right now.</p><p>We have a big show coming up this morning. Maria's exclusive interview is on deck with Bank of America chairman and CEO, Brian Moynihan. They talk about everything from the debt ceiling to trade and more, you don't want to miss it.</p><p>And joining the conversation this morning, pollster and Maslansky &amp; Partners president, Lee Carter, PWC partner, Mitch Roschelle and market strategist at Third Seven Advisors, Michael Block, much to discuss, Mike already says that he has something outrageous to say on China trade, so hold that thought. We're going get to it shortly. OK.</p><p>Futures are pointing to a higher open this morning, we have gains across the board, a 52-point gain on the Dow Futures. Investors, of course, are waiting for the busiest week of the earning season. Last week, losing week for the markets, a real whiplash about whether the Federal Reserve is going to cut a quarter of a point, half a point?</p><p>Again, it seems like the markets are trading all on monetary policy, but what about earnings? Ten of the 30, so one-third of the Dow components, more than one quarter of the S&amp;P 500 report this week, and the big names to watch, Facebook and Tesla, coming out on Wednesday, Google's parent, Alphabet and Amazon, on Thursday. Mike Block, what are you expecting?</p><p>MICHAEL BLOCK, MARKET STRATEGIST, THIRD SEVEN ADVISORS: We have some big names reporting this week. And, you know, for much of this year, I've been saying that it's all about growth. Well, this is some of these big companies chance to show that. Can Facebook and Amazon and Alphabet really answer some of the concerns?</p><p>Last week, we saw Netflix blow up because their non-U.S. ads weren't good. But we also saw Microsoft excel on the cloud. What's it going to be for Amazon? Are they going to show the growth in retail sales? Is this going to be about the cloud?</p><p>Can Alphabet recover from what was a bad quarter, last quarter? Can they continue to be the leadership here? And would that be enough for the overall market? Is it a good thing when only four stocks are -- amount for all the gains in the S&amp;P 500?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. So to your --</p><p>BLOCK: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- point, this is the front page story in the Wall Street Journal, this is above the full story, I'll hold it up, it's right there, because I'm a nerd, I still have newspapers. So, it's Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Facebook accounted for 19 percent of the S&amp;P 500's total return this year, and I think it's the best performance, so far, in 2019, the biggest gain since '98, so a little bubbly.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: What's interesting is, when all of the noise out there, geopolitically, China trade, and concerns about global economic growth. Those are the companies that investors are, sort of, flocking to.</p><p>What's interesting is the treasury is the flight to safety asset class, as are those big FANG names. And it's interesting how the market's transformed from being 500 stocks to 4 that people run to when they're worried about what's going on around the world.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And we talked about the Fed, I mentioned briefly the Federal Reserve decision and, kind of, a whiplash in the markets last week. What was it, it was Williams from the New York Fed on Thursday.</p><p>BLOCK: Williams getting all academic on us and talking about a half percent neutral rate and freaking everyone out. He's an academic. He's been doing this his entire career. This is what he does.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And then they had to send out the balloon through the Wall Street Journal on Friday, saying wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, right? It's only going to be a quarter of a point.</p><p>BLOCK: It's a bit of comedy. We're going to see where it'll go. By the way, I want to point out, we've talked about the FANG stocks in the past, you look at Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon now, that spells F.A.M.A, which for us finance geeks is really funny because Eugene Fama is the guy who told us to buy small cap value stock opposed to large cap growth stock.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was Fama and French.</p><p>BLOCK: Yes, it was Fama and French.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was Fama and French.</p><p>BLOCK: Sorry French, didn't mean to leave you out.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We want to get -- let's talk about economic numbers ahead of the Federal Reserve decision next week. So, we get the first reading on second quarter growth out on Friday, ahead of the Central Bank's decision next week.</p><p>And again, we were talking about interest rate cuts, but in terms what's coming out this week. Also, we get new home sales numbers and also durable goods which are scheduled on Thursday and then second quarter. So, what about second quarter growth, what are we expecting at that 3.1 percent growth in the first quarter?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: GDP now, the Atlanta Fed has it at 1.6, which they sometimes have been wildly inaccurate, but I have a good feeling about second quarter, because if you look at the earnings, the banks all talked about how the consumer was really, really strong and drove their business.</p><p>If you look at the retail sales number that came out last week, that number was strong. I think the consumers are driving this economy and the consumers fairly confident. So I'm fairly optimistic about second quarter GDP, I think it's going to be higher than that.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY &amp; PARTNERS: I'm really interested to see what's going to happen with real estate, though, because it seems like that's a different, you know, that's -- we've got so many great numbers and consumer confidence, and we're seeing real estate's not doing as well. So, I'm curious to see how that's all going to play out.</p><p>MCDOWELL: How's confidence holding up in this new environment, because again, I had this moment, and we're going to talk about the continued fight with the squad between President Trump and these four young congresswomen, but I'm driving around throughout the south and the roads are just wall-to- wall traffic, it's bumper-to-bumper traffic.</p><p>People are out, they're spending, and I thought, you know what, I wonder how many of these people who are out enjoying like the lowest unemployment rate that we've had in nearly half a century.</p><p>And these incredible wage gains, people are out, they're driving, they're enjoying their summer despite a hundred degree temperatures, they're not paying attention to that. Now, I wonder how confidence is reacting to just the feel good vibes about the economy, regardless of what's coming out of Washington.</p><p>CARTER: Consumer confidence set an all-time high, I mean, when you look at, I mean, I'm not sure it's all-time high, but it certainly continues to increase, and despite the fact that people are saying there's a recession coming, that these numbers are inflated, that we're in a bubble, all these kinds of things that you hear over and over again, that's not what the consumer is saying.</p><p>They're out there spending, they're feeling good. People are feeling better about the economy than they have, and when you look at the numbers in 2012, where we are today, it's unbelievable how much better people are feeling about where we are as a country and about our future.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Despite the fact that some of the candidates on the Democratic side of the campaign trail are trying to talk this country into a recession.</p><p>CARTER: Well, that, I think, is one the most fascinating things, it's almost like they're trying to talk us out of feeling good. So, I -- if you look at some of the messaging Elizabeth Warren and others are doing, it's economic growth, it's not working for every man, it's working -- that's what they're trying to say. They're saying, is it working for you, it's working for the wealthy, and it's working for companies.</p><p>But when you -- when you survey people and you talk to people out there, that's not how they feel. They're feeling like this is the best economy that we've ever had. And, you know --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And nonsupervisory wages have been growing faster than the wages of managers. That lower-skilled individuals in this country, their wages are growing faster than people, in some instances, that have college degrees or higher.</p><p>So, again, you have to be very careful when you tell somebody, you don't really feel as good as you think you do. It doesn't -- you feel -- they could come across like they're not telling the truth to people.</p><p>CARTER: That's right. And I think that the thing that they need to understand is there's a difference -- and you say this all the time, Dagen, you say it's the policies versus the politics, and I think that people don't like the politics, they're not optimistic about the tone and the tenor of our environment right now, but they feel very good about the economics and their pocket books.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I do want to point out because the president was still tweeting about these four female lawmakers, saying that he doesn't think -- he said this yesterday morning, I think it was about 8:00 in the morning, that he doesn't think they are capable of loving our country, so this continues.</p><p>I'm going to talk to you later in the show about what's the method to this madness here. So --</p><p>CARTER: There is one.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There is one. Because, again, people would come up to me and ask me to explain what was going on, like, you know, not today. So, well, this is on deck this week, in Washington Wednesday, former Special Counsel Robert Mueller testifying before the House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees.</p><p>Maria Bartiromo sat down with ranking Judiciary Committee member, Georgia congressman, Doug Collins, about what he plans to ask Mueller, so listen to this. I'll get everybody's reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Are you going to be asking specifically if he looked at the origin of that investigation, why they started to investigate Donald Trump in the first place?</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): We've got some great guys on our side and gals that are going to ask him really pointed questions to make sure that the American people understand this is not a vacuum that the Democrats have completely, to say the president was doing something wrong.</p><p>We're going to also go back to that corrupt kabal and others, I think, as you look at it in general that need to be part of this picture. Remember, the Mueller report is a one-sided report that is not been questioned from the other side. This is our chance to do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lee, what are you expecting?</p><p>CARTER: What? I'm expecting a mess. You know, I also wonder a lot of times, this is going to be to do about nothing, we're anticipating so much. I think that we're going to hear a lot more from the sidelines that we're actually going to see when you actually get down to it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Does the market care? Do investors --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I was about to say that, I don't think the market cares and what's interesting is, so much time has passed since this dust-up last time. I think re-dusting it up -- not only the market, but I think voters are just going to say --</p><p>CARTER: I think people already made up their minds.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So you had -- so we're saving this to the end. You have some bomb you're going to land about the China trade, tell us, before we go to break.</p><p>BLOCK: Yes, I'll say --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hit me.</p><p>BLOCK: I'll say this really quickly, what's going on here is this -- fact of the matter is, and we can agree with him and disagree, the point thing, this is how he feels. President Xi over in China does not trust Donald Trump full stop. That's what it comes down to -- he looks at the Iran deal and we can all say that was a terrible deal, of course, President Trump did away with it.</p><p>The Chinese look at this and they're saying, he breaks deals, we can't make a deal with him, and that's kind of the mindset now. They're actually of the mindset of, let's wait this out until next year, let's see if he loses the election, we're in no hurry to do this because we don't trust him. We don't trust any deal we make with him.</p><p>All of us can disagree with that reason. The important thing is, that's what's really happening in China. I'm not --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But we don't --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But we went into this, not trusting the Chinese because of the theft of intellectual property --</p><p>BLOCK: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- and the forced surrender of technology. And again, using Huawei to essentially -- as a trap door to spy on the world, the United States and other nations, so --</p><p>BLOCK: All of that is irrelevant. The thing that I'm saying is --</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, it's not -- it's not irrelevant.</p><p>BLOCK: No, it is relevant. It is relevant.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, it's relevant not irrelevant, but go ahead.</p><p>BLOCK: What I'm trying -- what I'm trying to say here is this, there's this thought that both sides are going to play nice, shake hands and make some, sort of, deal that's going to make markets go higher, whether it works or not, remains to be seen.</p><p>But I'm telling you that the actual mindset going on in China, right now, from what I'm getting from some high-placed people, is that they just don't even want to make a deal.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But if nothing changes in terms of where we are right now, Mitch, that's not necessarily bad for the market. I think that you have a market. You have investors and corporate executives. They are grappling with the existing tariffs that we have on Chinese goods. So, a status quo from here, until even after the election would be OK for the economy and the markets.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Most likely. And I think as time goes on, corporate managers are less and less convinced that anything is going to happen and they're just moving forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And moving production too.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Vietnam and India.</p><p>BLOCK: There's a lot going on. You know, one thing that's also going on overnight was, Japan and South Korea are having their own trade dispute, and Samsung might be moving more production here to the U.S. They already have a big chip facility in Austin, Texas and maybe moving more. There are so many moving parts here.</p><p>And yes, there could be a lot of adaptation if there's no deal and no progress. Let's see how it works out. My point is, there is this expectation, oh, they'll get a deal done once the summer is over. I'm not seeing it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Traffic gets worse --</p><p>MCDOWELL: How about ratifying that -- the new NAFTA?</p><p>BLOCK: Oh sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We'll take that USMCA.</p><p>BLOCK: Yes, let's get through that. Let's get some infrastructure --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Open the desk drawer. Open the desk drawer, take it out, and move it to the floor.</p><p>BLOCK: No. We're too busy fighting with each other.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly, and tweeting, fact on a tear. Major technology companies powering the markets recent gains, what it means for earning season, straight ahead. Plus, the Lion King roars at the box office, Disney's remake of its classic stories stampeding into theaters, the roundup, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A massive protest expected in Puerto Rico today, as the governor refuses to resign, Cheryl Casone has more details, hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, Dagen, good morning. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to take over one of the island's busiest roads today. They're hoping to convince Governor Ricardo Rossello to step down.</p><p>Overnight, Rossello announced he will not seek re-election, but he also won't quit over a leaked online conversation, showing him mocking women and hurricane victims. Today will mark the 10th straight day of protest there.</p><p>Well, Equifax could pay around $700 million to settle with the Federal Trade Commission over at 2017 data breach. Wall Street journal is reporting that the deal would resolve investigations by the FTC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and most states. It would also resolve a nationwide consumer class action lawsuit, the breach, one of the largest affecting private information.</p><p>And Disney's Lion King devoured the competition at the weekend box office.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES EARL JONES, VOICE OF MUFASA, THE LION KING: You must take your place in the Circle of Life.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: The remake grossed $185 million in the U.S., roaring passed expectations. I'm trying, it's Monday. It's already earned more than half a billion dollars worldwide. And then, here's some news, the Avengers: End Game which didn't make the top 10, doesn't even matter at this point.</p><p>With 1.5 million globally added, over this past weekend, it now has finally surpassed Avatar's all-time record, reaching $2.79 billion, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's incredible.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Cheryl. Who went to see it? Do you have a young daughter?</p><p>BLOCK: We watched Toy Story 4 yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, was it awesome?</p><p>BLOCK: Also Disney Pixar, fantastic, yes. That's my first Toy Story movie. I never saw any of them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'll take James Earl Joyce's -- James Earl Jones. Joyce is my mother's name that's why I said that, James Earl Jones' voice, over Tom Hanks, though, any day.</p><p>BLOCK: Oh, sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just saying.</p><p>BLOCK: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Buzz or Woody? I'm a -- I'm a Woody guy. I don't know. Sorry audience. I just --</p><p>BLOCK: If you see the new one, Forky.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Oh, really? There's a new character?</p><p>BLOCK: There's a new character named Forky. It's very clever.</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK. We'll leave it at that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't know. I never quite understood the need to make -- remake the Lion King, but I think that that speaks volumes about the need for that.</p><p>BLOCK: For the -- for the record, I was laughing hard with my daughter.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly. All right, major earnings on tap, 10 Dow components reporting this week ahead of the Fed possibly cutting interest rates, how the market is reacting.</p><p>And July heat wave, millions of Americans sweated out this weekend, dealing with blistering temperatures, but there is finally some relief in sight, and a surprise for a lifetime, for one family, when an uninvited guest yes, gets in the middle of their day of fishing, more ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Future pointing the gains across the board, a 58-point-gain on the Dow Futures after a losing week for the markets last week. But will earnings turn it all around? We have mega earnings on tap, economic numbers out and then a possible rate cut.</p><p>Joining me now, Altium Wealth portfolio manager, market strategist, Mike Lee, again, I still think it's about the Fed and what the Federal Reserve is going to do. You saw what markets did last week. It's like, quarter of like half a point, yes. Oh, it's only a quarter of a point. What about earnings here?</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AND MARKET STRATEGIST, ALTIUM WEALTH: You know, I'd say expectations of this quarter are super low. We're looking at -- right now, it's down 1.8, 1.9 percent, and revenue up just under 4 percent, so big misses, big beats, you know, those -- they'll get rewarded and, you know, taken down, respectively, but everything is about the Fed right now.</p><p>Are we going to get a rate cut? I personally think we're at 25-basis points. I'm 100 percent sure about that 25-basis point. At this next meeting, I think the Fed could throw us for a little bit of a curve ball and then reward us later, because the market is just ahead of their ski tips here, thinking that we're going to get 50 or 75 basis points in this meeting or by the end of the year, is insane.</p><p>Over the last few weeks, let's look some of the data that we got, we got a blowout jobs number, we've got the New York Fed -- you know, Empire State manufacturing blowing away estimates, the Philly Fed coming in like four times estimates.</p><p>Retail sales beating, inflation data coming in higher. There's no reason to cut rates now, other than to stop the dollar from appreciating, substantially, against the rest of the world.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mike?</p><p>BLOCK: Yes, just one thought, you know, I'm actually still bullish on the dollar, rate cut or not. You know, the ECB is still cutting. You know, there are other factors that are going to take the dollar down. It's just a matter of its run so far ahead that it's going to come in.</p><p>LEE: Yes. Well -- I agree with your thesis that the dollars are going to continue to get stronger, and I think what a lot of that has to do, is the tax cut and regulatory reform that we've seen here. The U.S. is now a much more tractive investment than it was just a few years ago, because it's much easier to do business.</p><p>And what's happening is, a lot of growth for the rest the world is getting sucked back to America. So, as long as we are the best game in town, and that gap continues to widen, I don't see how the dollar cannot continue to get stronger, and the Fed is not going to zero.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: But if dollar continues to get strong, that continues to weigh on corporate earnings with, you know, a half of the revenue of the S&amp;P 500 earned abroad, right?</p><p>LEE: Yes. So -- yes, and I think that's largely baked into expectations, it makes it more difficult to say, you know, to manufacture and, kind of, remake rework the base here, but the flipside of that, is a lot of these tech companies, right, that are continuing to be growing and growing and growing, like, that's going to be dollar irrelevant.</p><p>And that I think markets can go much, much higher here, because we're at 17 times forward earnings. The economy -- like you were just saying about, I think, GDP estimates, a little bit too low for this quarter as it were for the first quarter, and then things could continue to pick up for the next half of this year, through the rest of this year, into next year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Even if the Fed don't deliver, even if the Fed don't deliver. You think that markets will clearly be disappointed if the Fed doesn't cut next week.</p><p>LEE: You know, if the Fed -- I think you're going to continue to get this accommodative language, it may be too aggress over the last few weeks, which is why they came out, so expect to get something here, either by the way of transparency into the next rate cut, or a rate cut right here.</p><p>But I think we're one and done. It's very hard to rationalize with this strong of an economy that you're cutting rates.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: One of the things, Mike, you mentioned maybe three, four months ago on this show, was you thought the market was trying to bully the Fed by their behavior in the fourth quarter last year, to say you've got to be more accommodative, so if they don't get the cut that they're looking for, how do you think markets are going to react? They're going to start bulling the Fed again?</p><p>LEE: Yes, I think you'd get a selloff, and for investors out there, sitting with cash, you know, that is your opportunity to come in. So, I think at this next meeting, no matter what we get, you're most likely going to get a selloff because let's just say, hypothetically, if we get 75 basis points, which I don't think we are, the market will sell off because they're going to say, hey --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: They can sell the news.</p><p>LEE: What are they going to say? Hey, what does the Fed know that we don't?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Right.</p><p>LEE: If you get 50 basis points, that's, kind of, in line with expectation, so that's sell the news, we get 25 basis points, well, that's a huge disappointment. So, I think this is a sell-the-news type trading event for an entry point. But for those of us that are sitting in this, and this for a long run, like, just ride just through us. This business cycle is going to continue going, and going, and going, right?</p><p>You really -- you don't have a ton of leverage in this economy. A little bit in the S&amp;P 500, we're getting a little bit elevated there, but on the consumer side, if you look at debt service as a percentage of take home income, it's at the lowest level in 30 years.</p><p>You look at consumer confidence, consumer comfort, consumer sentiment, all the near the highest levels ever, 1.3 million more jobs available, people looking for work. It's really an unbelievable shape right now.</p><p>BLOCK: I just want to point out that the dollar does stay stronger, what sectors benefit, one of them is U.S. retail. U.S. consumer has more purchasing power, everything else help constant.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You left out in terms of investors pushing Fed to cut rates, and who use the word, bullying? We left out how the president might react to a dollar that continues to be strong and a Fed that doesn't cut rates aggressively. I'll just leave it at that.</p><p>LEE: He's a little bit of a victim of his own success here, but it's -- you know, afraid (INAUDIBLE) follow zero hedge. You know, it's -- the Fed shouldn't make policy based on the price of the S&amp;P 500, but it seems like that plays a much greater role than it should in this day and age.</p><p>BLOCK: The market dependent, full step.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, Mike, good to see you.</p><p>LEE: Thanks for having me.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Michael Lee from Altium. Coming up, Maria's exclusive sit down with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, covering topics from the debt ceiling to trade negotiations, plus a real-life jaws moment caught on camera.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good one.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: A great white shark drops in on a family fishing trip, more ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, July 22nd. Your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Futures are showing gains across the board. 57 point gain on the Dow Futures. The Dow, Nasdaq, and S&amp;P winning the -- ending week down, for the first time in three weeks. And see the losses there.</p><p>Looking for a rebound this morning. What's happening in Europe at the moment? We have slight gains across the board in England, France, and Germany. In Asia overnight, it was red across the board for all the major markets there as expectations were a deep interest rate cut by fed e here in the U.S. diminished. So, following through on our Friday here in the U.S.</p><p>The big heatwave, its deadly impact, and the call for help made by some police. And a fishing surprise, the incredible video of a real-life jaws. Wait for it encounter. Yes.</p><p>And millennials on the move. Find out top cities that they are flocking to. And a bull riding cop finds out the call that led to this officer. Well, giddy-up.</p><p>Our top story this half-hour. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, looking to wrap up a deal with the White House to lift the debt ceiling for Congress leaves for recess at the end of this week. That was one of the many topics, Maria, discussed within an exclusive sit-down with Bank of America chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Here we are in the longest expansion anybody has ever seen. And we're dealing with potentially another government shutdown. Will that end this expansion? Will markets get disrupted by this?</p><p>BRIAN MOYNIHAN, CHAIRMAN, BANK OF AMERICA: Well, I think, first, I think everybody agrees it shouldn't happen. The problem is 18 months ago, everybody agreed it shouldn't happen in the fall of 17, and it happened.</p><p>And so, I think we have to be careful that the unintended consequence can happen. In the environment with which it might happen, this time it's not quite as strong as remember, coming in the early team, we had tax reform get passed and nobody thought it would happens. So, there's tremendous enthusiasm in the business community, it's a little different now.</p><p>And so I think that's why, you know, Secretary Mnuchin and Speaker Pelosi are working hard on it. I think their best intentions are not to have an issue but it affected economy in the first quarter of 18 and the debate is it could affect it again?</p><p>And I think that along with three or four things are needed to get resolved the correct way in order to keep this expansion go in the United States. And I think all of them are imminently solvable and they just got to get done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. What else needs to get done, Brian?</p><p>MOYNIHAN: Well, first, you have to get the USMCA through. Because in any day, we have to stabilize that relationship between our north and south partners. And because it's good for all these -- all the countries I got a deal worked out, they just kind of push it through.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and by the way, if we can't get a deal that's already been agreed upon with our friends, imagine getting deals done with others?</p><p>MOYNIHAN: Yes. Well, because that brings it. So, you have that -- you have the debt ceiling that's kind of the fall issues to get make sure get done. Because I think that will send a signal to the world that the United States is pushing forward with agreements on trade.</p><p>And I think then, the next couple of issues, the one we got to get through the Brexit resolution, all this is in the general economy ultimately make sure it doesn't disrupt too much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MOYNIHAN: And then we've got China to keep it from blowing up. You know, and there's very difficult issues there. And the business community around the world knows that this has to be resolved and is with the -- with the administration and others clearly saying, you know these are difficult issues.</p><p>But the issues, if it blows up, it could be a detriment. And so, you they need to keep it going along towards a positive result. I think both countries interest there. But if you take those three or four things, basically USMC, the debt ceiling Brexit, China.</p><p>If we can keep those in the right place, I think the economy in the U.S. will continue to progress well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really. OK, so, how does the backdrop feel to you right now? You just reported $7 billion in net income last week. What did that tell you, what did the corner highlight for you in terms of the strength and weakness in the economy today?</p><p>Well, if you look at what drives our earnings, it's all the -- its American economy and our great teammates work on that. So, our consumer business made $3 billion. Our global banking business which is company -- you know, corporate banking made $2 billion, and then, we made a billion in wealth management -- billion in markets. So, it's very spread around all good performance.</p><p>But the consumer business everybody is talking about, because in that, you're seeing a consumer who is very strong in the United States spending money, borrowing responsibly, they're employed, their wages are growing faster than people thought. You see three percent handles on that now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MOYNIHAN: Their expectations are high, their confidence, although, not quite as high at the highest point, you know, still very high. All that is very good because the end of the day, two thirds the U.S. economy is by people like yourself spending money. And if you spend money, businesses will be successful, small business will be successful, and then, and will go on.</p><p>We look on the business side. Our small business loans outstanding are up from $35 to $37 billion every year, about six percent. The small business of borrowing -- again, their confidence dipped down a little bit, but that's because the world got more complex.</p><p>And if you look at mid-sized companies, they're spending a little less on CapEx, largely because that incentives are sort of through the system now. But they're very solid. Everybody is fine and sort of braced for please, as a please to move uncertainty and we can be more aggressive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, I'm glad you said CapEx is OK. Because there's this debate about these uncertainties over China, USMCA are now keeping businesses sitting on cash. But they're still spending on technology and you're spending a lot on technology, I'll get to that in a second.</p><p>But you still think CapEx is OK. Businesses are all allocating money to important issues that they need.</p><p>MOYNIHAN: It's slowed down to about half the rate, but still there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MOYNIHAN: But, the real question, it could be faster with that certainty. But people have sort of adjusted to the issues at the moment. And if you look at companies -- you talk to a company, anybody's in China is seeing a slowdown affect them. It's usually 20 percent of their business, 30 percent of business, and slow down, yet 20 percent. So, it's not the impact across the whole platform but it's the reverberation of that impact they're worried about. But generally, businesses are very saying what about what's going on. What's going to come?</p><p>It's amazing to me how efficient businesses have become in terms of the ability to deploy a modest amount of expense and get a lot of pop out of it like we do. We pay $3 billion in technology. We basically have flat expenses on our company for four years in a row.</p><p>And you think about that with multiple -- with transaction growth, six, seven, eight, 10 percent with Salesforce growth, you know, three, four, five percent a year in terms of new people.</p><p>We're able to pay for all that by investing technology and both for the customer and for ourselves to keep improving the company and our efficiency ratio has gone down. That's what businesses are doing around the world. You know, they're just -- they're learning how to become incrementally more efficient through all this wonderful technology and capabilities that they have.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's one of the ways you were able to turn this company around in the last decade. Because of your focus on keeping expenses tight or conservative as well as investing in technology.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: More of Maria's exclusive interview with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and coming up next hour. But first, a dangerous heat wave covering much of the country. Cheryl Casone has more. Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Dagen. So, an extreme heatwave is now blamed for, at least, six deaths from the Carolinas to Maine.</p><p>Daytime highs reached the upper 90s yesterday. Here in New York City, Con Ed reported that about 50,000 homes and businesses lost power, it's expected to cool off though as a cold front is slowly going to shift across the East. Police in a Massachusetts town asked residents to hold off on any criminal activity until today. So, there you have that. Thank you. You just wait to rob that bank today, no one will come out and arrest you.</p><p>All right, we have some jaw-dropping video for all the fishermen on the panel. OK, there's just one, of a great white shark, leaping out of the water and nearly biting a boy on a fishing boat. Look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOUG NELSON, JOINED AN OUTING ON CAPE COD BAY: Oh, wow!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. This is a very close call as you can see. This happened near Cape Cod. The shark jumped out of the water to steal a fish as it was being reeled in. Thankfully, nobody was hurt, well.</p><p>And then, there is this. Millennials are packing their bags for the West Coast. They are moving to cities with high home prices, a high cost of living, but also higher wages. It's according to a new study.</p><p>Portland, Oregon is the prime destination, followed by Seattle in Denver. San Francisco in Austin rounds out the top five.</p><p>I will send it back to you, Dagen. And, of course, the fisherman sitting next to you, probably. How I know I was on his boat yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm at shark site.</p><p>CASONE: I grew up fishing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I -- Yes, and so --</p><p>CARTER: Me two.</p><p>CASONE: And she's a fisherperson.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: So, at least a fisherperson is --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're a fisherperson.</p><p>CASONE: A fisherperson.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Just full disclosure, Lee, and I were trying to figure out what fish is being pulled into that the sharks was going after.</p><p>CARTER: A sad way (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCDOWELL: What do you think it was?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I think it was a cod because it was on Cape Cod. But I think it was a cod. That was my guess. But audience will probably tweet at me tell me, I don't know what I'm talking about. But that was any working theory.</p><p>BLOCK: The Massachusetts stories were great. You know, the police department that Cheryl was referring to is Braintree, Massachusetts. And it was great because there was this great tweet that said, \"It's -- you know, you have to say in Boston accident like, it was hotter than soccer balls out there. So -- Incredible tweet --</p><p>CARTER: Wait until tomorrow.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: That is a Jack Kennedy imitation</p><p>BLOCK: No, it's better -- I think -- I think it's like -- I think it's Mayor Quimby from the Simpsons, actually. Don't suppose to be honest.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You didn't sound like either Kennedy nor Quimby.</p><p>BLOCK: I'm from Stanton now, and so --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Where (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BLOCK: Hey, Chucky.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mark Wahlberg. Coming up, the busiest week of earning season. Halliburton kicking things off today. Reporting moments from now, we bring you the numbers as soon as they break.</p><p>And this is not his first rodeo. A cop takes a ride on a mechanical bull at a house party.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Headlines across America this morning. The Pittsburgh Post- gazette reports this: \"Dispute poll CBS off the air for DirecTV customers.\" CBS went to black on satellite systems owned by AT&amp;T and New York, L.A., Chicago, and other cities across the U.S. including Pittsburgh. The network and AT&amp;T mudslinging over the failure to agree on what CBS is paid for programming. The network warning this could be -- this could last a long time.</p><p>The Mercury News says that Google's big plans for downtown San Jose answers for all of your questions, plenty of questions and now some answers to how and when Google's takeover of San Jose will commence. Those plans include overhauling a city so-called sleepy downtown train station.</p><p>And then this, OzarksFirst.com writes: \"A Texas police officer responded to a noise complaint and wound up riding mechanical bull.\" And here we go, this apparently was not his first rodeo. The cop answering this call did (INAUDIBLE), climbing on the bull at a house party in East Texas riding effortlessly for about 30 seconds. Before falling off -- he was rewarded with cheers and plenty of high-fives. A three-year-old could ride that bull, though. Just saying.</p><p>But we have breaking news for you. Halliburton earnings are out and Deirdre Bolton has everything you need to know.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right, Dagen. If you look at earnings, you have a clear beat so that why we are seeing Halliburton move higher in the premarket. So, instead of $30.00 a share, which is what Wall Street was looking for the company posting $35.00 a share, so clear beat, obviously stronger. The problem for the company as day goes on, is going to be revenue a little light.</p><p>So, Wall Street looking for 5.97 billion in revenue. Halliburton posting 5.93 billion, so almost there, not quite, but as we can tell from the premarket, it seems like most investors are focusing on that profit number. So Dagen, we'll watch Halliburton also watch its large per competitor, Schlumberger -- won't be off to races. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWEL: Deirdre, thank you so much. Deirdre Bolton on earnings for us. Coming up, the deep dive into Deepfakes. We take a look at the technology behind bogus videos and the potential political impact. Next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Deepfake -- something you might have heard of. The technology allows anyone to create a video of an event that never happened and now that it's posing threat to business and our political system. Joining me now: Morning Anchor for Fox News Headlines 24/7 on SiriusXM 115, Brett Larson.</p><p>BRETT LARSON, FOX NEWS CHANNEL ANCHOR: This is terrifying, right? We've seen the videos -- there's a video of President Obama, I believe, he's praising President Trump. There's a video of Mark Zuckerberg saying I'm going it take Facebook off the Internet because that's right thing to do. Obviously, if you watch that video, you'd would think: wait, what now? But you might -- it might catch you off-guard and you might think it's real.</p><p>Now, we're hearing reports that they're using the same Deepfake technology to impersonate people's voices. So, we're taking about, you know, high- profile CEOs, to call their other executives and ask for money to help them out because they're in some sort of danger. It is a similar situation to - - that's if this is maybe something that we have experience of something -- I've experienced where a friend messages you on Facebook and says: hey, I'm in -- I'm traveling through Europe and I lost my passport and I need some cash because I'm at the hotel and all of my stuff is stolen.</p><p>And for a second, you might fall for it and think: well, that's interesting. The time it happened to me, I had happened to also have been in Europe, so I said: oh, my gosh, how convenient I'm also -- I'm in Paris. You know, where are you? But I have to point this out: you were just in New York yesterday. So, how is it that you're already in Europe and you've lost all of your stuff? So, obviously, the person who had hacked into that account was then on to me and I got blocked.</p><p>But what these guys are doing is taking speeches that CEO have given, ted talks, putting it into artificial intelligence and the just like Alexa, just like Siri, just like Google Home -- the voice has the ability to speak like another person and say anything you want.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Who's behind technology and more importantly the abuse of the technology?</p><p>LARSON: These are going to be some hard-core hackers who have figured some stuff out.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Domestic or foreign?</p><p>LARSON: I would -- I'm going to go out on a limb and say probably foreign. Probably from those countries that we like to spar with. That, you know, computers are -- they work everywhere. Anywhere you can plug them in and access Internet, you can do this kind of stuff.</p><p>CARTER: It's really scary because they can put things out there that people are predisposed to believe.</p><p>LARSON: Right.</p><p>CARTER: And then, it can perpetuate itself and this is super, super dangerous stuff and people can't even tell the difference in print stories, but you see video and hear the audio --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Then it's real.</p><p>CARTER: -- then it's real.</p><p>LARSON: Especially if it plays to your existing confirmation bias.</p><p>CARTER: Exactly.</p><p>LARSON: So, we're talking about, you know, imagine if you had a presidential candidate's voice impersonated and you could call into a talk show and you could go through an entire interview with somebody who may be not in on the joke. I mean, we live in a -- you know, there's 24 Democratic presidential candidates; there's one on the Republican side running who happens to also be in the White House. Imagine if you -- you know, you have a talk show and somebody says: oh, the president of the United States is on the phone and wants to talk to you. You're not going to say no to that and you're going to put them on the air and you're going to hear it, and think, well it sounds like the president.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You only need to make that mistake once and get (INAUDIBLE). It --</p><p>LARSON: That is absolutely true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It happens.</p><p>LARSON: That is true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: With what love Howard Stern, that's no disrespect to Howard Stern.</p><p>LARSON: But you know it's an interesting -- I hate to say interesting time. It's kind of a frightening situation where you can do this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What are the social media companies doing about it, though, ahead of the election particularly next year? The election is -- the campaigns are happening now; what are they doing about it now?</p><p>LARSON: What are they doing about this?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Nothing --</p><p>LARSON: You know, look, Facebook did the war room for the 2018 midterm elections where they tried to stay on top this stuff. This -- to me this feel like a toothpaste out of the tube situation where it's going to be -- we're just users now; it really falls on the users are going to have more savvy about what they hear and see.</p><p>CARTER: Well, these candidates are going to have to be really vigilant about --</p><p>LARSON: Well, absolutely.</p><p>CARTER: -- you know, protecting their messaging.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I guess if it goes viral, then they can shut it down. It's the innocuous one that seems real that influences a small group of people, that's the danger.</p><p>LARSON: Right. Exactly. Or the, you know, we use this in a campaign phone call. We use fake audio of a candidate. And this could be a candidate for anything. It could be mayor or congress, or even president.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'll end on this, though: the more this goes on and the more the social media companies have allowed, it's not just opinion it is literally fake manufactured news. It makes the -- the real media companies and the old newspapers much more relevant because more and more people are going to lean on them to -- again, it's the reporters' responsibility to vet and vet and vet and make sure something is real and accurate. I think it benefits the real media companies in this environment.</p><p>LARSON: Absolutely. And I've gotten a lot of flak for saying this in past but it is the rules of journalism: we have a gatekeeper. There is somebody who sits there and says hold on a second, they said what in a telephone interview? Let's fact check, double check, triple check before we go through that. Whereas, if you're blogger -- this is no offense to bloggers or Twitter-ers -- you just put it out there. You know, did you double check, did you call? Simple rules? 101. Journalism.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Covington High School --</p><p>LARSON: Yes, take a class.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Covington High School kids, you know who -- because you're on there and again it's like: I need to get in on app. No, I'm not. I'm putting my phone down because that doesn't look right. I was like there's a lot more to that story.</p><p>LARSON: Wait until the story is fully told.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much, Brett Larson. Good to see you.

We've got records on the  Dow, records on the Nasdaq, record high on the S&amp;P 500.  And we could have  an all-time record for the number of records.  Go on, yes, that's enough  bell.  To the business.  Well, I suppose that's a firm gavel.  Trading is  over.  It's Friday, it's December the 15th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, records all around on Wall Street.  As Republicans are closing in  on their tax plan.  Theresa May gets some congratulations as Brexit talks  now formally go to stage two.  And European politicians tell tech companies  to cross the Atlantic in search of net neutrality.  Europe is the place to  be.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital.  A rainy/snowy  capital today, where I mean business.  </p><p>Good evening.  Tonight, volume is high, and so are the spirits on Wall  Street.  A record-breaking session to end the week, with all three major  markets closing at an all-time high.  And it comes as the Republicans in  Congress are edging ever closer to an historic victory on their tax plan.  </p><p>So, join me at the trading post as we put this into perspective.  No  question with the Dow, the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq, we have green all across the  board today.  And with record highs.  So how many records?  Where do we  stand so far, this year?  The Dow now has 69 records.  S&amp;P, 61.  And the  Nasdaq has hit a record 71 times so far, this year.  The Dow ends at a  record -- it's the fourth time this week it's had this record.  And the S&amp;P  with 61 is on track to have made gains every month this year.  If that  happens, and it looks like it will by the end of the month, then that will  be the first time in history that it's happened.  </p><p>Now, one of the reasons why we saw extreme volatility during the course of  the day was its quadruple witching day at the New York Stock Exchange.   What that means is options, futures and cash market, various contracts, all  expire at the same time.  And when you put it like that, then you manage to  get huge volatility.  For example, the best part of 200 million shares had  changed hands just the open alone.  And we were heading towards 600, 700  million by the close of trading today.  </p><p>Europe still lags somewhat on the record.  We haven't had any really new --  we haven't had any new all-time highs on the FTSE, the DAX or the CAC for  some time.  Speaking to me earlier on the trading floor of the New York  Stock Exchange, the global head of listings told me it had been a strong  year all around, reinforced when you look at those numbers.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN TUTTLE, GLOBAL HEAD OF LISTINGS, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE:  It's been a  strong year for U.S. capital markets.  It's been a great year for the New  York Stock Exchange.  Last year, worst year in over a decade for capital- raising, equity capital-raising.  This year we had 88 new listings on the  New York Stock Exchange, raised more than double we did last year.  And the  pipeline for next year is strong, too.  </p><p>QUEST:  Why do you think that is?  What is it about -- I mean, or is it  just one of the things that goes in cycles and favors?  </p><p>TUTTLE:  Well, the IPO window is open.  What that means is that volatility  is low and stable, interest rates are low but telegraphed to steadily rise.   The companies that have public this year have performed well, by and large  in the weeks, months and quarters following their listing.  There is strong  investor confidence.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST:  So now one of the reasons why the market has moved so sharply, the  Republican tax plan.  Now or never for this odyssey.  The bill should  release shortly.  We're expecting it at 5:30 eastern time.  Some crucial  votes not yet fully locked in.  In the past few hours, Marco Rubio and Bob  Corker have announced they're back on side.  So that's OK.  There are three  key senators that are still wavering.  And two more Republicans have  question marks over their health and ability to vote.  Whichever way you  look at it, President Trump remains bullish that this will get done.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I have.  I have seen it.  I  think it's going to do very, very well.  I think that we are going to be in  a position to pass something as early as next week, which will be  monumental.  I think they'll be great.  They're great people.  He wants to  see it done.  I know him very well.  I know how they feel.  These are great  people.  And they want to see it done.  And they want to see it done  properly.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:05:00] QUEST:  Phil Mattingly is on Capitol Hill.  Phil, I was  listening to you last night, talking to Anderson.  This -- you were very  forthright about the fact that, you know, no single senator is going to see  this come down or have -- or risk the problem that will come with it if  they bring it down.  </p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN U.S. CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, look, I think  that's long been the feeling of the top Republican aides and, frankly,  lawmakers here.  I've talked to a bunch of senators.  Keep in mind,  Richard, yesterday the GOP leaders were scrambling for Marco Rubio, didn't  necessarily know that Senator Bob Corker would ever come back to yes.  He  was a no the first time around.  And today it looks like they're on a glide  path.  Now you noted, there are still three Senators that haven't come out  and said yes yet, Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, and Mike Lee.  But the  expectation right now, according to the GOP aides that I've been speaking  to in the Senate, is that they will all likely come around.  </p><p>The biggest concern was Marco Rubio.  The one that they thought maybe  wasn't even gettable at all was Senator Bob Corker.  Now they're there.   And I think you understand kind of the point the Senators were making to me  last night which was the political imperative here, the idea of getting tax  cut legislation, which has been something Republicans have campaigned on  year after year, cycle after cycle.  Is too great for them to try and stand  in the way of it.  And that seems to have won out at the end of the day.   There are still some steps to go here.  But right now, Republican leaders  are very confident that they're not just going to pass this, they're going  to actually pass this relatively easily.  </p><p>QUEST:  And the fascinating part, Phil, is that we're arguing or  discussing, I should say, about a bill that no one has seen.  That we don't  have the full details yet.  I mean, it is bizarre that the public debate  continues, and nobody knows the minutia of what's in the reconciled bill.  </p><p>MATTINGLY:  Right.  And you've got senators that are now saying, yes, to a  bill that they haven't fully read yet.  Obviously, public hasn't seen it  either.  If you think about it this way, this conference report that will  come out, the final bill, is 503 pages long.  </p><p>We haven't seen it.  Most senators haven't seen it.  The reason Senator  Mike Lee is not officially a yes yet on this bill is because he hasn't read  the bill yet.  And if he hasn't read the bill, that means the rest of  conference hasn't read the bill either.  And I think there's a couple  things here.  First, look, they went through a process, obviously, they  went through a committee process.  The U.S. House passed their version of  the bill.  The U.S. Senate passed their version of the bill too.  There are  large portions, almost entirety of portions of those bills that will be  reconciled under this bill.  So, they have a framework of what they're  voting on.  They have a pretty decent knowledge of large pieces of it.  </p><p>But there are major changes here.  You know as well as anyone, Richard,  major changes in transformative tax legislation can mean billions of  dollars for an industry or millions of dollars for individuals.  Or just a  couple hundred dollars for individuals that could be extremely important,  depending on how much money they make.  And so, the speed with which  they're moving on this is unquestionably stunning on some level.  And I  think Republicans that are being candid with you would acknowledge that.   But the reality is, this is something they have said they wanted to do.   They feel comfortable with the direction that it's been going over the  course of the last couple of weeks.  And they're ready to go.  And they're  going to do this probably early next week.  </p><p>QUEST:  Phil, good to have you on the program, putting it into context for  us tonight.  Thank you.  </p><p>Straight to the stock exchange.  Peter Tuchman is at the New York Stock  Exchange.  Good to see you, Peter.  The rally, three records -- I mean, any  -- is it the tax?  Is it general feeling of goodwill?  Why such a strong  rally today?  </p><p>PETER TUCHMAN, FLOOR BROKER, QUATTRO M.  SECURITIES:  You know what, I  listened to the interview you just had, and I kind of -- I was not sort of  a big fan of the fact that this keeps being the tax bill that's making this  market go higher and higher, but it's very convincing, your last interview,  talking about all of the other sort of the small bits and pieces of the tax  reform bill that are really -- that the people who are in the money, who  are in the brighter side of this business, are obviously understanding in a  better way.  This is real valuation.  Obviously, there's a lot of money  savings.  Tax reform seems to be a big part of it.  But I think it's the  end of the year.  There's no window dressing here.  This is real money,  real valuation.  A lot of euphoria in the marketplace.  I think it's  amazing.  Record highs again across the board.  </p><p>QUEST:  And I'm looking at the list of record highs in our trading post, 69  Dows, 61 S&amp;Ps.  71 Nasdaq.  And if it continues, it will be the most  records f for the S&amp;P in history.  </p><p>TUCHMAN:  You know what, Richard, this year has been unprecedented as far  as records go.  I think it's really important to see the speed with which  the market keeps going higher.  There are people who are probably betting  this market cannot keep going higher.  And that's sort of fueling it in a  way too.  There's a lot of people who have been waiting around for this  market to break.  They're sitting here in December having seen the market  go up 5,000 points, they've got to jump on board too.  So, they're around  here too.  </p><p>QUEST:  One of your colleagues was saying -- down at the exchange on \"QUEST  EXPRESS\" to me that today may have been the busiest day of -- for the rest  of the year.  It may be -- or may be a quiet day now.  What was the final  volume?  </p><p>TUCHMAN:  The volume is 2.4 billion.  Richard, I told you earlier, the  opening volume is 400 million.  We did 2 billion probably over a billion  three on the close.  </p><p>[16:10:00] It was an S&amp;P rebalance, a Russell, a Gold, an Illyrian across  the board and a quadruple witch.  It was probably the busiest day of the  year.  </p><p>QUEST:  I'll see you down on the floor tomorrow for \"QUEST EXPRESS.\"  </p><p>TUCHMAN:  I look forward to it, sir, see you later.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you, Peter Tuchman joining me.</p><p>Now the tax uncertainty in Washington weighed on some of the European  markets.  Take a look at how the numbers traded.  They mostly finished in  the Green despite weak results from the Swedish retailer, H&amp;M.  The pound  fell nearly 1 percent against the dollar.  </p><p>The most difficult phase of Brexit negotiations is ahead, and now the EU  member states say it can begin.  British businesses our breathing down the  neck of Prime Minister Theresa May's neck.  Talks will begin almost  immediately.  Negotiations on the trading relationship won't start until  March.  The parties must find agreement on key issues by next October.   That gives a time for the EU, the Parliament and the U.K. Parliament before  the U.K. leaves in2019.  Donald Tusk is warning, though, that this  schedule, tight though it is, will not easy to be met.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TUSK, EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT:  Still early, of course,  dramatically difficult.  For sure, the second phase will be I think more  demanding, more challenging than the first phase.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Erin McLaughlin is in Brussels for us tonight.  Erin, if the  trading or trade policy is not going to be the guidelines until March, what  are they going to be negotiating between now and then since the Prime  Minister, Theresa May, said that talks would start immediately?  What will  they be talking about?  </p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, focus of phase two of the  negotiations will be on the transition, or the implementation, as it's  called, in the U.K. And that is something that Theresa May has asked for.   A transition period of around two years in which basically the status quo  remains the same after Brexit, March 29th, of 2019.  Essentially things  stay the same in order to give businesses the opportunity to adjust to  implement the Brexit deal, the withdrawal agreement, which I expected in  October.  </p><p>And today, what we heard from the EU Wayne out in stark terms, what it sees  that transition period to entail.  Essentially meaning that the U.K. is  going to have to continue to follow EU rules.  Remain under the  jurisdiction of European courts.  Pay into the budget.  But critically,  Richard, they lose the seats at the EU table.  So suddenly the U.K. will be  in the position of becoming rule-takers, not rule-makers, likely to be a  bitter pill for many Brexiteers to swallow.  </p><p>QUEST:  I can see how they have come to that argument.  The U.K. doesn't  have much choice in that sense.  It's their gain if you want to still sit  at a table or if you still want to enjoy our benefit, this is the price  you've got to pay.  </p><p>MCLAUGHLIN Yes.  And to some extent, Theresa May has already acknowledged  that.  That if the U.K. I going to remain within the single market in some  capacity following Brexit as part of this transition agreement that they're  going to have to follow the -- the U.K. is going to follow EU rules.  Now  questions remain about the transition in terms of trade.  I was just  speaking to an EU source.  The question being, will the U.K. be able to  negotiate trade deals going forward.  And the EU source is telling me what  they want to hear from the U.K. at this point.  They want to hear Theresa  May articulate her vision for the transition, specifically on trade.  Will  the U.K. want to remain a part of the customs union as part of that  transition?  That will impact this implementation period, as well.  They  also want to hear from the U.K. in terms of what they see the future  relationship being.  We know that Theresa May is going to begin to have  those discussions with her cabinet next week.  </p><p>QUEST:  Erin in Brussels.  Erin, thank you.  </p><p>Canadian firms are planning to do more business with Europe because of  uncertainty over whether the NAFTA trade rules will survive.  This is  according to a new report that says 23 percent of firms surveyed by the  Export Development Canada said NAFTA was having a negative impact.  And a  quarter of those impacted said they were considering moving to the United  States.  Others could drift away, 23 said they were trying to diversify  their markets.  Pivoting attention to the EU.  Of course, there is a new  trade agreement.  </p><p>Peter Hall is the chief economist at the Export Development Canada, and is  in Ottawa for us tonight.  We've known now for some months that the risk of  NAFTA collapsing was a theoretical one.  </p><p>[16:15:02] But this number suggests it's becoming real and businesses are  starting to make contingency plans.  </p><p>PETER HALL, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EXPORT DEVELOPMENT CANADA:  Well, we were back  in May, confronted with a business community, an exporting community in  Canada, that was already having pressure put on it by U.S. buyers to  actually locate in the United States then.  So, at that time, I was doing a  cross-Canada tour.  I do that every May.  And Canadian exporters were  coming up to me saying, look, my buyer is actually talking to me and is  saying, you really need to co-locate down here.  We're worried about the  risks that we face.  So, they were saying, what should I do?  This is real.  </p><p>QUEST:  So -- I mean, the problem is, in many of the cases, I mean, co- locating sounds like a nice idea.  Buti f your factory is north of the  goods have to go backwards and forwards -- let's take automobiles, for  example.  It's not the sort of thing you can just ginny up in a couple of  months or so.  It's going to be very difficult for some, particularly  agricultural and obviously heavy manufacturing, to just have token presence  in the United States for the purpose of a post NAFTA.  </p><p>HALL:  Well, absolutely.  And U.S buyers actually understand that  completely.  You know, our information was anecdotal.  I wouldn't say it  was across the board, because when the poison pill clauses were put in  round four of the NAFTA negotiations, of course, what happened then?  Well,  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce got very active in Washington, D.C., lobbying  for NAFTA.  The auto lobby, which is a very tightly insinuated supply chain  on either side of the border got very active.  The retail sector, which  would be responsible for passing on the higher cost of goods that have to  cross a border to the average American, did not want that role.  And so,  they got active in support of NAFTA, too.  So, it's not just costs for  Canadian businesses.  It's actually costs for Americans and American  businesses, too.  </p><p>QUEST:  Can -- I mean, how damaging will it be for Canadian exporters if  NAFTA -- if the U.S. does pull the rug on NAFTA?  </p><p>HALL:  Well, at the limit, we've done a study that has said, look, if it  took us back to pre-U.S./Canada free trade agreement days, it could tip us  into recession based on last year's numbers.  So, this is something that  may be quite damaging.  That would all be borne by the trade sector.  So,  of course, if it was a recession in GDP terms, it would be definitely a  recession in export terms.  However, there are other ways of getting around  that.  If we reverted back to most favored nation trading status and had to  pay higher tariffs, you know, we -- essentially wouldn't be under -- under  the gun to bear all of this paperwork that would go with country of origin  requirements and sourcing and North American content and so forth.  You'd  bypass all of that.  And some firms may actually choose to pay that premium  in order to get by on all the paperwork.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir, thank you.  We look forward to talking more  about it in the future.  </p><p>HALL:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  There are new rules for travelers visiting the United States.  It's  hitting people from the 38 countries that are part of the visa waiver  program.  We'll discuss them after the break.  QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, live  from New York.  </p><p>[16:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  It was an extraordinary moment, both what you're seeing just then  at the trading post.  Extraordinary moment and also the United Nations with  the representatives from the United States and North Korea in the same  room.  First time in a decade the North Korean ambassador has addressed the  Security Council.  The U.S. Secretary of State says North Korea must earn  its way back to negotiating table.  Rex Tillerson warned that U.S. will not  let up its pressure on the regime.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REX TILLERSON, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  We simply cannot continue to  accept the progress of North Korea's program.  We will maintain the  pressure campaign.  And in fact, we undertake efforts to increase the  effectiveness of the pressure campaign, both through a combination of the  sanctions regime, full implementation and compliance of the sanction  regime, as well as unilateral actions on the part of many, many countries  to send the message to North Korea through diplomatic steps, as well as  economic steps.  That we do not accept the pathway where you're on.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Michelle Kosinski, CNN's senior diplomatic correspondent.  We saw  you're in New York, and we reeled you in to make -- </p><p>MICHELLE KOSINSKI, CNN SENIOR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT:  Always happy to do  so.  </p><p>QUEST:  This was an extraordinary day.  But so difficult for Rex Tillerson.   Who is saying one thing about North Korea, whilst his boss believes  something different.  </p><p>KOSINSKI:  Yes, I mean, on the one hand, you have this unique, crazy  situation of Tillerson being right across the table at the UN Security  Council from North Korea.  And the whole session is about how bad North  Korea has been.  So, you're sitting there watching, what are they going to  say?  Is there going to be any sharing or any kind of softening on North  Korea's stance?  And, of course, we got none.  So, it's probably bad to be  so optimistic about anything fun happening there.  I mean, it was pretty  anti-climactic from that standpoint.  There was also the question of what  is Rex Tillerson talking about?  </p><p>QUEST:  Tell me more, though, about what's happening in Rex Tillerson's  State Department?  I mean, if I read the reports, obviously ambassadorial  posts are unfilled.  Senior -- </p><p>KOSINSKI:  Dozens.  </p><p>QUEST:  Senior posts are unfilled.  </p><p>KOSINSKI:  Right.  </p><p>QUEST:  Morale is rock-bottom.  </p><p>KOSINSKI:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  How is this thing functioning?  </p><p>KOSINSKI:  It functions because there are still people filling those  positions.  The problem is, people are leaving on the lower levels.  And  also, the people who were in acting positions, like acting assistant  secretaries, it's not as if they're seen around the world as being the word  of the administration.  And, you know, President Trump will say, well, I'm  the only one that matters, so don't worry about that.  But other countries  are having legitimate problems dealing with the State Department.  And the  State Department will deny this, and they say everything is functioning  fine.  And they'll push back.  But the people that we talked to say that  that's not quite the case.  </p><p>QUEST:  So how does -- because, you know, as a business show, we look at it  from a management perspective.  How does Rex Tillerson justify what is  being reported as a State Department that some have seen -- I won't say in  chaos, but at least ineffectual because of the lack of management?  </p><p>KOSINSKI:  He doesn't really justify it.  He makes the point that the State  Department needs reorganizing and to some extent, absolutely, I don't know  there are too many people who would disagree with let's put more efficiency  back into it.  And let's trim away things that aren't working.  Absolutely,  sure.  But what we're hearing just this week when he sort of unveiled to a  town hall at the State Department his plan, people saying, you know --  these are former senior State Department officials who are saying, wait a  second.  This is what he spent a million dollars on in less than a year?   Like that's it?  This is his big reorg plan?  Whys he putting such a high  emphasis on things that lower-level tech people may should be handling?   Like, there's a lack of understanding as to how all the energy he's put in  is going to come out putting the U.S. in a stronger position  internationally.  </p><p>QUEST:  Talk to me about what you are hearing other leaders, diplomats,  ambassadors in Washington saying about what's happening in the U.S.  capitol.  </p><p>KOSINSKI:  It's so much.  I almost don't know where to begin.  </p><p>[16:25:00] QUEST:  Please.  </p><p>KOSINSKI:  But to be brief, on the sort of day-to-day aspect, it's  fascinating.  Because they say it will take days to set up a meeting.  You  call the State Department, and they say, oh, yes, maybe, sure we can do  this.  But then even to set up a meeting it's taking time.  And they say  they need information to send back to their own country immediately.  So  what they do is they go on the State Department website and fish around.   And they find that that doesn't work so well.  So, then they start looking  at places like the BBC and CNN.  And they'll go to the CNN website to get  the information that they need.  And it's coming from places like that and  not from the State Department.  On the higher end, we're hearing  ambassadors saying the State Department is invisible right now.  And that's  the scary thing.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.  Thank you for taking time and joining us in the studio.  </p><p>KOSINSKI:  Thank you.  Happy to.  </p><p>QUEST:  Have a bell.  </p><p>KOSINSKI:  Oh, I get just one?  </p><p>QUEST:  One.  </p><p>KOSINSKI:  Can I do it five times?  </p><p>QUEST:  No.</p><p>KOSINSKI:  OK.</p><p>QUEST:  Talking abo giving them an inch and they'll take a mile.  Five  times.  </p><p>There are new rules coming tourists visiting the United States on these  visa waiver program.  It allows 90 days of travel without a visa.   Travelers from 38 countries our facing increased vetting.  The new rules  also target companies where 2 percent more have tourist overstay illegally.   Hungary, Greece, Portugal and San Marino -- for some reason -- all break  the limit.  It means they'll have to launch public information campaigns to  reduce violations.  Tal Kopan, CNN's politics reporter is in Washington.  I  guess, do we know why San Marino for some reason -- is there a particular  quirk of this that I'm missing?  </p><p>TAL KOPAN, CNN POLITICS REPORTER:  I'm not sure.  I mean, the issue here  is, the percentage of travelers that these countries send to the U.S. who  then stay past what they're supposed to, which is one of the contributors  to illegal immigration in this country.  I don't know why San Marino  appears to be one of those countries.  </p><p>QUEST:  We know countries, for example, Poland, for example, it is not in  visa waiver.  Because it's not had the 2 percent, or it has breached --  consistently breached the 2 percent limit.  So, the U.S. is saying, as I  understand it, have a campaign or we'll take your visa waiver.  </p><p>KOPAN:  Right.  This is a little bit vague, exactly, what they're asking  these countries to do.  But it's a combination of increasing the vetting of  people coming through their borders, and then in this particular instance,  doing some sort of public awareness to their citizens that they cannot  overstay their visa once they get here.  And yes, there are also are some  vague threats involved.  But it's not clear exactly what the consequences  are going to be.  This seems to be another effort by the Trump  administration to get into this so-called extreme vetting, where they also  sort of conceal exactly what they want that to look like.  </p><p>And yet, Tal, we see numbers from U.S. travel.  The number of tourists are  down.  I mean, you know -- there is a view that some say I'd rather not go  to the United States.  Who wants to be insulted at the border?  Who wants  to have extreme vetting?  Who wants an embassy appointment?  It's not worth  it.  There's plenty of places l the rest of the world to visit.  </p><p>KOPAN:  That is absolutely something that critics of the Trump  administration are pointing to right now.  Student visa numbers have also  lagged.  You know, there as a sense that the Trump administration is making  America look unwelcoming.  And keep in mind, there's major industries in  the U.S. that rely on travel and foreign travelers are a big contributor of  that.  And so, when you see those numbers starting to down, universities  are scared about their enrollment, the hospitality industry, some of these  major cities that really enjoy some of those high tourism numbers.  This is  something that could have widespread implications for American businesses.   But it's unclear if the Trump administration sees this as an unfortunate  consequence or actually by design for some of the policies they're putting  into place.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you.  Thank you.  </p><p>KOPAN:  Thanks.  </p><p>As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, come to Europe then.  If  you don't want to go to the U.S., Europe, land of the free internet.  Home  of the open wave.  One member of the European parliament pitching her  content as the U.S. rolls back on internet neutrality.  QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS, live from New York.  </p><p>[16:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Hello, I've Richard Quest.  More QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a  moment.  When bitcoin hits a new all-time high as it prepares for another  market milestone for this weekend.  And Disney can afford to buy about  2,000 more bitcoins after a stellar opening for the new \"Star Wars.\"  As we  continue, this is CNN, and on this network, the facts always come first.  </p><p>The North Korean Ambassador to the United Nations says the U.S. is  terrified of his countries, quote, incredible might.  He spoke at a lengthy  security council meeting on Pyongyang's nuclear program and said North  Korea doesn't pose a threat to any state, as long as its interests aren't  infringed upon.  </p><p>Palestinian officials say four people were killed in Friday's protests over  the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  Hundreds are  also hurt.  There were clashes in the West Bank, Gaza, and the Jerusalem  suburbs behind the separation barrier.  </p><p>Dutch police say they are not currently treating an incident at Amsterdam's  Schiphol airport at terrorism.  Officers shot a man in the leg after they  say he entered the airport's police office and threatened someone with a  knife.  The airport was briefly evacuated but is now back to normal.  </p><p>President Trump has praised police and FBI agents at a speech he gave at  the FBI National Academy on Friday.  He struck a different tone only  moments earlier on his way to the speech.  He called congruent to the FBI  disgraceful and vowed to rebuild the federal agency.  </p><p>It is official.  We have a date.  Kensington Palace say Prince Harry and  Meghan Markle will marry May 19th of next year.  The ceremony will be at  St.  George's chapel in Windsor.  The pair announced their engagement last  month.  Harry said he knew Markle was the one from the first time they met.  </p><p>So, another day, another record for bitcoin.  A record on Friday.  Over the  course of a very busy week, it's traded between 13,000 and nearly 18,000.   Futures began trading on the CBOE on Sunday.  They launch on the CME this  weekend.  Bitcoin suffered setbacks to multiple exchanges suffered outages,  and that enraged investors.  Janet Yellen's called cryptocurrency highly  speculative.  The current price of bitcoins, as you can see in the trading  post, 17,432.  A gain of a -- a mere gain of 5.5 percent, up $901.  Joining  me, Michael Casey, is the chairman of the CoinDesk advisory board.  Good to  see you, sir.  </p><p>MICHAEL CASEY, CHAIRMAN, COINDESK ADVISORY BOARD:  Thank you.  Nice to meet  you.  </p><p>QUEST:  When you're backwards and forwards on whether bitcoin is  speculative, bubble or not, it doesn't really take us anywhere.  Other than  to ask, what purpose does bitcoin serve at these elevated prices?  </p><p>CASEY:  Well, I mean, I think if we think of it purely as a currency, a  normal medium of exchange, it's hard to see it functioning very well at  that level right now.  People are truly hoarding it or hoddling it, as the  bitcoin enthusiasts like to call.  And that doesn't really make for a  currency exchange.  But it certainly plays a role as a mechanism for  establishing a store value.  </p><p>[16:35:00] But just as importantly, I think, and it's hard to actually  quantity this, is just the buzz around things.  Right.  And that buzz  itself --</p><p>QUEST:  Why is that important?  That buzz?  Because if it's something that  is speculative, where people believe that there is a fall about to happen,  simply on -- look, I'm not being prejudiced against bitcoin.  </p><p>CASEY:  Sure.  </p><p>QUEST:  But on history -- </p><p>CASEY:  Yes.  </p><p>QUEST:  It tell us anything that rises this fast, falls quickly, too.  </p><p>CASEY:  I would not be surprised if we get a big correction from these  levels.  I think that's absolutely fair.  If we look through history,  bubbles have played this role of forming capital.  With the classic is the  dot-com bubble, of course, which collapsed and then led us to this  infrastructure that led us to Google and Facebook and everything else.  </p><p>Those of us who believe that the underlying technology of bitcoin, the  decentralized architects that allows us to resolve the problem of trust and  have peer-to-peer exchanges and an internet of value, think this is the  building of that base.  And the reach why the buzz matters is because it  gets people talking about it.  It gets people thinking, how could the world  be different?  What sort of decentralized applications could we think  about?  So there's immeasurable number of conversations going on around the  world right now.  We don't know where this is going to go.  But the buzz is  actually important.  </p><p>QUEST:  The buzz it is important, so you see, but widows and orphans,  ordinary investors, they require architecture of regulation to ensure  safety.  I understand and before every bitcoiner out there flames me.  I  understand you all love the fact that it's no regulation, there's nobody  watching over, you can do what you like with it.  But ordinary people do  require an element of security.  </p><p>CASEY:  Absolutely.  And I think that this -- we need to grow up.  </p><p>QUEST:  Yes, thank you.  </p><p>CASEY:  I've been saying this for some time.  I mean, bitcoin, the whole to  the moon idea, it's not a really sophisticated way to go good investing.   We need two-way flow.  We need self-governing institutions.  We need  journalists who start probe these things.  We need, you know -- we need  some form of regulation.  And we need some mechanism to keep this under  control.  I think ultimately that will come.  I mean, this is very early  days.  There are people who are building out professional investments  institutions and vehicles.  We're going to get to a point.  But in the  meantime, yes, we might see some widows and orphans -- </p><p>QUEST:  Just gone up.</p><p>CASEY:  -- suffer.  Oh, there it goes.  </p><p>QUEST:  You're talking about nuts.  Finally, one question.  Look, assuming  I bought a bitcoin, and I bought it at, say, 1,000, and it's now worth  17,000, and I want to spend it, and I'm buying something from you, but --  what I'm buying from you is only $1,000.  How -- how do you pay change?   What do you do?  </p><p>CASEY:  Yes.  So, the bitcoin protocol, if you're talking about how it  actually -- </p><p>QUEST:  Yes.  </p><p>CASEY:  It has a mechanism for change.  Basically, it then sends an amount  back to the same address.  And so, if you're talking specifically about the  functionality of that, that's why if you look at bitcoin entries on the  block chain, it actually has two of them.  One is the change.  And that's  the way it works, yes.</p><p>QUEST:  And there is nobody regulating it?  </p><p>CASEY:  No, it regulates itself.  That's the pure beauty of it.  Right.  It  actually doesn't need a regulator.  Because it's run through this  decentralized system.  That's actually what matters.</p><p>QUEST:  I need to rethink what I think about all of this.  Thank you for  coming in, sir.  </p><p>CASEY:  You're most welcome.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.</p><p>Now, a top U.S. Senator is mocking the backlash to Thursday's vote to roll  back net neutrality.  Ted Cruz is calling activists snowflakes who are  believing online propaganda.  The co-founder of Reddit, Alexis Ohanian,  told CNN, the repeal of the regulation makes internet like cable TV.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEXIS OHANIAN, COFOUNDER, REDDIT:  What repealing this does is effectively  giving service providers the ability to turn our internet into something  that looks like our cable bill.  Where you might one day want to visit your  favorite website, and find out that actually, it's not part of your  internet package, and for some additional amount of money, now you can get  access.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  One member of Europe's Parliament says tech companies should come  to Europe if the U.S. is going to crack down.  Marietje Schaake, says  Europe's rules can help companies to compete.  She joins me now from  Brussels.  I see what you're saying.  But you say this with a straight  face, since many, many tech companies believe Europe to be a chilly and  unfriendly regulatory environment for them.  </p><p>MARIETJE SCHAAKE, DUTCH MEMBER OF EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT:  Well, I disagree,  of course.  And certainly, when it comes to net neutrality safeguards, we  have secured those in Europe.  And think that it will prove to be very  important for innovation and for startups to have a chance to compete with  the very, very large, almost monopolistic players in the U.S. </p><p>QUEST:  So, Europe has gone against google and antitrust it's got the right  to be forgotten.  It has taken Apple over taxation.  Facebook, as well, on  taxes.  I understand, you know, Europe sees this as a legitimacy in each of  these actions.  But from their -- from the industry's point of view, they  don't see it as a favorable -- or at least a laissez faire environment like  the United States now.</p><p>[16:40:05] SCHAAKE:  Well, that may be the case.  But I think you also see  in the United States in the whole discussion about the impact that social  media platforms and big-tech companies have on democracy, the filter  bubbles that people find themselves in.  The so-called fake news  discussion.  That actually people are concerned about the major role of  these tech companies.  And if we don't want the huge technology companies  and the huge internet providers to cut deals with each other for faster  access to their content at the expense of public websites or smaller  competitors, then net neutrality is key.  </p><p>QUEST:  What if president Trump and the FCC administration are right?  And  that actually, by getting rid of net neutrality, as they believe, rules  that are somewhat anti-competitive in that sense, but allow everybody to  compete against each other.  That there will be greater innovation and that  you don't actually need all this net neutrality nonsense, as they would put  it.  </p><p>SCHAAKE:  Well, I think it's an illusion to think that fair competition  regulates itself.  There is always rules of the road, and net neutrality  safeguards fair competition in the digital economy.  If they prove to be  right, of course, I'm happy to be convinced.  But at the moment, I'm really  not sure.  And I'm not alone.  There were 22 million Americans that  submitted their comments on an online application to the FCC.  And 98  percent of them were in favor of keeping net neutrality.  The founders of  the internet spoke in favor of net neutrality.  I know a number of startups  and consumer rights organizations did.  And I really wonder why they would  if they think that competition would benefit all of them.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  But of those 28 million, you will be aware that a large  number have since been proven to be from dead people, or from others.  And  it's highly questionable exactly how many of those were legitimate.  But  your point is taken.  Your point is well taken, that there were -- that  there are a large number of traditionalists who are against the  continuation of net neutrality.  Finally, Europe -- </p><p>SCHAAKE:  I wouldn't consider myself a traditionalist, to be frank.  I  consider myself to be a modern-day regulator.  And I don't think it's  traditional to be in favor of net neutrality.  </p><p>QUEST:  On the question of completing the digital single market in Europe,  which, of course, is still some way off, and might be delayed in a post  Brexit world, how much of a priority is that?  </p><p>SCHAAKE:  It's a top priority.  And it will continue, even as we're dealing  with the unfortunate Brexit negotiations that are ongoing.  But I think the  U.K. will find that it's actually quite helpful to be part of one  regulatory space of 500 million consumers.  And that when it comes to the  global internet, even the EU is small.  And so, for us to have predictable  and level playing field rules is actually a benefit for both large and  smaller companies.  </p><p>QUEST:  Marietje Schaake, thank you for staying up late and working late  tonight to talk to us.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>Saudi Arabia is continuing to look forward as a part program and a new  program of its vision 2030.  The idea, of course, move the economy away  from oil.  </p><p>[16:45:03] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Saudi Arabia has revealed a new $19 billion program to boost  housing and small business.  It's part of the country's vision 2030 plan to  pull the economy away from oil.  I'm joined by Ali Shihabi, the executive  director of the Arabia Foundation, who is with me.  Good to see you, sir.   Thank you.  $19 billion should go some way.  But why is it necessary?  </p><p>ALI SHIHABI, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ARABIA FOUNDATION:  Well, it's necessary,  because the country has been going though effectively economic and  political shock therapy for the last 12 months.  There is so much change  happening.  And you know when you have change, necessary change, critical  change, but change, nonetheless, investors get nervous and cautious.  So,  the economy has got into a bit of a stand still.  And I think you need this  to -- it's a bit of testosterone if you want to shake it up.  </p><p>QUEST:  Testosterone it is true.  But really what we're all focused on at  the moment are the hundreds of people who are still locked up at the Ritz- Carlton hotel, particularly Prince Al-Waleed.  What's happening with them?   That's what everybody wants to know.  And information is few and far  between about the discouraging of allegedly corrupt profits.  Who is being  released, who is not.  It is not a transparent procedure at the moment.  </p><p>SHIHABI:  No, it's not.  And there is a fundamental logic and reason to  that.  Because under Sharia law, naming and shaming actually is part of the  punishment that you would get, and that would only come after a judgment by  court.  So effectively, you have to maintain -- until people go to court,  you have to maintain their anonymity.  And until they are convicted, you  have to maintain their anonymity.  Now, understandably, a few names have  been leaked.  But those are sort of high-profile names and they were leaked  for a reason.  To send a political message, if you want, that nobody is  immune.  But beyond that, everybody else has the right -- that right to  anonymity.  </p><p>QUEST:  I fundamentally understand what you're saying about this.  However,  as this stimulus package, and the 2030, and the new city that's being  built, as all these policies, they are designed to show a modern Saudi  Arabia that's playing in the international capital markets.  And investors  require transparency of procedure.  For want of a better word, the rule of  law.  </p><p>SHIHABI:  Well, yes.  But you are going through surgery now.  You see?  In  a way, you're in triage.  Saudi Arabia is like a patient that's been taken  into the emergency room that's in triage.  Triage is very messy.  There is  blood all over the place.  It has to happen.  It has to be done with.  Now  once it's done with, and you've seen that in countries that have gone  through different types of shock, a few months and the hedge funds come in.   And then a few months after that, more normal investors come in.  So,  people really get over these things quite quickly.  But you are through a  period of pain that you have to undertake.  You see?  So, there is a price  associated with that.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  There is no question.  I was in Riyadh last month.  There  is no question that the changes being introduced, and the anti-corruption  drive, is exceptionally popular.  No question about it.  As indeed the idea  of opening cinemas, allowing women to drive, as of next year.  Does the  Crown Prince have to be careful that he's not moving too far too fast?  </p><p>SHIHABI:  Well, that's always a question of judgment.  And a bit of luck.   You know?  The problem is that Saudi Arabia has always gone too slow, too  little and too slow.  The country for the last 30 years as hardly moving at  all.  So, I think a lot of that speed or so is a reflection of the fact  that there was such an accumulated list of issues that had to be addressed.   That addressing them by definition means that all these things come at the  same time.  </p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you.  Next time, in Riyadh, we'll go  to the cinema together.  </p><p>SHIHABI:  Look forward.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much indeed.  </p><p>Talking of the cinema, the force remains strong for \"Star Wars,\" after \"The  Last Jedi\" storms into the box office.  Makes millions.  We need to know,  is this going to be a record opening?  Frank Pallotta will be with us after  the break.  It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p>[16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  And that reporter is here now.  Having braved the cold.  </p><p>FRANK PALLOTTA, CNNMONEY MEDIA REPORTER:  It was the Hoth system out there.   I was freezing.  It was so cold.  The Hoth system is an ice planet in  \"Empire Strikes Back.\"  We'll get into it some other time.  </p><p>QUEST:  Is it going to be a record?  </p><p>PALLOTTA:  It's going to come close.  So, some new numbers just came in.   Disney is now projecting that it could bring in around mid-90s -- mid 100 - - mid $90 million.  It will be close to $100 million for its opening day.   To put that in perspective, \"The Force Awakens\" brought in around $120  million for its opening day.  And last night for its opening night, it  brought in $45 million, which was only second to \"force awakens\".  </p><p>Is that because there was a lot more hoopla over it, and there's only a few  years between \"force awakens\" and this one?  </p><p>Look at it this way, the last time we saw Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke  Skywalker, 32-1/2-year wait.  And then after the prequels it was a decade- long wait.  This is only been a two-year-long wait.  And we had a \"Star  Wars\" movie \"The Rogue One\" spinoff last year.  So, we are back in the  \"Star Wars\" galaxy compared to two years ago when we were just thrown right  back into this wonderful world in a galaxy far, far away.  </p><p>QUEST:  Is it good?  </p><p>PALLOTTA:  It's good.  I saw it Monday.  I saw it with a bunch of other  people at AMC Lincoln Square, the theatre I was standing outside of, and  people were cheering.  People got a little emotional.  There was even a  moment where it was just pure silence.  You could hear people gasping.   It's good.  People like it.  There has been a little blow back online from  some of fans who were saying it's too different.  It's hard to please \"Star  Wars\" fans.  They were saying \"Force Awakens\" is too much like the  original.  Now they're saying \"The Last Jedi\" is nothing like the original.   You can't please some people.</p><p>QUEST:  How much did across to make?  Do we have a number yet?</p><p>PALLOTTA:  We don't have -- Disney keeps the numbers very close to the  vest.  But it's in the hundreds of millions -- it's in the hundreds of  millions of dollars.  This is their major franchise.  This is what they're  really banking on.  You saw that huge deal yesterday.  This is what it's  for.  Things like this.  There is movies and then there's cinematic events  like \"Star Wars.\"  Disney hooks up with Fox to bring in more, so they can  make Marvel bigger.  So, that they can make \"Avatar\" the biggest movie of  all-time bigger.  This is where we're going.  It's no longer just going to  be movies.  It's going to be like going to a concert.  You can watch a  movie at home, but you can't experience it like the opening weekend of  \"Star Wars.\"  If you want to put it on, Richard, you look good in it.  Do  you want me to do it?  Sure.  You can even talk like this.  Woo! </p><p>[16:55:00] QUEST:  Ooh, keep it on and tell the dear viewer that there is a  Profitable Moment -- I'll do it.  Give it here.  </p><p>PALLOTTA:  There you go.  </p><p>QUEST:  There's a Profitable Moment after the break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's profitable moment.  A very profitable moment, if you look  at the way the markets have risen today.  Three records on the Dow, the  Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500.  And the S&amp;P on record, or at least on track, for  having a record every month of the year, which in itself would be an all- time record.  Put this together, and you're seeing markets -- it's  difficult to understate or to really put into context what's happening.   Because at the same time as you have huge political machinations in  Washington, a tax bill, will it or won't it.  </p><p>Peter Tuchman tonight summed it up.  It's real money going into the real  market and making real profits.  And that needs to be borne in mind.  This  is not bitcoin that we are seeing.  Oh, to be sure, a correction may be on  the way.  We haven't had one for many years.  But that doesn't mean to say  that the gains that we're seeing at the moment are illusory.  They are not.   They are real, they are here, and at the moment, they seem likely to  continue.  And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight.  I'm Richard Quest  in New York.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it's  profitable.  Lots of green.  We'll do it again on Monday.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

We've got records on the Dow, records on the Nasdaq, record high on the S&amp;P 500. And we could have an all-time record for the number of records. Go on, yes, that's enough bell. To the business. Well, I suppose that's a firm gavel. Trading is over. It's Friday, it's December the 15th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, records all around on Wall Street. As Republicans are closing in on their tax plan. Theresa May gets some congratulations as Brexit talks now formally go to stage two. And European politicians tell tech companies to cross the Atlantic in search of net neutrality. Europe is the place to be.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Richard Quest, live in the world's financial capital. A rainy/snowy capital today, where I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. Tonight, volume is high, and so are the spirits on Wall Street. A record-breaking session to end the week, with all three major markets closing at an all-time high. And it comes as the Republicans in Congress are edging ever closer to an historic victory on their tax plan.</p><p>So, join me at the trading post as we put this into perspective. No question with the Dow, the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq, we have green all across the board today. And with record highs. So how many records? Where do we stand so far, this year? The Dow now has 69 records. S&amp;P, 61. And the Nasdaq has hit a record 71 times so far, this year. The Dow ends at a record -- it's the fourth time this week it's had this record. And the S&amp;P with 61 is on track to have made gains every month this year. If that happens, and it looks like it will by the end of the month, then that will be the first time in history that it's happened.</p><p>Now, one of the reasons why we saw extreme volatility during the course of the day was its quadruple witching day at the New York Stock Exchange. What that means is options, futures and cash market, various contracts, all expire at the same time. And when you put it like that, then you manage to get huge volatility. For example, the best part of 200 million shares had changed hands just the open alone. And we were heading towards 600, 700 million by the close of trading today.</p><p>Europe still lags somewhat on the record. We haven't had any really new -- we haven't had any new all-time highs on the FTSE, the DAX or the CAC for some time. Speaking to me earlier on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange, the global head of listings told me it had been a strong year all around, reinforced when you look at those numbers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN TUTTLE, GLOBAL HEAD OF LISTINGS, NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE: It's been a strong year for U.S. capital markets. It's been a great year for the New York Stock Exchange. Last year, worst year in over a decade for capital- raising, equity capital-raising. This year we had 88 new listings on the New York Stock Exchange, raised more than double we did last year. And the pipeline for next year is strong, too.</p><p>QUEST: Why do you think that is? What is it about -- I mean, or is it just one of the things that goes in cycles and favors?</p><p>TUTTLE: Well, the IPO window is open. What that means is that volatility is low and stable, interest rates are low but telegraphed to steadily rise. The companies that have public this year have performed well, by and large in the weeks, months and quarters following their listing. There is strong investor confidence.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: So now one of the reasons why the market has moved so sharply, the Republican tax plan. Now or never for this odyssey. The bill should release shortly. We're expecting it at 5:30 eastern time. Some crucial votes not yet fully locked in. In the past few hours, Marco Rubio and Bob Corker have announced they're back on side. So that's OK. There are three key senators that are still wavering. And two more Republicans have question marks over their health and ability to vote. Whichever way you look at it, President Trump remains bullish that this will get done.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have. I have seen it. I think it's going to do very, very well. I think that we are going to be in a position to pass something as early as next week, which will be monumental. I think they'll be great. They're great people. He wants to see it done. I know him very well. I know how they feel. These are great people. And they want to see it done. And they want to see it done properly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:05:00] QUEST: Phil Mattingly is on Capitol Hill. Phil, I was listening to you last night, talking to Anderson. This -- you were very forthright about the fact that, you know, no single senator is going to see this come down or have -- or risk the problem that will come with it if they bring it down.</p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN U.S. CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, look, I think that's long been the feeling of the top Republican aides and, frankly, lawmakers here. I've talked to a bunch of senators. Keep in mind, Richard, yesterday the GOP leaders were scrambling for Marco Rubio, didn't necessarily know that Senator Bob Corker would ever come back to yes. He was a no the first time around. And today it looks like they're on a glide path. Now you noted, there are still three Senators that haven't come out and said yes yet, Susan Collins, Jeff Flake, and Mike Lee. But the expectation right now, according to the GOP aides that I've been speaking to in the Senate, is that they will all likely come around.</p><p>The biggest concern was Marco Rubio. The one that they thought maybe wasn't even gettable at all was Senator Bob Corker. Now they're there. And I think you understand kind of the point the Senators were making to me last night which was the political imperative here, the idea of getting tax cut legislation, which has been something Republicans have campaigned on year after year, cycle after cycle. Is too great for them to try and stand in the way of it. And that seems to have won out at the end of the day. There are still some steps to go here. But right now, Republican leaders are very confident that they're not just going to pass this, they're going to actually pass this relatively easily.</p><p>QUEST: And the fascinating part, Phil, is that we're arguing or discussing, I should say, about a bill that no one has seen. That we don't have the full details yet. I mean, it is bizarre that the public debate continues, and nobody knows the minutia of what's in the reconciled bill.</p><p>MATTINGLY: Right. And you've got senators that are now saying, yes, to a bill that they haven't fully read yet. Obviously, public hasn't seen it either. If you think about it this way, this conference report that will come out, the final bill, is 503 pages long.</p><p>We haven't seen it. Most senators haven't seen it. The reason Senator Mike Lee is not officially a yes yet on this bill is because he hasn't read the bill yet. And if he hasn't read the bill, that means the rest of conference hasn't read the bill either. And I think there's a couple things here. First, look, they went through a process, obviously, they went through a committee process. The U.S. House passed their version of the bill. The U.S. Senate passed their version of the bill too. There are large portions, almost entirety of portions of those bills that will be reconciled under this bill. So, they have a framework of what they're voting on. They have a pretty decent knowledge of large pieces of it.</p><p>But there are major changes here. You know as well as anyone, Richard, major changes in transformative tax legislation can mean billions of dollars for an industry or millions of dollars for individuals. Or just a couple hundred dollars for individuals that could be extremely important, depending on how much money they make. And so, the speed with which they're moving on this is unquestionably stunning on some level. And I think Republicans that are being candid with you would acknowledge that. But the reality is, this is something they have said they wanted to do. They feel comfortable with the direction that it's been going over the course of the last couple of weeks. And they're ready to go. And they're going to do this probably early next week.</p><p>QUEST: Phil, good to have you on the program, putting it into context for us tonight. Thank you.</p><p>Straight to the stock exchange. Peter Tuchman is at the New York Stock Exchange. Good to see you, Peter. The rally, three records -- I mean, any -- is it the tax? Is it general feeling of goodwill? Why such a strong rally today?</p><p>PETER TUCHMAN, FLOOR BROKER, QUATTRO M. SECURITIES: You know what, I listened to the interview you just had, and I kind of -- I was not sort of a big fan of the fact that this keeps being the tax bill that's making this market go higher and higher, but it's very convincing, your last interview, talking about all of the other sort of the small bits and pieces of the tax reform bill that are really -- that the people who are in the money, who are in the brighter side of this business, are obviously understanding in a better way. This is real valuation. Obviously, there's a lot of money savings. Tax reform seems to be a big part of it. But I think it's the end of the year. There's no window dressing here. This is real money, real valuation. A lot of euphoria in the marketplace. I think it's amazing. Record highs again across the board.</p><p>QUEST: And I'm looking at the list of record highs in our trading post, 69 Dows, 61 S&amp;Ps. 71 Nasdaq. And if it continues, it will be the most records f for the S&amp;P in history.</p><p>TUCHMAN: You know what, Richard, this year has been unprecedented as far as records go. I think it's really important to see the speed with which the market keeps going higher. There are people who are probably betting this market cannot keep going higher. And that's sort of fueling it in a way too. There's a lot of people who have been waiting around for this market to break. They're sitting here in December having seen the market go up 5,000 points, they've got to jump on board too. So, they're around here too.</p><p>QUEST: One of your colleagues was saying -- down at the exchange on \"QUEST EXPRESS\" to me that today may have been the busiest day of -- for the rest of the year. It may be -- or may be a quiet day now. What was the final volume?</p><p>TUCHMAN: The volume is 2.4 billion. Richard, I told you earlier, the opening volume is 400 million. We did 2 billion probably over a billion three on the close.</p><p>[16:10:00] It was an S&amp;P rebalance, a Russell, a Gold, an Illyrian across the board and a quadruple witch. It was probably the busiest day of the year.</p><p>QUEST: I'll see you down on the floor tomorrow for \"QUEST EXPRESS.\"</p><p>TUCHMAN: I look forward to it, sir, see you later.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you, Peter Tuchman joining me.</p><p>Now the tax uncertainty in Washington weighed on some of the European markets. Take a look at how the numbers traded. They mostly finished in the Green despite weak results from the Swedish retailer, H&amp;M. The pound fell nearly 1 percent against the dollar.</p><p>The most difficult phase of Brexit negotiations is ahead, and now the EU member states say it can begin. British businesses our breathing down the neck of Prime Minister Theresa May's neck. Talks will begin almost immediately. Negotiations on the trading relationship won't start until March. The parties must find agreement on key issues by next October. That gives a time for the EU, the Parliament and the U.K. Parliament before the U.K. leaves in2019. Donald Tusk is warning, though, that this schedule, tight though it is, will not easy to be met.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TUSK, EUROPEAN COUNCIL PRESIDENT: Still early, of course, dramatically difficult. For sure, the second phase will be I think more demanding, more challenging than the first phase.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Erin McLaughlin is in Brussels for us tonight. Erin, if the trading or trade policy is not going to be the guidelines until March, what are they going to be negotiating between now and then since the Prime Minister, Theresa May, said that talks would start immediately? What will they be talking about?</p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, focus of phase two of the negotiations will be on the transition, or the implementation, as it's called, in the U.K. And that is something that Theresa May has asked for. A transition period of around two years in which basically the status quo remains the same after Brexit, March 29th, of 2019. Essentially things stay the same in order to give businesses the opportunity to adjust to implement the Brexit deal, the withdrawal agreement, which I expected in October.</p><p>And today, what we heard from the EU Wayne out in stark terms, what it sees that transition period to entail. Essentially meaning that the U.K. is going to have to continue to follow EU rules. Remain under the jurisdiction of European courts. Pay into the budget. But critically, Richard, they lose the seats at the EU table. So suddenly the U.K. will be in the position of becoming rule-takers, not rule-makers, likely to be a bitter pill for many Brexiteers to swallow.</p><p>QUEST: I can see how they have come to that argument. The U.K. doesn't have much choice in that sense. It's their gain if you want to still sit at a table or if you still want to enjoy our benefit, this is the price you've got to pay.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN Yes. And to some extent, Theresa May has already acknowledged that. That if the U.K. I going to remain within the single market in some capacity following Brexit as part of this transition agreement that they're going to have to follow the -- the U.K. is going to follow EU rules. Now questions remain about the transition in terms of trade. I was just speaking to an EU source. The question being, will the U.K. be able to negotiate trade deals going forward. And the EU source is telling me what they want to hear from the U.K. at this point. They want to hear Theresa May articulate her vision for the transition, specifically on trade. Will the U.K. want to remain a part of the customs union as part of that transition? That will impact this implementation period, as well. They also want to hear from the U.K. in terms of what they see the future relationship being. We know that Theresa May is going to begin to have those discussions with her cabinet next week.</p><p>QUEST: Erin in Brussels. Erin, thank you.</p><p>Canadian firms are planning to do more business with Europe because of uncertainty over whether the NAFTA trade rules will survive. This is according to a new report that says 23 percent of firms surveyed by the Export Development Canada said NAFTA was having a negative impact. And a quarter of those impacted said they were considering moving to the United States. Others could drift away, 23 said they were trying to diversify their markets. Pivoting attention to the EU. Of course, there is a new trade agreement.</p><p>Peter Hall is the chief economist at the Export Development Canada, and is in Ottawa for us tonight. We've known now for some months that the risk of NAFTA collapsing was a theoretical one.</p><p>[16:15:02] But this number suggests it's becoming real and businesses are starting to make contingency plans.</p><p>PETER HALL, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EXPORT DEVELOPMENT CANADA: Well, we were back in May, confronted with a business community, an exporting community in Canada, that was already having pressure put on it by U.S. buyers to actually locate in the United States then. So, at that time, I was doing a cross-Canada tour. I do that every May. And Canadian exporters were coming up to me saying, look, my buyer is actually talking to me and is saying, you really need to co-locate down here. We're worried about the risks that we face. So, they were saying, what should I do? This is real.</p><p>QUEST: So -- I mean, the problem is, in many of the cases, I mean, co- locating sounds like a nice idea. Buti f your factory is north of the goods have to go backwards and forwards -- let's take automobiles, for example. It's not the sort of thing you can just ginny up in a couple of months or so. It's going to be very difficult for some, particularly agricultural and obviously heavy manufacturing, to just have token presence in the United States for the purpose of a post NAFTA.</p><p>HALL: Well, absolutely. And U.S buyers actually understand that completely. You know, our information was anecdotal. I wouldn't say it was across the board, because when the poison pill clauses were put in round four of the NAFTA negotiations, of course, what happened then? Well, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce got very active in Washington, D.C., lobbying for NAFTA. The auto lobby, which is a very tightly insinuated supply chain on either side of the border got very active. The retail sector, which would be responsible for passing on the higher cost of goods that have to cross a border to the average American, did not want that role. And so, they got active in support of NAFTA, too. So, it's not just costs for Canadian businesses. It's actually costs for Americans and American businesses, too.</p><p>QUEST: Can -- I mean, how damaging will it be for Canadian exporters if NAFTA -- if the U.S. does pull the rug on NAFTA?</p><p>HALL: Well, at the limit, we've done a study that has said, look, if it took us back to pre-U.S./Canada free trade agreement days, it could tip us into recession based on last year's numbers. So, this is something that may be quite damaging. That would all be borne by the trade sector. So, of course, if it was a recession in GDP terms, it would be definitely a recession in export terms. However, there are other ways of getting around that. If we reverted back to most favored nation trading status and had to pay higher tariffs, you know, we -- essentially wouldn't be under -- under the gun to bear all of this paperwork that would go with country of origin requirements and sourcing and North American content and so forth. You'd bypass all of that. And some firms may actually choose to pay that premium in order to get by on all the paperwork.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir, thank you. We look forward to talking more about it in the future.</p><p>HALL: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: There are new rules for travelers visiting the United States. It's hitting people from the 38 countries that are part of the visa waiver program. We'll discuss them after the break. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, live from New York.</p><p>[16:20:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: It was an extraordinary moment, both what you're seeing just then at the trading post. Extraordinary moment and also the United Nations with the representatives from the United States and North Korea in the same room. First time in a decade the North Korean ambassador has addressed the Security Council. The U.S. Secretary of State says North Korea must earn its way back to negotiating table. Rex Tillerson warned that U.S. will not let up its pressure on the regime.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REX TILLERSON, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We simply cannot continue to accept the progress of North Korea's program. We will maintain the pressure campaign. And in fact, we undertake efforts to increase the effectiveness of the pressure campaign, both through a combination of the sanctions regime, full implementation and compliance of the sanction regime, as well as unilateral actions on the part of many, many countries to send the message to North Korea through diplomatic steps, as well as economic steps. That we do not accept the pathway where you're on.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Michelle Kosinski, CNN's senior diplomatic correspondent. We saw you're in New York, and we reeled you in to make --</p><p>MICHELLE KOSINSKI, CNN SENIOR DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT: Always happy to do so.</p><p>QUEST: This was an extraordinary day. But so difficult for Rex Tillerson. Who is saying one thing about North Korea, whilst his boss believes something different.</p><p>KOSINSKI: Yes, I mean, on the one hand, you have this unique, crazy situation of Tillerson being right across the table at the UN Security Council from North Korea. And the whole session is about how bad North Korea has been. So, you're sitting there watching, what are they going to say? Is there going to be any sharing or any kind of softening on North Korea's stance? And, of course, we got none. So, it's probably bad to be so optimistic about anything fun happening there. I mean, it was pretty anti-climactic from that standpoint. There was also the question of what is Rex Tillerson talking about?</p><p>QUEST: Tell me more, though, about what's happening in Rex Tillerson's State Department? I mean, if I read the reports, obviously ambassadorial posts are unfilled. Senior --</p><p>KOSINSKI: Dozens.</p><p>QUEST: Senior posts are unfilled.</p><p>KOSINSKI: Right.</p><p>QUEST: Morale is rock-bottom.</p><p>KOSINSKI: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: How is this thing functioning?</p><p>KOSINSKI: It functions because there are still people filling those positions. The problem is, people are leaving on the lower levels. And also, the people who were in acting positions, like acting assistant secretaries, it's not as if they're seen around the world as being the word of the administration. And, you know, President Trump will say, well, I'm the only one that matters, so don't worry about that. But other countries are having legitimate problems dealing with the State Department. And the State Department will deny this, and they say everything is functioning fine. And they'll push back. But the people that we talked to say that that's not quite the case.</p><p>QUEST: So how does -- because, you know, as a business show, we look at it from a management perspective. How does Rex Tillerson justify what is being reported as a State Department that some have seen -- I won't say in chaos, but at least ineffectual because of the lack of management?</p><p>KOSINSKI: He doesn't really justify it. He makes the point that the State Department needs reorganizing and to some extent, absolutely, I don't know there are too many people who would disagree with let's put more efficiency back into it. And let's trim away things that aren't working. Absolutely, sure. But what we're hearing just this week when he sort of unveiled to a town hall at the State Department his plan, people saying, you know -- these are former senior State Department officials who are saying, wait a second. This is what he spent a million dollars on in less than a year? Like that's it? This is his big reorg plan? Whys he putting such a high emphasis on things that lower-level tech people may should be handling? Like, there's a lack of understanding as to how all the energy he's put in is going to come out putting the U.S. in a stronger position internationally.</p><p>QUEST: Talk to me about what you are hearing other leaders, diplomats, ambassadors in Washington saying about what's happening in the U.S. capitol.</p><p>KOSINSKI: It's so much. I almost don't know where to begin.</p><p>[16:25:00] QUEST: Please.</p><p>KOSINSKI: But to be brief, on the sort of day-to-day aspect, it's fascinating. Because they say it will take days to set up a meeting. You call the State Department, and they say, oh, yes, maybe, sure we can do this. But then even to set up a meeting it's taking time. And they say they need information to send back to their own country immediately. So what they do is they go on the State Department website and fish around. And they find that that doesn't work so well. So, then they start looking at places like the BBC and CNN. And they'll go to the CNN website to get the information that they need. And it's coming from places like that and not from the State Department. On the higher end, we're hearing ambassadors saying the State Department is invisible right now. And that's the scary thing.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you. Thank you for taking time and joining us in the studio.</p><p>KOSINSKI: Thank you. Happy to.</p><p>QUEST: Have a bell.</p><p>KOSINSKI: Oh, I get just one?</p><p>QUEST: One.</p><p>KOSINSKI: Can I do it five times?</p><p>QUEST: No.</p><p>KOSINSKI: OK.</p><p>QUEST: Talking abo giving them an inch and they'll take a mile. Five times.</p><p>There are new rules coming tourists visiting the United States on these visa waiver program. It allows 90 days of travel without a visa. Travelers from 38 countries our facing increased vetting. The new rules also target companies where 2 percent more have tourist overstay illegally. Hungary, Greece, Portugal and San Marino -- for some reason -- all break the limit. It means they'll have to launch public information campaigns to reduce violations. Tal Kopan, CNN's politics reporter is in Washington. I guess, do we know why San Marino for some reason -- is there a particular quirk of this that I'm missing?</p><p>TAL KOPAN, CNN POLITICS REPORTER: I'm not sure. I mean, the issue here is, the percentage of travelers that these countries send to the U.S. who then stay past what they're supposed to, which is one of the contributors to illegal immigration in this country. I don't know why San Marino appears to be one of those countries.</p><p>QUEST: We know countries, for example, Poland, for example, it is not in visa waiver. Because it's not had the 2 percent, or it has breached -- consistently breached the 2 percent limit. So, the U.S. is saying, as I understand it, have a campaign or we'll take your visa waiver.</p><p>KOPAN: Right. This is a little bit vague, exactly, what they're asking these countries to do. But it's a combination of increasing the vetting of people coming through their borders, and then in this particular instance, doing some sort of public awareness to their citizens that they cannot overstay their visa once they get here. And yes, there are also are some vague threats involved. But it's not clear exactly what the consequences are going to be. This seems to be another effort by the Trump administration to get into this so-called extreme vetting, where they also sort of conceal exactly what they want that to look like.</p><p>And yet, Tal, we see numbers from U.S. travel. The number of tourists are down. I mean, you know -- there is a view that some say I'd rather not go to the United States. Who wants to be insulted at the border? Who wants to have extreme vetting? Who wants an embassy appointment? It's not worth it. There's plenty of places l the rest of the world to visit.</p><p>KOPAN: That is absolutely something that critics of the Trump administration are pointing to right now. Student visa numbers have also lagged. You know, there as a sense that the Trump administration is making America look unwelcoming. And keep in mind, there's major industries in the U.S. that rely on travel and foreign travelers are a big contributor of that. And so, when you see those numbers starting to down, universities are scared about their enrollment, the hospitality industry, some of these major cities that really enjoy some of those high tourism numbers. This is something that could have widespread implications for American businesses. But it's unclear if the Trump administration sees this as an unfortunate consequence or actually by design for some of the policies they're putting into place.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>KOPAN: Thanks.</p><p>As we continue tonight on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, come to Europe then. If you don't want to go to the U.S., Europe, land of the free internet. Home of the open wave. One member of the European parliament pitching her content as the U.S. rolls back on internet neutrality. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, live from New York.</p><p>[16:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I've Richard Quest. More QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. When bitcoin hits a new all-time high as it prepares for another market milestone for this weekend. And Disney can afford to buy about 2,000 more bitcoins after a stellar opening for the new \"Star Wars.\" As we continue, this is CNN, and on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>The North Korean Ambassador to the United Nations says the U.S. is terrified of his countries, quote, incredible might. He spoke at a lengthy security council meeting on Pyongyang's nuclear program and said North Korea doesn't pose a threat to any state, as long as its interests aren't infringed upon.</p><p>Palestinian officials say four people were killed in Friday's protests over the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Hundreds are also hurt. There were clashes in the West Bank, Gaza, and the Jerusalem suburbs behind the separation barrier.</p><p>Dutch police say they are not currently treating an incident at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport at terrorism. Officers shot a man in the leg after they say he entered the airport's police office and threatened someone with a knife. The airport was briefly evacuated but is now back to normal.</p><p>President Trump has praised police and FBI agents at a speech he gave at the FBI National Academy on Friday. He struck a different tone only moments earlier on his way to the speech. He called congruent to the FBI disgraceful and vowed to rebuild the federal agency.</p><p>It is official. We have a date. Kensington Palace say Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry May 19th of next year. The ceremony will be at St. George's chapel in Windsor. The pair announced their engagement last month. Harry said he knew Markle was the one from the first time they met.</p><p>So, another day, another record for bitcoin. A record on Friday. Over the course of a very busy week, it's traded between 13,000 and nearly 18,000. Futures began trading on the CBOE on Sunday. They launch on the CME this weekend. Bitcoin suffered setbacks to multiple exchanges suffered outages, and that enraged investors. Janet Yellen's called cryptocurrency highly speculative. The current price of bitcoins, as you can see in the trading post, 17,432. A gain of a -- a mere gain of 5.5 percent, up $901. Joining me, Michael Casey, is the chairman of the CoinDesk advisory board. Good to see you, sir.</p><p>MICHAEL CASEY, CHAIRMAN, COINDESK ADVISORY BOARD: Thank you. Nice to meet you.</p><p>QUEST: When you're backwards and forwards on whether bitcoin is speculative, bubble or not, it doesn't really take us anywhere. Other than to ask, what purpose does bitcoin serve at these elevated prices?</p><p>CASEY: Well, I mean, I think if we think of it purely as a currency, a normal medium of exchange, it's hard to see it functioning very well at that level right now. People are truly hoarding it or hoddling it, as the bitcoin enthusiasts like to call. And that doesn't really make for a currency exchange. But it certainly plays a role as a mechanism for establishing a store value.</p><p>[16:35:00] But just as importantly, I think, and it's hard to actually quantity this, is just the buzz around things. Right. And that buzz itself --</p><p>QUEST: Why is that important? That buzz? Because if it's something that is speculative, where people believe that there is a fall about to happen, simply on -- look, I'm not being prejudiced against bitcoin.</p><p>CASEY: Sure.</p><p>QUEST: But on history --</p><p>CASEY: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: It tell us anything that rises this fast, falls quickly, too.</p><p>CASEY: I would not be surprised if we get a big correction from these levels. I think that's absolutely fair. If we look through history, bubbles have played this role of forming capital. With the classic is the dot-com bubble, of course, which collapsed and then led us to this infrastructure that led us to Google and Facebook and everything else.</p><p>Those of us who believe that the underlying technology of bitcoin, the decentralized architects that allows us to resolve the problem of trust and have peer-to-peer exchanges and an internet of value, think this is the building of that base. And the reach why the buzz matters is because it gets people talking about it. It gets people thinking, how could the world be different? What sort of decentralized applications could we think about? So there's immeasurable number of conversations going on around the world right now. We don't know where this is going to go. But the buzz is actually important.</p><p>QUEST: The buzz it is important, so you see, but widows and orphans, ordinary investors, they require architecture of regulation to ensure safety. I understand and before every bitcoiner out there flames me. I understand you all love the fact that it's no regulation, there's nobody watching over, you can do what you like with it. But ordinary people do require an element of security.</p><p>CASEY: Absolutely. And I think that this -- we need to grow up.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, thank you.</p><p>CASEY: I've been saying this for some time. I mean, bitcoin, the whole to the moon idea, it's not a really sophisticated way to go good investing. We need two-way flow. We need self-governing institutions. We need journalists who start probe these things. We need, you know -- we need some form of regulation. And we need some mechanism to keep this under control. I think ultimately that will come. I mean, this is very early days. There are people who are building out professional investments institutions and vehicles. We're going to get to a point. But in the meantime, yes, we might see some widows and orphans --</p><p>QUEST: Just gone up.</p><p>CASEY: -- suffer. Oh, there it goes.</p><p>QUEST: You're talking about nuts. Finally, one question. Look, assuming I bought a bitcoin, and I bought it at, say, 1,000, and it's now worth 17,000, and I want to spend it, and I'm buying something from you, but -- what I'm buying from you is only $1,000. How -- how do you pay change? What do you do?</p><p>CASEY: Yes. So, the bitcoin protocol, if you're talking about how it actually --</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>CASEY: It has a mechanism for change. Basically, it then sends an amount back to the same address. And so, if you're talking specifically about the functionality of that, that's why if you look at bitcoin entries on the block chain, it actually has two of them. One is the change. And that's the way it works, yes.</p><p>QUEST: And there is nobody regulating it?</p><p>CASEY: No, it regulates itself. That's the pure beauty of it. Right. It actually doesn't need a regulator. Because it's run through this decentralized system. That's actually what matters.</p><p>QUEST: I need to rethink what I think about all of this. Thank you for coming in, sir.</p><p>CASEY: You're most welcome.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you.</p><p>Now, a top U.S. Senator is mocking the backlash to Thursday's vote to roll back net neutrality. Ted Cruz is calling activists snowflakes who are believing online propaganda. The co-founder of Reddit, Alexis Ohanian, told CNN, the repeal of the regulation makes internet like cable TV.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEXIS OHANIAN, COFOUNDER, REDDIT: What repealing this does is effectively giving service providers the ability to turn our internet into something that looks like our cable bill. Where you might one day want to visit your favorite website, and find out that actually, it's not part of your internet package, and for some additional amount of money, now you can get access.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: One member of Europe's Parliament says tech companies should come to Europe if the U.S. is going to crack down. Marietje Schaake, says Europe's rules can help companies to compete. She joins me now from Brussels. I see what you're saying. But you say this with a straight face, since many, many tech companies believe Europe to be a chilly and unfriendly regulatory environment for them.</p><p>MARIETJE SCHAAKE, DUTCH MEMBER OF EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Well, I disagree, of course. And certainly, when it comes to net neutrality safeguards, we have secured those in Europe. And think that it will prove to be very important for innovation and for startups to have a chance to compete with the very, very large, almost monopolistic players in the U.S.</p><p>QUEST: So, Europe has gone against google and antitrust it's got the right to be forgotten. It has taken Apple over taxation. Facebook, as well, on taxes. I understand, you know, Europe sees this as a legitimacy in each of these actions. But from their -- from the industry's point of view, they don't see it as a favorable -- or at least a laissez faire environment like the United States now.</p><p>[16:40:05] SCHAAKE: Well, that may be the case. But I think you also see in the United States in the whole discussion about the impact that social media platforms and big-tech companies have on democracy, the filter bubbles that people find themselves in. The so-called fake news discussion. That actually people are concerned about the major role of these tech companies. And if we don't want the huge technology companies and the huge internet providers to cut deals with each other for faster access to their content at the expense of public websites or smaller competitors, then net neutrality is key.</p><p>QUEST: What if president Trump and the FCC administration are right? And that actually, by getting rid of net neutrality, as they believe, rules that are somewhat anti-competitive in that sense, but allow everybody to compete against each other. That there will be greater innovation and that you don't actually need all this net neutrality nonsense, as they would put it.</p><p>SCHAAKE: Well, I think it's an illusion to think that fair competition regulates itself. There is always rules of the road, and net neutrality safeguards fair competition in the digital economy. If they prove to be right, of course, I'm happy to be convinced. But at the moment, I'm really not sure. And I'm not alone. There were 22 million Americans that submitted their comments on an online application to the FCC. And 98 percent of them were in favor of keeping net neutrality. The founders of the internet spoke in favor of net neutrality. I know a number of startups and consumer rights organizations did. And I really wonder why they would if they think that competition would benefit all of them.</p><p>QUEST: Right. But of those 28 million, you will be aware that a large number have since been proven to be from dead people, or from others. And it's highly questionable exactly how many of those were legitimate. But your point is taken. Your point is well taken, that there were -- that there are a large number of traditionalists who are against the continuation of net neutrality. Finally, Europe --</p><p>SCHAAKE: I wouldn't consider myself a traditionalist, to be frank. I consider myself to be a modern-day regulator. And I don't think it's traditional to be in favor of net neutrality.</p><p>QUEST: On the question of completing the digital single market in Europe, which, of course, is still some way off, and might be delayed in a post Brexit world, how much of a priority is that?</p><p>SCHAAKE: It's a top priority. And it will continue, even as we're dealing with the unfortunate Brexit negotiations that are ongoing. But I think the U.K. will find that it's actually quite helpful to be part of one regulatory space of 500 million consumers. And that when it comes to the global internet, even the EU is small. And so, for us to have predictable and level playing field rules is actually a benefit for both large and smaller companies.</p><p>QUEST: Marietje Schaake, thank you for staying up late and working late tonight to talk to us. We appreciate it.</p><p>Saudi Arabia is continuing to look forward as a part program and a new program of its vision 2030. The idea, of course, move the economy away from oil.</p><p>[16:45:03] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Saudi Arabia has revealed a new $19 billion program to boost housing and small business. It's part of the country's vision 2030 plan to pull the economy away from oil. I'm joined by Ali Shihabi, the executive director of the Arabia Foundation, who is with me. Good to see you, sir. Thank you. $19 billion should go some way. But why is it necessary?</p><p>ALI SHIHABI, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ARABIA FOUNDATION: Well, it's necessary, because the country has been going though effectively economic and political shock therapy for the last 12 months. There is so much change happening. And you know when you have change, necessary change, critical change, but change, nonetheless, investors get nervous and cautious. So, the economy has got into a bit of a stand still. And I think you need this to -- it's a bit of testosterone if you want to shake it up.</p><p>QUEST: Testosterone it is true. But really what we're all focused on at the moment are the hundreds of people who are still locked up at the Ritz- Carlton hotel, particularly Prince Al-Waleed. What's happening with them? That's what everybody wants to know. And information is few and far between about the discouraging of allegedly corrupt profits. Who is being released, who is not. It is not a transparent procedure at the moment.</p><p>SHIHABI: No, it's not. And there is a fundamental logic and reason to that. Because under Sharia law, naming and shaming actually is part of the punishment that you would get, and that would only come after a judgment by court. So effectively, you have to maintain -- until people go to court, you have to maintain their anonymity. And until they are convicted, you have to maintain their anonymity. Now, understandably, a few names have been leaked. But those are sort of high-profile names and they were leaked for a reason. To send a political message, if you want, that nobody is immune. But beyond that, everybody else has the right -- that right to anonymity.</p><p>QUEST: I fundamentally understand what you're saying about this. However, as this stimulus package, and the 2030, and the new city that's being built, as all these policies, they are designed to show a modern Saudi Arabia that's playing in the international capital markets. And investors require transparency of procedure. For want of a better word, the rule of law.</p><p>SHIHABI: Well, yes. But you are going through surgery now. You see? In a way, you're in triage. Saudi Arabia is like a patient that's been taken into the emergency room that's in triage. Triage is very messy. There is blood all over the place. It has to happen. It has to be done with. Now once it's done with, and you've seen that in countries that have gone through different types of shock, a few months and the hedge funds come in. And then a few months after that, more normal investors come in. So, people really get over these things quite quickly. But you are through a period of pain that you have to undertake. You see? So, there is a price associated with that.</p><p>QUEST: Right. There is no question. I was in Riyadh last month. There is no question that the changes being introduced, and the anti-corruption drive, is exceptionally popular. No question about it. As indeed the idea of opening cinemas, allowing women to drive, as of next year. Does the Crown Prince have to be careful that he's not moving too far too fast?</p><p>SHIHABI: Well, that's always a question of judgment. And a bit of luck. You know? The problem is that Saudi Arabia has always gone too slow, too little and too slow. The country for the last 30 years as hardly moving at all. So, I think a lot of that speed or so is a reflection of the fact that there was such an accumulated list of issues that had to be addressed. That addressing them by definition means that all these things come at the same time.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir. Thank you. Next time, in Riyadh, we'll go to the cinema together.</p><p>SHIHABI: Look forward.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>Talking of the cinema, the force remains strong for \"Star Wars,\" after \"The Last Jedi\" storms into the box office. Makes millions. We need to know, is this going to be a record opening? Frank Pallotta will be with us after the break. It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>[16:50:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: And that reporter is here now. Having braved the cold.</p><p>FRANK PALLOTTA, CNNMONEY MEDIA REPORTER: It was the Hoth system out there. I was freezing. It was so cold. The Hoth system is an ice planet in \"Empire Strikes Back.\" We'll get into it some other time.</p><p>QUEST: Is it going to be a record?</p><p>PALLOTTA: It's going to come close. So, some new numbers just came in. Disney is now projecting that it could bring in around mid-90s -- mid 100 - - mid $90 million. It will be close to $100 million for its opening day. To put that in perspective, \"The Force Awakens\" brought in around $120 million for its opening day. And last night for its opening night, it brought in $45 million, which was only second to \"force awakens\".</p><p>Is that because there was a lot more hoopla over it, and there's only a few years between \"force awakens\" and this one?</p><p>Look at it this way, the last time we saw Han Solo, Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, 32-1/2-year wait. And then after the prequels it was a decade- long wait. This is only been a two-year-long wait. And we had a \"Star Wars\" movie \"The Rogue One\" spinoff last year. So, we are back in the \"Star Wars\" galaxy compared to two years ago when we were just thrown right back into this wonderful world in a galaxy far, far away.</p><p>QUEST: Is it good?</p><p>PALLOTTA: It's good. I saw it Monday. I saw it with a bunch of other people at AMC Lincoln Square, the theatre I was standing outside of, and people were cheering. People got a little emotional. There was even a moment where it was just pure silence. You could hear people gasping. It's good. People like it. There has been a little blow back online from some of fans who were saying it's too different. It's hard to please \"Star Wars\" fans. They were saying \"Force Awakens\" is too much like the original. Now they're saying \"The Last Jedi\" is nothing like the original. You can't please some people.</p><p>QUEST: How much did across to make? Do we have a number yet?</p><p>PALLOTTA: We don't have -- Disney keeps the numbers very close to the vest. But it's in the hundreds of millions -- it's in the hundreds of millions of dollars. This is their major franchise. This is what they're really banking on. You saw that huge deal yesterday. This is what it's for. Things like this. There is movies and then there's cinematic events like \"Star Wars.\" Disney hooks up with Fox to bring in more, so they can make Marvel bigger. So, that they can make \"Avatar\" the biggest movie of all-time bigger. This is where we're going. It's no longer just going to be movies. It's going to be like going to a concert. You can watch a movie at home, but you can't experience it like the opening weekend of \"Star Wars.\" If you want to put it on, Richard, you look good in it. Do you want me to do it? Sure. You can even talk like this. Woo!</p><p>[16:55:00] QUEST: Ooh, keep it on and tell the dear viewer that there is a Profitable Moment -- I'll do it. Give it here.</p><p>PALLOTTA: There you go.</p><p>QUEST: There's a Profitable Moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment. A very profitable moment, if you look at the way the markets have risen today. Three records on the Dow, the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500. And the S&amp;P on record, or at least on track, for having a record every month of the year, which in itself would be an all- time record. Put this together, and you're seeing markets -- it's difficult to understate or to really put into context what's happening. Because at the same time as you have huge political machinations in Washington, a tax bill, will it or won't it.</p><p>Peter Tuchman tonight summed it up. It's real money going into the real market and making real profits. And that needs to be borne in mind. This is not bitcoin that we are seeing. Oh, to be sure, a correction may be on the way. We haven't had one for many years. But that doesn't mean to say that the gains that we're seeing at the moment are illusory. They are not.

This afternoon, the Fed is scheduled to release comments from its first policy meeting under its new flexible inflation target policy. While market participants aren\u2019t expecting the Fed to do anything with rates, many may be curious whether the central bank will offer more comments about the policy.     In economic news this morning, retail sales came in weaker than expected, rising by 0.6% in August when a Briefing.com consensus had expected a 1% rise. The prior reading was also revised lower, to 0.9% from 1.2%.    The lackluster August numbers represent the first month after the extra $600 per week in federal unemployment benefits came to an end and as Congress hasn\u2019t worked out a new coronavirus aid package that would provide more stimulus money for Americans.    Turning to corporate news, FedEx Corp. (FDX) hit a home run in its earnings release after the market closed yesterday. The company saw increased revenue per package, and average daily package volume for FedEx Ground rose more than 30%. Earnings per share far exceeded analyst expectations, and revenue also beat forecasts. The company\u2019s shares were up around 9% this morning.    Meanwhile, Boeing\u2019s (BA) shares were pointing lower this morning following a scathing Congressional report about its beleaguered MAX jets that cited serious issues with the plane's design and construction, as well as certification lapses at the Federal Aviation Authority.   Tech-Related Stocks Resume Leadership   Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) finished just slightly in positive territory on Tuesday, the other two made better headway. The tech heavy Nasdaq Composite (COMP) gained the most ground as tech-related companies continued to get their mojo back.    The tech-led gains on Tuesday came despite mega-cap Apple  AAPL  (AAPL) paring its gains to end just slightly higher after its product event. AAPL shares had risen markedly in the previous session and were also up decently for a good bit of Tuesday\u2019s trading. But after seeing the new products investors apparently thought enough had gotten baked into the cake\u2014or the apple pie\u2013and they were content to let the stock end near flat.    The other FAANG names\u2014Facebook (FB), Amazon  AMZN  (AMZN), Netflix  NFLX  (NFLX) and GoogleGOOGL  parent Alphabet (GOOGL)\u2014gained much more strongly than AAPL on Tuesday. For reference, the NYSE FANG+ Index climbed 2.5% on the day. This could be a reflection that, though big-tech shares have had a tremendous run off the March lows, last week's steep drop may be seen as too-much-too-quickly.    While it\u2019s good to see investors returning to these names that helped lead the market rally before getting hammered, the market would be stronger if there were broader sector participation. Yesterday, for example, several sectors\u2014Staples, Health Care  SBRA  , Industrials, Materials, and Energy\u2014were flat or lower. And Financials had a particularly rough day (see more below).     Still, it\u2019s possible that if the FAANGs really gain some momentum, that could translate into more solid participation from other segments of the market.   Despite Optimism About the Fed, Financials Stumble   It seems that optimism about the Federal Reserve, which started its two-day policy setting meeting yesterday and is scheduled to wrap it up later today, helped keep sentiment generally positive. Investors are apparently optimistic that the central bank will continue its ultra-accommodative stance while also being willing to let the economy run hot at times.    While those inflation expectations have helped cheer investors, it should be noted that we have to get there first. The economy has a ways to go before inflation could be considered hot, much less problematic to a degree that turns the Fed toward a hawkish stance.    The gains for the market on Tuesday came despite headwinds for the Financials sector, which was the worst performing of the 11 SPX  SPXC  sectors on concerns about net interest income. While that is a factor facing the broad banking industry, Citigroup  C  (C) has also stumbled on some company specific news after the Wall Street Journal reported that federal regulators are preparing to reprimand the bank over its risk systems.         Headwinds For Banks: As the end of the quarter approaches and banks continue to face headwinds, the declines we\u2019ve seen in the Financials sector could be reflective of a bit of caution ahead of earnings. Of course, the regulatory news about C wasn\u2019t good, but at least it has been confined to one company. A bigger issue facing banks seems to be the net interest income issue amid weak loan demand and low interest rates. Banks got some reprieve as the yield curve steepened after the Fed announced its inflation averaging policy. Still, rates overall remain low and there doesn\u2019t seem to be as much demand out there for loans. Citigroup said lower consumer borrowing will dent its third quarter revenue, and PNC Financial Services Group\u2019s  PNC  (PNC) CEO said slower business activity is a headwind for lending, according to Reuters. Banks have also been socking away money to help cover potentially bad loans, also eating into profitability.     Industrial Production Growth Wanes: When people have less money to spend, they buy fewer things and factories end up making fewer widgets. That fundamental economic truism seems to be in play as the pandemic drags on and continues to leave people out of work even as government stimulus money dries up. Main Street has been feeling the pinch more than Wall Street, which as a whole has benefited from the Fed\u2019s largess and expectations of more. On Tuesday, data showed that industrial production in August grew less than expected. The latest print came in a 0.4% monthly growth when 1% had been expected in a Briefing.com consensus. Although it\u2019s still nice to see growth, and it was good news that the prior month\u2019s figure was revised to 3.5% from 3%, it\u2019s still clear that growth is slowing.    What Could Re-accelerate Manufacturing Growth? Although September manufacturing data from the Empire State on Tuesday came in much better than expected, it seems like the view from the national factory floor has been dimming. What might flip the switch and rev manufacturing growth back up? A coronavirus vaccine would probably go a long way toward making people feel more comfortable going out, giving the economy a shot in the arm and helping boost spending on stuff made in factories. But short of that, it seems like industrial production growth might not ramp back up without another round of government stimulus for Main street. But even stimulus could have limited effects on real manufacturing growth. Direct payments and other forms of Main street stimulus can help the numbers look good in the short term, but unless there's a path to long-term growth (and a path to eradication of the virus), once the money is spent, we could be right back where we are today.

The SNL U.S. Insurance Index slipped 0.15% to 1,080.23.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The declines started after both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq closed at their highest levels ever and the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished above 29,000 on Sept. 2. A day later, technology companies led the way in a two-day sell-off that sent all three indices sharply lower.</p><p>OANDA analyst Ed Moya said the tech sell-off ensued after China announced new policies to help develop its semiconductor industry. The move was a response to the U.S. banning some Chinese tech companies and restricting others' from buying U.S.-made parts. Moya said tech's \"high flyers\" also had concerns over a \"blue wave\" in the upcoming presidential election that may lead to a tougher regulatory and corporate tax environment.</p><p>\"You could choose your reason for why to abandon the tech trade, but it just seemed that it just kind of snowballed, and that's why we're kind of where we are right now,\" Moya said in an interview.</p><p>Despite what he called a \"tremendous amount of rotation out of big tech,\" Moya does not expect to see a repeat of what happened in 2000 when the \"dot com\" bubble burst.</p><p>\"Tech is still handsomely up for the year,\" Moya said. \"Once this settles, you're still going to see investors want to remain fairly positioned with tech, as that is going to be one of the bright spots of the economy going forward.\"</p><p>One of the few bright spots among insurers was Genworth Financial Inc., which rocketed up 45.99% for the week. The rise was fueled by positive news about its long-awaited merger with China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co. Ltd., which announced that it had secured financing for the planned $2.7 billion deal.</p><p>Both sides on June 30 agreed to extend the deadline for completion of the merger to Sept. 30, the 15th such extension since the deal was announced in October 2016. Genworth had the right to terminate the agreement had Oceanwide not provided a financing plan by Aug. 31.</p><p>Genworth President and CEO Tom McInerney said Oceanwide meeting the deadline was important in light of his company's \"ongoing review process,\" and it provided an important update for Genworth's shareholders, \"particularly in light of the market disruptions driven by the global pandemic.\"</p><p>Moody's analyst Bob Garofalo in an email said the funding disclosure was \"credit positive for Genworth\" as it removes uncertainty over aspects of the deal and makes it more likely that it will ultimately close.</p><p>Elsewhere in the life space, Voya Financial Inc.'s agreement to sell its individual life and other legacy non-retirement annuities businesses to Resolution Life Group Holdings LP is being held up, but is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Originally slated to close Sept. 30, the deal was delayed to accommodate the completion of the remaining regulatory reviews of the transaction.</p><p>Voya Financial dipped 2.98% in what was a mixed week in the life sector. Great-West Lifeco Inc. dropped 5.30%, Manulife Financial Corp. lost 3.88% and Athene Holding Ltd. ticked down 0.24%. Lincoln National Corp., however, added 2.22%.</p><p>The final act of a merger that was never completed played out in a Delaware courtroom this week when a judge rejected efforts by Anthem Inc. and Cigna Corp. to collect billions of dollars in damages from each other over their failed union.</p><p>Anthem was to have acquired Cigna in the $54.2 billion agreement announced in July 2015, but the merger was blocked in February 2017 over antitrust concerns.</p><p>Cigna wanted Anthem to pay around $15 billion for damages and termination fees, while Anthem demanded $21 billion, alleging Cigna had \"breached its obligations in the deal. Calling the battle a \"corporate soap opera,\" Chancery Court Judge Travis Laster in his opinion said both sides \"played themselves\" and that \"each party must bear the losses it suffered as a result of their star-crossed venture.\"</p><p>Cigna ended the week down 1.40%, while Anthem dipped 0.38%.</p><p>There was little movement among some major P&amp;C names as Progressive Corp. edged down 0.79%, W. R. Berkley Corp. inched lower by 0.10% and Allstate Corp. ended down 0.52%.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLINS-60193039</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLINS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T0-Y471-JDVW-N061-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360261</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"725\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Insurance Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 7, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0008ZA4</classCode><className>GENWORTH FINANCIAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0009DI4</classCode><className>CHINA OCEANWIDE HOLDINGS GROUP CO LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS524210 INSURANCE AGENCIES &amp;

Getty Images  Getty Images   U.S. stock indexes finished lower for a third day on Tuesday, slumping to a four week low, led by technology stocks which had driven the five month rally, as the Nasdaq Composite booked its quickest plunge ever from a record close to correction territory.  While investors worried about valuations at their highest levels in more than a decade, remarks by President Donald Trump on Monday, threatening to 'decouple'[1] the U.S. economy from China added to market jitters, analysts said.How did major indexes fare?</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.24%[2] dropped 632.42 points, or 2.3%, to finish at 27,500.89, while the S&amp;#38;P 500 SPX, -2.77%[3] gave up 95.12 points, or 2.8%, to end at 3,331.84 The Nasdaq Composite COMP, -4.11%[4] skid 465.44 points, or 4.1%, to close in correction territory at 10,847.69, after plunging 10% in the three sessions from its 12,056.44 record close on Sept. 2. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.3% last week to end Friday at 11,313.13, its biggest weekly decline since March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.8% last week, ending at 28,133.31, while the S&amp;#38;P 500dropped 2.3% to 3,426.96 \u2014 the biggest weekly falls for those indexes since June. To qualify for correction territory, shares must end at least 10% lower from their prior closing high, which the Nasdaq accomplished on Tuesday after only three trading sessions, its quickest correction on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data. What drove the market?High valuations especially for technology companies, a sluggish economic recovery in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, geopolitical risks including U.S. - China tensions, and the upcoming November elections all pose risks for investors, though the Nasdaq bore the brunt Tuesday, slumping 10% in three days, to register its fastest correction ever.  Read:Tech-stock rout stirs memories of 1999-2000, but here's what's different[5] The reversal for the Nasdaq, which had previously soared to a series of all-time highs, was led by falls for its highest-flying components, including Apple Inc. AAPL, -6.72%[6], Facebook Inc. FB, -4.09%[7], Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -5.41%[8] and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -4.39%[9] and Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -3.68%[10] GOOGL, -3.64%[11] as worries grew that the momentum-led gains for the sector had finally pushed valuations too far to be sustained.  One thing to watch will be if major U.S. equity indexes can manage to rally without the tech giants, given their bulkier footprint in a stay-at-home, pandemic world, said Clifton Hill, a portfolio manager for Acadian Asset Management's multi-asset class strategies group, in an interview with MarketWatch. Hill also said he'll be watching to see whether money fleeing tech stocks rotates into 'value equities and others that had not done as well,' while also monitoring developments on the 'Nasdaq whale' front, after the Financial Times [12]unmasked SoftBank on Friday as having amassed billions worth of equity derivatives in recent months that helped fuel the sharp ascent for big tech stocks.  See:The Nasdaq just marked the fastest 10% plunge in history-again[13] Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that the Senate plans to vote on pared-down[14] Republican coronavirus relief package this week, but looks unlikely to pass into law as Democrats fight for more aid. Remarks by Trump in a Labor Day news conference also left stocks under pressure, analysts said. 'We will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we'll end reliance on China once and for all, whether it's decoupling or putting in massive tariffs like I've been doing already. We're going to end our reliance on China, because we can't rely on China,' Trump said[15]. 'Decoupling implies that only domestic companies can serve domestic customers,' Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note Tuesday. But his team also outlined several reasons why the post-COVID-19 world already was poised 'to be less global and more digital' anyway, as production is brought closer to home and driven to adopt more technology and automation in the process. Meanwhile, China on Tuesday said it would launch an initiative of its own to set global standards on data security[16], a move seen as an attempt to counter U.S. efforts to isolate their networks from Chinese technology.  In coronavirus pandemic news, a group of nine drug company chief executives said that they have signed a pledge[17] to make the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals the priority in developing the first COVID-19 vaccine. Related: There are seven coronavirus vaccine candidates being tested in the U.S. \u2014 here's where they stand[18] Fresh data also showed U.S. consumer borrowing rose again [19]in July, for the second month in a row, after households tightened their belts in March and socked away more savings at the onset of the pandemic in the U.S., according to Federal Reserve data. Which companies were in focus? Airliner shares were a bright spot amid a sea of red Tuesday, after data showed an uptick in Labor Day travel[20], giving a boost to shares of JetBlue Airways Corp  JBLU, +2.55%[21], Southwest Airlines Corp LUV, +2.81%[22], Alaska Air Group Inc ALK, +1.91%[23], American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, +0.14%[24] and Delta Air Lines IncDAL, +2.42%[25] Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, -21.06%[26] fell 21.1%, a record one-day decline[27], after a rebalancing of the S&amp;#38;P 500 by S&amp;#38;P Dow Jones Indices on Friday unexpectedly left the electric-vehicle maker out[28] of the U.S. stock-market benchmark. The rebalancing saw Catalent Inc. CTLT, -1.04%[29], Etsy Inc.ETSY, -1.32%[30] and Teradyne Inc. TER, -3.90%[31] added to the index. Shares of Nikola Corp. NKLA, +40.78%[32] soared 40.8% after the alternative-fuel vehicle maker and General Motors Co. announced they had entered a strategic partnership[33] that would start with the Nikola Badger, the company's planned fully-electric and hydrogen-fuel cell electric pickup truck, and include cost reductions for other models. GM shares rose 7.9%. Shares of Boeing Co. BA, -5.82%[34] fell 5.8% after the Wall Street Journal reported[35] that production problems at a 787 Dreamliner factory prompted air-safety regulators to review quality-control lapses that could stretch back almost a decade. Peloton Interactive Inc. shares PTON, +6.16%[36] advanced 6.2% after the company said it had lowered the price of its original exercise bike Monday while introducing a premium option and rolling out a new lower-priced treadmill[37]. Roku Inc.ROKU, +1.70%[38] shares rose 1.7% after Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall began coverage of the stock with an overweight rating, an $215 price [39]target and called the company an 'advertising heavyweight in the making.'  Chip-equipment stocks Applied Materials Inc. AMAT, -8.74%[40], KLA Corp. KLAC, -9.77%[41] and Lam Research Corp. LRCX, -9.12%[42] each fell more than 8%[43] Tuesday amid reports that the U.S. is considering putting export restrictions on Chinese chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.JPMorgan Chase &amp;#38; Co. JPM, -3.47%[44] shares fell 3.5%, after the banks said it found evidence[45] of employees and customers misusing the government's flood of stimulus funds this spring and is cooperating with authorities.  How did other markets trade?The yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.678%[46] TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.678%[47] fell 3.8 basis points to 0.682% as investors prepared for a heavy week of supply[48]. Bond prices move inversely to yields.  The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.86%[49], which tracks the performance of the greenback against its major rivals, was up 0.8%.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, -1.14%[55] closed 1.2% lower, losing steam as U.S. equities fell[56], while the U.K.'s benchmark FTSE UKX, -0.77%[57] shed 0.1%.

And if you look over the  course of the year, it's now positive for the year so far.</p><p>Join me at the superscreens and you will see exactly what we are talking  about.  This is how the market just closed; it's a gain of 234 points.  But  bobbing around 18,000 ,just shows you in the last few seconds of trade,  it's just gone back down again, it might just recalibrate to 18,000.</p><p>But if you look at what happened, it was the energy stocks that did the  trick.  They rallied alongside oil prices.  U.S. government bond prices are  also falling.  So let's start with the Dow Jones.  Bring in Paul La Monica  to join me and to put some perspective --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST:  Now here is the Dow. </p><p>What was the influence here?  We are just about 18,000.  That's a very  strong gain of some 1.3 percent. </p><p>What was the influence?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNNMONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT:  You mentioned energy, but  it was also banks and tech stocks that really did well, Goldman Sachs and  JPMorgan Chase, big winners today.  I think everyone's hoping that a Fed  rate hike is going to be good for banks.  But then with techs, they've just  been beaten up in a couple -- for the past couple of days.</p><p>QUEST:  Right.  But this idea that -- well, let's look at year-to-date, or  six month-to-date.  There you -- that starts to put -- but look at this.   We have this big dip in June.  Now that's the fear of rates.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Exactly.</p><p>QUEST:  But now rates still likely to go up this year with the market's  back.</p><p>So why?</p><p>LA MONICA:  I think that we're maybe finally getting accustomed to the rate  hike is going to be in September.  You had that strong jobs report and that  really is cementing in a lot of people's minds that a rate hike is finally  coming.  I think a lot of this fits and starts that we've had, the angst  has been about, oh, is it going to be June?  No, it's not going to be June.   Is it going to be September?  No, it's not going to be September.  Maybe  it's 2016.  It was the uncertainty about the timing of the rate hike.  So  now it's more certain.</p><p>QUEST:  Right.  So the acceptance that it's going to happen is basically  let's live with it and let's deal with it.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Definitely.  And you can't ignore overseas as well.  What's  going on in Europe is definitely leading bond prices down and yields up  here as well, German bond yield finally back above 1 percent.  You have the  hopes that Greece may get saved after all if Germany's going to compromise.</p><p>QUEST:  The Nasdaq:  here's the Nasdaq today, similar story.  It went up;  it made its gains and it stayed there throughout the session.</p><p>What was the driving force?</p><p>LA MONICA:  You have enthusiasm again about big tech.  Apple was a winner.   Microsoft, Intel, IBM; Netflix is a huge winner, top gainer in the S&amp;P 500  today.  Stock has more than doubled this year.  People just love that  company.  Probably overvalued but right now momentum investors don't --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST:  -- same again with you here.  You have -- this click, this fall  down here was very sharp and very pronounced.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, again, the rate hike fears but also valuations.  That's  definitely something that is a big problem with tech stocks, more so than  the broader market, a lot of people worried about the Netflixes and the  Facebooks of the world, are they overvalued?</p><p>QUEST:  OK.  So putting all this together for me as we draw the strands of  the market, what do you make of it?</p><p>LA MONICA:  I think that right now we're probably just going to have more  volatility unfortunately.  We think the rate hike is coming in September.   But this is a data-dependent fad, a data-dependent market.  It's trite and  clich,, but until we know for certain that that rate hike is coming, just  more volatility.</p><p>QUEST:  More volatility --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST:  -- many thanks for that.</p><p>Here we have the way the market has traded.  And it's not often that you  see this sort of day.  I showed you what was happening.  We started the day  when it was just barely -- well, when we started the program, it was over - - then we went back.  But we have held 18,000 on the Dow Jones.</p><p>What were the issues that helped make the day move forward?  I promise you  one thing:  it's a case with \"Business on the Move.\"</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p>[16:05:10]  QUEST (voice-over):  Welcome to the new \"Business on the Move,\"  where we see Netflix stock soared to record highs, up 3.7 percent.

It's a case of what  you're seeing is \"Business on the Move.\"  And as we continue...</p><p>As we continue after the break  from \"Business on the Move\" to chief  executives on the move, this is Sir Tim Clark of Emirates.  He will be  joining me in the C suite to talk about what his speech to the Wings Club.</p><p>Come and join me, sir.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST:  We're back, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  The chief executive of Emirates  is warning that if the U.S. scraps its \"open skies\" agreements, foreign  airlines may have trouble flying into the UAE.</p><p>Sir Tim Clark says if \"open skies\" is scrapped, there could be new anti- trust concerns at play for all the U.S. carriers.  At this week's IATA AGM,  the international -- the airline association, the chief executive of  American Airlines, Doug Parker, told me it's his responsibility as an  airline CEO to bring this issue to bear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOUG PARKER, CEO, AMERICAN AIRLINES:  You know, this is an issue that we  believe has the potential to have a profound impact on our airlines, on the  U.S. commercial aviation business and on the people we employ.  And we are  obligated to go fight for all those things.</p><p>And in this case, some may have other views, we felt very strongly that  indeed you know, what we're doing is right and that what -- and that these  fights and the potential for flights that fly to the United States from  other parts of the world will be subsidized by governments, is going to  have a big impact on the U.S. airline industry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Sir Tim Clark, the president and CEO of Emirates, joins me here in  the C suite.</p><p>You didn't launch yourself out of the chair when you heard.  This is your  speech that you have to the Wings Club here in New York today.</p><p>You called the U.S. claim \"stuff and nonsense,\" an extremely dodgy 55-page  dossier, which indeed this is it.  And you go on to warn that basically we  could see the rise of a new international aviation model which would be out  with the old guard, in with the vanguard.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>[16:10:03]  SIR TIM CLARK, CEO, EMIRATES:  Well, I think as a result of  everything that's been going on over the last couple of months, three  months, the allegations that have been made against the Gulf carriers,  which are manifestly incorrect, but -- and there has been a polarization of  the aviation community with regard to what's been going on here.  So you  see many of the existing alliance structures starting to fracture and there  is a possibility of new arrangements coming into place.</p><p>QUEST:  Are you now fearful that the U.S. government might actually agree  and -- the merits, but they might requirements to open consultations with  the UAE and Qatar?</p><p>CLARK:  No, I'm not of that mind at all.  I believe that once we have  submitted our proposal, our rebuttal of everything that's been said,  including what has already gone into the U.S. government dossiers and  dockets that they will take a slightly different view.</p><p>QUEST:  So essentially -- and I've sort of read this several times over the  past few months -- essentially the allegations are that you get letters of  credit, that the fees that you pay at your airports are too low to recoup  the cost of the airport, that there's common ownership, the accounts are  dodgy and that you don't transact at arm's length with donata (ph) and all  the other organizations.</p><p>Do you transact at arm's length?</p><p>CLARK:  So as I said earlier, that's all complete stuff and nonsense.  We  are totally transparent.  We always have been.</p><p>QUEST:  You transact at arm's length?</p><p>CLARK:  Absolutely.  And we've been certified as doing so by the  international auditors.  So as I said, our financials are absolutely clear  and transparent.  You can test anything.</p><p>I've also invited organs of the U.S. government to come down to Dubai,  examine our books and satisfy themselves that they can see that we do not  do anything that is illegitimate, illegal or whatever.  It is all totally  above board.</p><p>QUEST:  So but the U.S. carriers -- and I was at IATA and there is a  fundamental fissure now in the industry, which it knows who believe the  U.S. is right and those who believe that you are the future model.</p><p>The U.S. -- how does the U.S. in your view get this so wrong then? </p><p>What's going wrong with the U.S.?</p><p>CLARK:  I don't think the U.S. is getting it wrong at all.  I think they're  being led down a path which is a tad misguided.  It's based on false  suppositions and allegations, which need to be dealt with obviously.  And  they are dealing with them in the best way they can.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST:  But these allegations about the Gulf Three have swirled for as long  as I've covered aviation and I suspect since longer since you've been at  Emirates.  They've always said something smelly going on with those  airlines when you run a bloody good airline and the food's magnificent and  the planes are brilliant.  But something dodgy in the accounts.</p><p>CLARK:  Well, I guess you're right.  We've had to deal with this for many  years.  And we've addressed it successfully for many years and we will  continue to address it successfully for many years to come because I don't  suppose it's going to go away.</p><p>All I can say is that for 23 years, Emirates has been disclosing its  accounts.  It's been congratulated on the quality of its financial  statements, the veracity of the financial statements.  And there is  absolutely no reason to doubt that we do anything but operate our company  on a fully commercial basis.</p><p>QUEST:  Is it likely this also becomes a geopolitical issue?  I'm thinking  obviously CENTCOM's space there.  There are strategic, there are global  security issues, terrorism issues between these governments.</p><p>Is it likely that the governments in the Gulf would say, all right, you  want to stuff our airlines...?</p><p>CLARK:  No, I don't believe it'll get to that at all.  I believe that we  will argue the case in front of the U.S. government departments on the  basis of the merits of our particular case.  I think once we have finished  that exercise, everybody will be satisfied that we are right and what has  been said about us by the U.S. big three legacy carriers is fundamentally  wrong.</p><p>We do not adversely affect their business because, frankly, they don't fly  to our region.  American Airlines doesn't operate in the Middle East,  Africa, West Asia, Indian subcontinent at all.  So how can we possibly be  doing damage?</p><p>QUEST:  I need to talk to you about one other area:  FIFA.  You're looking  remarkably prescient from having pulled out from stopping a global sponsor  of FIFA.</p><p>Do you feel that -- you obviously feel justified you saw something that the  others didn't.</p><p>CLARK:  Well, I won't say that we saw something that others didn't.  What  we are particular pleased that we're not in that space at the moment.  And  the commercial terms of FIFA's offering to us for continuance of our  sponsorship just didn't stack up  in any shape or form.</p><p>QUEST:  But what are the commercial reasons?</p><p>Or did you just not like the smell of the way they do business?</p><p>CLARK:  You know, there were concerns in other areas.  That's as far as I  will -- I'm prepared to go on that.  But certainly, primarily it was  because we were asked to be paid -- to pay a lot more than we had been  paying and when we did the return on investment analysis, even though it is  the largest sports tournament in the world, it wasn't going to stack up for  us.</p><p>QUEST:  What do you -- now that Blatter's going, would you be looking to go  back in again if the terms were right?</p><p>[16:15:00]  CLARK:  If the terms were right, yes, I'm sure we would.  It is  something that we left with great reluctance.  Obviously any major sponsor  would.  But if things are sorted out in FIFA and we get a commercial  offering that is as good as it was in the old days, then, yes, sure, we'd  go back and look at it, seriously.</p><p>QUEST:  But there has to be -- because obviously what we have found -- and  let's face it, I'll be quite honest, Tim, you're the first -- all right,  previous sponsor, former sponsor, CEO who's prepared to talk on the record.   Everybody else is running for the hills.</p><p>CLARK:  Well, look, I can't speak for them.  I would just repeat what I  said, we are glad we're not in the space at the moment because of the  fallout over the last few weeks.  It is a big pity; the big loser, of  course, is football.  Let's hope that we can get it back onto some kind of  track.  It becomes the beautiful sport that it is.  The sponsors are back  in competing against each other to get onto the tournament because it is a  hugely competitive battle to get that kind of exposure.  But it's worth it.</p><p>QUEST:  Between FIFA corruption, Gulf Three, big three allegations, I tell  you, you've got your work cut out for you.</p><p>CLARK:  Oh, well, we can deal with it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CLARK:  No, no.</p><p>QUEST:  All right.  Good to see you.  Thank you --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST:  -- now the Swiss office of the attorney general has confirmed to  CNN that it has now seized and is analyzing computer data from FIFA  headquarters.  FIFA says it will postpone the bidding process for the 2026  World Cup amid the investigation.</p><p>Speaking earlier, the general secretary, Jerome Valcke, hit out at the  media, calling for his head.  Mr. Markey said he had nothing to do with the  $10 million payment to the Caribbean football union connected with South  Africa's winning bid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME VALCKE, FIFA SECRETARY GENERAL:  The file was given to the ethics  committee of FIFA as it was given to the audit and compliance committee of  FIFA. None of the chairmen of both of these committees have found any  wrongdoings and anything would justify to blame FIFA's administration or to  blame the secretary general FIFA, to blame me.  Nothing. </p><p>So I'm sorry, I don't know what to say more than that.  I have no more  answer about this case, has no more thing to say.  I mean, you have decided  that, after Blatter, I have to be the cut, to be -- the head to be cut,  fine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  \"WORLD SPORT's\" Don Riddell is at the CNN Center, joins me now.</p><p>Don, when we look at that, I mean, look, everybody's now jumped into the  fray.</p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, yes.  I mean, Jerome Valcke had to  spend a lot of time defending himself yet again today while he was in  Russia, talking about how as far as he and the Russians sports minister are  concerned, the 2018 World Cup will go ahead as planned.  But this would be  another significant developments or at least evidence that these twin  criminal prosecutions against FIFA continue with the information now that - - information has been seized from the head office and reportedly from the  top men, Valcke and Sepp Blatter.</p><p>QUEST:  One question that I'm confused -- and it doesn't take much to  confuse me on this subject -- but one question I am confused about, does  FIFA have the legal right to withdraw either of those in the event of  proven corruption?</p><p>RIDDELL: Well, that's very, very interesting.  I mean, we heard Domenico  Scala talking about this the other day.  And he was the first senior FIFA  official to say that actually they would have the right, if it could be  proven that there was corruption in the bids for Russia 2018, Qatar 2022.   Of course, you can imagine, Richard, what that would unleash in terms of  legal proceedings and counter suing back onto  FIFA.  It would be a  monumental undertaking to actually take those tournaments away, especially  when you consider how much Russia and Qatar have spent building those  stadiums, putting the infrastructure in place, all based on a document that  they would assign to FIFA, saying you've got the World Cup in those years.</p><p>So potentially, I suppose, theoretically, it could happen.  I think in  practice it would be very, very difficult.</p><p>QUEST:  And I hope you were listening to Sir Tim Clark and what he was  saying from Emirates.  He says that they didn't like the commercial  arrangements but they would be back in the ring if they were -- if things  got better.</p><p>But it's interesting.  None of the other sponsors have gone anywhere near  as close as speaking publicly, which I think speaks volumes for Emirates.</p><p>RIDDELL:  Yes, although to be honest, he didn't really say very much, did  he?  I mean, he played as they wanted too much money and we weren't  prepared to spend that much money; however, sponsoring the World Cup and 22  men on the pitch is absolutely what we would want to be doing because it's  a fabulous tournament.  But clearly he's relieved that they don't have to  deal with any of the fallout and the mess right now because people who are  sponsoring FIFA right now, their names are associated with just the most  unholy of messes, which is just going to get worse and worse.</p><p>QUEST:  All right.  </p><p>[16:20:00]  Don Riddell, who is at CNN Center, thank you, sir.</p><p>Now a Nobel Prize-winning scientist is under fire for sexist comments.  He  said he can't work in labs with women because they cry and fall in love.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING) </p><p>QUEST:  A Nobel Prize-winning scientist is apologizing for sexist comments  he made about women working in laboratories.  Now he's an admitted  chauvinist; he's Tim Hunt and he was addressing a convention of female  scientists and journalists in Seoul.</p><p>So what did he say?  He said, \"Let me tell you about my trouble with girls.   Three things happen when they are in the lab:  you fall in love with them,  they fall in love with you and when you criticize them they cry.\"</p><p>Hunt apologized for offending anyone, saying he meant the comment as  lighthearted and ironic.  </p><p>Dr. Emily Grossman is a science teacher and advocate for women in science  and joins me now from London.</p><p>Dr. Grossman, you restrained yourself admirably from launching yourself out  of the chair as I was reading that script.</p><p>But you've heard these sorts of things before.  Look, I've got three highly  qualified professional sisters, who all work as director and managing  director level and they would all tell me that they've heard all of this  sort of stuff before.</p><p>DR. EMILY GROSSMAN, SCIENCE TEACHER: Absolutely.  This is an old story.   Women have been being told since the Renaissance time that our brains, our  skills are too small to house a powerful brain, that exercising our brains  would shrink our ovaries.  But the thing is we've come back from that.   We've come an awful long way back from that.</p><p>But unfortunately, slightly flippant and irresponsible comments like this  don't do a great service to helping us encourage more young women into  science and engineering and mathematical subjects.</p><p>QUEST:  Why?</p><p>GROSSMAN:  Why?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST:  Well, I'm just going to put it in a point of view since  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>I mean, those sorts of comments are pretty awful in any industry, whether  it be the pub, the media or in a scientific environment.  They probably  have no place.  Well, they don't have  any place, I would agree.</p><p>Why is it worse in science?</p><p>GROSSMAN:  It's no worse in science than in any other industry.  The issue  with science is that we desperately need more female scientists coming up,  taking science subjects at university and coming up in science careers.  We  need that in all subjects but particularly in science, because women have  been underrepresented in that area for so long.  And it's always been seen  as  subject that's more for boys than it is for girls.</p><p>And my work as a teacher and as an advocate for this, just to help to  encourage young girls to know that there is a place for them in science  careers, that it's not just the boys and to actually nurture them and give  them support and give them confidence to go on into studying it.</p><p>And unfortunately, comments like this, just the fear is that it would make  people feel that actually science isn't for them because it's an  environment that they just don't want to go into if they're seen as  negatively stereotyped because of feminine characteristics, like crying.</p><p>QUEST:  Right.  Let me just, again, put the other point of view -- I can  feel my email box about to explode as I go down this road.</p><p>But you'll bear with me, I'm sure.</p><p>[16:25:01]  Some would say -- I can hear some viewers saying, oh, come on.   He was being humorous.  He's a man of a certain generation.  He's won a  Nobel Prize.  Everybody should lighten up a little.</p><p>GROSSMAN:  He's in a position of responsibility there.  He's in a position  of authority.  And I agree, you know, flippant comments, jokey comments,  but people will listen to them.  And it's a very fragile environment where  classically it's been underrepresented by women for so long and young girls  are very sensitive to those kinds of stereotypes, those kinds of lack of  role models, helping them and supporting them and encouraging them to say  actually there's a place for you.  Science is for girls.  Science careers  are for girls.  And you're not going to get intimidated or, at worst,  bullied if you're going to go in to this environment.</p><p>Now I'm not saying that he would do that.  I'm saying it was just rather  silly of him to make those kinds of comments, which could be interpreted  and represented to all of the people who are going to be listening to him  out there.</p><p>QUEST:  Well, I need to apologize.  I think I mispronounced your name.   It's Dr. Grossman.  But anyway, since we've now been on television  together, I think we know each other well enough that I can call you Emily.   Please call me Richard.</p><p>Thank you very much for joining me this evening.</p><p>Right.  There we are.

Three  men armed with explosives tried to get the Karnak Temple in Luxor.   The police confronted them.  One attacker was killed when he blew up his  explosives.  Another was shot dead by the police, the third was injured.   Islamist militants have been increasingly targeting attractions in Egypt.   As Ian Lee now reports, the militants are increasingly targeting the  tourism industry itself.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>IAN LEE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Egyptian authorities thwarted a potential  devastating attack in Luxor.  Three militants tried to enter the Karnak  Temple with guns and explosives. Hundreds of tourists visit the site daily.  An alert policeman stopped the  men near the entrance.  Two militants were killed and one injured in the  incident according to the Ministry of the Interior. Five people, including civilians, were injured at (AUDIO GAP) health  ministry.  No tourists were harmed and nobody claimed responsibility.   This is the first deadly attack on the Luxor tourist site since 1997 when  gunmen killed 62 people, most international tourists.   In a statement, Egypt's minister of tourism Khaled Rami said, \"The  government of Egypt places the highest priority on the safety of tourists  in our country, we have enhanced security measures in place at all our  sites and we continue to take every measure to ensure that no harm comes to  anyone visiting Egypt.\" This attack comes just a week after gunmen shot and killed two police near  the Great Pyramids.  The targeting of tourist sites represents a major  escalation by militants.   Until recently, they've almost exclusively targeted Egyptian government  officials and security forces, killing hundreds of policemen, soldiers and  even civilians caught in the crosshairs since the overthrow of Islamist  President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013. It's not known who's behind the violence, but in a post last month on its  official Arabic website, the Muslim Brotherhood appeared to endorse a call  to arms by urging followers to quote, \"Resist this coup by all means until  the fall of the regime\" and asserted the quote, \"legitimate right to self- defense.\" Tourism is a major source of income for Egypt which has been struggling  since the 2011 revolution.  After this attack, it's likely to struggle a  little longer.  Ian Lee, CNN Cairo.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Tourism minister Khaled Rami joins me now on the line from Luxor.

The core question - what more can you do to enhance security and give  tourists a feeling of safety?  </p><p>KHALED RAMI, EGYPTIAN TOURISM MINISTER, LUXOR, EGYPT:  I think what  happened today shows how the security forces in Egypt are working, they're  extremely efficient, they were able to foil this attack and kill two of the  terrorists and the third one is injured as you said in your report which is  right. [16:35:11] As a matter of fact, there are now consideration of even  enhancing more of those security measures to go further away from the  perimeter of all tourist sites to include a much bigger - a much bigger --  radius.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  But the issue here of course is obviously one is  exceptionally grateful and glad that you thwarted the attack.  But you  don't want the attack to even be started in the first place.  That's the  danger for tourists.  They say, 'Well, they may thwart the attack, but I  don't really want to be there if an attack's about to take place.'</p><p>RAMI:  We have to look at it from another perspective.  Terrorist attacks  are logistically something which is extremely difficult and which is  something that takes lots of preparation and also needs a huge budget.  So  I don't think that something like that is a common thing, That's why we, the Egyptian governments, are able to enhance security in  all touristic sites and around our tourists, I feel that they could be very  safe in Egypt.  </p><p>QUEST:  The country has done a remarkable job of restoring your tourism  numbers.  They will almost be back at record levels despite - for want of a  better word - government issues or issues of revolution - whatever you want  to call it, Minister.  Your numbers have come back.  And that's a testament  to the strength of tourism as an industry, isn't it?  </p><p>RAMI:  It is.  Tourism is a very resilient industry, and as a matter of  fact, in the first five month of this year - from January to May - we  witnessed an increase in tourist numbers to Egypt by 9 percent compared to  the - </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  </p><p>RAMI:  -- same periods of last year.  </p><p>QUEST:  Are you - </p><p>RAMI:  And also the - </p><p>QUEST:  -- forgive me, are you seeing numbers coming back at Cairo?   Because obviously the Red Sea, obviously (Shah Mel Sheik), that has been -  never been - affected.  And now of course you've got these areas, but what  about Cairo?  </p><p>RAMI:  To tell you the truth, the occupancy rates in the hotels in Giza in  May were 50 percent and in Cairo which the area we call Greater Cairo was  45 percent.  </p><p>QUEST:  We now look at the situation in the region - whether it's ISIS or  whether its - well any of the other disputations (ph) - any of the other  terrorist activities - they increase the refugee crisis, the Jordanian  crisis - whatever it is, the region - put a regional hat on for me with you  will as to how the region can portray an element of safety and security  when frankly most of the news concerns bombs, bullets and death as a  result. </p><p>RAMI:  You know, Richard, we made this mistake in the 90s.  I remember  times when the Egyptian government said that terrorism is not confined to  Egypt and not confined to the Middle East.  Terrorism is a global threat.   I need that we need that we all work together.  We are all in the same  boat, we have to work together to fight terrorists.  It's not confined to  the Middle East alone.</p><p>QUEST:  And as it's not confined to - it may not be confined to the Middle  East alone - I'll take your point on that.  And certainly if you look at  North Africa and if you look at other parts of the world - even parts of  Asia - yes, you're absolutely correct.   But the perception - that's your difficulty, Minister, isn't it?  It's the  perception. </p><p>RAMI:  I know it is the perception that terrorism stems from Islamic  countries which is something that we have to fight.  Not - the problem is  that people are generalizing the whole thing.  We in Egypt are against  terrorism.  Most of the people in the Islamic world - I would say 99.9  percent - are against extremism because extremism is something extremely  bad.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  </p><p>RAMI:  Extremists will turn into terrorists.  If they don't turn into  terrorists, they will at least try to persuade others to turn into  terrorists.  And I need - I need - a statement from the Western world to  say that extremism should be - </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  </p><p>RAMI:  -- fought and not only terrorists.  </p><p>QUEST:  Minister, very good of you to come on the program tonight, sir.   Thank you very much.  I know it's been a busy day for you.  </p><p>RAMI:  Thank you so much.  </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you.</p><p>RAMI:  Thank you, Richard, 'bye.</p><p>QUEST:  Egypt's minister of tourism joining me.  </p><p>Now let's assume you are traveling and you have decided to go - it doesn't  really matter where you're going.  The one thing you've really got to  decide is whether to check your bag or whether to try and heave it into the  overhead compartment.   New regulations could make that size of that bag standard.  In a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:42:12] QUEST:  Welcome to the check-in area for Q Air where we are  going to address a problem almost every passenger faces - getting carry-on  luggage into the overhead bins.   Now, carry-on luggage, sometimes it can be truly small and carry-on - no  problem with that. Other times it could be carry-on - well, carry-on, carry-on - and then  you've got very large carry-ons which won't fit in but will go overhead.   Now IATA - the International Airline Transport Association is trying to  make things easier for us all (ph).  It's come up with standard guideline  for carry-ons.  One line, one standard for everybody. The problem is the new size really takes all of them and is smaller than  the current largest carry-on which means those of us who've got large  carry-ons may have to buy smaller carry-ons if you want to get on to the  checked baggage.   So far the guidelines are voluntary, several international airlines say  they will sign on once they get the bags.  On this month's \"CNN Business  Traveller,\" we've been flying in America. I've been crisscrossing the USA.   I've been road testing the four major American carriers - American, Delta,  Southwest and United.   I've been flying hub to hub, meeting the airline executives, finding about  the investments they're doing flying in America.  Because the truth is U.S.  airlines are much better than their reputation precedes them.   Here's where I've been flying from - if you take.  We flew from Love Field  to Chicago Midway on Southwest.  Then we went on United from O'Hare to  Dallas/Fort Worth.  From Dallas/Fort Worth we took Delta to Atlanta.  And  then we from - I beg your pardon - American - and then Delta from Atlanta  up to LaGuardia.   So, flying in America.  Deliberately we chose routes of around two/two and  a half hours, we deliberately didn't allow the airlines to put us on  transcon routes where they have nice, big lying-flat seats.  We wanted  typical everyday flights in America.   Now to look and see the first flight.  It was American Airlines.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Hello.  Good thank you.  The new American has gone further than  most in reinventing themselves.  </p><p>JEFF PLANT, VICE PRESIDENT, DALLAS/FORT WORTH HUB, AMERICAN AIRLINES:  This  is the Admiral's Club, terminal D, one of four clubs here at Dallas-Fort  Worth.  We want to be great again, we want to be number one again.   16:45:00] And we have new airplanes that have the same amenities on them  going domestically than international.  They have video screens, they have  internet, they have mood lighting, they have a really good feel to them  even though you're only going to Austin, Texas.  </p><p>QUEST:  So, whether you're flying to Austin or L.A., American believes the  domestic market is key.  </p><p>SCOTT KIRBY, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN AIRLINES:  For (ph) historically in the  domestic market, we competed mostly on price.  Today we can compete on  product as well.   Seventy percent of our revenue comes from the domestic market and our best  customers.  Even those that are flying the long-haul international routes  and paying premium fares to fly in first and business class typically spend  a lot of time flying domestically and are flying us internationally because  they're on our frequent flyer program domestically.  </p><p>QUEST:  What are the priorities?  </p><p>KIRBY:  The premium experience.  So we've announced a $2 billion investment  in the premium products of first class - the transcon product that we have,  the lounges.  But we're also investing in the entire product.</p><p>QUEST:  It's time to put one of those planes to the test.</p><p>Male:  Hey, how are you doing?</p><p>QUEST:  Hello, how are you?</p><p>Male:  Thank you. </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much.  Up here it's all new American.  The evidence  of this increased investment is obvious as soon as you step onboard.  Brand  new seats with up-to-date technology and a completely refurbished cabin.   In fact, the whole structure has changed.  The U.S. carriers have gone  further than, say, even the Europeans in breaking up the cabin into  different classes.  For instance, American calls it main cabin extra.  It's  at the front of economy, there's more leg room and it's reserved for those  who pay are the frequent flyers.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Historically it was just first-class and coach and those were the  only two.  But first-class can be a great product, but then you can have  more comfort economy, you can have maybe even more segments in coach where  customers can pay a little bit more and get a better product. Customers that care about price and that want to have the best price can  still get the lowest price.  And customers that want more service, that  want more leg room, that want more amenities can pay for that and get  those.  But it's a customer choice.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Scott Kirby of American Airlines.  We'll be road testing the rest  of them - United, Delta and Southwest.  Now, what happens if you merge Angry Birds with Lego?  We'll show you after  the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Markets across Europe rallied on this Wednesday's trading session.   If you take a look at the number, you'll see exactly the strong  performance.  Two percent up on the Xetra DAX, 1 and 3/4 is in Paris.  In  London it was the governor of the Bank of England - Mark Carney - who's  addressing the financial finest tonight, calling for the tougher measures  against bankers who are found to have been broken the law at the city's  speech. Shares in Standard Chartered are up 4 percent.  After a challenging few  years, the new chief exec Bill Winters says he will make banks' capital  strength his priority.  The company behind Angry Birds is hoping to turn its fortunes around as it  signs a deal with Lego to make irritable, avian toys.  The toy release is  scheduled to coincide with the release of (LAUGHTER) - \"Happy Birds,\" the  movie next year. [16:50:07] The chief executive of Rovio joined me earlier and I asked him,  looking at the partnership, why bring Angry Birds and Lego together?   What's at the heart of it?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>PEKKA RANTALA, CEO, ROVIO:  Lego is all about innovation and creativity and  so it's Angry Birds.  So that's what we share in common.  On the other  hand, Lego is endorsing that creativity from construction perspective,  whereas I think our entry point is a joyful destruction.  On the other hand, Lego is a very much physical, good space experience and  the Angry Birds, we are very digital native brand.  So bringing digital and  physical together, I think together we can have something that's - some  magic for the consumers.</p><p>QUEST:  Yes, well that's the core - bringing digital and physical together.  </p><p>RANTALA:  Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST:  But when you bring digital and physical together, what are you left  with?  Pieces of Lego that look like Angry Birds?  Because that's not  terribly imaginative.  So what's the end product going to look like?  </p><p>RANTALA:  Well of course this means in practice that next spring 2016, Lego  will launch throughout their entire worldwide distribution Lego products  based on the Angry Birds movie characters and all around the world, you  know, ranging all relevant price points.  So they are Lego blocks based on  Angry Birds characters. But of course at the same time like I said, so we are looking forward at  the ways we can combine the digital and the physical experience and we are,  I said, hatching some cool things for the consumers in practice --   </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  </p><p>RANTALA:  -- so that they can have a journey between physical and digital  world.  </p><p>QUEST:  Is it fair to say - as I'm putting together some Lego - I never was  very good at this.  Is it fair to say - </p><p>RANTALA:  You need to practice.  </p><p>QUEST:  Well, thank you.  Yes.  Is it fair to say that this is not exactly  an experiment, it's going to be a learning curve for both of you because of  the nature - the different nature - of the two companies - one physical,  one digital?  </p><p>RANTALA:  Well first of all, you know, we've been in talks for a long, long  time and I think the deciding (ph) point was that when the Lego executives  saw the really raw and unfinished version of our upcoming feature film, so  they got so excited that we decided that now is the right time to go  onboard and start this partnership. So we've been preparing this for quite a long time.  So I think that we  will - in other words, we don't want to practice too much when we go  towards our fans.  So I think that we are going to have something that really feels really  real and great and is a great experience from the very beginning.  But of  course it's a journey when these two companies we now start to partner.  We  are looking forward to have a long-term partnership and I'm sure that the  years will bring with them of course new experiences.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  That's Lego and Angry Birds.  One piece of news to bring you coming  in while we've been on-air.  S&amp;P has downgraded Greece's credit rating  further into junk territory.  It's now - it's only gone down by one notch  from Triple C Plus, now it's at Triple C.   And the outlook is negative and if I just tell you the reason why they say,  according to the S&amp;P press release, \"Greece's delaying its payment to the  IMF appears to demonstrate the Greek government is prioritizing pension and  other domestic spendings over its debt obligations.  We've lowered our  long-term sovereign credit to Triple C.\"   Not a huge move - Triple C Plus to Triple C - but it is an indication that  Greece's actions in deciding to bundle payments as it did at the beginning  of the month, has had a repercussion.  In other words, now the ratings  agency put them on guard.   Now other news, by all accounts Google Glass was an epic flop - not for  everyone.  It turns out they have medical uses with Google Glass and there  are applications that are helping sufferers of Parkinson's disease.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Parkinson's is a movement disorder.  I was diagnosed  in 2003.  With Parkinson's, all of your movements and in fact everything  about your body becomes constricted.  For me, everything slows down.  When  I would be walking on the sidewalk, I would feel like I was walking through  mud or quicksand.   They have developed an app for Google Glass and it consists of a little  screen and this plastic piece that you put on and they give you little  visuals to follow.   I took it out for a walk and it's great for a walk because the person who  was demonstrating the walk - she's walking and you walk along with her and  then she - then the screen disappears and the music just keeps looping when  you're walking because walking to music is very helpful and it keeps you in  a certain gait and you don't slow down.  </p><p>[16:55:01] UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Anthropedi (ph) offers free specialized  dance classes for people with Parkinson's.  All of the strategies that  dancers use to move and to control their movement and maintain balance and  control their flexibility and use a wide range of imaginative tools to  initiate movement.  All of those tools can be useful for people with  Parkinson's.   As a teacher, it's impossible for me to be with each individual student  once they leave the studio.  Google Glass is in many ways the perfect  technology for translating the information that we try to get across in  class into people's everyday lives.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The exercise is really imperative to combat almost  any kind of ill health, but with Parkinson's it's particularly necessary  because of the tendency of the body to constrict - just sort of twist in on  itself.   I think probably the visual keeps you honest in terms of the extent to  which you put your all into an exercise.  The dancers are so well trained  and they do it so beautifully you want to imitate them.  And when you  imitate them, you're doing the exercise better. </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Magnificent.  A \"Profitable Moment\" is after the break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's \"Profitable Moment.\"  Today Sir Tim Clark brought the  Gulf 3 fight right into the heart of American aviation.  Speaking at the  Wings Club, he defended the way the Gulf 3 run their business.  Now it's up  to the U.S. government to decide whether they will ask for consultations.   This row between the American carriers and the Gulf is nasty, it's deep and  it's going to take more than a few speeches to put it right.   And that is \"Quest Means Business\" for tonight.  I'm Richard Quest in New  York.  Whatever  you're up to in the hours ahead, (RINGS BELL) I hope it's  profitable.  Let's get together tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2015 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED. Copyright 2015 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

It's now back over 18,000 again, of 1.33 percent for a midweek session. A strong but firm gavel on the midweek session, Wednesday, the 10th of June.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight: back in the black. U.S. markets stage a supersized rally.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Emirates Airlines is warning Washington over the battle in the skies. The Emirates chief exec Sir Tim live on this program.</p><p>And as Egypt foils a major terror attack, we're going to hear from the tourism minister tonight on how he's keeping visitors safe.</p><p>We have a very busy hour together. I'm Richard Quest and I mean business.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST: Good evening. It's a midweek session and the markets snapped their four-day losing streak and they've done so in a spectacular style. The Dow has just closed the best part of 250 points up. And if you look over the course of the year, it's now positive for the year so far.</p><p>Join me at the superscreens and you will see exactly what we are talking about. This is how the market just closed; it's a gain of 234 points. But bobbing around 18,000 ,just shows you in the last few seconds of trade, it's just gone back down again, it might just recalibrate to 18,000.</p><p>But if you look at what happened, it was the energy stocks that did the trick. They rallied alongside oil prices. U.S. government bond prices are also falling. So let's start with the Dow Jones. Bring in Paul La Monica to join me and to put some perspective --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: Now here is the Dow.</p><p>What was the influence here? We are just about 18,000. That's a very strong gain of some 1.3 percent.</p><p>What was the influence?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNNMONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT: You mentioned energy, but it was also banks and tech stocks that really did well, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, big winners today. I think everyone's hoping that a Fed rate hike is going to be good for banks. But then with techs, they've just been beaten up in a couple -- for the past couple of days.</p><p>QUEST: Right. But this idea that -- well, let's look at year-to-date, or six month-to-date. There you -- that starts to put -- but look at this. We have this big dip in June. Now that's the fear of rates.</p><p>LA MONICA: Exactly.</p><p>QUEST: But now rates still likely to go up this year with the market's back.</p><p>So why?</p><p>LA MONICA: I think that we're maybe finally getting accustomed to the rate hike is going to be in September. You had that strong jobs report and that really is cementing in a lot of people's minds that a rate hike is finally coming. I think a lot of this fits and starts that we've had, the angst has been about, oh, is it going to be June? No, it's not going to be June. Is it going to be September? No, it's not going to be September. Maybe it's 2016. It was the uncertainty about the timing of the rate hike. So now it's more certain.</p><p>QUEST: Right. So the acceptance that it's going to happen is basically let's live with it and let's deal with it.</p><p>LA MONICA: Definitely. And you can't ignore overseas as well. What's going on in Europe is definitely leading bond prices down and yields up here as well, German bond yield finally back above 1 percent. You have the hopes that Greece may get saved after all if Germany's going to compromise.</p><p>QUEST: The Nasdaq: here's the Nasdaq today, similar story. It went up; it made its gains and it stayed there throughout the session.</p><p>What was the driving force?</p><p>LA MONICA: You have enthusiasm again about big tech. Apple was a winner. Microsoft, Intel, IBM; Netflix is a huge winner, top gainer in the S&amp;P 500 today. Stock has more than doubled this year. People just love that company. Probably overvalued but right now momentum investors don't --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: -- same again with you here. You have -- this click, this fall down here was very sharp and very pronounced.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, again, the rate hike fears but also valuations. That's definitely something that is a big problem with tech stocks, more so than the broader market, a lot of people worried about the Netflixes and the Facebooks of the world, are they overvalued?</p><p>QUEST: OK. So putting all this together for me as we draw the strands of the market, what do you make of it?</p><p>LA MONICA: I think that right now we're probably just going to have more volatility unfortunately. We think the rate hike is coming in September. But this is a data-dependent fad, a data-dependent market. It's trite and clich,, but until we know for certain that that rate hike is coming, just more volatility.</p><p>QUEST: More volatility --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: -- many thanks for that.</p><p>Here we have the way the market has traded. And it's not often that you see this sort of day. I showed you what was happening. We started the day when it was just barely -- well, when we started the program, it was over - - then we went back. But we have held 18,000 on the Dow Jones.</p><p>What were the issues that helped make the day move forward? I promise you one thing: it's a case with \"Business on the Move.\"</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[16:05:10] QUEST (voice-over): Welcome to the new \"Business on the Move,\" where we see Netflix stock soared to record highs, up 3.7 percent. Shareholders have approved a proposal that could clear the way for a split and Marriott Hotels is adding Netflix to hotel rooms as well.</p><p>As for Zara, the big shopping company Zara from Spain, up 28 percent. It saw profits soar, everything, apparently was all to do with rapid expansion and a weak euro.</p><p>Now if you're looking in London, police are searching for an item just like this: there are reports that a manuscript of \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" the prequel, has been stolen. The book itself is due for release next week as indeed the prequel is now going to be the sequel.</p><p>Talk about sugary drinks, sugary drinks about to get slapped with health warnings like this one, what does the warning say? It says \"Drinking beverages with added sugar contributes to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay.\"</p><p>In other words, this warning in San Francisco, the law still needs the efforts of the mayor's signature to go into effect. It's a case of what you're seeing is \"Business on the Move.\" And as we continue...</p><p>As we continue after the break from \"Business on the Move\" to chief executives on the move, this is Sir Tim Clark of Emirates. He will be joining me in the C suite to talk about what his speech to the Wings Club.</p><p>Come and join me, sir.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST: We're back, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. The chief executive of Emirates is warning that if the U.S. scraps its \"open skies\" agreements, foreign airlines may have trouble flying into the UAE.</p><p>Sir Tim Clark says if \"open skies\" is scrapped, there could be new anti- trust concerns at play for all the U.S. carriers. At this week's IATA AGM, the international -- the airline association, the chief executive of American Airlines, Doug Parker, told me it's his responsibility as an airline CEO to bring this issue to bear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOUG PARKER, CEO, AMERICAN AIRLINES: You know, this is an issue that we believe has the potential to have a profound impact on our airlines, on the U.S. commercial aviation business and on the people we employ. And we are obligated to go fight for all those things.</p><p>And in this case, some may have other views, we felt very strongly that indeed you know, what we're doing is right and that what -- and that these fights and the potential for flights that fly to the United States from other parts of the world will be subsidized by governments, is going to have a big impact on the U.S. airline industry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Sir Tim Clark, the president and CEO of Emirates, joins me here in the C suite.</p><p>You didn't launch yourself out of the chair when you heard. This is your speech that you have to the Wings Club here in New York today.</p><p>You called the U.S. claim \"stuff and nonsense,\" an extremely dodgy 55-page dossier, which indeed this is it. And you go on to warn that basically we could see the rise of a new international aviation model which would be out with the old guard, in with the vanguard.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>[16:10:03] SIR TIM CLARK, CEO, EMIRATES: Well, I think as a result of everything that's been going on over the last couple of months, three months, the allegations that have been made against the Gulf carriers, which are manifestly incorrect, but -- and there has been a polarization of the aviation community with regard to what's been going on here. So you see many of the existing alliance structures starting to fracture and there is a possibility of new arrangements coming into place.</p><p>QUEST: Are you now fearful that the U.S. government might actually agree and -- the merits, but they might requirements to open consultations with the UAE and Qatar?</p><p>CLARK: No, I'm not of that mind at all. I believe that once we have submitted our proposal, our rebuttal of everything that's been said, including what has already gone into the U.S. government dossiers and dockets that they will take a slightly different view.</p><p>QUEST: So essentially -- and I've sort of read this several times over the past few months -- essentially the allegations are that you get letters of credit, that the fees that you pay at your airports are too low to recoup the cost of the airport, that there's common ownership, the accounts are dodgy and that you don't transact at arm's length with donata (ph) and all the other organizations.</p><p>Do you transact at arm's length?</p><p>CLARK: So as I said earlier, that's all complete stuff and nonsense. We are totally transparent. We always have been.</p><p>QUEST: You transact at arm's length?</p><p>CLARK: Absolutely. And we've been certified as doing so by the international auditors. So as I said, our financials are absolutely clear and transparent. You can test anything.</p><p>I've also invited organs of the U.S. government to come down to Dubai, examine our books and satisfy themselves that they can see that we do not do anything that is illegitimate, illegal or whatever. It is all totally above board.</p><p>QUEST: So but the U.S. carriers -- and I was at IATA and there is a fundamental fissure now in the industry, which it knows who believe the U.S. is right and those who believe that you are the future model.</p><p>The U.S. -- how does the U.S. in your view get this so wrong then?</p><p>What's going wrong with the U.S.?</p><p>CLARK: I don't think the U.S. is getting it wrong at all. I think they're being led down a path which is a tad misguided. It's based on false suppositions and allegations, which need to be dealt with obviously. And they are dealing with them in the best way they can.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: But these allegations about the Gulf Three have swirled for as long as I've covered aviation and I suspect since longer since you've been at Emirates. They've always said something smelly going on with those airlines when you run a bloody good airline and the food's magnificent and the planes are brilliant. But something dodgy in the accounts.</p><p>CLARK: Well, I guess you're right. We've had to deal with this for many years. And we've addressed it successfully for many years and we will continue to address it successfully for many years to come because I don't suppose it's going to go away.</p><p>All I can say is that for 23 years, Emirates has been disclosing its accounts. It's been congratulated on the quality of its financial statements, the veracity of the financial statements. And there is absolutely no reason to doubt that we do anything but operate our company on a fully commercial basis.</p><p>QUEST: Is it likely this also becomes a geopolitical issue? I'm thinking obviously CENTCOM's space there. There are strategic, there are global security issues, terrorism issues between these governments.</p><p>Is it likely that the governments in the Gulf would say, all right, you want to stuff our airlines...?</p><p>CLARK: No, I don't believe it'll get to that at all. I believe that we will argue the case in front of the U.S. government departments on the basis of the merits of our particular case. I think once we have finished that exercise, everybody will be satisfied that we are right and what has been said about us by the U.S. big three legacy carriers is fundamentally wrong.</p><p>We do not adversely affect their business because, frankly, they don't fly to our region. American Airlines doesn't operate in the Middle East, Africa, West Asia, Indian subcontinent at all. So how can we possibly be doing damage?</p><p>QUEST: I need to talk to you about one other area: FIFA. You're looking remarkably prescient from having pulled out from stopping a global sponsor of FIFA.</p><p>Do you feel that -- you obviously feel justified you saw something that the others didn't.</p><p>CLARK: Well, I won't say that we saw something that others didn't. What we are particular pleased that we're not in that space at the moment. And the commercial terms of FIFA's offering to us for continuance of our sponsorship just didn't stack up in any shape or form.</p><p>QUEST: But what are the commercial reasons?</p><p>Or did you just not like the smell of the way they do business?</p><p>CLARK: You know, there were concerns in other areas. That's as far as I will -- I'm prepared to go on that. But certainly, primarily it was because we were asked to be paid -- to pay a lot more than we had been paying and when we did the return on investment analysis, even though it is the largest sports tournament in the world, it wasn't going to stack up for us.</p><p>QUEST: What do you -- now that Blatter's going, would you be looking to go back in again if the terms were right?</p><p>[16:15:00] CLARK: If the terms were right, yes, I'm sure we would. It is something that we left with great reluctance. Obviously any major sponsor would. But if things are sorted out in FIFA and we get a commercial offering that is as good as it was in the old days, then, yes, sure, we'd go back and look at it, seriously.</p><p>QUEST: But there has to be -- because obviously what we have found -- and let's face it, I'll be quite honest, Tim, you're the first -- all right, previous sponsor, former sponsor, CEO who's prepared to talk on the record. Everybody else is running for the hills.</p><p>CLARK: Well, look, I can't speak for them. I would just repeat what I said, we are glad we're not in the space at the moment because of the fallout over the last few weeks. It is a big pity; the big loser, of course, is football. Let's hope that we can get it back onto some kind of track. It becomes the beautiful sport that it is. The sponsors are back in competing against each other to get onto the tournament because it is a hugely competitive battle to get that kind of exposure. But it's worth it.</p><p>QUEST: Between FIFA corruption, Gulf Three, big three allegations, I tell you, you've got your work cut out for you.</p><p>CLARK: Oh, well, we can deal with it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CLARK: No, no.</p><p>QUEST: All right. Good to see you. Thank you --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: -- now the Swiss office of the attorney general has confirmed to CNN that it has now seized and is analyzing computer data from FIFA headquarters. FIFA says it will postpone the bidding process for the 2026 World Cup amid the investigation.</p><p>Speaking earlier, the general secretary, Jerome Valcke, hit out at the media, calling for his head. Mr. Markey said he had nothing to do with the $10 million payment to the Caribbean football union connected with South Africa's winning bid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME VALCKE, FIFA SECRETARY GENERAL: The file was given to the ethics committee of FIFA as it was given to the audit and compliance committee of FIFA. None of the chairmen of both of these committees have found any wrongdoings and anything would justify to blame FIFA's administration or to blame the secretary general FIFA, to blame me. Nothing.</p><p>So I'm sorry, I don't know what to say more than that. I have no more answer about this case, has no more thing to say. I mean, you have decided that, after Blatter, I have to be the cut, to be -- the head to be cut, fine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: \"WORLD SPORT's\" Don Riddell is at the CNN Center, joins me now.</p><p>Don, when we look at that, I mean, look, everybody's now jumped into the fray.</p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, yes. I mean, Jerome Valcke had to spend a lot of time defending himself yet again today while he was in Russia, talking about how as far as he and the Russians sports minister are concerned, the 2018 World Cup will go ahead as planned. But this would be another significant developments or at least evidence that these twin criminal prosecutions against FIFA continue with the information now that - - information has been seized from the head office and reportedly from the top men, Valcke and Sepp Blatter.</p><p>QUEST: One question that I'm confused -- and it doesn't take much to confuse me on this subject -- but one question I am confused about, does FIFA have the legal right to withdraw either of those in the event of proven corruption?</p><p>RIDDELL: Well, that's very, very interesting. I mean, we heard Domenico Scala talking about this the other day. And he was the first senior FIFA official to say that actually they would have the right, if it could be proven that there was corruption in the bids for Russia 2018, Qatar 2022. Of course, you can imagine, Richard, what that would unleash in terms of legal proceedings and counter suing back onto FIFA. It would be a monumental undertaking to actually take those tournaments away, especially when you consider how much Russia and Qatar have spent building those stadiums, putting the infrastructure in place, all based on a document that they would assign to FIFA, saying you've got the World Cup in those years.</p><p>So potentially, I suppose, theoretically, it could happen. I think in practice it would be very, very difficult.</p><p>QUEST: And I hope you were listening to Sir Tim Clark and what he was saying from Emirates. He says that they didn't like the commercial arrangements but they would be back in the ring if they were -- if things got better.</p><p>But it's interesting. None of the other sponsors have gone anywhere near as close as speaking publicly, which I think speaks volumes for Emirates.</p><p>RIDDELL: Yes, although to be honest, he didn't really say very much, did he? I mean, he played as they wanted too much money and we weren't prepared to spend that much money; however, sponsoring the World Cup and 22 men on the pitch is absolutely what we would want to be doing because it's a fabulous tournament. But clearly he's relieved that they don't have to deal with any of the fallout and the mess right now because people who are sponsoring FIFA right now, their names are associated with just the most unholy of messes, which is just going to get worse and worse.</p><p>QUEST: All right.</p><p>[16:20:00] Don Riddell, who is at CNN Center, thank you, sir.</p><p>Now a Nobel Prize-winning scientist is under fire for sexist comments. He said he can't work in labs with women because they cry and fall in love.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST: A Nobel Prize-winning scientist is apologizing for sexist comments he made about women working in laboratories. Now he's an admitted chauvinist; he's Tim Hunt and he was addressing a convention of female scientists and journalists in Seoul.</p><p>So what did he say? He said, \"Let me tell you about my trouble with girls. Three things happen when they are in the lab: you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you and when you criticize them they cry.\"</p><p>Hunt apologized for offending anyone, saying he meant the comment as lighthearted and ironic.</p><p>Dr. Emily Grossman is a science teacher and advocate for women in science and joins me now from London.</p><p>Dr. Grossman, you restrained yourself admirably from launching yourself out of the chair as I was reading that script.</p><p>But you've heard these sorts of things before. Look, I've got three highly qualified professional sisters, who all work as director and managing director level and they would all tell me that they've heard all of this sort of stuff before.</p><p>DR. EMILY GROSSMAN, SCIENCE TEACHER: Absolutely. This is an old story. Women have been being told since the Renaissance time that our brains, our skills are too small to house a powerful brain, that exercising our brains would shrink our ovaries. But the thing is we've come back from that. We've come an awful long way back from that.</p><p>But unfortunately, slightly flippant and irresponsible comments like this don't do a great service to helping us encourage more young women into science and engineering and mathematical subjects.</p><p>QUEST: Why?</p><p>GROSSMAN: Why?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: Well, I'm just going to put it in a point of view since (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>I mean, those sorts of comments are pretty awful in any industry, whether it be the pub, the media or in a scientific environment. They probably have no place. Well, they don't have any place, I would agree.</p><p>Why is it worse in science?</p><p>GROSSMAN: It's no worse in science than in any other industry. The issue with science is that we desperately need more female scientists coming up, taking science subjects at university and coming up in science careers. We need that in all subjects but particularly in science, because women have been underrepresented in that area for so long. And it's always been seen as subject that's more for boys than it is for girls.</p><p>And my work as a teacher and as an advocate for this, just to help to encourage young girls to know that there is a place for them in science careers, that it's not just the boys and to actually nurture them and give them support and give them confidence to go on into studying it.</p><p>And unfortunately, comments like this, just the fear is that it would make people feel that actually science isn't for them because it's an environment that they just don't want to go into if they're seen as negatively stereotyped because of feminine characteristics, like crying.</p><p>QUEST: Right. Let me just, again, put the other point of view -- I can feel my email box about to explode as I go down this road.</p><p>But you'll bear with me, I'm sure.</p><p>[16:25:01] Some would say -- I can hear some viewers saying, oh, come on. He was being humorous. He's a man of a certain generation. He's won a Nobel Prize. Everybody should lighten up a little.</p><p>GROSSMAN: He's in a position of responsibility there. He's in a position of authority. And I agree, you know, flippant comments, jokey comments, but people will listen to them. And it's a very fragile environment where classically it's been underrepresented by women for so long and young girls are very sensitive to those kinds of stereotypes, those kinds of lack of role models, helping them and supporting them and encouraging them to say actually there's a place for you. Science is for girls. Science careers are for girls. And you're not going to get intimidated or, at worst, bullied if you're going to go in to this environment.</p><p>Now I'm not saying that he would do that. I'm saying it was just rather silly of him to make those kinds of comments, which could be interpreted and represented to all of the people who are going to be listening to him out there.</p><p>QUEST: Well, I need to apologize. I think I mispronounced your name. It's Dr. Grossman. But anyway, since we've now been on television together, I think we know each other well enough that I can call you Emily.

Three men armed with explosives tried to get the Karnak Temple in Luxor. The police confronted them. One attacker was killed when he blew up his explosives. Another was shot dead by the police, the third was injured. Islamist militants have been increasingly targeting attractions in Egypt. As Ian Lee now reports, the militants are increasingly targeting the tourism industry itself.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>IAN LEE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Egyptian authorities thwarted a potential devastating attack in Luxor. Three militants tried to enter the Karnak Temple with guns and explosives. Hundreds of tourists visit the site daily. An alert policeman stopped the men near the entrance. Two militants were killed and one injured in the incident according to the Ministry of the Interior. Five people, including civilians, were injured at (AUDIO GAP) health ministry. No tourists were harmed and nobody claimed responsibility. This is the first deadly attack on the Luxor tourist site since 1997 when gunmen killed 62 people, most international tourists. In a statement, Egypt's minister of tourism Khaled Rami said, \"The government of Egypt places the highest priority on the safety of tourists in our country, we have enhanced security measures in place at all our sites and we continue to take every measure to ensure that no harm comes to anyone visiting Egypt.\" This attack comes just a week after gunmen shot and killed two police near the Great Pyramids. The targeting of tourist sites represents a major escalation by militants. Until recently, they've almost exclusively targeted Egyptian government officials and security forces, killing hundreds of policemen, soldiers and even civilians caught in the crosshairs since the overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013. It's not known who's behind the violence, but in a post last month on its official Arabic website, the Muslim Brotherhood appeared to endorse a call to arms by urging followers to quote, \"Resist this coup by all means until the fall of the regime\" and asserted the quote, \"legitimate right to self- defense.\" Tourism is a major source of income for Egypt which has been struggling since the 2011 revolution. After this attack, it's likely to struggle a little longer. Ian Lee, CNN Cairo.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Tourism minister Khaled Rami joins me now on the line from Luxor. Minister, thank you for giving us your time this evening. The core question - what more can you do to enhance security and give tourists a feeling of safety?</p><p>KHALED RAMI, EGYPTIAN TOURISM MINISTER, LUXOR, EGYPT: I think what happened today shows how the security forces in Egypt are working, they're extremely efficient, they were able to foil this attack and kill two of the terrorists and the third one is injured as you said in your report which is right. [16:35:11] As a matter of fact, there are now consideration of even enhancing more of those security measures to go further away from the perimeter of all tourist sites to include a much bigger - a much bigger -- radius.</p><p>QUEST: Right. But the issue here of course is obviously one is exceptionally grateful and glad that you thwarted the attack. But you don't want the attack to even be started in the first place. That's the danger for tourists. They say, 'Well, they may thwart the attack, but I don't really want to be there if an attack's about to take place.'</p><p>RAMI: We have to look at it from another perspective. Terrorist attacks are logistically something which is extremely difficult and which is something that takes lots of preparation and also needs a huge budget. So I don't think that something like that is a common thing, That's why we, the Egyptian governments, are able to enhance security in all touristic sites and around our tourists, I feel that they could be very safe in Egypt.</p><p>QUEST: The country has done a remarkable job of restoring your tourism numbers. They will almost be back at record levels despite - for want of a better word - government issues or issues of revolution - whatever you want to call it, Minister. Your numbers have come back. And that's a testament to the strength of tourism as an industry, isn't it?</p><p>RAMI: It is. Tourism is a very resilient industry, and as a matter of fact, in the first five month of this year - from January to May - we witnessed an increase in tourist numbers to Egypt by 9 percent compared to the -</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>RAMI: -- same periods of last year.</p><p>QUEST: Are you -</p><p>RAMI: And also the -</p><p>QUEST: -- forgive me, are you seeing numbers coming back at Cairo? Because obviously the Red Sea, obviously (Shah Mel Sheik), that has been - never been - affected. And now of course you've got these areas, but what about Cairo?</p><p>RAMI: To tell you the truth, the occupancy rates in the hotels in Giza in May were 50 percent and in Cairo which the area we call Greater Cairo was 45 percent.</p><p>QUEST: We now look at the situation in the region - whether it's ISIS or whether its - well any of the other disputations (ph) - any of the other terrorist activities - they increase the refugee crisis, the Jordanian crisis - whatever it is, the region - put a regional hat on for me with you will as to how the region can portray an element of safety and security when frankly most of the news concerns bombs, bullets and death as a result.</p><p>RAMI: You know, Richard, we made this mistake in the 90s. I remember times when the Egyptian government said that terrorism is not confined to Egypt and not confined to the Middle East. Terrorism is a global threat. I need that we need that we all work together. We are all in the same boat, we have to work together to fight terrorists. It's not confined to the Middle East alone.</p><p>QUEST: And as it's not confined to - it may not be confined to the Middle East alone - I'll take your point on that. And certainly if you look at North Africa and if you look at other parts of the world - even parts of Asia - yes, you're absolutely correct. But the perception - that's your difficulty, Minister, isn't it? It's the perception.</p><p>RAMI: I know it is the perception that terrorism stems from Islamic countries which is something that we have to fight. Not - the problem is that people are generalizing the whole thing. We in Egypt are against terrorism. Most of the people in the Islamic world - I would say 99.9 percent - are against extremism because extremism is something extremely bad.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>RAMI: Extremists will turn into terrorists. If they don't turn into terrorists, they will at least try to persuade others to turn into terrorists. And I need - I need - a statement from the Western world to say that extremism should be -</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>RAMI: -- fought and not only terrorists.</p><p>QUEST: Minister, very good of you to come on the program tonight, sir. Thank you very much. I know it's been a busy day for you.</p><p>RAMI: Thank you so much.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you.</p><p>RAMI: Thank you, Richard, 'bye.</p><p>QUEST: Egypt's minister of tourism joining me.</p><p>Now let's assume you are traveling and you have decided to go - it doesn't really matter where you're going. The one thing you've really got to decide is whether to check your bag or whether to try and heave it into the overhead compartment. New regulations could make that size of that bag standard. In a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:42:12] QUEST: Welcome to the check-in area for Q Air where we are going to address a problem almost every passenger faces - getting carry-on luggage into the overhead bins. Now, carry-on luggage, sometimes it can be truly small and carry-on - no problem with that. Other times it could be carry-on - well, carry-on, carry-on - and then you've got very large carry-ons which won't fit in but will go overhead. Now IATA - the International Airline Transport Association is trying to make things easier for us all (ph). It's come up with standard guideline for carry-ons. One line, one standard for everybody. The problem is the new size really takes all of them and is smaller than the current largest carry-on which means those of us who've got large carry-ons may have to buy smaller carry-ons if you want to get on to the checked baggage. So far the guidelines are voluntary, several international airlines say they will sign on once they get the bags. On this month's \"CNN Business Traveller,\" we've been flying in America. I've been crisscrossing the USA. I've been road testing the four major American carriers - American, Delta, Southwest and United. I've been flying hub to hub, meeting the airline executives, finding about the investments they're doing flying in America. Because the truth is U.S. airlines are much better than their reputation precedes them. Here's where I've been flying from - if you take. We flew from Love Field to Chicago Midway on Southwest. Then we went on United from O'Hare to Dallas/Fort Worth. From Dallas/Fort Worth we took Delta to Atlanta. And then we from - I beg your pardon - American - and then Delta from Atlanta up to LaGuardia. So, flying in America. Deliberately we chose routes of around two/two and a half hours, we deliberately didn't allow the airlines to put us on transcon routes where they have nice, big lying-flat seats. We wanted typical everyday flights in America. Now to look and see the first flight. It was American Airlines.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Hello. Good thank you. The new American has gone further than most in reinventing themselves.</p><p>JEFF PLANT, VICE PRESIDENT, DALLAS/FORT WORTH HUB, AMERICAN AIRLINES: This is the Admiral's Club, terminal D, one of four clubs here at Dallas-Fort Worth. We want to be great again, we want to be number one again. 16:45:00] And we have new airplanes that have the same amenities on them going domestically than international. They have video screens, they have internet, they have mood lighting, they have a really good feel to them even though you're only going to Austin, Texas.</p><p>QUEST: So, whether you're flying to Austin or L.A., American believes the domestic market is key.</p><p>SCOTT KIRBY, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN AIRLINES: For (ph) historically in the domestic market, we competed mostly on price. Today we can compete on product as well. Seventy percent of our revenue comes from the domestic market and our best customers. Even those that are flying the long-haul international routes and paying premium fares to fly in first and business class typically spend a lot of time flying domestically and are flying us internationally because they're on our frequent flyer program domestically.</p><p>QUEST: What are the priorities?</p><p>KIRBY: The premium experience. So we've announced a $2 billion investment in the premium products of first class - the transcon product that we have, the lounges. But we're also investing in the entire product.</p><p>QUEST: It's time to put one of those planes to the test.</p><p>Male: Hey, how are you doing?</p><p>QUEST: Hello, how are you?</p><p>Male: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much. Up here it's all new American. The evidence of this increased investment is obvious as soon as you step onboard. Brand new seats with up-to-date technology and a completely refurbished cabin. In fact, the whole structure has changed. The U.S. carriers have gone further than, say, even the Europeans in breaking up the cabin into different classes. For instance, American calls it main cabin extra. It's at the front of economy, there's more leg room and it's reserved for those who pay are the frequent flyers.</p><p>KIRBY: Historically it was just first-class and coach and those were the only two. But first-class can be a great product, but then you can have more comfort economy, you can have maybe even more segments in coach where customers can pay a little bit more and get a better product. Customers that care about price and that want to have the best price can still get the lowest price. And customers that want more service, that want more leg room, that want more amenities can pay for that and get those. But it's a customer choice.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Scott Kirby of American Airlines. We'll be road testing the rest of them - United, Delta and Southwest. Now, what happens if you merge Angry Birds with Lego? We'll show you after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Markets across Europe rallied on this Wednesday's trading session. If you take a look at the number, you'll see exactly the strong performance. Two percent up on the Xetra DAX, 1 and 3/4 is in Paris. In London it was the governor of the Bank of England - Mark Carney - who's addressing the financial finest tonight, calling for the tougher measures against bankers who are found to have been broken the law at the city's speech. Shares in Standard Chartered are up 4 percent. After a challenging few years, the new chief exec Bill Winters says he will make banks' capital strength his priority. The company behind Angry Birds is hoping to turn its fortunes around as it signs a deal with Lego to make irritable, avian toys. The toy release is scheduled to coincide with the release of (LAUGHTER) - \"Happy Birds,\" the movie next year. [16:50:07] The chief executive of Rovio joined me earlier and I asked him, looking at the partnership, why bring Angry Birds and Lego together? What's at the heart of it?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>PEKKA RANTALA, CEO, ROVIO: Lego is all about innovation and creativity and so it's Angry Birds. So that's what we share in common. On the other hand, Lego is endorsing that creativity from construction perspective, whereas I think our entry point is a joyful destruction. On the other hand, Lego is a very much physical, good space experience and the Angry Birds, we are very digital native brand. So bringing digital and physical together, I think together we can have something that's - some magic for the consumers.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, well that's the core - bringing digital and physical together.</p><p>RANTALA: Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST: But when you bring digital and physical together, what are you left with? Pieces of Lego that look like Angry Birds? Because that's not terribly imaginative. So what's the end product going to look like?</p><p>RANTALA: Well of course this means in practice that next spring 2016, Lego will launch throughout their entire worldwide distribution Lego products based on the Angry Birds movie characters and all around the world, you know, ranging all relevant price points. So they are Lego blocks based on Angry Birds characters. But of course at the same time like I said, so we are looking forward at the ways we can combine the digital and the physical experience and we are, I said, hatching some cool things for the consumers in practice --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>RANTALA: -- so that they can have a journey between physical and digital world.</p><p>QUEST: Is it fair to say - as I'm putting together some Lego - I never was very good at this. Is it fair to say -</p><p>RANTALA: You need to practice.</p><p>QUEST: Well, thank you. Yes. Is it fair to say that this is not exactly an experiment, it's going to be a learning curve for both of you because of the nature - the different nature - of the two companies - one physical, one digital?</p><p>RANTALA: Well first of all, you know, we've been in talks for a long, long time and I think the deciding (ph) point was that when the Lego executives saw the really raw and unfinished version of our upcoming feature film, so they got so excited that we decided that now is the right time to go onboard and start this partnership. So we've been preparing this for quite a long time. So I think that we will - in other words, we don't want to practice too much when we go towards our fans. So I think that we are going to have something that really feels really real and great and is a great experience from the very beginning. But of course it's a journey when these two companies we now start to partner. We are looking forward to have a long-term partnership and I'm sure that the years will bring with them of course new experiences.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: That's Lego and Angry Birds. One piece of news to bring you coming in while we've been on-air. S&amp;P has downgraded Greece's credit rating further into junk territory. It's now - it's only gone down by one notch from Triple C Plus, now it's at Triple C. And the outlook is negative and if I just tell you the reason why they say, according to the S&amp;P press release, \"Greece's delaying its payment to the IMF appears to demonstrate the Greek government is prioritizing pension and other domestic spendings over its debt obligations. We've lowered our long-term sovereign credit to Triple C.\" Not a huge move - Triple C Plus to Triple C - but it is an indication that Greece's actions in deciding to bundle payments as it did at the beginning of the month, has had a repercussion. In other words, now the ratings agency put them on guard. Now other news, by all accounts Google Glass was an epic flop - not for everyone. It turns out they have medical uses with Google Glass and there are applications that are helping sufferers of Parkinson's disease.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Parkinson's is a movement disorder. I was diagnosed in 2003. With Parkinson's, all of your movements and in fact everything about your body becomes constricted. For me, everything slows down. When I would be walking on the sidewalk, I would feel like I was walking through mud or quicksand. They have developed an app for Google Glass and it consists of a little screen and this plastic piece that you put on and they give you little visuals to follow. I took it out for a walk and it's great for a walk because the person who was demonstrating the walk - she's walking and you walk along with her and then she - then the screen disappears and the music just keeps looping when you're walking because walking to music is very helpful and it keeps you in a certain gait and you don't slow down.</p><p>[16:55:01] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Anthropedi (ph) offers free specialized dance classes for people with Parkinson's. All of the strategies that dancers use to move and to control their movement and maintain balance and control their flexibility and use a wide range of imaginative tools to initiate movement. All of those tools can be useful for people with Parkinson's. As a teacher, it's impossible for me to be with each individual student once they leave the studio. Google Glass is in many ways the perfect technology for translating the information that we try to get across in class into people's everyday lives.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The exercise is really imperative to combat almost any kind of ill health, but with Parkinson's it's particularly necessary because of the tendency of the body to constrict - just sort of twist in on itself. I think probably the visual keeps you honest in terms of the extent to which you put your all into an exercise. The dancers are so well trained and they do it so beautifully you want to imitate them. And when you imitate them, you're doing the exercise better.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Magnificent. A \"Profitable Moment\" is after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's \"Profitable Moment.\" Today Sir Tim Clark brought the Gulf 3 fight right into the heart of American aviation. Speaking at the Wings Club, he defended the way the Gulf 3 run their business. Now it's up to the U.S. government to decide whether they will ask for consultations. This row between the American carriers and the Gulf is nasty, it's deep and it's going to take more than a few speeches to put it right. And that is \"Quest Means Business\" for tonight. I'm Richard Quest in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, (RINGS BELL) I hope it's profitable.

It's now back over 18,000 again, of 1.33 percent for a midweek session. A strong but firm gavel on the midweek session, Wednesday, the 10th of June.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight: back in the black. U.S. markets stage a supersized rally.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Emirates Airlines is warning Washington over the battle in the skies. The Emirates chief exec Sir Tim live on this program.</p><p>And as Egypt foils a major terror attack, we're going to hear from the tourism minister tonight on how he's keeping visitors safe.</p><p>We have a very busy hour together. I'm Richard Quest and I mean business.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST: Good evening. It's a midweek session and the markets snapped their four-day losing streak and they've done so in a spectacular style. The Dow has just closed the best part of 250 points up. And if you look over the course of the year, it's now positive for the year so far.</p><p>Join me at the superscreens and you will see exactly what we are talking about. This is how the market just closed; it's a gain of 234 points. But bobbing around 18,000 ,just shows you in the last few seconds of trade, it's just gone back down again, it might just recalibrate to 18,000.</p><p>But if you look at what happened, it was the energy stocks that did the trick. They rallied alongside oil prices. U.S. government bond prices are also falling. So let's start with the Dow Jones. Bring in Paul La Monica to join me and to put some perspective --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: Now here is the Dow.</p><p>What was the influence here? We are just about 18,000. That's a very strong gain of some 1.3 percent.</p><p>What was the influence?</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNNMONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT: You mentioned energy, but it was also banks and tech stocks that really did well, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, big winners today. I think everyone's hoping that a Fed rate hike is going to be good for banks. But then with techs, they've just been beaten up in a couple -- for the past couple of days.</p><p>QUEST: Right. But this idea that -- well, let's look at year-to-date, or six month-to-date. There you -- that starts to put -- but look at this. We have this big dip in June. Now that's the fear of rates.</p><p>LA MONICA: Exactly.</p><p>QUEST: But now rates still likely to go up this year with the market's back.</p><p>So why?</p><p>LA MONICA: I think that we're maybe finally getting accustomed to the rate hike is going to be in September. You had that strong jobs report and that really is cementing in a lot of people's minds that a rate hike is finally coming. I think a lot of this fits and starts that we've had, the angst has been about, oh, is it going to be June? No, it's not going to be June. Is it going to be September? No, it's not going to be September. Maybe it's 2016. It was the uncertainty about the timing of the rate hike. So now it's more certain.</p><p>QUEST: Right. So the acceptance that it's going to happen is basically let's live with it and let's deal with it.</p><p>LA MONICA: Definitely. And you can't ignore overseas as well. What's going on in Europe is definitely leading bond prices down and yields up here as well, German bond yield finally back above 1 percent. You have the hopes that Greece may get saved after all if Germany's going to compromise.</p><p>QUEST: The Nasdaq: here's the Nasdaq today, similar story. It went up; it made its gains and it stayed there throughout the session.</p><p>What was the driving force?</p><p>LA MONICA: You have enthusiasm again about big tech. Apple was a winner. Microsoft, Intel, IBM; Netflix is a huge winner, top gainer in the S&amp;P 500 today. Stock has more than doubled this year. People just love that company. Probably overvalued but right now momentum investors don't --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: -- same again with you here. You have -- this click, this fall down here was very sharp and very pronounced.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, again, the rate hike fears but also valuations. That's definitely something that is a big problem with tech stocks, more so than the broader market, a lot of people worried about the Netflixes and the Facebooks of the world, are they overvalued?</p><p>QUEST: OK. So putting all this together for me as we draw the strands of the market, what do you make of it?</p><p>LA MONICA: I think that right now we're probably just going to have more volatility unfortunately. We think the rate hike is coming in September. But this is a data-dependent fad, a data-dependent market. It's trite and clich,, but until we know for certain that that rate hike is coming, just more volatility.</p><p>QUEST: More volatility --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: -- many thanks for that.</p><p>Here we have the way the market has traded. And it's not often that you see this sort of day. I showed you what was happening. We started the day when it was just barely -- well, when we started the program, it was over - - then we went back. But we have held 18,000 on the Dow Jones.</p><p>What were the issues that helped make the day move forward? I promise you one thing: it's a case with \"Business on the Move.\"</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[16:05:10] QUEST (voice-over): Welcome to the new \"Business on the Move,\" where we see Netflix stock soared to record highs, up 3.7 percent. Shareholders have approved a proposal that could clear the way for a split and Marriott Hotels is adding Netflix to hotel rooms as well.</p><p>As for Zara, the big shopping company Zara from Spain, up 28 percent. It saw profits soar, everything, apparently was all to do with rapid expansion and a weak euro.</p><p>Now if you're looking in London, police are searching for an item just like this: there are reports that a manuscript of \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" the prequel, has been stolen. The book itself is due for release next week as indeed the prequel is now going to be the sequel.</p><p>Talk about sugary drinks, sugary drinks about to get slapped with health warnings like this one, what does the warning say? It says \"Drinking beverages with added sugar contributes to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay.\"</p><p>In other words, this warning in San Francisco, the law still needs the efforts of the mayor's signature to go into effect. It's a case of what you're seeing is \"Business on the Move.\" And as we continue...</p><p>As we continue after the break from \"Business on the Move\" to chief executives on the move, this is Sir Tim Clark of Emirates. He will be joining me in the C suite to talk about what his speech to the Wings Club.</p><p>Come and join me, sir.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST: We're back, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. The chief executive of Emirates is warning that if the U.S. scraps its \"open skies\" agreements, foreign airlines may have trouble flying into the UAE.</p><p>Sir Tim Clark says if \"open skies\" is scrapped, there could be new anti- trust concerns at play for all the U.S. carriers. At this week's IATA AGM, the international -- the airline association, the chief executive of American Airlines, Doug Parker, told me it's his responsibility as an airline CEO to bring this issue to bear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOUG PARKER, CEO, AMERICAN AIRLINES: You know, this is an issue that we believe has the potential to have a profound impact on our airlines, on the U.S. commercial aviation business and on the people we employ. And we are obligated to go fight for all those things.</p><p>And in this case, some may have other views, we felt very strongly that indeed you know, what we're doing is right and that what -- and that these fights and the potential for flights that fly to the United States from other parts of the world will be subsidized by governments, is going to have a big impact on the U.S. airline industry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Sir Tim Clark, the president and CEO of Emirates, joins me here in the C suite.</p><p>You didn't launch yourself out of the chair when you heard. This is your speech that you have to the Wings Club here in New York today.</p><p>You called the U.S. claim \"stuff and nonsense,\" an extremely dodgy 55-page dossier, which indeed this is it. And you go on to warn that basically we could see the rise of a new international aviation model which would be out with the old guard, in with the vanguard.</p><p>What do you mean?</p><p>[16:10:03] SIR TIM CLARK, CEO, EMIRATES: Well, I think as a result of everything that's been going on over the last couple of months, three months, the allegations that have been made against the Gulf carriers, which are manifestly incorrect, but -- and there has been a polarization of the aviation community with regard to what's been going on here. So you see many of the existing alliance structures starting to fracture and there is a possibility of new arrangements coming into place.</p><p>QUEST: Are you now fearful that the U.S. government might actually agree and -- the merits, but they might requirements to open consultations with the UAE and Qatar?</p><p>CLARK: No, I'm not of that mind at all. I believe that once we have submitted our proposal, our rebuttal of everything that's been said, including what has already gone into the U.S. government dossiers and dockets that they will take a slightly different view.</p><p>QUEST: So essentially -- and I've sort of read this several times over the past few months -- essentially the allegations are that you get letters of credit, that the fees that you pay at your airports are too low to recoup the cost of the airport, that there's common ownership, the accounts are dodgy and that you don't transact at arm's length with donata (ph) and all the other organizations.</p><p>Do you transact at arm's length?</p><p>CLARK: So as I said earlier, that's all complete stuff and nonsense. We are totally transparent. We always have been.</p><p>QUEST: You transact at arm's length?</p><p>CLARK: Absolutely. And we've been certified as doing so by the international auditors. So as I said, our financials are absolutely clear and transparent. You can test anything.</p><p>I've also invited organs of the U.S. government to come down to Dubai, examine our books and satisfy themselves that they can see that we do not do anything that is illegitimate, illegal or whatever. It is all totally above board.</p><p>QUEST: So but the U.S. carriers -- and I was at IATA and there is a fundamental fissure now in the industry, which it knows who believe the U.S. is right and those who believe that you are the future model.</p><p>The U.S. -- how does the U.S. in your view get this so wrong then?</p><p>What's going wrong with the U.S.?</p><p>CLARK: I don't think the U.S. is getting it wrong at all. I think they're being led down a path which is a tad misguided. It's based on false suppositions and allegations, which need to be dealt with obviously. And they are dealing with them in the best way they can.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: But these allegations about the Gulf Three have swirled for as long as I've covered aviation and I suspect since longer since you've been at Emirates. They've always said something smelly going on with those airlines when you run a bloody good airline and the food's magnificent and the planes are brilliant. But something dodgy in the accounts.</p><p>CLARK: Well, I guess you're right. We've had to deal with this for many years. And we've addressed it successfully for many years and we will continue to address it successfully for many years to come because I don't suppose it's going to go away.</p><p>All I can say is that for 23 years, Emirates has been disclosing its accounts. It's been congratulated on the quality of its financial statements, the veracity of the financial statements. And there is absolutely no reason to doubt that we do anything but operate our company on a fully commercial basis.</p><p>QUEST: Is it likely this also becomes a geopolitical issue? I'm thinking obviously CENTCOM's space there. There are strategic, there are global security issues, terrorism issues between these governments.</p><p>Is it likely that the governments in the Gulf would say, all right, you want to stuff our airlines...?</p><p>CLARK: No, I don't believe it'll get to that at all. I believe that we will argue the case in front of the U.S. government departments on the basis of the merits of our particular case. I think once we have finished that exercise, everybody will be satisfied that we are right and what has been said about us by the U.S. big three legacy carriers is fundamentally wrong.</p><p>We do not adversely affect their business because, frankly, they don't fly to our region. American Airlines doesn't operate in the Middle East, Africa, West Asia, Indian subcontinent at all. So how can we possibly be doing damage?</p><p>QUEST: I need to talk to you about one other area: FIFA. You're looking remarkably prescient from having pulled out from stopping a global sponsor of FIFA.</p><p>Do you feel that -- you obviously feel justified you saw something that the others didn't.</p><p>CLARK: Well, I won't say that we saw something that others didn't. What we are particular pleased that we're not in that space at the moment. And the commercial terms of FIFA's offering to us for continuance of our sponsorship just didn't stack up in any shape or form.</p><p>QUEST: But what are the commercial reasons?</p><p>Or did you just not like the smell of the way they do business?</p><p>CLARK: You know, there were concerns in other areas. That's as far as I will -- I'm prepared to go on that. But certainly, primarily it was because we were asked to be paid -- to pay a lot more than we had been paying and when we did the return on investment analysis, even though it is the largest sports tournament in the world, it wasn't going to stack up for us.</p><p>QUEST: What do you -- now that Blatter's going, would you be looking to go back in again if the terms were right?</p><p>[16:15:00] CLARK: If the terms were right, yes, I'm sure we would. It is something that we left with great reluctance. Obviously any major sponsor would. But if things are sorted out in FIFA and we get a commercial offering that is as good as it was in the old days, then, yes, sure, we'd go back and look at it, seriously.</p><p>QUEST: But there has to be -- because obviously what we have found -- and let's face it, I'll be quite honest, Tim, you're the first -- all right, previous sponsor, former sponsor, CEO who's prepared to talk on the record. Everybody else is running for the hills.</p><p>CLARK: Well, look, I can't speak for them. I would just repeat what I said, we are glad we're not in the space at the moment because of the fallout over the last few weeks. It is a big pity; the big loser, of course, is football. Let's hope that we can get it back onto some kind of track. It becomes the beautiful sport that it is. The sponsors are back in competing against each other to get onto the tournament because it is a hugely competitive battle to get that kind of exposure. But it's worth it.</p><p>QUEST: Between FIFA corruption, Gulf Three, big three allegations, I tell you, you've got your work cut out for you.</p><p>CLARK: Oh, well, we can deal with it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CLARK: No, no.</p><p>QUEST: All right. Good to see you. Thank you --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: -- now the Swiss office of the attorney general has confirmed to CNN that it has now seized and is analyzing computer data from FIFA headquarters. FIFA says it will postpone the bidding process for the 2026 World Cup amid the investigation.</p><p>Speaking earlier, the general secretary, Jerome Valcke, hit out at the media, calling for his head. Mr. Markey said he had nothing to do with the $10 million payment to the Caribbean football union connected with South Africa's winning bid.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME VALCKE, FIFA SECRETARY GENERAL: The file was given to the ethics committee of FIFA as it was given to the audit and compliance committee of FIFA. None of the chairmen of both of these committees have found any wrongdoings and anything would justify to blame FIFA's administration or to blame the secretary general FIFA, to blame me. Nothing.</p><p>So I'm sorry, I don't know what to say more than that. I have no more answer about this case, has no more thing to say. I mean, you have decided that, after Blatter, I have to be the cut, to be -- the head to be cut, fine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: \"WORLD SPORT's\" Don Riddell is at the CNN Center, joins me now.</p><p>Don, when we look at that, I mean, look, everybody's now jumped into the fray.</p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, yes. I mean, Jerome Valcke had to spend a lot of time defending himself yet again today while he was in Russia, talking about how as far as he and the Russians sports minister are concerned, the 2018 World Cup will go ahead as planned. But this would be another significant developments or at least evidence that these twin criminal prosecutions against FIFA continue with the information now that - - information has been seized from the head office and reportedly from the top men, Valcke and Sepp Blatter.</p><p>QUEST: One question that I'm confused -- and it doesn't take much to confuse me on this subject -- but one question I am confused about, does FIFA have the legal right to withdraw either of those in the event of proven corruption?</p><p>RIDDELL: Well, that's very, very interesting. I mean, we heard Domenico Scala talking about this the other day. And he was the first senior FIFA official to say that actually they would have the right, if it could be proven that there was corruption in the bids for Russia 2018, Qatar 2022. Of course, you can imagine, Richard, what that would unleash in terms of legal proceedings and counter suing back onto FIFA. It would be a monumental undertaking to actually take those tournaments away, especially when you consider how much Russia and Qatar have spent building those stadiums, putting the infrastructure in place, all based on a document that they would assign to FIFA, saying you've got the World Cup in those years.</p><p>So potentially, I suppose, theoretically, it could happen. I think in practice it would be very, very difficult.</p><p>QUEST: And I hope you were listening to Sir Tim Clark and what he was saying from Emirates. He says that they didn't like the commercial arrangements but they would be back in the ring if they were -- if things got better.</p><p>But it's interesting. None of the other sponsors have gone anywhere near as close as speaking publicly, which I think speaks volumes for Emirates.</p><p>RIDDELL: Yes, although to be honest, he didn't really say very much, did he? I mean, he played as they wanted too much money and we weren't prepared to spend that much money; however, sponsoring the World Cup and 22 men on the pitch is absolutely what we would want to be doing because it's a fabulous tournament. But clearly he's relieved that they don't have to deal with any of the fallout and the mess right now because people who are sponsoring FIFA right now, their names are associated with just the most unholy of messes, which is just going to get worse and worse.</p><p>QUEST: All right.</p><p>[16:20:00] Don Riddell, who is at CNN Center, thank you, sir.</p><p>Now a Nobel Prize-winning scientist is under fire for sexist comments. He said he can't work in labs with women because they cry and fall in love.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>QUEST: A Nobel Prize-winning scientist is apologizing for sexist comments he made about women working in laboratories. Now he's an admitted chauvinist; he's Tim Hunt and he was addressing a convention of female scientists and journalists in Seoul.</p><p>So what did he say? He said, \"Let me tell you about my trouble with girls. Three things happen when they are in the lab: you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you and when you criticize them they cry.\"</p><p>Hunt apologized for offending anyone, saying he meant the comment as lighthearted and ironic.</p><p>Dr. Emily Grossman is a science teacher and advocate for women in science and joins me now from London.</p><p>Dr. Grossman, you restrained yourself admirably from launching yourself out of the chair as I was reading that script.</p><p>But you've heard these sorts of things before. Look, I've got three highly qualified professional sisters, who all work as director and managing director level and they would all tell me that they've heard all of this sort of stuff before.</p><p>DR. EMILY GROSSMAN, SCIENCE TEACHER: Absolutely. This is an old story. Women have been being told since the Renaissance time that our brains, our skills are too small to house a powerful brain, that exercising our brains would shrink our ovaries. But the thing is we've come back from that. We've come an awful long way back from that.</p><p>But unfortunately, slightly flippant and irresponsible comments like this don't do a great service to helping us encourage more young women into science and engineering and mathematical subjects.</p><p>QUEST: Why?</p><p>GROSSMAN: Why?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: Well, I'm just going to put it in a point of view since (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>I mean, those sorts of comments are pretty awful in any industry, whether it be the pub, the media or in a scientific environment. They probably have no place. Well, they don't have any place, I would agree.</p><p>Why is it worse in science?</p><p>GROSSMAN: It's no worse in science than in any other industry. The issue with science is that we desperately need more female scientists coming up, taking science subjects at university and coming up in science careers. We need that in all subjects but particularly in science, because women have been underrepresented in that area for so long. And it's always been seen as subject that's more for boys than it is for girls.</p><p>And my work as a teacher and as an advocate for this, just to help to encourage young girls to know that there is a place for them in science careers, that it's not just the boys and to actually nurture them and give them support and give them confidence to go on into studying it.</p><p>And unfortunately, comments like this, just the fear is that it would make people feel that actually science isn't for them because it's an environment that they just don't want to go into if they're seen as negatively stereotyped because of feminine characteristics, like crying.</p><p>QUEST: Right. Let me just, again, put the other point of view -- I can feel my email box about to explode as I go down this road.</p><p>But you'll bear with me, I'm sure.</p><p>[16:25:01] Some would say -- I can hear some viewers saying, oh, come on. He was being humorous. He's a man of a certain generation. He's won a Nobel Prize. Everybody should lighten up a little.</p><p>GROSSMAN: He's in a position of responsibility there. He's in a position of authority. And I agree, you know, flippant comments, jokey comments, but people will listen to them. And it's a very fragile environment where classically it's been underrepresented by women for so long and young girls are very sensitive to those kinds of stereotypes, those kinds of lack of role models, helping them and supporting them and encouraging them to say actually there's a place for you. Science is for girls. Science careers are for girls.

Three men armed with explosives tried to get the Karnak Temple in Luxor. The police confronted them. One attacker was killed when he blew up his explosives. Another was shot dead by the police, the third was injured. Islamist militants have been increasingly targeting attractions in Egypt. As Ian Lee now reports, the militants are increasingly targeting the tourism industry itself.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>IAN LEE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Egyptian authorities thwarted a potential devastating attack in Luxor. Three militants tried to enter the Karnak Temple with guns and explosives. Hundreds of tourists visit the site daily. An alert policeman stopped the men near the entrance. Two militants were killed and one injured in the incident according to the Ministry of the Interior. Five people, including civilians, were injured at (AUDIO GAP) health ministry. No tourists were harmed and nobody claimed responsibility. This is the first deadly attack on the Luxor tourist site since 1997 when gunmen killed 62 people, most international tourists. In a statement, Egypt's minister of tourism Khaled Rami said, \"The government of Egypt places the highest priority on the safety of tourists in our country, we have enhanced security measures in place at all our sites and we continue to take every measure to ensure that no harm comes to anyone visiting Egypt.\" This attack comes just a week after gunmen shot and killed two police near the Great Pyramids. The targeting of tourist sites represents a major escalation by militants. Until recently, they've almost exclusively targeted Egyptian government officials and security forces, killing hundreds of policemen, soldiers and even civilians caught in the crosshairs since the overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013. It's not known who's behind the violence, but in a post last month on its official Arabic website, the Muslim Brotherhood appeared to endorse a call to arms by urging followers to quote, \"Resist this coup by all means until the fall of the regime\" and asserted the quote, \"legitimate right to self- defense.\" Tourism is a major source of income for Egypt which has been struggling since the 2011 revolution. After this attack, it's likely to struggle a little longer. Ian Lee, CNN Cairo.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Tourism minister Khaled Rami joins me now on the line from Luxor. Minister, thank you for giving us your time this evening. The core question - what more can you do to enhance security and give tourists a feeling of safety?</p><p>KHALED RAMI, EGYPTIAN TOURISM MINISTER, LUXOR, EGYPT: I think what happened today shows how the security forces in Egypt are working, they're extremely efficient, they were able to foil this attack and kill two of the terrorists and the third one is injured as you said in your report which is right. [16:35:11] As a matter of fact, there are now consideration of even enhancing more of those security measures to go further away from the perimeter of all tourist sites to include a much bigger - a much bigger -- radius.</p><p>QUEST: Right. But the issue here of course is obviously one is exceptionally grateful and glad that you thwarted the attack. But you don't want the attack to even be started in the first place. That's the danger for tourists. They say, 'Well, they may thwart the attack, but I don't really want to be there if an attack's about to take place.'</p><p>RAMI: We have to look at it from another perspective. Terrorist attacks are logistically something which is extremely difficult and which is something that takes lots of preparation and also needs a huge budget. So I don't think that something like that is a common thing, That's why we, the Egyptian governments, are able to enhance security in all touristic sites and around our tourists, I feel that they could be very safe in Egypt.</p><p>QUEST: The country has done a remarkable job of restoring your tourism numbers. They will almost be back at record levels despite - for want of a better word - government issues or issues of revolution - whatever you want to call it, Minister. Your numbers have come back. And that's a testament to the strength of tourism as an industry, isn't it?</p><p>RAMI: It is. Tourism is a very resilient industry, and as a matter of fact, in the first five month of this year - from January to May - we witnessed an increase in tourist numbers to Egypt by 9 percent compared to the -</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>RAMI: -- same periods of last year.</p><p>QUEST: Are you -</p><p>RAMI: And also the -</p><p>QUEST: -- forgive me, are you seeing numbers coming back at Cairo? Because obviously the Red Sea, obviously (Shah Mel Sheik), that has been - never been - affected. And now of course you've got these areas, but what about Cairo?</p><p>RAMI: To tell you the truth, the occupancy rates in the hotels in Giza in May were 50 percent and in Cairo which the area we call Greater Cairo was 45 percent.</p><p>QUEST: We now look at the situation in the region - whether it's ISIS or whether its - well any of the other disputations (ph) - any of the other terrorist activities - they increase the refugee crisis, the Jordanian crisis - whatever it is, the region - put a regional hat on for me with you will as to how the region can portray an element of safety and security when frankly most of the news concerns bombs, bullets and death as a result.</p><p>RAMI: You know, Richard, we made this mistake in the 90s. I remember times when the Egyptian government said that terrorism is not confined to Egypt and not confined to the Middle East. Terrorism is a global threat. I need that we need that we all work together. We are all in the same boat, we have to work together to fight terrorists. It's not confined to the Middle East alone.</p><p>QUEST: And as it's not confined to - it may not be confined to the Middle East alone - I'll take your point on that. And certainly if you look at North Africa and if you look at other parts of the world - even parts of Asia - yes, you're absolutely correct. But the perception - that's your difficulty, Minister, isn't it? It's the perception.</p><p>RAMI: I know it is the perception that terrorism stems from Islamic countries which is something that we have to fight. Not - the problem is that people are generalizing the whole thing. We in Egypt are against terrorism. Most of the people in the Islamic world - I would say 99.9 percent - are against extremism because extremism is something extremely bad.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>RAMI: Extremists will turn into terrorists. If they don't turn into terrorists, they will at least try to persuade others to turn into terrorists. And I need - I need - a statement from the Western world to say that extremism should be -</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>RAMI: -- fought and not only terrorists.</p><p>QUEST: Minister, very good of you to come on the program tonight, sir. Thank you very much. I know it's been a busy day for you.</p><p>RAMI: Thank you so much.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you.</p><p>RAMI: Thank you, Richard, 'bye.</p><p>QUEST: Egypt's minister of tourism joining me.</p><p>Now let's assume you are traveling and you have decided to go - it doesn't really matter where you're going. The one thing you've really got to decide is whether to check your bag or whether to try and heave it into the overhead compartment. New regulations could make that size of that bag standard. In a moment.</p><p>[16:42:12] QUEST: Welcome to the check-in area for Q Air where we are going to address a problem almost every passenger faces - getting carry-on luggage into the overhead bins. Now, carry-on luggage, sometimes it can be truly small and carry-on - no problem with that. Other times it could be carry-on - well, carry-on, carry-on - and then you've got very large carry-ons which won't fit in but will go overhead. Now IATA - the International Airline Transport Association is trying to make things easier for us all (ph). It's come up with standard guideline for carry-ons. One line, one standard for everybody. The problem is the new size really takes all of them and is smaller than the current largest carry-on which means those of us who've got large carry-ons may have to buy smaller carry-ons if you want to get on to the checked baggage. So far the guidelines are voluntary, several international airlines say they will sign on once they get the bags. On this month's \"CNN Business Traveller,\" we've been flying in America. I've been crisscrossing the USA. I've been road testing the four major American carriers - American, Delta, Southwest and United. I've been flying hub to hub, meeting the airline executives, finding about the investments they're doing flying in America. Because the truth is U.S. airlines are much better than their reputation precedes them. Here's where I've been flying from - if you take. We flew from Love Field to Chicago Midway on Southwest. Then we went on United from O'Hare to Dallas/Fort Worth. From Dallas/Fort Worth we took Delta to Atlanta. And then we from - I beg your pardon - American - and then Delta from Atlanta up to LaGuardia. So, flying in America. Deliberately we chose routes of around two/two and a half hours, we deliberately didn't allow the airlines to put us on transcon routes where they have nice, big lying-flat seats. We wanted typical everyday flights in America. Now to look and see the first flight. It was American Airlines.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Hello. Good thank you. The new American has gone further than most in reinventing themselves.</p><p>JEFF PLANT, VICE PRESIDENT, DALLAS/FORT WORTH HUB, AMERICAN AIRLINES: This is the Admiral's Club, terminal D, one of four clubs here at Dallas-Fort Worth. We want to be great again, we want to be number one again. 16:45:00] And we have new airplanes that have the same amenities on them going domestically than international. They have video screens, they have internet, they have mood lighting, they have a really good feel to them even though you're only going to Austin, Texas.</p><p>QUEST: So, whether you're flying to Austin or L.A., American believes the domestic market is key.</p><p>SCOTT KIRBY, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN AIRLINES: For (ph) historically in the domestic market, we competed mostly on price. Today we can compete on product as well. Seventy percent of our revenue comes from the domestic market and our best customers. Even those that are flying the long-haul international routes and paying premium fares to fly in first and business class typically spend a lot of time flying domestically and are flying us internationally because they're on our frequent flyer program domestically.</p><p>QUEST: What are the priorities?</p><p>KIRBY: The premium experience. So we've announced a $2 billion investment in the premium products of first class - the transcon product that we have, the lounges. But we're also investing in the entire product.</p><p>QUEST: It's time to put one of those planes to the test.</p><p>Male: Hey, how are you doing?</p><p>QUEST: Hello, how are you?</p><p>Male: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much. Up here it's all new American. The evidence of this increased investment is obvious as soon as you step onboard. Brand new seats with up-to-date technology and a completely refurbished cabin. In fact, the whole structure has changed. The U.S. carriers have gone further than, say, even the Europeans in breaking up the cabin into different classes. For instance, American calls it main cabin extra. It's at the front of economy, there's more leg room and it's reserved for those who pay are the frequent flyers.</p><p>KIRBY: Historically it was just first-class and coach and those were the only two. But first-class can be a great product, but then you can have more comfort economy, you can have maybe even more segments in coach where customers can pay a little bit more and get a better product. Customers that care about price and that want to have the best price can still get the lowest price. And customers that want more service, that want more leg room, that want more amenities can pay for that and get those. But it's a customer choice.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Scott Kirby of American Airlines. We'll be road testing the rest of them - United, Delta and Southwest. Now, what happens if you merge Angry Birds with Lego? We'll show you after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Markets across Europe rallied on this Wednesday's trading session. If you take a look at the number, you'll see exactly the strong performance. Two percent up on the Xetra DAX, 1 and 3/4 is in Paris. In London it was the governor of the Bank of England - Mark Carney - who's addressing the financial finest tonight, calling for the tougher measures against bankers who are found to have been broken the law at the city's speech. Shares in Standard Chartered are up 4 percent. After a challenging few years, the new chief exec Bill Winters says he will make banks' capital strength his priority. The company behind Angry Birds is hoping to turn its fortunes around as it signs a deal with Lego to make irritable, avian toys. The toy release is scheduled to coincide with the release of (LAUGHTER) - \"Happy Birds,\" the movie next year. [16:50:07] The chief executive of Rovio joined me earlier and I asked him, looking at the partnership, why bring Angry Birds and Lego together? What's at the heart of it?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>PEKKA RANTALA, CEO, ROVIO: Lego is all about innovation and creativity and so it's Angry Birds. So that's what we share in common. On the other hand, Lego is endorsing that creativity from construction perspective, whereas I think our entry point is a joyful destruction. On the other hand, Lego is a very much physical, good space experience and the Angry Birds, we are very digital native brand. So bringing digital and physical together, I think together we can have something that's - some magic for the consumers.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, well that's the core - bringing digital and physical together.</p><p>RANTALA: Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST: But when you bring digital and physical together, what are you left with? Pieces of Lego that look like Angry Birds? Because that's not terribly imaginative. So what's the end product going to look like?</p><p>RANTALA: Well of course this means in practice that next spring 2016, Lego will launch throughout their entire worldwide distribution Lego products based on the Angry Birds movie characters and all around the world, you know, ranging all relevant price points. So they are Lego blocks based on Angry Birds characters. But of course at the same time like I said, so we are looking forward at the ways we can combine the digital and the physical experience and we are, I said, hatching some cool things for the consumers in practice --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>RANTALA: -- so that they can have a journey between physical and digital world.</p><p>QUEST: Is it fair to say - as I'm putting together some Lego - I never was very good at this. Is it fair to say -</p><p>RANTALA: You need to practice.</p><p>QUEST: Well, thank you. Yes. Is it fair to say that this is not exactly an experiment, it's going to be a learning curve for both of you because of the nature - the different nature - of the two companies - one physical, one digital?</p><p>RANTALA: Well first of all, you know, we've been in talks for a long, long time and I think the deciding (ph) point was that when the Lego executives saw the really raw and unfinished version of our upcoming feature film, so they got so excited that we decided that now is the right time to go onboard and start this partnership. So we've been preparing this for quite a long time. So I think that we will - in other words, we don't want to practice too much when we go towards our fans. So I think that we are going to have something that really feels really real and great and is a great experience from the very beginning. But of course it's a journey when these two companies we now start to partner. We are looking forward to have a long-term partnership and I'm sure that the years will bring with them of course new experiences.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: That's Lego and Angry Birds. One piece of news to bring you coming in while we've been on-air. S&amp;P has downgraded Greece's credit rating further into junk territory. It's now - it's only gone down by one notch from Triple C Plus, now it's at Triple C. And the outlook is negative and if I just tell you the reason why they say, according to the S&amp;P press release, \"Greece's delaying its payment to the IMF appears to demonstrate the Greek government is prioritizing pension and other domestic spendings over its debt obligations. We've lowered our long-term sovereign credit to Triple C.\" Not a huge move - Triple C Plus to Triple C - but it is an indication that Greece's actions in deciding to bundle payments as it did at the beginning of the month, has had a repercussion. In other words, now the ratings agency put them on guard. Now other news, by all accounts Google Glass was an epic flop - not for everyone. It turns out they have medical uses with Google Glass and there are applications that are helping sufferers of Parkinson's disease.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Parkinson's is a movement disorder. I was diagnosed in 2003. With Parkinson's, all of your movements and in fact everything about your body becomes constricted. For me, everything slows down. When I would be walking on the sidewalk, I would feel like I was walking through mud or quicksand. They have developed an app for Google Glass and it consists of a little screen and this plastic piece that you put on and they give you little visuals to follow. I took it out for a walk and it's great for a walk because the person who was demonstrating the walk - she's walking and you walk along with her and then she - then the screen disappears and the music just keeps looping when you're walking because walking to music is very helpful and it keeps you in a certain gait and you don't slow down.</p><p>[16:55:01] UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Anthropedi (ph) offers free specialized dance classes for people with Parkinson's. All of the strategies that dancers use to move and to control their movement and maintain balance and control their flexibility and use a wide range of imaginative tools to initiate movement. All of those tools can be useful for people with Parkinson's. As a teacher, it's impossible for me to be with each individual student once they leave the studio. Google Glass is in many ways the perfect technology for translating the information that we try to get across in class into people's everyday lives.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The exercise is really imperative to combat almost any kind of ill health, but with Parkinson's it's particularly necessary because of the tendency of the body to constrict - just sort of twist in on itself. I think probably the visual keeps you honest in terms of the extent to which you put your all into an exercise. The dancers are so well trained and they do it so beautifully you want to imitate them. And when you imitate them, you're doing the exercise better.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Magnificent. A \"Profitable Moment\" is after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's \"Profitable Moment.\" Today Sir Tim Clark brought the Gulf 3 fight right into the heart of American aviation.

I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, August 7th, your top stories, right now, just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">China trade turmoil once again, top story, China Central Bank setting its Yuan rate above the symbolic seven level, but still not at a low, not seen since 2008, what it all means for trade talks as the battle shifts a bit from tariffs to currency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets, this morning, continuing a firmer trade, adding to yesterday's gains, take a look. We're expecting a higher opening from the Dow Industrials today, better than 100 points. We've got earnings to take a look at. Disney reporting record revenue, but profit did take a hit and theme park attendance, actually, declined. We've got more on that, plus the details on Disney streaming service as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Donald Trump headed to Dayton and El Paso, the president will meet with victims' families and first responders. There is a controversy as the president clashes with Democrats this morning, MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>We've got a big show this morning, joining the conversation, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, former U.S. Army Special Operations and strategic adviser at WhiteFox Defense, Brett Velicovich and CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell. Big show, lots to talk about this morning.</p><p>Also on deck this morning, top tiered PGA Tour golfer, four-time major tournament winner, he's the number one right now, Brooks Koepka is here to talk about the big business of golf, ahead of the playoffs there.</p><p>World Bank Group president, David Malpass is here on trade, and then, Bill Clinton's former chief of staff and McLarty Associates chairman, Mack McLarty joining us, to talk 2020, and Hawaii congressman 2020 presidential candidate, Tulsi Gabbard is here. We'll talk in Google, doubling down on Senator Kamala Harris, and 2020, a lot to come. Don't miss the three hours right here, as we kick it off.</p><p>And we are looking at markets this morning, firmer tone, actually, 102 points higher on the Dow Industrials, S&amp;P up 11-1/2, NASDAQ up almost 50 points. All three major averages rebounded yesterday on fading trade and currency fears, Beijing and Washington still in a trade stalemate, with China reportedly digging in for a drawn-out fight, pretty good market yesterday, Lindsey, your reaction?</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: Yes, I mean, I'm actually surprised the market is taking everything that we've learned through the last couple of days in such good stride. Again, today, like you said at the top of the show, you see the Yuan being weakened.</p><p>It has been weakened each in the last couple of days, not to the extent that we saw on Sunday night which sent the market into knee-jerk reaction.</p><p>But, I think, what we're seeing here is that these two countries are in it for the long haul and I don't expect us to have any resolution before the end of the year, and my biggest fear, so we go to a point of no return, where we go too far and the economic impact around the global is really too far to come back from.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It certainly will stoke uncertainty, Dagen, which you've talked about so much.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. Uncertainty that a Federal Reserve can't fix, I mean, uncertainty is the greatest enemy of business investment decisions, I'm stealing a quote, I think it's the head of titan steel who was quoted in the Wall Street Journal saying that last week.</p><p>But, again, in a market, and I'm not talking about just the U.S. market, but in markets and economies that are -- markets overvalued, priced for perfection and economies that are highly leveraged and companies, in many instances, that are deeply indebted as well. It doesn't take much in that scenario to trigger, kind of, an irrational panic --</p><p>BRETT VELICOVICH, STRATEGIC ADVISER AT WHITEFOX DEFENSE: Right, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- and maybe, I don't think any panics are rational, but it doesn't take much and the reason -- I'll point this out, yesterday, the reason that investors were so concerned about this sudden drop in the Yuan and other Asian currencies like the Yuan, is because of the dollar- denominated debts that are outside those countries.</p><p>You have entities, banks, particularly in South Korea, that will then try to repay those debts with a devalued currency, with a cheaper currency, that in and of itself, could trigger a financial crisis and the domino effect around the world, so the stability and the currency was critical.</p><p>VELICOVICH: Right, right. I do think that the market probably overreacted, definitely, with concerns that this trade war would escalate to a global currency war. And while the Chinese may be OK with a trade war, at least, now, and digging in.</p><p>What they definitely don't want is a global currency war because, you know, in the end, it could hurt their own -- their own country citizens, they can make it so, obviously, they have less purchasing power overseas.</p><p>And one thing Xi Jinping does not need right now are more people within his country, angry at him, and that could potentially hurt, you know, the Chinese economy (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: But, I mean, they were devaluing their currency before the U.S. called them out, right?</p><p>VELICOVICH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, devaluing their currency, so --</p><p>VELICOVICH: But that doesn't necessarily always work when you devalue your currency, right? Because, you know, in the end, it spells long-term trouble potentially for the Chinese government and the Chinese economy.</p><p>And I think we did see them blink here, and the reason the market bounced back was -- what we saw that they tried to stabilize the currency and make it -- then basically reassure investors that everything was going to be OK and that they didn't specifically want a currency war to take place.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, they're trying to prevent a capital flight out of the nation. That's what China cannot afford. And Xi Jinping, to your point, is in -- and we talked about this yesterday, Xi Jinping is in a position where he might -- he really can't negotiate with President Trump coming up on this 75th anniversary, I think it's in October of the People's Republic, that major anniversary for communist China, that -- that's --</p><p>Because I know that you talked about this yesterday, that when are we going to get a trade deal, it could be after the election, because in the short run, that neither one of these men, these leaders, have a lot of negotiating power.</p><p>VELICOVICH: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Room to give, so to speak.</p><p>VELICOVICH: And Xi Jinping has a strong man image to protect, I mean, he thinks in dynasties, right, centuries, we think -- we tend to think in years, so he has a strong man image to protect as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and for sure. All right, then we've got earnings to talk about, Disney's profit dip, the company reporting disappointing third quarter numbers yesterday. Missing on earnings per share, and revenue, the 21st Century Fox acquisition is cited as one of the reasons for the miss.</p><p>CEO Bob Iger says that costs related to Disney's upcoming streaming service, would weigh on the company, what's your reaction here, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: That one of the things that hurt -- that dragged on Disney's results was the -- again, like you said, the acquisition of these Fox assets and Bob Iger started the call saying that it was the most complicated in his 14-year tenure as CEO. That's not good.</p><p>Can you get -- again, these are assets, these are film assets and entertainment assets on the Fox side that had been lagging this year. They will rebound, but it kind of goes to the point that the entertainment business is very cyclical. And that investors, I think, are really waiting until the streaming service comes out later this year.</p><p>That's the way that Disney will ultimately be able to monetize of the eldest content that it's acquired and owned and monetized all these entertainment assets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: If I had to make a bet, I would be betting on Disney, I mean, I know Netflix has been super successful, but Disney has got incredible libraries after all of those acquisitions that it's done in the last decade.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>BELL: Well, no, I think you're absolutely right. But the only concern for the near term is this is a stock that's up 30 percent year-to-date, right? And, you know, Bob Iger also made the comment on his call that it's going to take a couple of years for those streaming services to turn around just like Netflix and some of the others.</p><p>They are spending a lot of money to invest in this portion of the business, to make it grow and this is what investors are betting on. They might be disappointed.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here's the kicker, and Disney said this yesterday, Disney Plus, which as stand-alone, is going to cost 6.99 a month. Disney Plus will come in a bundle, along with ESPN Plus and Hulu for 12.99, 12.99 a month that is the same price as Netflix most popular subscription plan. You know what Netflix doesn't have, live sports.</p><p>VELICOVICH: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's what you get with that -- with that bundle. That is a very competitive price and that is a very attractive option.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Highest premium -- probably the most important intellectual property on television, live sports.</p><p>VELICOVICH: Sure, sure, but Iger did say on this call that this was the most important product the company has launched since his tenure. So, you can see how big of a deal it is for them to release a streaming service. And then, the other thing is that they have to scale it very quickly, OK?</p><p>Consumers are about to be inundated with more and more of these streaming services, these paid to play things and I think he believes he's got to go quick, he's got to scale it very, very fast, otherwise, he's going to get beaten by some of these other networks.</p><p>BELL: Well, for the same price as Netflix, you're getting less content. But to the point, it's like, people are going to pay for the sports and if you're a parent, the Disney, you know, all the different -- their assets there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You get Star Wars and sports for 12.99 a month, and that's not even including Hulu. Who can turn that down?</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I've owned all of the streaming services at one point or another.</p><p>VELICOVICH: Right, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very competitive.</p><p>VELICOVICH: After a while, it seems like it gets more expensive than a cable bundle. Once you start seeing all of these --</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I don't have a cable. I shouldn't say owned, I've rented these streaming services.</p><p>VELICOVICH: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: President Trump headed to Dayton and El Paso today to talk with victims' families days after the mass shootings in those cities, the president making the trip despite protests for some Democrats, including 2020 presidential candidate and El Paso native, Beto O'Rourke and Texas Congresswoman Veronica Escobar.</p><p>President Trump tweeted on Beto O'Rourke last night. The president said this, Beto, phony name to indicate Hispanic heritage, O'Rourke, who is embarrassed by my last visit to the great state of Texas, where I trounced him, and is now even more embarrassed by polling at one percent in the Democrat primary, should respect the victims and law enforcements and be quiet. What a tweet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Beto O'Rourke it -- his -- jump -- him jumping on this issue, it looks like that he is trying to benefit, politically, from these murders in El Paso, quite frankly, and that's the way it looks, not just the president, but it looks that way to many people.</p><p>VELICOVICH: It's embarrassing. It's so disheartening to see these commentators on the left, basically say that the president of the United States is not welcome in Ohio or --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's just disgusting, you're right.</p><p>VELICOVICH: -- in El Paso. It's embarrassing. And the president has time and time again, repeatedly, forcefully denounced hate and basically called for bipartisan support to help fix this issue, and he's already proven -- he's got a proven track record of doing something about this. After Las Vegas, people called for bump stocks to be banned.</p><p>He put out legislation that banned bump stocks, so he's waiting for people to guide him and tell him what to do so he can help get this fixed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We talked about this yesterday. And, Dagen, you said -- you made the point that the president has done more, in terms of these shootings, from the bump stocks to talk about background checks, than President Obama has done, ever, certainly in his two terms.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They also, in a bipartisan move in Congress, they've tried to close the loopholes and the National Background Check System. Because, again, it was after the Sutherland Springs shooting in Texas, that murderer had had a court martial related to -- a court martial related to domestic violence that the Air Force didn't report into the background check system.</p><p>So, again, I think you have to step back and look at, is the government enforcing the laws as they are on the books right now?</p><p>One big thing that will happen, I think, is that Congress will move forward on, at least, laying the ground work for national red flag laws or national -- what -- they have many names, but gun violence restraining orders where law enforcement and or a family member can go to a court and get an order to remove a weapon or weapons from an individual's home or person.</p><p>VELICOVICH: Extreme risk protection.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's what they are also called. It's very tricky. You have to be careful about due process. But I do think that you will see something happen. Lindsey Graham has teamed up with Richard Blumenthal in Connecticut. Connecticut was the first state in the country in 1999 to have these orders in place. And so, I think that this is something that you will see happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You would think that both sides could together on something like this. I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're really complicated. I encourage people to read about them. They're extremely complicated, but I think that if you get some, sort of, standard, Lindsey Graham and Blumenthal are not even talking about a federal red flag law.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're talking about grants to these states in order to implement them. That shows less government overreach.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's take a quick break. We want to take a look at earnings in markets this morning, but this quick break, and then taking on big tech, President Trump slams Google over alleged political bias, what he said and what he wants done, straight ahead on that.</p><p>And then, SpaceX success, the company's Falcon 9 rocket taking off, three years after the first one exploded, back in a minute with a lot to come. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, Iran issuing a new stern warning, Cheryl Casone on headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria, in a speech broadcast live on state television, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said that peace with Iran is the mother of peace, war with Iran is the mother of all war. He also had this warning for shipping in the Strait of Hormuz.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HASSAN ROUHANI, PRESIDENT OF IRAN (through translator): If you want safety for your soldiers in the region, security would be for security, you cannot blemish our security and then expect security for you, peace for peace, oil for oil.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: This comes as tensions between Iran and the U.S. continue to rise, following President Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement and re-imposition of sanctions. Rouhani, accusing the U.S. of engaging an economic terrorism, but he says he is willing to talk with the U.S. if all sanctions are lifted.</p><p>Well, more Walgreens stores are closing, the company shutting down 200 locations. The announcement just after Walgreens announced closing 200 Boots locations over in the U.K. They also said the closings are part of a move to increase their operational efficiency. The stock is down more than 20 percent, year to date.</p><p>An impressive video from SpaceX to show you, Elon Musk Space Company launched its Falcon 9 rocket into orbit on Tuesday. Video shows a drone ship which captures the rocket's fairing, which is part of protective cover that breaks off and it falls back to the earth after the rocket leaves the atmosphere.</p><p>But, again, Elon Musk, actually doing pretty well, Maria, when it comes to SpaceX and these rocket launches. Things are turning around, it seems, for him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure he is. Cheryl, thank you so much. I want to talk Iran for a second, Brett, your thoughts on this new stern warning coming from Iran?</p><p>VELICOVICH: Well, it's just more of the same from the world's largest exporter of terrorism. With Iran, it's all about rhetoric, you have to watch what they do and not what they say, necessarily, but the fact is, they are covertly at war with us and they've been covertly at war with us for years. They do this through their proxy forces.</p><p>They just recently captured another tanker in the Gulf, supposedly smuggling oil. They're trying to tend almost as if they are the good guys all of the sudden, when really they're there to stoke chaos, stoke violence and hurt the U.S.</p><p>And so, the one -- there's a few things I worry about when it comes to Iran, recently, I worry that China may start buying their oil and potentially give them an outlet to help boost their economy a bit, China's trying to form these new alliances particularly with the trade war.</p><p>And the other thing I worry about is recent legislation where Democrats seem to be trying to weaken our ability to defend ourselves against Iran, because they are taking away the president's war powers to be able to act quickly, unilaterally, and do something at a moment's notice at a time when it's needed the most.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But if we are attacked first, the president doesn't need to check with Congress.</p><p>VELICOVICH: They're trying to basically take away the AUMF, the Authorization for Use of Military Force. He's going to have to work with Congress to do that. Now, I do believe in that legislation it does say that if we are attacked first, they can do something, but they seem to be weakening our ability to defend ourselves and I really -- I'm really concerned about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and it's certainly is concerning to see this accelerate.</p><p>VELICOVICH: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Really quickly, you know what would weaken our ability to really defend ourselves against Iran on the national stage, is green -- a Green New Deal and moving to fossil -- moving away from fossil fuels. Again, the rest of the world uses fossil fuels and Iran is one of the biggest producers, we are the biggest producer in the world.</p><p>But again, you move away from that, you remove your ability to control the price of oil, which we now have in our -- basically, as a weapon, and you weaken us on the world stage. That's something that the Democrats don't talk about when they're talking about going into electric cars and flying birds to the west coast.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Literal birds.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oil at 53.40 this morning, unlike sweet crude. Quick break, and then, permission not granted, Twitter warning users their data may have been used for ads without an OK, the fallout coming up. Plus, market rally, stocks are rebounding after Monday's selloff.</p><p>We are looking at gains this morning, and the momentum continues. We've got the outlook ahead of the opening bell when we come right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, markets are bouncing back, they certainly bounced back yesterday, after sharp losses on Monday, the meltdown, of course, heightened by U.S.-China trade tensions. Yesterday, Dow Industrials were up 311 points, and this morning, that momentum continues.</p><p>Joining us right now is Russell Investment senior portfolio manager, Kevin Divney, and Kevin, it's great to see you this morning, thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>KEVIN DIVNEY, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, RUSSELL INVESTMENT: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How did you react to that big selloff on Monday? As portfolio manager, did you buy into it or stepped aside?</p><p>DIVNEY: We were already positioned knowing that the shock of a (INAUDIBLE) event was heightened this summer, so we've been very neutral between, say, growth and value and cyclical and defensive, going into earning season, we want to see how that came out.</p><p>We're, sort of, trying to balance the line between being very cyclical and defensive here, but now, in an environment where its trade policy versus monetary policy. And the market really isn't processing earnings results yet. I think that's what we are looking through at the end of August, when does that start to get priced in?</p><p>Not concerned from valuation level, the S&amp;P 500 is about at fair value today, if you look at price to book versus returns on capital. And the earnings season has been relatively positive. We knew it was going to decelerate, but the margins have been pretty intact, record profit margins are staying there, and that's something we are looking for going into 2020.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, go through what happened last night, in terms of monetary policy.</p><p>DIVNEY: Well, we had three other cuts in Asia, so now you see policy makers reacting to deceleration.</p><p>And what is interesting and some people are calling it a three dimensional chess game between the administration and the Fed right now, is that they're trying to back them into a corner to continue to cut, to do these stimulative actions because of the trade policy, potentially amplifying already a decelerating global economy.</p><p>We see that in Europe, the PMIs are below 50. The concerns in Asia, what's going on, and this, sort of, tailwind we have here is really just the U.S. consumer here in the U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Dagen, you said earlier, and have been saying for a while, interest rate cuts are not going to save you out of where we are right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Not where to the point that we've gotten the escalation of this fight because, again, a trade war has now have turned into what looks like a currency war, maybe not -- maybe not in the last day or so, but, again, how much juice, because we've already had longer-term interest rates falling since last year. And you have these incredibly attractive mortgage rates.</p><p>How much juice would a short-term cut provide, in terms of lending and in terms of lower -- and, you know, and how much -- how much would it benefit Americans.</p><p>DIVNEY: The benefit would be material if it was with corporate investment, because we have seen that slowed down and that is really because of visibility and confidence because of these policy actions that have been taken.</p><p>So, if there's more clarification on the policy side that spurs investment, but also just with lower interest rates, that is something that could help spurs investment.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But you won't get the corporate investment without the clarity on trade policy.</p><p>DIVNEY: Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So that means that an interest rate cut would do --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and look at 10-year, though, I mean, 1.7 percent on the 10-year yield, that is extraordinary.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's lowest it's been since before President Trump was elected.</p><p>DIVNEY: It broke 170 yesterday, the yield-curve inversion is another cause of concern, I think, you know, weeks back, when it converted, people are calling it a technical now if it stays inverted, if you go back to 1969, usually there's a recession 304 days after the yield curve staying there.</p><p>So, the capital markets are telling us deceleration, you know, the tension we've had, really pose crisis at the capital markets, tend to be vigilantes by forcing policymakers into a corner and that's really not the best way for policymakers to be taking action.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you said earnings and backdrops still pretty good. Lindsey, what are the numbers, right now? How are we looking on the second quarter reporting season?</p><p>BELL: Second quarter, like you said, has been very good. We are looking at 1-1/2 percent growth. We're looking for down two percent going into the earnings season. Second half numbers have come down, but my worry is 2020 expectations for over 11 percent earnings growth, like you said, we are seeing a deceleration, economically, around the globe. What happens to those numbers going forward?</p><p>DIVNEY: The 2019 numbers have come down. A lot of the line for 2020 is still out there, so the guidance is really, really important. And that would be the concern. The good news or the, sort of, safety net right now is that the market's not incredibly expensive and that's the one thing that is, sort of, a haven for equity investors right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Kevin, it's great to have you. Thanks so much.</p><p>DIVNEY: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kevin Divney joining us there. We'll take a break. When we come back -- well, first, let me tell you about President Trump just tweeted. He said this just a moment ago. South Korea has agreed to pay substantially more money to the United States in order to defend itself from North Korea.</p><p>Over the past many decades, the U.S. has been paid very little by South Korea. But last year, at the request of President Trump, South Korea paid $990 million. Talks have begun to further increase payments to the United States.</p><p>South Korea is a very wealthy nation that now feels an obligation to contribute to the military defense provided by the United States of America. The relationship between the two countries is a very good one, writes the president this morning.</p><p>We'll take a break. When we come back, the president takes on big technology, slamming Google for alleged political bias, what he wants done coming up. And then hitting the road, Amazon self-driving robot ready to make first deliveries, where you can find them, straight ahead. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, August 7th. Your top stories right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast. Markets have a firmer tone today. Take a look. Futures showing the markets will add to yesterday's rally up 104 points on the Dow this morning. S&amp;P Futures are up 11 and the Nasdaq Futures up 46.</p><p>Yesterday, the market was able to gain back some of the losses suffered during Monday's big broad sell-off. DowIndustrials were up 311 points yesterday. 1-1/4 percent. S&amp;P was up 37, and the Nasdaq was up 107, 1-1/3 percent yesterday.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. As you just heard, we had a number of interest rate cuts in Asia. In the European markets, you had more signs of a slowdown. Germany reported industrial production fell more than expected in the month of June. It was down 1.5 percent month-over- month.</p><p>Nonetheless, the DAX Index is up 160 points right now, 1-1/3 percent. FT- 100 in London up 60 points, and the CAC Quarante in Paris up 71.</p><p>In Asia overnight, market saw slight losses except for Hong Kong which managed to end on the upside as a Chinese official said that Hong Kong is tracing its worst crisis in 20 years. Because we see that on the streets with all those protesters. And as I mentioned three interest rate cuts in Asia overnight.</p><p>President Trump versus Google. He is doubling down on claims of political bias. He says he's watching the company very closely.</p><p>And then, there is this. Twitter's privacy problems get worse. The company says it may have used user data for ads without permission. What a surprise. The social media is says, it is doing something about it and we will tell you about that.</p><p>Plus this, the future is here. Amazon self-driving robots hitting the road, delivering packages. Find out where. Checkout that robot there.</p><p>And top-ranked golfer Brooks Koepka. We go inside the big business of the PGA and look at how technology is being used to drive the sport forward. He's coming up later this hour. All those stories coming up.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour. Online censorship. President Trump slamming Google and its CEO amid allegations of anti-conservative bias. The president says that the administration is watching Google closely.</p><p>Here is what he told me back in June about tech companies in the 2020 election.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. President, you mentioned technology companies. How concerned are you that technology companies are censoring conservatives, and they are going to do this right up to the 2020 election?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (via telephone): Well they're doing it to me on Twitter. I mean, what they did to me on Twitter is incredible. You know I have a -- you know, millions and millions of followers. But I will tell you, they make it very hard for people to join me in Twitter, and they make it very much harder for me to get out the message.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP: Google was totally biased to the -- you know they talk about Russia because they had some bloggers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, somebody at Google said, they don't want what happened in 2016 to happen in 2010. They don't want it to happen again, right? Is that what you're referring to?</p><p>TRUMP: Oh, shortly did. Let me tell you. They are trying to rig the election. That's what we should be looking at, not that the witch-hunt -- the phony witch-hunt which is proven zero.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. And judge, what you didn't hear in that sound bite -- It's good to see you, by the way.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But what you didn't hear in that sound bite was me saying to the president, do you -- asking him, do you want to see legislation? Or do you just want to see competition on this market?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Now, how did he answer that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he said, we will likely see legislation lead to competition.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, look. You know, I'm a free-market person, and I'm also a First Amendment person. Doesn't matter what I am, the First Amendment is very clear and the courts have been very clear. The government doesn't regulate speech.</p><p>The president's complaints in my view are perfectly legitimate and widely held, and well-grounded. There's no question, but that this is happening. The question is, what remedy can there be?</p><p>Can Congress possibly get involved and say that Google, you have to have more conservative opinions. I mean, the marketplace of ideas regulates speech. The government doesn't regulate speech. But by pushing this the way he is, he will -- he will make a lot of people aware of the fact that they are being subtly manipulated. When they Google something, they're not getting the answer that they're expecting, or they getting an answer that Google wants them to get.</p><p>In the real world, you know, Google weren't worth what it is. And if there weren't the barriers to competition, there'd be another search engine that people that dislike Google and dislike its political manipulation could go to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: But I realized the barriers to entry are extraordinary. We would require a fortune to establish something that could compete with Google.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, Google has a 90 percent market share. I take it in terms of search. And you remember during 2016, and we were sitting here, we went to all the conventions and we were covering the election.</p><p>You Googled anything about Hillary Clinton, you got great, beautiful news.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She was the best thing since sliced bread. You did the same thing for Donald Trump at that time, and it was, he's terrible, he's horrible, he's -- all negative stories. So, they did do that during 2016.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, the more the president points this out, the more consumers should be aware of what's going on. But I fear -- and people who believe in the freedom of speech should fear any effort by the government to tell Google how to run its business, and what speech it should advance, and what speech it should not advance. That's going to be done by the marketplace of ideas, state it differently.</p><p>If people feel about Google the way the president does, they shouldn't use it and they should go somewhere else and some other search engine will (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: You don't have a choice, though. You don't -- you don't have a choice, though.</p><p>BARTIROMO: 90 percent market share.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But you don't have a choice. You know, if you put a search query into the taskbar of your Apple Safari browser on your iPhone, it is Google.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What you don't -- you do not have a choice in terms of -- you don't have a choice of who serves ads to all the web sites that you visit on the Internet. That two-thirds of the ads are served by Google and Facebook, roughly.</p><p>BELL: We also (INAUDIBLE) with social media companies: Facebook, Twitter and the like. You start -- they start to understand what you like and what you're interested and they keep feeding you that news.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right. Yes, yes.</p><p>BELL: So you're not getting the other side of the conversation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, there's also the privacy issue in terms of that as well. Look I got to get to Peter Strzok. Because the former --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes, I just read the complaint for you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The former -- I'm sorry?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I just read the complaint for you this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, good. The former FBI agent is suing the bureau and the Justice Department over his dismissal now. He claims the agencies violated his First and Fifth Amendment rights.</p><p>No mention of what rights he meant -- he broke when he spied on Donald Trump, but go ahead.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I would like to be president at his deposition. His examination before trial, where they go into all kinds of things about his own personal background. Here is his argument. He legitimately was reviewed by the aspect of the group in the FBI that hears complaints about senior FBI members and that group which is a non-political group that's been doing it for years and years and years, he gave the names, they're not names that any of us would recognize. Decided that his behavior did not warrant being fired.</p><p>He then was fired and given you what he says happened to him. He then was fired because he expressed political opinions about the president. So, his argument is I was punished for exercising political speech which is protected under the First Amendment, and the FBI people that reviewed my behavior decided not to fire me, and I wasn't allowed an appeal which under the civil service law is he is entitled to.</p><p>Prediction, there'll be some kind of monetary settlement here. Nobody wants a case like this to go -- to go to trial. He doesn't want all of his background, as I said, kiddingly, I'd like to be present at the deposition. He doesn't want to have to answer all those questions under oath: Did you say this? Did you say this? Did you do that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: What did you tell FISA? He doesn't want to go through that. Right. And he appeared he doesn't want to go through that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I just say no mention of the abuse -- no mention of the abuse around the FISA Court.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Of course, not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, that's comments.</p><p>VELICOVICH: He deliberately sabotage the president of the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>VELICOVICH: He's a counterintelligence professional that should know better.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: of course -- of course.</p><p>VELICOVICH: You should not -- you know, intertwined political dissent in your thoughts who is -- if you're a counterintelligence professional. That is sabotage by definition, and that's a criminal offense if you're in the intelligence community.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, that's why I don't think those will be tried. To be settled probably with some financial settlement.</p><p>It's interesting what he's asking for. A return -- I can't imagine this happening now. A return to the position that he had at the time he was fired with an increase in pay.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, right. Because he did such a good job in that role.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because he can't get a job at MSNBC. Was that why?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's probably the next step. This whole story is so troubling.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And more is coming out. We're expecting the I.G. report around September. And, of course, Lindsey Graham's deep dive into the FISA abuse comments as well. Judge, it's really good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Pleasure, guys. All the best.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Judge Napolitano there. Coming up, Twitter privacy issues. The company admitting that it may have used data for ads without user permission. Details coming up.</p><p>VELICOVICH: Surprise.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then the view from the top. I sat down with pro golfer, Brooks Koepka, yesterday. Talked golf and technology and life as the number one golfer in the world. That's coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. North Korea issuing a new warning about this latest missile test. Cheryl Casone on headlines now. Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, that's right, Maria. North Korea launched another missile yesterday. This is the fourth in less than two weeks.</p><p>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, said that the test launches are a warning to the United States and to South Korea over this joint military drills that began this week. Now, North Korea says that Kim supervised a live fire demonstration of newly developed short-range ballistic missiles.</p><p>Well, Twitter has revealed that it may have shared certain data without permission. Users to have clicked on ads since May 2018 may have had personal data send to Twitter's partners. Company reportedly also used data for personalized ads without getting an OK. Twitter said that it's working to make sure this never happens again.</p><p>And then, now to Amazon. The self-driving delivery robot scout, you may have seen him if you're in Seattle. Well, they'll going to another neighborhood.</p><p>The six-wheel robots are going to begin delivering packages in Irvine, California. Amazon begin testing robots in a suburb of Seattle at the beginning of this year. Now, the company says that scouts will be delivering orders Monday to Friday and only during the day.</p><p>So, I guess, Maria, if you're a robot, you just don't want to work on weekends.</p><p>You know what -- you know, but OK, got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like that. I want to use one of those. I think they look cool.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, it's because you need a person there to answer the calls and deal with the -- when the robot gets lost or wounds up with the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's a need for people, still.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's good. We like that. Quick break, and then sitting down with number one, my chat with pro golfer, Brooks Koepka, we talked technology golf -- what it's like to rule the green. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, Tiger Woods may still be the top draw but Brooks Koepka is the top golfer in the world. Both PGA superstars taking their town's Jersey City, New Jersey this week, for the first leg of the FedEx Cup Playoffs. I caught up with Koepka at Liberty National Golf Club yesterday where the big tournament will take place.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: You are a very special individual and a special athlete, let's talk about that, number one in the world, four major titles in three seasons, how do you feel about all of this?</p><p>BROOKS KOEPKA, PROFESSIONAL GOLFER: It's awesome. I want a good run right now. You know, it's kind of one of those things where you do don't want it to end, eventually it's going to. It's going to slow down but, you know, I'm enjoying the moment, I'm enjoying where I'm at and trying to make, you know, an impact and it's been a lot of fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you stay there? Tell me that. I know that this is partly mental, it's partly physical, but how do you stay number one? What's going through your head right now?</p><p>KOEPKA: When I first became number one, it was more about -- I just wanted to stay there, you know, that was the goal just to stay there. Yes, and then I lost it and got it back again. And ever since I got it back, it's been one of those things where I'm not trying to push too hard and not trying to put too much pressure on yourself, and you kind of get consumed with it, and that's kind of what I did in the beginning stages of it. But now, it's just relax and go play, still the same game I've played for 25 years now, and nothing has change -- just going to put the ball in the hole.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, is there something that you know that others don't? I mean, you're a champion, so when go out there, you know that you're among the best in the world, hands down. You've got others around you but what do you think about?</p><p>KOEPKA: I don't think about anything, I just go out there and go win, go play the best I can each day and go play the best I can for that week. And you know, even if it comes up short, it comes up short. I gave it my all and there's nothing to be disappointed in if you gave it your all.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How has the game changed? I mean, you've got new ways to show the game on T.V. You've got social media, you've got --</p><p>KOEPKA: Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- technology, tell me how the game has changed from your standpoint?</p><p>KOEPKA: It's crazy. There's so much technology. I really don't even use much of it. I mean, I understand how it all works, you can break it down into just about anything from, you start looking at half degree here from half-degree there, you know, in a full swing and the ball is going 300 yards and it goes off 15 yards off line. And it can get very complicated and you kind of get obsessed with it. I'm the kind of person, when I see those stats, I see the numbers, all of the technology involved in it and I kind of get consumed by it instead of actually going out and go play and just kind of let it come naturally to me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it feels like you don't put that pressure on yourself. You always say it's just golf -- you go out there and what's most important is you're feeling relaxed.</p><p>KOEPKA: Yes, that's all growth. I mean, it's just a game at the end of the game at the end of the day. We're still having fun. I'm still having as much fun as I did when I was a 5-year-old kid, 10-year-old kid not making any money or not playing for major championships. It's still a game for me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you grew up with it?</p><p>KOEPKA: Yes, that's what makes the fun. You know, I grew up playing with my family and then obviously, you know, you start competing against guys a little bit older you, guys your age and then you get out here and then it becomes very real.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, here we are at the beginning of the playoffs, you say winning major events championships is easier than regular events?</p><p>KOEPKA: Yes, I think so. That's a little too much pressure on themselves. You figure this on, there are 50 guys who said it were -- you know, a lot of them, they just want to win. And then, mentally, some of them just aren't strong enough and then from there, you've got a few that will play good. So, you only have to beat a certain amount of guys and guys just mentally get in their own way a lot of times.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, go back to your most recent huge win, a huge amount of opportunities comes your way with that right? Endorsements. How do you decide?</p><p>KOEPKA: Yes, I mean, obviously, I start to partner up with brands that kind of go along the same viewpoints that I have. I think that it's fun; we get to meet so many different people. Golf is a game that everyone loves to play and you get them out there in the golf course for five hours and you really get to know somebody. So, it's been fun dealing with sponsors and dealing with different partnerships and meeting a bunch of people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Golfing has become really big business. I mean, I know it just didn't happen that way but it's happened over several years. Do you feel it as a player, do you feel it as the number one?</p><p>KOEPKA: Yes, yes, a little bit. You know, you've got certain obligations you got to stick to and it's fun, each year seems to grow and grow as far as who you can meet, who you can bring into the game and that's what -- that's what I think everybody loves about this game: you see a lot of other athletes even when they're done playing they want to come in and play golf.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's funny because they're strong from other sports but they really love golf.</p><p>KOEPKA: Yes, you know, we watch them all of the time and they end up watching us and all they want to do -- I mean, some of them are golf junkies so it's quite fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You feel like you didn't get treated and respected by the media; you didn't get your due by the media last time.</p><p>KOEPKA: Yes, I felt it there for a while. If there was a couple of other guys that have done what I've done over the couple of years, it feels like they're -- the dollar bill, (INAUDIBLE) or anything like that. You know, I get it, I get that I'm not on the golf course, not smiling all of the time, not the most approachable on the golf course and, you know, it's one of those things where that's my work. You know, I'm going out there not to please anybody on the golf course, I'm just going out to take care of business. I'm sure a lot of people -- you know, they might enjoy their jobs but at the same time when they're grind in computer, they may not be smiling. That's basically what I'm doing out here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And by the way, that's why you're winning.</p><p>KOEPKA: Yes, exactly. I got to focus on what I got to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You didn't do any equipment deals, tell me about that, why?</p><p>KOEPKA: I just wanted to play with everything that I've got right now in the bag. I think it's nice to keep your options open, nice to have, you know, some company comes out with new driver, a new ball, new wedges, anything like that. I've got the opportunity to go out there and go test it and see if it's going to make my game better.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, the next, what, five months is really important to you, how do you prepare?</p><p>KOEPKA: Yes, I mean, obviously, these few weeks will be important and then from there it's just, you know, I'm happy where I'm at. I'm happy where I'm at. I feel like everything has worked out well, I think that's why I've had so much success over the last few years being able to kind of pick and choose what I'd like to do. So, I hope it stays that way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Karma. You're a good man. Thank you so much for joining me.</p><p>KOEPKA: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. My thanks to the number one golf in the world, Brooks Koepka, more to come on that. Still ahead, I'll sit down with Hawaii Congressman and 2020 hopeful Tulsi Gabbard, she's here in studio to talk big tech and heated competition in the Democratic field.</p><p>Then, Disney earnings in focus this morning. The company sow revenue soared but profits missed estimates. Stock is down 3-1/2 percent this morning. We're talking a look at the new streaming service next hour right here as well as Disney's growth story. MORNINGS WITH MARIA continues next up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks, so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, August 7th. Your top stories right now, just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast. China trade turmoil continues. The China Central Bank setting its yuan rate above the symbolic seven level, but still at a low not seen since 2008. A new number shows the U.S. has collected $63 billion in Chinese tariffs through the month of June.</p><p>Markets this morning are firmer. We're looking at another rally at the start of trading this morning adding to yesterday's gains. Dow Industrials, however, off of the best levels of the morning, up 60 points right now. S&amp;P Futures up six, and NASDAQ Futures up 29. Earnings continuing to come out. You see CVS on your screen right now as we speak.</p><p>Yesterday, the market was able to gain back some of the losses that it suffered during Monday's huge selloff. The Dow Industrials yesterday up 311 points, 1-1/4 percent. The S&amp;P was up 37, the NASDAQ up 107 points, 1- 1/3 percent higher there as well.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. European indices are higher across the board despite more signs of a slowdown. Germany reporting industrial production was down. It was actually down more than expected in the month of June, down 1-1/2 percent month over month. The DAX in Germany.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019080701cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS0-SSX1-JB20-G1X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8024\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 7, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

If nothing else, it was definitely a far cry from two or three months ago when investors could check in on the markets only every few days and not really miss much of anything. But after <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>shocked the world on Tuesday night and the news networks first began reporting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 500 points (then 600 points ... then 800 points), and I, like most market participants, came in Wednesday morning expecting stock market carnage. In our view, the most likely reaction was going to be \"Brexit: The Sequel ,\" where stocks sold off on the uncertainty before finding a bottom in the subsequent days. So, accordingly, our advice Wednesday morning prior to the market opening was to stay calm, take a breath, and get ready to buy the anticipated dip.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But then a funny thing happened and market sentiment seemed to almost immediately flip just as we published our comments, as if a \"Buy \" switch had been thrown somewhere between Washington and Wall Street. Despite all indications prior to the election that the market favored a <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>victory, investors, when finally forced to consider what a <person><nameText>Trump presidency </nameText></person>may actually mean, did not exactly hate the possibilities. The complete 180 \u00b0 turn is perfectly summarized by this email received just prior to the market opening on Wednesday: ...</p><p>SELL EVERYTHING ! THE END IS HERE !! SELL !! SELL !! SELL !! Well ... except Biotech because the risk of price controls is over ! Sell EVERYTHING but Biotech stocks !! Oh , and Financial stocks ! Financial stocks will do very well with less regulation !! Sell everything but Biotechs and Financials ! Of course there's Energy stocks , yeah they will do better with Republicans for sure. OK , we are selling everything EXCEPT Energy , Financials and Biotechs !! I can't sell [the big Tech companies ] though because they will bring all that cash back from overseas now [and maybe invest more of it into their businesses ]... Heck , if these stocks go up , it will drag ALL tech stocks higher. Alright , alright , we are gonna buy more Technology today ! So here is the plan. Sell everything except Technology , Financials , Energy and Biotechs ! But everything else has to go ! Although ... with the GOP controlling all three branches , they might actually get some infrastructure spending passed. That could really push Industrials and Basic Materials higher. OK , new plan-We buy Basic Material stocks , Industrials , Technology , Biotech , Financials and Energy , but nothing else !! Everything else , SELL ! But wait , what if they cut corporate taxes like they promised ? That means more cash for share buy-backs , dividends and capital investment. And , if the GOP cuts taxes for individuals , they will have more for Consumer stocks. Well consumers make up 70 % of the economy ... that will make everything go higher !!!</p><p>NEW PLAN ! BUY EVERYTHING !... BUY ... BUY ... BUY ! Ultimately, not EVERYTHING went up (Technology, for one), but, as we said in the months leading up to the election, there would certainly be areas of the market that would benefit under each outcome and there was not really a scenario that would undermine our long-term bullish thesis. And, yes, the initial market response is a gut-reaction to what should still be considered a \"best case scenario \" for the coming administration, but for the first time in a while it appears investors see a path toward much higher stock prices. Even we, as bullish as we have been, have admitted that while the market likely had a high floor underneath it that would prevent major losses, conditions weren't SO great that we were going to see stocks take off and never look back. There is now at least a better chance that happens.</p><p>Whenever a market rallies on news that is still, at best, a high uncertainty event, it is generally a very bullish sign and implies a strong market. I won't go so far as to call this a rule because no one has ever presented me with a stock market rulebook, but it does lead us to believe the probabilities favor higher prices over the coming months even if we are now a tad overbought in the short term. Also, the fact that we never even got a buyable dip post-election (unless you happen to trade futures), strengthens the argument that stocks want to keep moving higher, in our view.</p><p>Of course, the absence of a selloff left many of our readers feeling disgruntled after they missed the sharp move last week. Our inboxes have been filled with questions from despondent advisors asking if it is too late to buy after the quick rally, but unless the market completely changes its opinion on a <person><nameText>Trump presidency, </nameText></person>the 11 /4 /16 low likely marked an important bottom and any subsequent dips over the coming days should remain above that level. Recall, even though we had been cautious and advised patience in the weeks heading into the election, we also said that the downside would likely be limited to the 3 % -6 % range in the S &amp;; P 500. Well, the move from the previous all-time high in August to the low on 11 /4 ended up being just over 5 %, so there is a good chance that was it and prices can now go higher.</p><p>Keep in mind, though, a <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>presidency is a high risk /high reward scenario, where the eventual results will not be known for some time. There is a chance that things work out very well for the stock market, with a pro-business, Republican majority actually getting things done in Washington, making it easier for companies to run efficiently, and investing in areas of the country that have not recovered since the Great Recession. However, it does likely create some more negative tail risk if the policies don't work, as the combination of less tax revenue and fiscal stimulus could end up doing nothing FUTURE more than increasing the national debt while also bringing about higher inflation that will necessitate rates rising more quickly than they otherwise would have. We have said for two years now that higher rates are not a tremendous concern as long as they move up gradually and are supported by a strengthening economy, but what we don't want is the Federal Reserve to be forced into quickly raising more than expected in order to combat inflation. An outcome such as that could pump the brakes on the bull market and is something to keep in the back of your mind before throwing all caution to the wind.</p><p>There is some long-term technical hope, though, that we could see the next major leg of the secular bull market start soon. The last two years have generally been regarded as quite volatile, and that is true in that we have had a number of quick rallies and dips (nine dips of 5 % or more since October 2014). However, all that volatility has come within a very tight range by historical standards, a point I decided to explore further over the weekend by diving into the data and doing some fun \"spreadsheeting.\" I looked at all the rolling two-year trading ranges in the S &amp;; P 500 going back to 1962 and what I found was quite interesting (by rolling two-year trading range I mean the percentage difference between the highest price and lowest price from 2015-2016, then 2014-2015, then 2013-2014, and so on).</p><p>And, finally, the specific way the market rallied last week is also very promising. There were obviously winners and losers with respect to sectors after the election result, but the rally was not the narrow variety we have experienced the past two years where only a select few stocks were responsible for the gains. The call for this week: We should start to see a return to a more normal trading environment in the coming days, as the election is left in the rear-view mirror and things like the economy and earnings once again become the focus. Remember, our view before the craziness of last week was that, overall, things are \"good enough \" to keep this secular bull market going and we have not wavered on that. It would not surprise us to see some profit-taking in many of the stocks that experienced quick run-ups after the election, but long-term investors should likely leave the selling to the swing traders. Chances are any dips are limited to the 2120-2150 range in the S &amp;; P 500 and those dips should be for buying. And if you are thinking about selling right now, I'll leave you with a quote from Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefevre, which is about as close to a market rulebook as I have ever seen: \"They say you never go broke taking profits. No, you don't. But neither do you grow rich taking a four-point profit in a bull market.\" And we think this is still a bull market.</p><p>Credit : Andrew Adams , CMT , Raymond James Ltd.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 140.48 points, or 0.5 percent, to 27,288.18. The Nasdaq composite climbed 184.84 points, or 1.7 percent, to 10,963.64. The Russell 2000 index of small company stocks picked up 11.71 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,496.96.</p><p>  Tuesday's market rebound has been the exception this month. Wall Street has suddenly lost momentum in September following months of powerful gains that returned the S&amp;P 500 to a record. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is down 5.3 percent so far this month, while the Nasdaq is off nearly 7 percent. A long list of concerns for investors has caused big swings in the market, from worries that stocks have grown too expensive to frustration about Congress' refusal so far to deliver more aid to the struggling economy.</p><p>  ''Right now it's kind of reality is setting in, looking at valuations and realizing that coronavirus is still prevalent, we don't have a vaccine and we don't know who's going to be in the White House in 2021,'' said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest.</p><p>  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pressed Congress to act on additional aid for the economy during a House of Representatives committee hearing Tuesday, saying that the economy appears to be improving, but still likely needs more government stimulus. Extra weekly unemployment benefits and other stimulus that Congress approved in March have expired, and some areas of the economy have already slowed as a result.</p><p>  That support from Congress, along with unprecedented moves by the Federal Reserve to aid markets, helped halt the S&amp;P 500's nearly 34 percent plummet earlier this year. Investors say it's crucial that Congress extended more support, but partisan disagreements have blocked the efforts.</p><p>  The sudden vacancy on the Supreme Court following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is amping up partisanship across the country, diminishing hopes even further.</p><p>  Among other concerns for investors are rising tensions between the United States and China, which could lead to a Chinese retaliation against U.S tech companies, as well as the upcoming U.S. elections and all the changes in tax policy and regulations they can create.</p><p>  All those factors combined to knock the S&amp;P 500 down as much as 2.7 percent on Monday.</p><p>  The uneasy trading continued early Tuesday as stock indexes swung from small gains to losses through the morning before steadying by afternoon. Tech stocks in the S&amp;P 500 bounced between a gain of 1.7 percent and a loss of 0.4 percent, for example.</p><p>  Big Tech stocks have lost momentum this month on worries their stocks grew too expensive following a supersonic run through the pandemic. Apple, Amazon and others have benefited from the pandemic because it's accelerated work-from-home and other trends that boost their profits.</p><p>  Tech stocks added to their gains Tuesday after a late-afternoon turnaround a day earlier. Apple gained 1.6 percent while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose 2.4 percent. Amazon climbed 5.7 percent.</p><p>  Traders also bid up shares in homebuilders after the National Association of Realtors said that sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose 2.4 percent in August to their highest level since 2006. Sales are up 10.5 percent from a year ago and back to pre-COVID-19 levels of early 2020.</p><p>  Among the biggest gainers was builder D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI) , which rose 4.7 percent.</p><p>  Stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the strength of the economy clawed back some of their sharp losses from the day before, but their movements were also erratic.</p><p>Norwegian Cruise Line climbed 2.3 percent. Energy stocks in the S&amp;P 500 rose as much as 1.6 percent in the first 20 minutes of trading, only to give all the gains away.</p><p>  European stocks recovered some of their steep losses from Monday, which were triggered in part by worries that stricter restrictions on businesses may be on the way to stem a resurgence of coronavirus cases.</p><p>  U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday announced a package of new restrictions, including requiring pubs and restaurants to close between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m, but analysts said they were less extreme than some investors worried.</p><p>Germany's DAX returned 0.4 percent, though it's still down 4 percent for the week so far. France's CAC 40 fell 0.4 percent, and the FTSE 100 in London fell 0.4 percent.</p><p>  In Asia, South Korea's Kospi fell 2.4 percent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1 percent and stocks in Shanghai sank 1.3 percent.</p><p>  Treasury yields dipped, and the 10-year yield fell to 0.67 percent from 0.68 percent late Monday.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-556041200923</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X1-2TJ1-DXY4-X0BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"878\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/business/23markets.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/business/23markets.html</url><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 23, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>US Federal Reserve System</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwQTBCNEI1REYxNDExMDgzQzVBNTc4NzgwN0YzQzg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTEzMzQzODVBMzEzNDczMEE1ODM5N0REMTc3QzFDMkI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Meanwhile monetary policy is quietly normalising.  Symbolic developments in Asia include the incorporation of Chinese A-shares into the MSCI Emerging Market indices and the opening of the Bond Connect programme, both of which further demonstrate the ongoing integration of China into world markets.  I spent much of last week talking about the fourth industrial revolution in Robotics and Automation, something that has become a true cross sector and cross border thematic. Indeed it is difficult to think of any growth company not somehow exposed to this theme.</p><p><br/><br/>A quiet week in markets thanks to US holidays and the onset of (Northern hemisphere) summer gives us time to look back at the first half of 2017 and also to look further ahead at what is increasingly being referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution in Automation and Robotics, a cross-border cross-sector theme that we believe will come to dominate growth investing.  <br/>Looking back as we pass the half year mark, the contrarian plays from the end of 2016 continue to do best and the call to be in mid-caps at the beginning of the year also looks to be paying off.  Europe was up the most in dollar terms in the second quarter (and, largely, year to date), helped by the depressed first quarter as markets worried about the French election, but Asia is next and the Americas last. Hong Kong continues to stand out as a market, helped undoubtedly by the southbound flows from China.  <br/>The second quarter had more of a momentum feel to it than the first as the narrative shifted to \u2018explain\u2019 why the consensus was wrong in Q1. The end of the reflation trade we were told, but the reality was that risk premia put on at the end of 2016 simply unwound. Whether it was emerging market risk premia based on unwarranted worries over a strong dollar, high interest rates and debt or political risk premia in Europe based on understandable concern over potentially huge policy change. The rally in Europe has pushed the dollar back down as the euro went higher on relief that it wasn\u2019t going to break up any time soon and the dollar, as measured on its trade-weighted basis broke lower and is now below its pre Trump rally level. Historically, that should have helped both oil and gold, but as noted last week, they have also broken long term support and while oil has rallied from an over-sold condition  last week, momentum remains poor, consistent with the supply side story of weak pricing. Their weakness helped to confirm, for some, the Q2 narrative of \u2018no reflation\u2019, but I would maintain this is more about excess supply, than weak demand.<br/>Meanwhile the extra-ordinary behaviour of Bitcoin continues. When at the end of Q1 I had a conversation with a visiting millennial who was hoping to pay for his gap year by trading Bitcoin, I freely admitted that I had no idea where this crypto currency was going beyond the fact that if every 19 year old wanted to buy it then it would certainly go higher until there were no more 19 year olds left to buy it based on \u2018what their mate told them\u2019. Moreover that when someone started to sell it, then things could get tricky. I really hope that he sold some after it almost tripled (!) in Q2. Where it goes next is still frankly anyone\u2019s guess although I would note two technical factors that are now present (that were not at the end of Q1). The short term moving average was attacked twice and now appears as resistance rather than support and with lower highs and lower lows, there is all the appearance of a top formation.  <br/>Moving to assets - as opposed to tradable prices -  the \u2018no reflation\u2019 narrative nevertheless helped US Treasuries and while US long bonds ran into profit taking as the quarter/half year closed, they still managed to be only just behind US equities in total returns year to date. In terms of the curves, \u2013 the 2s-10s and 2-30 Treasury curves have subsequently steepened from what were decade lows. As we approached those lows, some were trying to suggest that it was some prediction about a recession, but experience suggests that this is far more often a function of internal market positioning as people borrowed short and lent long \u2013 rarely a recipe for long term success. Also interesting when looking at yield curves is the steady onwards and upwards move in Libor, which continues to grind higher, standing at 1.299%, only 9bp below 2 year Treasuries. If this can let the air out of leveraged carry trades, then all the better.<br/>There is a sense that monetary policy is quietly normalising. The selloff in bonds towards the end of the month was partly profit taking, but also I suspect a recognition that monetary policy, both from the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB), is moving away from quantitative easing (QE) and ultra-low nominal rates. In my view, the biggest risk to the Western economies remains the high levels of consumer debt and the liquidity and cash flow implications of higher mortgage payments. The UK, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece have all proven historically to be highly sensitive to mortgage rates due to their floating rate nature, while the shift away from fixed rate refinance-able mortgages in the US in the mid-2000s significantly increased US household sensitivity. The world\u2019s top central bankers are all changing over the next couple of years, Yellen, Kuroda, Carney and Draghi as well as Zhou at the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) and limiting leverage in financial markets without collapsing housing markets will be the real challenge for monetary policy going forward. It does not however mark an end to the process of financial repression, whereby capital requirements and other regulations more or less force pension funds and insurance companies to hold bonds. This should keep a bid for bonds that would offset any sell off related to carry trades unwinding.  <br/>My concern remains less about the macro environment and more about the internal de-stabilisation of markets through so-called \u2018portfolio insurance products\u2019. As previously discussed, the reverse VIX ETF, XIV is up another 75% or so this quarter as VIX stays low, which continues to make me nervous. Momentum traders buying XIV are effectively selling volatility and the problem is compounded because the observed levels of low volatility are attracting a different crowd of ETFs, those chasing low volatility as a risk factor and generating a second set of momentum trades. Indeed, as my colleague Simon Weston (manager of the AXA WF Framlington Asia Select Income fund) noted, the low volatility directional trend of large cap tech stocks has made them (new) favourites of the low volatility ETF crowd, creating factor based momentum to add to simple price momentum. The problem (broadly) with the proliferation of these higher frequency algorithmic (algo) trades is that once a \u2018factor\u2019 starts to exhibit performance, money is thrown at it and the factor becomes self-fulfilling, right up until it doesn\u2019t. In effect factor ETFs risk turning every factor into momentum.  <br/>Here in Asia we have had some symbolic events in capital markets at the end of the half year. Last week MSCI announced the inclusion of China A-shares in the Emerging Markets index, which triggered some meaningful north bound flows over the Stock Connect and a rally in the CSI 300 index. Secondly, with the 20th anniversary of the handover in Hong Kong we got the first symbolic trade on the new Bond Connect, a mechanism to allow international investors to trade Chinese onshore bonds via Hong Kong. While this is not a short term \u2018wall of money\u2019 in either direction (I am still waiting for the one that was supposed to come from Japan to the UK in 1988), it does run up a flag for international investors to say that you can no longer pretend China is not coming to your world. Whether you like it or not.<br/>This has been much less dramatic than in 2015 when the prospect of MSCI inclusion was largely behind the huge run-up in the Chinese markets in the second quarter of 2015 as domestic speculators chased stocks, usually with margin, on the basis that valuation was not important, as some \u2018dumb\u2019 passive investor would simply be forced to buy off you at any price. That didn\u2019t happen of course and the various indices fell back to earth \u2013 the Shenzhen Index had shown Bitcoin-like performance, almost trebling in the 18 months from the beginning of 2014. Note from the chart below, however, that the performance of \u2018China\u2019 can very much depend on which index you look at. The Shenzhen Index, which is more \u2018new economy\u2019 is down this year but is still up 70% over the last three years, while the CSI 300 China index, the best performer of the four this year, is almost exactly flat on 3 years.  <br/>Chart 1: How well the Chinese market is doing this year depends on which index you look at<br/>  Source: Bloomberg AXA IM, July 2017  <br/>In the credit markets, low US treasury yields and tighter conditions in China have led to a surge in dollar denominated debt issues. In particular Evergrande just issued $6.6bn of debt, 40% of which was replacing old debt, but the rest was new borrowing. Doubtless encouraged by their very strong stock price performance this year, (+215% year to date) creditors should nevertheless note that Evergrande has never generated  positive free cash flow since its listing in 2009. While not worried about systemic risk with bad debts in China, we are wary at the individual stock level. Also we note that the Chinese authorities are cracking down on some of the big mergers &amp; acquisition players like Anbang, HNA and Wanda which will undoubtedly undermine some of the confidence that these companies might be buyers of last resort for otherwise unprofitable small and mid-caps. Moreover, while a number of meetings recently with credit agencies and other specialists have made me more confident over the bad debt provisions of the big banks, I do remain concerned about some of the involvement in corporate lending to some of these more aggressive acquirers.  <br/>The big US banks all passed their annual stress tests recently and what originally began as a process of demonstrating solidity of balance sheets and confidence in the system has now become more an assessment of the ability to pay out higher dividends or buy back equity. After an incredibly good second half of 2016, US banks had traded broadly flat year to date before a 10% run in the last month, largely on expectations of a better pay out. This also likely contributed to a bout of profit taking and rotation out of some of the big tech names into quarter end. Nasdaq has hit a six week low on this rebalancing albeit it is still +16% year to date, and while all the FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) names are below their 50 day moving averages this feels more like a correction than a big sell off.  <br/>An interesting point raised recently by the Financial Times is that previously emerging markets used to be around 10% tech and 30% commodity, but that now this has all but reversed with commodities representing around 12% and technology around double that at just over 25%. While on the one hand it shouldn\u2019t really be a surprise, the point of emerging markets is that they are, indeed, emerging, it also helps to explain why they don\u2019t really perform as they are \u2018supposed to\u2019.  <br/>The increasing focus on technology in emerging markets mirrors the changes in the underlying economies. At the consumer end, the lack of legacy infrastructure has meant users have gone straight to mobile and the rapid growth of internet based shopping has been well documented. The same is happening with payments systems - it is almost harder to use cash than pay by phone in China these days, so dominant is WeiChat Pay. This is particularly true among millennials, and given that more than half the world\u2019s millennial population lives in emerging markets this is driving a form of globalisation of consumption. Smart phones have moved from being a luxury to a necessity. UBS estimate that between 2013 and 2015 some 500 million users gained access to the internet.  A twenty-something living in Shanghai probably has more in common with a twenty year old in Mumbai or Seattle than with their 60 year old neighbour. Connected homes, wearables, smart health products and of course (semi) autonomous vehicles are all possible now thanks to the cloud, cheap storage and big data analytics.  <br/>Capital investment has poured into building this infrastructure and of course high quality precision manufactured smart phones and tablets in turn require precise engineering in high tech factories, rather than cheap labour sweatshops. As such, factories have become more automated and high tech, leading to an explosion in the use of automation and robotics, what is being referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This is a global phenomenon, China is now the world\u2019s biggest buyer of industrial robots as it seeks to catch up with the robot penetration rates of the likes of South Korea and Japan. Initially dominated by the autos sector, industrial automation is spreading to every sector, making it a true cross border, cross sector thematic. Factories are becoming smarter with sensor and optics improving accuracy and efficiency while a new generation of smaller robots (or \u2018co-bots\u2019) are being deployed alongside humans to further enhance quality and output. Businesses are having to automate or die, partly because demographics are pushing up labour costs everywhere, but also because the precision of robotics delivers a quality factor that customers demand. The cloud and big data are bringing forth the internet of things which means that every factory \u2013 as well as potentially every home \u2013 is becoming smarter. For investors, process automation can raise margins as well as sales, implying higher share price multiples while the evolution of traditional manufacturing companies towards more software businesses is also leading to stock re-rating. Importantly though, in our opinion, it is not enough to simply be \u2018in the robotics and automation space\u2019, like all thematics, it needs to be tied into improving profitability and cash flows.<br/>For investors there is also the problem that pure plays are hard to find; the market for robotic equipment for example is very concentrated, with really only 4 big players \u2013 Fanuc, ABB, Yasakawa and Kuka (the latter just bought by the Chinese. Perhaps it was because they saw this video). Similarly the market for process automation is dominated by around half a dozen players who control around 80% of the market for sensors, measurement equipment and so on. As more companies appear in this space, investors need to be on the lookout for new opportunities, but also wary that the companies they have already invested in can survive the new competition. This applies everywhere of course and here in Asia we are keeping a particularly close watch on what is coming from China \u2013 either quoted or unquoted.  <br/>There are however, many more companies in the \u2018enabler\u2019 category, including software, semiconductors and other system components. The concept of robotics and automation is spreading to other areas such as medicine and of course the next stage of automotive automation \u2013 autonomous driving. The cloud, big data analytics, sophisticated software and sensors and autonomous driving captures the main elements we see driving (sic) this theme and, as we would argue, driving growth investors more generally. Ultimately investing is a bottom up process, focussing on cash flow and how much we pay to participate in those flows, but understanding the macro headwinds and tailwinds that companies are likely to face is more important than ever in this Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is bringing in ever faster disruption to existing business models.  <br/>P.S. The Kuka video above might be fake news, but it\u2019s still pretty impressive!  <br/>Regards,  <br/>Mark  <br/><br/>Mark Tinker<br/>Head of AXA IM Framlington Equities Asia<br/><br/>In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editorial@plusmedia.info\">editorial@plusmedia.info</email><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-APMN115675520170706</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NYP-KJT1-DXCW-D36S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2717\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 6, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Market turmoil: Stocks appear to have found firmer ground following rough trading sessions in Asia and the United States. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">US stock futures were pointing higher on Thursday, and major European indexes dropped less than 1%. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Benchmark indexes in Asia did drop sharply, with the main market in Tokyo closing down 3.7%. Stocks dropped 1% in Hong Kong and 1.6% in Seoul.</p><p>The rout started in the United States on Wednesday. </p><p>The Dow fell more than 600 points, a 2.4% drop. The S&amp;P 500 sank more than 3%. The Nasdaq slumped 4.4%, its worst day since August 2011.</p><p>\"Investors have been worried about the potential negative impacts of higher interest rates, signs of weaker global growth and potential disruption from tariffs,\" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. </p><p>\"Still, the nearly 10% decline in US stocks over the last month appears excessive relative to the risks that we highlighted.\"</p><p>2. Big Tech earnings: Twitter (TWTR), will publish its latest numbers before the opening bell on Thursday, while Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Snap (SNAP), Expedia Group (EXPE) and Intel (INTC) will follow after the close. </p><p>It could be a painful day for Snap. The struggling messaging app is dealing with a revolving door of executives, and the stock is down a staggering 53% for the year. Analysts expect the company will report another decline in users when it releases its third quarter finances this week.</p><p>The tech earnings come amid major drops in the sector. Netflix (NFLX) nosedived 9% on Wednesday, while Facebook (FB) was down 6% and Amazon dropped 5%. Apple (AAPL) shed about 3%. </p><p>Tech stocks sank following disappointing results from Texas Instruments and AT&amp;T (T), CNN's parent company.

The continued high demand from our customers makes us confident for the fourth quarter,\" CEO Dieter Zetsche said in a statement. </p><p>Daimler shares were up 1% on Thursday.</p><p>Separately, Daimler has announced a new joint venture with China's Geely to launch an upscale ride-hailing service in China next year.</p><p>South Korea's Hyundai Motors (HYMTF) said Thursday that its net profit plunged 68% in the third quarter. Shares in the company dropped 6%.</p><p>4.

But it also forecast slower sales growth. On the news, Bear Stearns downgraded the stock to attractive from buy.\u00a0</p><p>Software company Oracle(ORCL:Nasdaq) edged Network Appliance out to be the days's most active stock on the Nasdaq. It was rallying back from recent lows and lately was up 2.2% the day after jumping on news that it would team up with Citigroup(C:NYSE) to integrate each others' technologies and services.\u00a0</p><p>And have you looked at MP3(MPPP:Nasdaq) recently? The stock jumped 56%. Okay, so that translates into a gain of only $2.25 to bring its stock to $6.25. Still. It was shooting up after announcing that it would restart its my.mp3.com service with a pay option by the end of November. Yesterday, the company was ordered to pay $53.4 million to Universal as a result of a copyright infringement case. TheStreet.com/NYTimes.com joint newsroom covered the lawsuit in a separate story.\u00a0</p><p>So who's not happy today? Hewlett Packard(HWP:NYSE) was giving back yesterday's gains. Hewlett, a computer and imaging company, has taken quite a ride since it announced on Monday that it missed earnings estimates by a dime. It rebounded Tuesday as investors decided tech stocks looked oversold.\u00a0</p><p>Battered retailers have been in focus this week as a flurry of companies report their third-quarter earnings. Wal-Mart(WMT:NYSE) was up again today despite its downward tone about its fourth-quarter earnings. The S&amp;P Retail Index was up 1.4%. Wal-Mart was 4.4% higher.\u00a0</p><p>But activity could get more interesting as the afternoon progresses. The Federal Open Market Committee is meeting to decide the direction of interest rates. While no one is expecting the Fed to change interest rates, it is less certain what the committee will say about the risks of inflation going forward.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Sector Watch\u00a0</p><p>With no real resolution on the election front, many stocks expected to benefit from a Bush win of the White House -- such as drugs and tobacco -- were pulling back today. The American Stock Exchange Pharmaceutical Index, which tracks the drug sector, and the American Stock Exchange Tobacco Index were both lower.\u00a0</p><p>Paper stocks had strength again today. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Forest &amp; Paper Products Index was rising 2.6% on consolidation fever. Georgia-Pacific(GP:NYSE) said yesterday that it expected its $7.5 billion bid for Fort James(FJ:NYSE) to close \"very soon\" after its recently extended regulatory review. Also yesterday, Weyerhaeuser(WY:NYSE) confirmed that it had financing for its proposed acquisition of Willamette Industries(WLL:NYSE).\u00a0</p><p>Back to top<br/>\u00a0<br/>Bonds/EconomyBonds were stronger today in the hope of good news on interest rates from today's Fed policy meeting. There is a minority opinion that the Fed may move to a neutral bias about inflation, which suggests there would no further interest rate increases in the near term.\u00a0</p><p>The benchmark 10-year Treasury note is at 100 4/32, up 9/32, to yield 5.734%.\u00a0</p><p>The 30-year Treasury bond is at 106 11/32, up 8/32, to yield 5.800%.\u00a0</p><p>Historically low interest rates are still helping to keep consumers interested in the housing market. The Mortgage Applications Survey (definition | chart | source ) for the week ended November 10 rose 6% to 690.4 from 651.2 in the previous week.\u00a0</p><p>Business inventories (definition | chart | source ) for September edged up 0.1% after a rise of 0.7% in August. A rise of 0.3% had been expected. This was the slowest pace of increas in nearly two years. While stockpiling slowed, sales didn't.

Bad news from software maker Oracle(ORCL:Nasdaq) and PC giant Dell(DELL:Nasdaq) helped sparked today's selloff.\u00a0</p><p>Dell was under pressure from reports that it was cutting expenses by up to 10% and that it may cut as many as 4,000 jobs. And Oracle was the victim of some cautious comments from a Morgan Stanley analyst after CEO Larry Ellison talked of weakness in the company's database business. Ellison has sold about 27 million of his shares in the last two weeks, according to SEC filings.\u00a0</p><p>Networker Cisco(CSCO:Nasdaq) continues to bleed, down 3.1% to $29.12. It was the most actively traded stock on the Nasdaq for the third day in a row today. The company announced that it missed earnings targets for the first time in three years Tuesday after the market close and gave a murky forecast for the future.\u00a0</p><p>The ever-troubled communications-equipment maker Lucent(LU:NYSE) was taking a beating, after the The Wall Street Journal reported this morning that it is being investigated by the SEC for possible fraudulent accounting practices. Regulators are looking at the company's booking sales procedures and software-licensing agreements. Specifically, the SEC is investigating whether Lucent improperly booked $679 million in revenue during its 2000 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. The stock was off 11.2%, approaching a low hit in late December of $13.50.\u00a0</p><p>But that news wasn't any huge surprise. Lucent already did its own investigation of the revenue booking and in December restated its financial results to eliminate the $679 million in revenue. And with so much bad news already priced into the stock, investors probably wonder how much further it can fall.\u00a0</p><p>After five disappointing quarters, a string of high-level executive firings and a round of lower-level layoffs, the company's stock price is already down 78% from the highs of last year. TheStreet.com took a look at Lucent's approach to accounting early on, and has been following Lucent's other woes.\u00a0</p><p>Mobile-phone maker Nokia(NOK:NYSE ADR) was off 6.8% after UBS Warburg removed the mobile-phone giant from its list of top-10 global technology stock picks. That move helped knock down overseas markets.\u00a0</p><p>The good news is that network storage systems maker Network Appliance(NTAP:Nasdaq) was up 10% to $38.75 after its earnings report from last night. The bounce was a nice relief from the drag it experienced this week after being caught up in the Cisco conundrum.\u00a0</p><p>The company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat estimates after the market closed Thursday. But the company's sales came in a bit below forecasts, an uncharacteristic shortfall for a company well-positioned in one of the fastest-growing technology markets. It is yet another sign that corporations aren't spending as freely on tech gear as they once were. TheStreet.com's Tom Lepri took a look at what the report means for Network Appliance.\u00a0</p><p>And those makers of Toy Story and its sequel, Pixar Animation Studios(PIXR:Nasdaq), were celebrating today after posting better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter. The company said the sequel's home video and merchandise sales help to more than triple its revenue. The stock was up earlier but had lately turned down slightly.\u00a0</p><p>Back to top<br/>\u00a0<br/>Sector Watch\u00a0</p><p>Defensives were relishing this latest bit of weakness in tech stocks, with oil, tobacco and drug stocks bouncing.\u00a0</p><p>Blue-chip ExxonMobil(XOM:NYSE) was bouncing 1.8% to $85.99. The stock's been beaten down in the past couple days, so the recovery was a nice breather for the stock. The American Stock Exchange Oil &amp; Gas Index was 2% higher.\u00a0</p><p>The American Stock Exchange Pharmaceutical Index was rising 0.6%, and the American Stock Exchange Tobacco Index was lifting 1.3%.\u00a0</p><p>Back to top<br/>\u00a0<br/>Bonds/EconomyTreasury prices are up as weakness in equities has brought investors' focus back to notes and bonds. The money market is also consolidating after absorbing $32 billion in government debt that was auctioned over the last three days. The long end of the market is showing greater strength, with the 30-year up by half a point.\u00a0</p><p>A $5 billion auction of three-year notes from Freddie Mac should keep the trading volume up today. Next week, $21 billion worth of three- and six-month Treasury bills will be sold.\u00a0</p><p>The benchmark 10-year Treasury note lately was up 9/32 to 99 19/32, lowering its yield to 5.052%.\u00a0</p><p>Analysts will once again be hoping for Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan to hint of more rate cuts as he addresses the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday. In the wake of the Fed's two January cuts, the Bank of England cut interest rates yesterday and the Japanese central bank followed through with a cut overnight.\u00a0</p><p>Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said in his round of conversations with television networks yesterday that he agrees with Greenspan's recent view that the economy is near zero growth. O'Neill estimates the present growth rate at 0.5% - 0 .6%. But he expressed confidence that technology-led productivity gains would take the nation to a \"golden era of economic prosperity\" as 80% of their contribution was still to be realized. His statements suggest that last quarter's higher-than-expected productivity gains amid a weakening economy were due to structural improvements in supply-chain management techniques.\u00a0</p><p>There is no economic news today.\u00a0</p><p>Back to top</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-#1299963#</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:42B2-6RT0-00MP-T1RM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"997\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>TheStreet.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19301\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2001 TheStreet.com, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"02\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>February 9, 2001 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>ORACLE CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0CISCO SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0MORGAN STANLEY\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>\u00a0WALL STREET JOURNAL\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>ORCL (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0CSCO (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>\u00a0MS (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0SIC7379 COMPUTER RELATED SERVICES, NEC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0SIC7371 COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0NAICS334210 TELEPHONE APPARATUS MANUFACTURING\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0NAICS334111 ELECTRONIC COMPUTER MANUFACTURING\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0SIC3663 RADIO &amp;

Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, August 8th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are higher this morning. Take a look at futures pointing to a higher opening but well off of the highs of the morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Dow Jones futures right now up 27 points, losing steam quickly. We had been up about 80 points earlier. S&amp;P futures up 6.5, the Nasdaq futures are up 29 points, a third of a percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This comes one day after a wild day on Wall Street yesterday -- huge swings, down and up. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P were able to come back from sharp losses earlier in the day to end actually higher. The Dow finishing the day slightly lower after a 2.5 percent plunge earlier in the session. It was down 600 at its worst yesterday.</p><p>Markets now looking fractionally better.</p><p>In Europe this morning, take a look at the momentum there, taking a cue from Wall Street. FT 100 up 12 points, CAC 40 in Paris up 62, and the Dax index in Germany higher by 85.</p><p>In Asia it was higher across the board. We got better than expected trade data out of China overnight. Meanwhile Japan allowing exports of semiconductor manufacturing materials to South Korea.</p><p>We have another central bank cut. This from the Philippine Central Bank, cutting its key rate by 25 basis points after those three central banks did the same yesterday.</p><p>Oil, a big story, this morning sliding into bear market territory yesterday. Reports that Saudi Arabia is discussing options with other producers to stem the decline. Oil prices up almost 2 percent right now.</p><p>Senator Mitch McConnell's Twitter has been locked. Coming up -- how video of protesters shut down his campaign's feed and what AOC has to do with it.</p><p>More shaming from the left.</p><p>Plus more big tech privacy issues, reports that Microsoft contractors are listening to Skype calls. This as Instagram dumps a partner after tracking users.</p><p>All the issues you need to know, coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning. And joining me to break it all down: fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; Farvahar Partners founder and CEO Omeed Malik is with us this morning; and Fox News contributor, columnist with \"The Hill\", Liz Peek.</p><p>Great show so far -- guys.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes</p><p>BARTIROMO: A lot to talk about. I can't believe how many stories are pointing to more shaming and more, you know, upset over President Trump.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: and Mitch McConnell, it was his campaign Twitter account. They posted video of a mob outside his home, chanting nasty things about him.</p><p>Twitter shuts that down. That's not ok. But over the weekend, after these shootings, what was trending on Twitter, hashtag Mass Murder Mitch and Massacre Mitch. That was ok?</p><p>But when you post video of people threatening you outside your home, that gets your own Twitter account shut down? That is the world of insanity that we're living in now when it comes to social media.</p><p>Google, if you try to find out about mass shootings under President Obama's presidency, if you Google that, it pulls up search queries that involve Trump. It's all Trump information.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And granted, maybe that's the way the algorithms are working but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But somebody puts the algorithms together. Humans do the algorithms. I mean when is this going to stop and these powerful technology companies be held to account?</p><p>These companies are more powerful than ever before and they're trying to put their finger on the scale.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But literally if somebody is harassing me and I take a video of them and put it on Twitter, they're going to shut my account down. They're going to suspend it because that violates their rules. But somebody is allowed to basically cast aspersions at me and use hate speech against me and threaten me on Twitter and that's ok?</p><p>BARTIROMO: But I don't even understand. I mean you're showing what's actually going on. McConnell's campaign was showing what was actually going on outside of his own home.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's called news. That's news.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>PEEK: And we haven't heard anything from Twitter about this. I mean generally speaking, they respond when something like this takes place and everybody's angry about it.</p><p>I'm kind of surprised we haven't seen anything about this from the company. Because they are under fire on this stuff. Everyone knows there's bias.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is why we're going to see legislation.</p><p>OMEED MALIK, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, FARVAHAR PARTNERS: This is one time we can all agree we want more regulation of these big tech companies. They need to be broken up. these are anti-trust issues as well as violating First Amendment issues of free speech as well. This is about a serious --</p><p>PEEK: Eventually, the broadcasters had to give everyone equal time. And at some point the social media companies are going to be hit with the same kind of thing.</p><p>MALIK: If they want the best of both worlds.</p><p>PEEK: That is exactly right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly. We've got a big show. Coming up, joining the conversation this morning, the assistant to President Trump for trade and manufacturing policy, Peter Navarro is here to talk China and the Federal Reserve. We are going to talk about the issues around that, trade.</p><p>And then three-time MLB MVP and 14 time all star, Alex Rodriguez. A-Rod here this morning along. Along with Barstool Sports CEO Erica Nardini. They'll discuss the sports business, podcast, and all things baseball this morning.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big show ahead.</p><p>Our top story this hour is the stock market and all the wild swings we've been seeing. Orts business and all things baseball this morning. We've got a big show ahead.</p><p>Our top story this hour is the stock market and all the wild swings we've been seeing. Futures set for a higher opening this morning although. We are off of the highs of the morning after stocks snapped back yesterday from sharp losses.</p><p>Investors ultimately shook off fears from escalating China trade tensions. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq finished slightly higher in a major market reversal yesterday in heavy volume.</p><p>The Dow erased a 589-point plunge to end the day slightly lower on the session. It fell to a two month low.</p><p>President Trump slamming the Federal Reserve yesterday for doing more to harm the economy, he says, than China. But says he still has a long way to go with China. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our country is doing incredibly well. China is not doing well. If you look at the trade situation, China just admitted yesterday that they've been a currency manipulator. First time they've ever been called out.</p><p>Somebody had to do this with China because they were taking hundreds of billions of dollars a year out of the United States. And somebody had to make a stand.</p><p>I think the market reaction is anticipated. I would have anticipated. I would have maybe anticipated even more if China was killing us with unfair trade deals. The people that allowed that to happen are a disgrace.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining us right now is Wells Fargo senior global equity strategist Scott Wren. Scott -- good to see you this morning. Thanks so much joining us.</p><p>SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO: Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what do you see here? I mean all these wild swings, a lot of upset and nervousness over China trade and over all these interest rate cuts. Tell us what you want to do as an investor today.</p><p>WREN: Well, you know, you're right. There's a laundry list of things to worry about. I think really what's been going on is, you know, we had a gigantic run higher up what I would call panic Christmas Eve low. You know, at one point at the high the market was up, the S&amp;P 500 was up almost 29 percent.</p><p>So, you know, I think it's natural just in any environment when you have a massive rally like that, you know, it could easily cough up a third of it on very little news. So really, we did not trade, at least in the U.S. trading session. We haven't hit the 200-day moving average which is down at 27.90.</p><p>Now, overnight that level was tested when we were all sleeping but I think what you want to do here, you have to have a forward outlook. And if your forward outlook is constructive, we're looking for modest growth. We're looking for not much inflation.</p><p>Clearly, the Fed's in an accommodative mood, as is every other major central bank. Valuations are not stretched. So if those are the conditions, what you need to be doing is looking at opportunities to step into stocks.</p><p>Now, you know, we're less than 5 percent off the all-time record high. We have not had much of a pullback. I mean it feels pretty painful when, you know, you get a 3 percent pullback in one day like we did on Monday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WREN: But what we want our clients to do, we want to lean toward this expansion continuing. So, you know, whether it's the 200-day moving average, whether it's the June low, down at 27.40 somewhere in that zone is a great place to put a toe in the water at the very least. So you know, we're buying industrials, buying consumer discretionary, buying tech.</p><p>All the things that get clobbered here in the pullback, we don't want our clients getting defensive. So you know, we don't want them in utilities and staples; at least overweight those sectors.</p><p>So that's kind of our game plan. And I think you have to be patient here. But, you know, when the opportunity arises, you need to step in. You can't hesitate. I mean you've already formed your forward outlook or at least we have. Now, if your forward outlook is not good, well, that's a whole different deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Interesting. Ok.</p><p>WREN: We're looking for opportunities to buy.</p><p>PEEK: So Scott -- it does seem -- good morning. It does seem like the United States equities market, stock market is really the only game in town. I mean, you know, there are all kinds of issues, we're all concerned about the Fed fund rate being higher than it should be, et cetera.</p><p>But honestly for institution that's have to come up with 5, 6, 7 percent returns, where else are they going to go?</p><p>WREN: That's exactly right, Liz. I mean we are really the only game in town. We've got the most dependable economy. We have a sturdy financial system. And that's why money tends to flow to the U.S.</p><p>I mean if you're out there looking to buy equities, are you going to buy, you know, eurozone equities? Sure, they might be cheap, but they're cheap for a reason. So I think you're still going to have interest in the U.S.</p><p>But, you know, all of us have been around for a long time and you know when the 10 year yield's at 170, that's not a good sign. So you have to think about why it's there, safe haven buying, other things. But it's also a reflection of hey just are we in a modest growth, modest inflation environment or is it something worse.</p><p>So there's a lot going on and I hope we don't see a lot of days like yesterday. I mean, which ended fine, but that kind of volatility -- we're going to see a lot of mini days like yesterday and I think this volatility is not going to go away anytime soon.</p><p>MALIK: Hi -- Scott. It's Omeed here. Two quick questions for you.</p><p>One, how much do you think the rise of algorithmic trading has provided an artificial floor for the equity markets? And on a somewhat related note, are you concerned about the lack of liquidity we have in a post-crisis equity market which increases volatility, as you know?</p><p>WREN: Yes. you know, these algo traders, you know, I'm an old school guy. I mean I was on the floor of the Mercantile Exchange, you know, 30 years ago. And so, you know, I think in terms of humans driving things. They get emotional, they push the sell button and all those kinds of things.</p><p>Nowadays, you know, certainly a big volume is the machines pushing the button. And I think that if you look at -- it's certainly a big part of the volume. But if you look at places where the market stops and the last few years -- I mean the 200-day moving average, for example, that has really been a good source of resistance at times and support.</p><p>So I would argue that when you look back at how the market trades, the natural places where humans would be buying or selling, it looks like, you know, that's where these algos are doing the same thing.</p><p>Now does the speed of the move increase? I think it does. But I think the magnitude of the move, you know, what might normally play out over a few weeks or a month or something, I mean, it might take a day or two, but that is a consideration.</p><p>You know, when you're running stops, when you're blowing through support, people are piling on quickly. And so, you know, there's some issues to think about there. But overall, you know, they're providing some liquidity and I think really when you look at it, the places where the market settles out are oftentimes if not almost all the time the same places as you would if there were just humans doing the trading, pushing the button so-to- speak.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. You're looking for opportunities. We're going to be watching. You want to buy here.</p><p>WREN: We are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Scott -- good to see you. Thanks so much.</p><p>WREN: All right. Thanks -- guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Scott Wren joining us from Wells Fargo.</p><p>Quick break and then the McConnell campaign account locked out of Twitter, we told you why. We're going to tell you more about how that's playing out coming up.</p><p>And then more privacy concerns -- Microsoft and Instagram tracking consumer data. we're going to tell you all about it when we come back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>As we reported earlier, Senator Mitch McConnell's campaign account was locked out of Twitter. Lauren Simonetti with more details right now -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Let's get some more information -- Maria.</p><p>Twitter says it locked out the account for posting a video of protesters outside his Kentucky home. Twitter says the video violates its \"violent threat\" policy. Mitch McConnell's campaign manager slamming the company saying this in a statement. Quote, \"This is a problem with the speech police in America today. Twitter will allow the words of 'Massacre Mitch' to trend nationally on their platform but locks out our account for posting actual threats against us.\"</p><p>Well Twitter says the campaign's account will remain locked until that video of the protesters outside his home is deleted -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you justify this?</p><p>SIMONETTI: He's the victim and his account is locked as a result.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's extraordinary.</p><p>PEEK: It's really staggering really. And I just keep being surprised that Twitter hasn't said anything about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They did. That was the comment. They're going to keep it locked until they delete the video. I mean it's absolutely extraordinary.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>PEEK: I can understand their -- anyway.</p><p>SIMONETTI: I mean comments like \"stab him in the heart\", that's allowed to live on online but until that video comes down, his campaign account is blocked.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And let's just underline the fact that this is outside of his home.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, exactly. They're targeting his home.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is outside of Mitch McConnell's home and it's on him to delete the video. Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it was ok with Twitter to post say the address of someone on television and basically send mobs to the home and -- but this is not ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Unbelievable.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It actually expose -- you know what? If you're protesting and exercising your right to free speech, I would think that you would have the right to film them and post it on a social media platform. But again, clearly the censorship is ok if you're a conservative.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. And you know what? We're going to keep hearing commentary and proposals for regulation of this industry because they continue to just do whatever they want to do based on their ideologies and politics.</p><p>Speaking of politics, on this program yesterday I sat down with 2020 candidate Tulsi Gabbard where she doubled down on her criticism of rival Kamala Harris. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. TULSI GABBARD (D-HI), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know, what kind of leadership would she bring? And what kind of leader was she as attorney general in California?</p><p>And it's pointing to the truth and the facts. She claims to be very proud of the record that she had as the attorney general in California.</p><p>I pointed out some of the huge problems with the kind of leadership that she brought where she claims to be a champion for the people, but instead made decisions that caused more harm, hardship and suffering for people in California. And I gave some of those examples in the debate. She needs to answer to the American people on these facts.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was yesterday right here. Omeed -- you are a Tulsi Gabbard supporter. Your reaction. Why did she find it important to take on Kamala Harris?</p><p>MALIK: Well, I think it was important that her record be examined because it was long overdue. So basically what she's talking about as she mentioned in the debate this is a person who said she is proud of her record. She sent 1,500 people to jail for marijuana offenses from the black and brown community and at the same time she went on a radio show just about two months ago and laughed about how she smokes a joint every once in a while because of her Jamaican heritage.</p><p>That's the kind of inconsistency that people have come to know about Kamala and it's why her poll numbers are starting to suffer.</p><p>I mean moreover, she sounds like someone who wants to be everything to everyone and her new healthcare plan demonstrates that. It basically is a hodgepodge of ideas that really doesn't do anything, it could end up signifying nothing.</p><p>In complete contrast, Tulsi came on your show yesterday and talked about suing Google for $50 million. And we've been talking about how they're targeting conservatives. This is someone on the Democratic side but isn't just doing it because her side is being targeted but she wants to do something that's right for the country. And she is putting country above party.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. On the healthcare story, Dagen -- first Kamala Harris said she's ok with eliminating 180 million people's healthcare that's currently in place and go for Medicare for all. Then she backtracked it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. She raised her hand at that first Democratic debate and said I misheard the question. She thought that it mean -- her original answer was that she thought it meant taking away her -- like giving up her private insurance. I can't remember the initial explanation on her part.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why would anyone mess with her private --</p><p>MALIK: Right. Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Kamala Harris was a prosecutor and an attorney general. You have to stand up and defend -- on a debate stage you have to defend your record. I don't know how you defend prosecuting parents for truancy which actually happened although nobody went to jail. But again, she was a very aggressive prosecutor. You kind of -- you have to own it and you have to expect people to come after that.</p><p>PEEK: And it's interesting to me that the only reason we're talking about Kamala Harris, the only reason she got a bump in the polls was she took on Joe Biden. There was a point where she was expected to be the vice presidential candidate for a Biden candidacy. Now maybe it's Tulsi Gabbard.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, she took on Biden and she's very close with the Obamas. So that's interesting.</p><p>All right. Quick break. And then oil is taking a dive, crude entering bear market territory yesterday. We've got a bounce however this morning. More on that next up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Stocks are higher, oil prices are rebounding as well after sliding into bear market territory yesterday. Take a look at crude this morning, up 1.75 percent 88 cents higher.</p><p>The latest Energy Information Administration report shows that stockpiles rose two and-a-half million barrels last week. That was 2.4 million. That's adding to concerns that the U.S.-China trade war could slow growth.</p><p>Joining us right now is IHS Markit vice chairman, Dan Yergin. Dan -- it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DAN YERGIN, VICE CHAIRMAN, HIS MARKIT: Good morning -- Maria. And good morning everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to what we're seeing in terms of stockpiling and its impact.</p><p>YERGIN: Well, the reason -- the concern about stockpiling is that that indicates that there's weakness in the world economy and in the U.S. economy. And of course, what also happened is that, you know, the fear of the trade war is really a fear about what happens to global demand for energy because of the weaker global economy.</p><p>I think this rebound we're seeing in oil prices right now is partly because of what the Saudis and others have indicated they're doing and also the sense that maybe this isn't yet a full-blown currency war.</p><p>PEEK: Dan -- good morning. Question for you. It seems to me that stockpiling would have actually taken place pretty naturally in an industry that's worried about what's going on with Iran, the Strait of Hormuz, tankers being taken out-of-line, et cetera.</p><p>I mean wouldn't that have been a reason why people would actualy begin to stockpile oil?</p><p>YERGIN: Well, I think there are two things to what you said. Certainly, you know, two months ago the oil market was registering fear about the gulf, all these incidents.</p><p>As of yesterday, we count 532 tankers in and around the Persian Gulf which tells you -- I mean there's a lot of risk there. But I think these stockpiles are the kind of commercial stockpiles as a result of production in the United States or also in terms of not as much gasoline demand as been expected. So I think there's kind of two different things going on there.</p><p>There's no question that there's still this sense of risk about the Gulf, but right now it's been engulfed by the concerns about a weaker global economy.</p><p>MALIK: Hi, Daniel -- this is Omeed. A lot has been made about China reducing their rates and its effect on exports. But as you well know, China imports a lot of its commodities and that's going to obviously affect their purchasing power.</p><p>Could you talk a little about China potentially not having the same purchasing power for its commodities and its impact on oil?</p><p>YERGIN: Certainly, because oil is priced in dollars and there's no question that China is by far the world's largest market for energy. They import 75 percent of their oil, we import under 15 percent. We're a major oil exporter.</p><p>And so if their economy weakens, that will affect the demand for energy. That's part of what's in the psychology of the market. But of course as you also point out, they don't want to see at least at this point their currency weaken too much because they have to buy all those commodities and there will be a higher price because the dollar will be stronger.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dan, real quick -- o you see the economy slowing substantially this year?</p><p>YERGIN: Well, I think our numbers show the U.S. economy slowing from almost 3 percent last year to maybe 2.3 percent this year and also a slowing in the global economy because of all the concerns that are out there. So not a recession by any means but a slowing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there.</p><p>Dan -- it's great to see you. Come back soon.</p><p>YERGIN: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much.</p><p>YERGIN: Thank you. Ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dan Yergin, IHS.</p><p>Coming up, the trade dispute with China hitting the American farmer. We're going to talk with one soybean farmer coming up next, get his perspective on things.</p><p>Then new competition for the iPhone, Samsung unveils the Galaxy Note 10, its features and release date all ahead later this hour. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, August 8th. Your top stories right now, 7:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Markets are higher this morning, Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading, although we are off of the highest levels of the morning. Dow Futures up 30 points, S&amp;P Futures up six and the NASDAQ Futures up 32.</p><p>This on top of a wild day yesterday with huge swings on Wall Street. The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P were able to come back from sharp losses earlier in the day to actually end higher. The Dow finished the day slightly lower. But it was much worse, it was a 2.6 percent plunge, almost 600 points at its worst and then came back to end down 22 points on the Dow.</p><p>European indices are continuing that momentum today, take a look. We've got the FT-100 in London up 14, CAC Quarante in Paris up 62, and the DAX Index in Germany up 90 points, three quarters of one percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight it was green across the board. Take a look, Japan allowing exports of semiconductor manufacturing materials to South Korea. We also have another central bank cut, this time from the Philippines and this one was expected. They lowered their key rate by 25 basis points.</p><p>China with a surprise increase in exports. The July rise of 3.3 percent mostly due to shipments to Europe and Southeast Asia. This as exports to the United States were down 6-1/2 percent as far as imports. What it all means for the future of trade talks, coming up.</p><p>More big tech privacy issues to tell you about. Reports that Microsoft contractors are listening to Skype calls, and Instagram dumping a partner after tracking users, everything you need to know, coming up.</p><p>Samsung is announcing new phones, competition for the iPhone, what the company is doing to gain some ground in the battle with Apple.</p><p>And it's back-to-school time. The big business it means for retailers, plus a look at the -- at the U.S. consumer and how they are being impacted by tariffs.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning. But first, our top stories this half an hour, tariffs and farming, China's imports from the United States fell 19 percent during July. That's an improvement from June when imports were down 31 percent. China says it will suspend imports of U.S. agricultural goods. The U.S. farming industry taking major hits from this ongoing trade impasse.</p><p>Joining us right now is a farmer, Iowa soybean farmer, Ron Heck. And Ron, it is good to see you this morning. Thank you so much for joining us today.</p><p>RON HECK, SOYBEAN FARMER, IOWA: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How significant has this impact been to your business, to your farming and what's your take on the recent tariffs?</p><p>HECK: Overall, U.S. farm profit has been cut in half over the last six years, from a little over $130 billion, down to about $60 billion a year for all farmers. Some sectors have been hit more than others. Soybeans are among the worst. And this is really unprecedented for our -- formerly our number one customer, to have the government issue an order to not buy anymore. It's the height of market interference on their part.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what would you like to see done, Ron? Do you want the president to pull back and not -- and not put these tariffs on products?</p><p>HECK: Oh, this was something that had to be done. China has been doing harm to our agriculture for many, many years. Going back 10 years, they have interfered, restricted with food imports from the U.S. They had entirely shut out corn before they started it on soybeans. Something had to be done.</p><p>We were facing a shrinking market. We were going to lose that market because of the Chinese government anyway. So the Chinese government has kind of put us in a position where we had not much left to lose and I'm very pleased that our government is in the process of trying to do something about that. And reopening that market for the benefit of U.S. farmers and also for Chinese consumers.</p><p>MALIK: Hi, Ron. Sorry to hear about the struggles in your area. I was curious if you and your peers are supportive of the ratification of the USMCA which as you know, improves upon NAFTA which may also mitigated bit of this with imports to Mexico which I know is a consumer agricultural products quite significantly from the country.</p><p>HECK: Oh, absolutely. Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, are our major customers. So the approval of the USMCA is really at the very top of our list. The ag trade benefits everyone in North America.</p><p>PEEK: Ron, I'm sure you're checking on and following what this means for the Chinese consumer which you mentioned a couple of minutes ago. It seems to me this has to have had an enormous impact on prices that they're paying in China for food, grains, and pork and all the rest of these things. I mean, what do -- what do you see from that or what do you hear from that?</p><p>HECK: Well, certainly the policies of the Chinese government have made food more expensive in China than it should be. The most recent numbers that I have available are from the OECD, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p><p>Before this latest round of tariff wars, Chinese consumers were already paying more than $160 billion a year more for food because of restrictions. For many years the price of soybeans has been five to $6.00 a bushel more inside of China than it is in the rest of the world.</p><p>That's harmed our demand and of course hurts the Chinese consumers. And it's why our Chinese customers would like to go back to buying from us because we have a good supply, great quality. We're reliable suppliers and a lower price than what China has internally.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ron, it's Dagen McDowell. What about the long-term damage done to the farming community by this? Are you worried about that? Because again, billions of dollars in aid but unless this trade fight is resolved, where does that leave families, frankly?</p><p>HECK: Yes, the -- we'd much rather have the trade than the aid. The aid is a short-term Band-Aid. We've lost in the last six years about $65 billion a year in farm operating profits. The trade payments of 12 to $14 billion are very helpful but they're much less than the total damage.</p><p>The only real answer here is to go back to a system that is more open where our customers are allowed to buy our products.</p><p>PEEK: Is there another market where some farmers are selling soybeans in particular right now? I can't imagine 16 million tons are just going to go to waste.</p><p>HECK: We certainly hope they don't. We're carrying the extra inventory at our own expense. We are making more sales to other countries but losing 1.3 billion customers in China is something that you just can't make up.</p><p>PEEK: Right.</p><p>HECK: So our leftover inventory at the end of each year keeps going up. It will be years getting this straightened out even if we have an immediate trade resolution.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have you been promised anymore help from the government?</p><p>HECK: No. It's on a year by year basis. Our government and the soybean farmers, both hope that we work this out and further payments aren't necessary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HECK: But in the -- in the meantime, with no profits, we have -- we have bills to pay and it's very helpful to the ag industry and the rural communities to have these market payments that at least allow farmers to pay their bills.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what you're saying is you support what the president has done even though it's been a major hit to your business? How do you think this gets resolved?</p><p>HECK: Well, China and the United States are really natural trading partners. Unfortunately, they're also natural rivals. But we need to have this rivalry issue settled and go back to trading.</p><p>China benefits from buying our food. We benefit from buying Chinese products. And hopefully at one of these trade meetings the presidents of the two countries will get together and agree to trading rules.</p><p>But we can't have the Chinese state trading enterprise model where the government just comes out and says well, we're not going to buy beans --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Understood.</p><p>HECK: -- or the ag products. That's the definition of unfair trading practices.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ron, it's great to get your insights this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>HECK: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be watching. Ron Heck, soybean farmer.</p><p>Technology giants are under fire again meanwhile over privacy concerns. Forcing Instagram to cut ties with one of its marketing partners. Grady Trimble is live in Chicago this morning with details there. Grady, Good morning to you.</p><p>GRADY TRIMBLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. Not such a good morning for anybody who likes tech and social media and wants privacy. This time around, Facebook's Instagram as well as Microsoft's Cortana the voice assistant and Skype are getting attention for all the wrong reasons.</p><p>First, Business Insider reports one of Instagram's vetted advertising partners was able to collect user data from their stories including their location as well as personal bios and pictures. You might know, stories are supposed to disappear after 24 hours.</p><p>Instagram sent the start-up hyper a cease and desist and told Business Insider HYP3R broke its rules. HYP3R for its part denied doing so according to the publication. This of course comes a year after Cambridge Analytica, that whole scandal in which that company got access to user data on Facebook to target them with political ads. Facebook as you know owns Instagram.</p><p>And in other tech news, Vice is reporting Microsoft hires contractors to listen to Skype calls as well as some things people say to the voice assistant Cortana. An unnamed contractor told Vice he's heard intimate private conversations. The source says contractors listen only when people are using the translation function and they're there to help with the artificial intelligence to make sure that the translation is correct and to improve that function.</p><p>But Maria, I think it's safe to say at this point anything you do online, anything you do on your phone, you better assume that it's public.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, all right. Grady, thanks very much. We'll be watching what happens next. Grady Trimble with the latest there in Chicago.</p><p>Coming up, Samsung rolls out its new phone, the details on the iPhone competitor and when you can get your hands on it.</p><p>Then, it is that time of the year, back-to-school. Can you believe it? Parents spending a lot on these supplies. We're going to tell you what they are, next hour. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Puerto Rico swears in its third governor in less than a week. Lauren Simonetti with headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Wow. OK. So the U.S. Territory Secretary of Justice Wanda Vazquez was sworn into office yesterday. This after the island's Supreme Court ruled last week's swearing in of Pedro Pierluisi was unconstitutional. Outgoing embattled Governor Ricardo Rossello had appointed Pierluisi days before stepping down, a move the courts disagreed with.</p><p>Well, Samsung has unveiled its new Galaxy Note 10 smartphones, plural, two of them, one smaller than the first Galaxy Note 10 which was released back in 2011 and then also a bigger one. The updated models offer more battery power and other features.</p><p>Although, they don't have the head phone jack. Pre-orders start today. The official release is set for August 23rd. They start at $950.</p><p>Well, the Emmys are following the Oscars lead, producers deciding not to have a host at this year's awards ceremony. The Fox Network will broadcast the Emmys next month. And they say that some big names in Hollywood were considered but the producers decided they had too much to do without worrying about a host. So if you remember, the Oscars were hostless back in February. Show moves faster. Viewership went up 12 percent. So we'll see if that's going to happen this time too.</p><p>It's also some big anniversaries, it's the 30th anniversary of \"Seinfeld\", I think the 25th of \"Friends\". So I think there's a lot to get to and they'll do it without a host.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes and it worked out well the last time.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Worked out really well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The only reason -- the only reason the Oscars ratings were up is because of Gaga and Cooper. Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, good point.</p><p>PEEK: What a scene that was.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good point, they almost kissed right there at the piano.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I have watched that movie, \"A Star is Born\" probably 12 times.</p><p>PEEK: It's so fabulous.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Me too. I keep watching it over and over again because now it's on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is that good. It's on HBO.</p><p>PEEK: It's so good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's so good.</p><p>All right, coming up, the first day of school is looming, back-to-school shopping already reaching fever pitch. The top trends for fall, right after this break.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. And it is back-to-school shopping. It is big business. Parents on pace for some heavy and hefty spending. This year it's expected to hit $80.7 billion, just back to school. That's according to the National Retail Federation.</p><p>Joining me right now is the founder of OMG Accessories, Anne Harper. Anne, it's great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ANNE HARPER, FOUNDER, OMG ACCESSORIES: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bringing some products around as well. What are you expecting this back-to-school season?</p><p>HARPER: Well, this is actually been one of our biggest years ever. Year over year for the last two years, we've seen a 30 percent increase in our sales.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Terrific. And you brought some products that you sell through what, Target, give me the stores that you're --</p><p>HARPER: We sell department stores like Nordstrom, Dillard's, Von Maur and then we do a huge off price business with T.J. Maxx, Burlington, Ross Stores.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are these the most popular products so far?</p><p>HARPER: Right now, unicorns are the craze, still to this day. We definitely think they're here to stay. And this is what we're selling just tons of.</p><p>BARTIROMO: For what age?</p><p>HARPER: We target seven to 14.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. And so it's funny that something comes up and it's like it just takes off like fire, like in this year it's unicorns.</p><p>HARPER: You know what? The last 2-1/2 years have been unicorns.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>HARPER: But we definitely mini backpacks are very, very popular, cross bodies, anything hands-free. Everyone has their phone, kids have phones, something in their hands. So anything really that you can, you know, be hands-free.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are you expecting? Because you know, we have this conversation ongoing about whether or not we're to going to see an economic slowdown. Do you see any expectations that consumers will spend less this year on these kinds of things?</p><p>HARPER: We really have just continually seen growth with the products. I think that the customer is -- you know, our girl is on social media 24/7 and she knows what she wants. And this is -- this is what attracts her, so she's asking mom to buy it and mom's buying it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So broadly the state of retail same thing or are you seeing the state of retail change?</p><p>HARPER: I think this demographic in specific is like -- is really key because they are just young and ready to purchase. They know what they want. They're making the decisions right now. And they're making it easy for their parents to kind of go out and buy them what they want.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where do you produce these products? I want to understand what the impact of tariffs has been. But do you produce where?</p><p>HARPER: So we do produce a lot overseas in China. We also other countries in Southeast Asia. We have definitely diversified our supplier base so that, you know, we are not so heavily impacted by the tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, so have you seen an impact yet? What has been the cost of the tariffs to your business?</p><p>HARPER: We really have found just better ways, we're smarter about how we manufacture. So really overall, we have not been impacted, I really have to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Were there any plans to move your production out of China, given this fight?</p><p>HARPER: Yes, I mean, we were definitely very prepared for this to happen, a couple years even prior to the increase. So since we were prepared for this, we really were able to not be have -- you know, haven't be heavily impacted.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why were you expecting even before the fight happened?</p><p>HARPER: Just you know, there's always been rising costs in China over the last several years, so we moved outside of China, just so that, you know, we were secure in keeping the cost down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I see.</p><p>HARPER: Also, our volume has tremendously increased due to the demand of the product. So given the volume increase, we're able to work with our manufacturers on keeping the cost down.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, real quick, give me the prices of some of these things as people go shopping for their kids, seven to 14 year old.</p><p>HARPER: So, yes, seven to 14 year old. Price points start at $12.00 and go up to the $50.00 range for the big, large backpacks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, they look good.</p><p>HARPER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Anne, it's good to have you on the show.</p><p>HARPER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Anne Harper, OMG.</p><p>Still ahead, A-Rod is here in the studio MLB MVP, along with Barstool Sports CEO Erika Nardini will join me to talk about the corp podcasts and all things baseball.

Getty Images   As California becomes one of the first states to take on Big Tech in the ongoing battle over the employment status of Uber and Lyft drivers, the scofflaw ride-hailing companies are now working their political contacts to avoid complying with a law that has been on the books for almost a year.Earlier Thursday, an appellate judge granted an emergency stay, lifting the injunctions [1]</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/judge-denies-delay-for-uber-and-lyft-which-could-result-in-california-ride-hailing-shutdown-11597347579?mod=article_inlinehttp://www.marketwatch.com/story/judge-denies-delay-for-uber-and-lyft-which-could-result-in-california-ride-hailing-shutdown-11597347579?mod=article_inlinehttp://www.marketwatch.com/story/judge-denies-delay-for-uber-and-lyft-which-could-result-in-california-ride-hailing-shutdown-11597347579?mod=article_inlineagainst\">http://www.marketwatch.com/story/judge-denies-delay-for-uber-and-lyft-which-could-result-in-california-ride-hailing-shutdown-11597347579?mod=article_inlinehttp://www.marketwatch.com/story/judge-denies-delay-for-uber-and-lyft-which-could-result-in-california-ride-hailing-shutdown-11597347579?mod=article_inlinehttp://www.marketwatch.com/story/judge-denies-delay-for-uber-and-lyft-which-could-result-in-california-ride-hailing-shutdown-11597347579?mod=article_inlineagainst</url>Uber Technologies Inc.UBER, +6.76%[2] and Lyft Inc.LYFT, +5.75%[3] LYFT, +5.75%[4] that ordered them to comply with the California law, known as AB-5, that requires ride-hailing companies to classify their drivers as employees instead of independent contractors. The companies had threatened to shut operations in the state rather than comply with the ruling. They now have an expedited time frame for their appeals, which, in an unusual request from Appellate Judge P.J. Pollack, will now be consolidated. Both Uber and Lyft have until Aug. 25 to agree to the expedited procedures and then until Sept. 4 to file their opening briefs. The two companies, but Uber even more so, have taken an act-first-and-seek-forgiveness-later approach when it comes to complying with international and local regulations. Now, both are using all the political might that they have gathered up over the past years to buy more time in this battle, in the hopes that a ballot measure in the upcoming November election, known as Proposition 22, will overturn AB-5. The companies are spending millions of dollars fighting a law that will make their operating costs rise if they are forced to pay benefits to their drivers. Their threats to shut down their operations in the state raised enough concern to get support in some corners.  Late Wednesday, the mayors of San Jose and San Diego issued a joint statement[5], saying they had serious concerns that nearly 1 million gig-economy workers in California would lose their jobs if Uber and Lyft shut down their operations in the Golden State. They also played the pandemic card, saying that many of those drivers are helping homebound seniors and transporting patients seeking medical care. In their statement, they asked the appeals court to stay the injunction against the companies.  'The vast majority of drivers want to stay independent workers and are looking for solutions that protect their independence while also providing additional benefit,' said Kevin Faulconer, mayor of San Diego, and Sam Licardo, mayor of San Jose, echoing the party line of the companies.  In addition, Uber and Lyft \u2014 along with DoorDash \u2014 have spent at least $30 million each so far on Prop. 22, which would exempt them from AB-5. So while the state ushered in a new law that offers more protections to workers, the companies involved have been doing everything possible to make their part of the gig as low-cost and as high-profit as possible. Instead of preparing for a major change, and making changes in their operations to accommodate the new law, they have continued to relentlessly fight it. The appellate judge, however, is demanding that the CEOs of both companies submit a sworn statement, also by Sept. 4, 'confirming that it [the company] has developed implementation plans under which, if this court affirms the preliminary injunction and Proposition 22 on the November 2020 ballot fails to pass.' California is leading the way in these battles against Big Tech, from this fight with Uber and Lyft to the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) that is Facebook [6]Inc.'s FB, +2.44%[7] next nightmare, to a law requiring women on company boards. And just last week, a new bill that would require racial diversity on boards passed the state Senate Committee on Banking and Financial Institutions. [8] Whether these efforts to reign in tech giants will be successful or not is way too early to tell, but it's clear that the rest of the U.S. is watching. The Uber and Lyft showdown is an important battle in the war against the dominance of Big Tech.

Joining us now London is Mark Hawtin, Investment Director at GAM. Mark, what do you think about really the story of the day, I've had to say is the prospect of rising yields?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  I think it's an interesting term. We've had a really strong start to markets in the first week of January. There are clearly some issues that investors are beginning to look at. But for me, I think one needs to guide in the inflation outlook. It's all going to be about how the inflation prints come through from a fundamental points of view unless the market might be positioning for worse inflation data. I think that from a fundamental perspective, that's what needs to be focused on most and Friday obviously is a key day for that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes, U.S. CPI will deliver it on Friday. If inflation starts to tick higher, if yields start to go higher, how does that change how I invest in equities?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  Well, I think it will have an impact. Always when market move away from the perceived view, you get changes. So I think the initial position will be that markets will probably sell off if we get a big tick up in yields and inflation data comes through stronger than expected. But I think as long as it's measured, equities will still be OK in the medium to longer term.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEVINE</emphasis>:  Isn't that the trade-off, Mark? I mean, if I'm sitting here with cash to put to work, the last thing I want to do is put it in bonds if we're looking at a bear market here, especially if I'm not going to get any return anyway. The only place to go is equities.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  Yes, I mean, obviously as an equity investor, I'd have to agree with that. But I think what tends to happen is that when you get the kind of shock effect initially, it affects all asset classes. So I think it will actually give you probably a better opportunity on a very short-term basis, perhaps a better to buy because it's all a bit cheaper.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  But in terms of how I position within the market -- I want to get this chart up so I can show you what is going on here. If rates go higher, how does that affect my kind of cyclical value balance? Cyclicals have been doing relatively well. Financial -- you saw it yesterday in the S&amp;P, markets sold kind of bond proxies and bought into financials, et cetera. Is that the rotation that you would now expect to start to really sort of gain even more traction?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  I'm not sure. I think in General, cyclical assets and growth assets actually tend to do quite well in rising rate environment --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  -- because we're seeing continued and stronger growth than expected coming through. So apart again from the initial shock factor, I think we will see growth assets in particular doing very well in a steady raising right environment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  But it's all about the delta, it's all about the rate of change?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  Correct.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  And in terms of how does this work from my geographical point of view, is -- the U.S. is later in the cycle. Do I kind of rethink what I'm doing in the U.S. versus what's happening in Europe? Europe doesn't have much tech. We'll talk about tech a little bit later on. Is that a hindrance in this kind of environment? How do I position myself around the world?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  Well, I think we've already seen from the U.S. equity point of view, we've obviously already seen the tightening cycle beginning. So some of the shock factor is already built in there. If we were to start to see that occurring in Europe or in Japan, then you've probably got the shock factor to come. So mostly it's counterintuitive, but I would probably say the U.S. equities.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEVINE</emphasis>:  When I look at the possibility of buying equities, I always think from a value perspective maybe that is because I'm a bargain hunter by nature. U.S. equities seem to be pretty highly valued, I think 20 -- the last time I checked, 23 times forward earnings compared to 15 or 16 times forwards earnings here in Europe. I realize there's a mix difference, right, more tech stocks in the U.S. But what do you think about value hunting in this market?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  OK. So I think you've got to stick to, you know, strong fundamental work. And if you look within, I mean from the sector I cover which is technology, so the sector I have the most knowledge about, I can see that certain parts of that sector look quite stretched compared to history. Semiconductors, for example, where (INAUDIBLE) supposed have gone up to well over 13 times from a low in 2011 in 5.5 times. So there you had a big valuation increase.  </p><p>      But if you look at big cap tech more broadly, it's actually trading relative to the S&amp;P at the lower end of its range because some of these big growth facets, these big growth countries have not rerated. In fact, according to a piece of research by Bernstein put out over the term of the year, big cap tech has actually derated slightly in the last 12 months in spite of share price performance.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEVINE</emphasis>:  All right, thanks very much, Mark.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEVINE</emphasis>:  We're going to continue to talk about the technology side of that as well. Glad you mentioned that because we're going to focus in on it. Guy?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes, absolutely, that is what's coming up.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Mark Hawtin is still with us, GAM Investment Director. Let's talk about tech kind of -- let's take a step back and kind of away from CES and the razzle-dazzle of what is going on there. Tech just had a great run. Is it going to continue to have a great run in 2018 and do I need to be even more concentrated in the way that I hold tech because (INAUDIBLE) this morning basically what it seems you are saying is that FANGS are going to continue to do well. But other areas, semis, et cetera may have such a great year.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  Yes. So this is my view. I think that overall, technology is not as overvalued as you might think, looking at how shares performed last year because earnings growth was extremely strong.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  But it's differentiated within the sector. So for example, some of the really big cap incumbent technology companies, companies like Cisco or IBM or some of the semis companies have very pedestrian growth but their share price performance are still strong. So they got heavily rerated.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  Some of the FANG names, their growth was actually faster than their share price performance so they actually got slightly derated. So I think they're going to be more and more selective in favor of growth and away from what's perceived as value. And that might well tie in as well with any chance we'll start to get in bond yields because I think investors will are tended to go for dividend yielding tech companies and that will become less attractive as rates rise.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  What does that mean for companies like Microsoft?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  I think Microsoft struggles almost directly between the two in a sense. It's got some great growth initiatives particularly with its public crowd offering.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  It has some incumbent businesses. It has a yield.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Throws off a lot of cash too.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  Throws off a lot of cash. I think it probably sits in between the two. I still quite like it as an investment amongst that incumbent group.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Why don't you like Apple?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  OK. So it is a tricky one because it's cheap. Apple is cheap.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  And if I was a pension fund manager, I'd probably be more seriously considering it as the kind of company to have in the portfolio. But as a growth technology company, it's far from growth to be honest. Expectations of growth over the next couple years is a low single digit top line. If the X is actually less successful than is expected, and that seems to be what's panning out here, then actually growth could be full even lower than that. So it's going to be a low to no growth company with a number I think of longer term risks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  It feels in many ways a bit like kind of Microsoft a few years ago. It's kind of not generating a lot of top line growth but it's kind of kicking off a lot of cash and in many ways it depends on what kind of investor you are as to your attitude to whether or not you own it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  It does and it does depend on what they do to change their business roadmap.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  And I think, you know, since the iPhone, there's not been an enormous amount of innovation. And even where there has been innovation, the opportunity for those innovative changes to create additional significant revenue are very limited against this massive sort of iceberg of iPhone unit sales. So I think that, you know, everyone is focusing on the service business now but that's coming under a lot of competitive pressure from companies like Amazon Prime Video, for example on the iTunes side.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  One thing that people talk about when they talk about big tech is the regulatory risk. And we were talking about this yesterday on the program. It feels like we're coming out of a kind of 15-year regulatory cram down for the telecom sector. Is there a discount that I need to apply coming back to phase (ph) to some of these stocks because of the potential regulatory position that we may be getting over the next few years? And is that why the market almost did what it did last year? It's beginning to kind of factor in external factors other than simply what they can do in terms of top and bottom line and kind of what the bigger trajectory is here? Like Mark Zuckerberg talks about this year, he's got to fix Facebook. From the investor point of view, that sounds quite serious.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  Yes. Well, he would say that obviously because he needs to make sure that he is saying the right things.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  As such a large company, it's important that he is seen to be politically correct. And, you know, they are hiring another 15,000 people this year to monitor content and they're going to spend a lot of money doing that.  </p><p>      But I think that -- I think a lot of it has been factored in already and I think you're dead right. One of the reason why these growth names perhaps didn't do better last year was because of this perceived regulatory risk. But I think it will be an evolutionary factor. I don't think we're going to have a crashing down of regulation, which is going to heavily constrict these companies because to do that, quite frankly, it needs to be done on a global scale. And I cannot see a global initiative to crack down on the regulation of these businesses and no one country is going to want to risk being too aggressive themselves because then they risk vulcanizing themselves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  So the Europeans who don't really have a tech sector to worry about.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  No, but they do I think realize that the internet is a vital part of their economy. The digital economy is becoming, you know, in many ways is because the physical economy. If you decide as one geographic unit to clamp down from a regulatory perspective and you risk the internet growth in your area, you're vulcanizing yourself and it could have long reaching consequences.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Just from a kind of asset allocation point of view, do I overweight Asia and underweight Europe? Just kind of in sort of big picture here because of the fact that Asia has better tech companies and Europe doesn't have many. You've kind of named a couple already, SAP and so forth. But there aren't many. Is that a reason to be underweight Europe in 2018 do you think?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  I don't think it's right to make a decision on geographic allocation purely on how tech will do. And if you were going to make that decision, then you just continue to stick with the U.S.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  I think it's interesting that although there's a perception that Asia is full of amazing technology companies, in reality, there are very few global leaders in Asia. There are some big players from a regional perspective, like the internet companies in China, but there are more global technology winners in Europe than there are in Asia. You know, there's SAP, there's SML leading their parts of the market.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  There are very few real global leaders in Asia.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Great to see you this morning, Mark. Thank you very much indeed --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HAWTIN</emphasis>:  Thanks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  -- for coming to see us here at Bloomberg. Mark Hawtin, Investment Director joining us from GAM on the tech sec.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RCX-H021-F15W-H19H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Joining us now London is Mark Hawtin, Investment Director at GAM. Mark, what do you think about really the story of the day, I've had to say is the prospect of rising yields?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARK HAWTIN, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR, GAM: I think it's an interesting term. We've had a really strong start to markets in the first week of January. There are clearly some issues that investors are beginning to look at. But for me, I think one needs to guide in the inflation outlook. It's all going to be about how the inflation prints come through from a fundamental points of view unless the market might be positioning for worse inflation data. I think that from a fundamental perspective, that's what needs to be focused on most and Friday obviously is a key day for that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GUY JOHNSON, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Yes, U.S. CPI will deliver it on Friday. If inflation starts to tick higher, if yields start to go higher, how does that change how I invest in equities?</p><p>HAWTIN: Well, I think it will have an impact. Always when market move away from the perceived view, you get changes. So I think the initial position will be that markets will probably sell off if we get a big tick up in yields and inflation data comes through stronger than expected. But I think as long as it's measured, equities will still be OK in the medium to longer term.</p><p>LEVINE: Isn't that the trade-off, Mark? I mean, if I'm sitting here with cash to put to work, the last thing I want to do is put it in bonds if we're looking at a bear market here, especially if I'm not going to get any return anyway. The only place to go is equities.</p><p>HAWTIN: Yes, I mean, obviously as an equity investor, I'd have to agree with that. But I think what tends to happen is that when you get the kind of shock effect initially, it affects all asset classes. So I think it will actually give you probably a better opportunity on a very short-term basis, perhaps a better to buy because it's all a bit cheaper.</p><p>JOHNSON: But in terms of how I position within the market -- I want to get this chart up so I can show you what is going on here. If rates go higher, how does that affect my kind of cyclical value balance? Cyclicals have been doing relatively well. Financial -- you saw it yesterday in the S&amp;P, markets sold kind of bond proxies and bought into financials, et cetera. Is that the rotation that you would now expect to start to really sort of gain even more traction?</p><p>HAWTIN: I'm not sure. I think in General, cyclical assets and growth assets actually tend to do quite well in rising rate environment --</p><p>JOHNSON: OK.</p><p>HAWTIN: -- because we're seeing continued and stronger growth than expected coming through. So apart again from the initial shock factor, I think we will see growth assets in particular doing very well in a steady raising right environment.</p><p>JOHNSON: But it's all about the delta, it's all about the rate of change?</p><p>HAWTIN: Correct.</p><p>JOHNSON: And in terms of how does this work from my geographical point of view, is -- the U.S. is later in the cycle. Do I kind of rethink what I'm doing in the U.S. versus what's happening in Europe? Europe doesn't have much tech. We'll talk about tech a little bit later on. Is that a hindrance in this kind of environment? How do I position myself around the world?</p><p>HAWTIN: Well, I think we've already seen from the U.S. equity point of view, we've obviously already seen the tightening cycle beginning. So some of the shock factor is already built in there. If we were to start to see that occurring in Europe or in Japan, then you've probably got the shock factor to come. So mostly it's counterintuitive, but I would probably say the U.S. equities.</p><p>LEVINE: When I look at the possibility of buying equities, I always think from a value perspective maybe that is because I'm a bargain hunter by nature. U.S. equities seem to be pretty highly valued, I think 20 -- the last time I checked, 23 times forward earnings compared to 15 or 16 times forwards earnings here in Europe. I realize there's a mix difference, right, more tech stocks in the U.S. But what do you think about value hunting in this market?</p><p>HAWTIN: OK. So I think you've got to stick to, you know, strong fundamental work. And if you look within, I mean from the sector I cover which is technology, so the sector I have the most knowledge about, I can see that certain parts of that sector look quite stretched compared to history. Semiconductors, for example, where (INAUDIBLE) supposed have gone up to well over 13 times from a low in 2011 in 5.5 times. So there you had a big valuation increase.</p><p>But if you look at big cap tech more broadly, it's actually trading relative to the S&amp;P at the lower end of its range because some of these big growth facets, these big growth countries have not rerated. In fact, according to a piece of research by Bernstein put out over the term of the year, big cap tech has actually derated slightly in the last 12 months in spite of share price performance.</p><p>LEVINE: All right, thanks very much, Mark.</p><p>HAWTIN: OK.</p><p>LEVINE: We're going to continue to talk about the technology side of that as well. Glad you mentioned that because we're going to focus in on it. Guy?</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes, absolutely, that is what's coming up.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON: Mark Hawtin is still with us, GAM Investment Director. Let's talk about tech kind of -- let's take a step back and kind of away from CES and the razzle-dazzle of what is going on there. Tech just had a great run. Is it going to continue to have a great run in 2018 and do I need to be even more concentrated in the way that I hold tech because (INAUDIBLE) this morning basically what it seems you are saying is that FANGS are going to continue to do well. But other areas, semis, et cetera may have such a great year.</p><p>HAWTIN: Yes. So this is my view. I think that overall, technology is not as overvalued as you might think, looking at how shares performed last year because earnings growth was extremely strong.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>HAWTIN: But it's differentiated within the sector. So for example, some of the really big cap incumbent technology companies, companies like Cisco or IBM or some of the semis companies have very pedestrian growth but their share price performance are still strong. So they got heavily rerated.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>HAWTIN: Some of the FANG names, their growth was actually faster than their share price performance so they actually got slightly derated. So I think they're going to be more and more selective in favor of growth and away from what's perceived as value. And that might well tie in as well with any chance we'll start to get in bond yields because I think investors will are tended to go for dividend yielding tech companies and that will become less attractive as rates rise.</p><p>JOHNSON: What does that mean for companies like Microsoft?</p><p>HAWTIN: I think Microsoft struggles almost directly between the two in a sense. It's got some great growth initiatives particularly with its public crowd offering.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>HAWTIN: It has some incumbent businesses. It has a yield.</p><p>JOHNSON: Throws off a lot of cash too.</p><p>HAWTIN: Throws off a lot of cash. I think it probably sits in between the two. I still quite like it as an investment amongst that incumbent group.</p><p>JOHNSON: Why don't you like Apple?</p><p>HAWTIN: OK. So it is a tricky one because it's cheap. Apple is cheap.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>HAWTIN: And if I was a pension fund manager, I'd probably be more seriously considering it as the kind of company to have in the portfolio. But as a growth technology company, it's far from growth to be honest. Expectations of growth over the next couple years is a low single digit top line. If the X is actually less successful than is expected, and that seems to be what's panning out here, then actually growth could be full even lower than that. So it's going to be a low to no growth company with a number I think of longer term risks.</p><p>JOHNSON: It feels in many ways a bit like kind of Microsoft a few years ago. It's kind of not generating a lot of top line growth but it's kind of kicking off a lot of cash and in many ways it depends on what kind of investor you are as to your attitude to whether or not you own it.</p><p>HAWTIN: It does and it does depend on what they do to change their business roadmap.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>HAWTIN: And I think, you know, since the iPhone, there's not been an enormous amount of innovation. And even where there has been innovation, the opportunity for those innovative changes to create additional significant revenue are very limited against this massive sort of iceberg of iPhone unit sales. So I think that, you know, everyone is focusing on the service business now but that's coming under a lot of competitive pressure from companies like Amazon Prime Video, for example on the iTunes side.</p><p>JOHNSON: One thing that people talk about when they talk about big tech is the regulatory risk. And we were talking about this yesterday on the program. It feels like we're coming out of a kind of 15-year regulatory cram down for the telecom sector. Is there a discount that I need to apply coming back to phase (ph) to some of these stocks because of the potential regulatory position that we may be getting over the next few years? And is that why the market almost did what it did last year? It's beginning to kind of factor in external factors other than simply what they can do in terms of top and bottom line and kind of what the bigger trajectory is here? Like Mark Zuckerberg talks about this year, he's got to fix Facebook. From the investor point of view, that sounds quite serious.</p><p>HAWTIN: Yes. Well, he would say that obviously because he needs to make sure that he is saying the right things.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>HAWTIN: As such a large company, it's important that he is seen to be politically correct. And, you know, they are hiring another 15,000 people this year to monitor content and they're going to spend a lot of money doing that.</p><p>But I think that -- I think a lot of it has been factored in already and I think you're dead right. One of the reason why these growth names perhaps didn't do better last year was because of this perceived regulatory risk. But I think it will be an evolutionary factor. I don't think we're going to have a crashing down of regulation, which is going to heavily constrict these companies because to do that, quite frankly, it needs to be done on a global scale. And I cannot see a global initiative to crack down on the regulation of these businesses and no one country is going to want to risk being too aggressive themselves because then they risk vulcanizing themselves.</p><p>JOHNSON: So the Europeans who don't really have a tech sector to worry about.</p><p>HAWTIN: No, but they do I think realize that the internet is a vital part of their economy. The digital economy is becoming, you know, in many ways is because the physical economy. If you decide as one geographic unit to clamp down from a regulatory perspective and you risk the internet growth in your area, you're vulcanizing yourself and it could have long reaching consequences.</p><p>JOHNSON: Just from a kind of asset allocation point of view, do I overweight Asia and underweight Europe? Just kind of in sort of big picture here because of the fact that Asia has better tech companies and Europe doesn't have many. You've kind of named a couple already, SAP and so forth. But there aren't many. Is that a reason to be underweight Europe in 2018 do you think?</p><p>HAWTIN: I don't think it's right to make a decision on geographic allocation purely on how tech will do. And if you were going to make that decision, then you just continue to stick with the U.S.</p><p>JOHNSON: Right.</p><p>HAWTIN: I think it's interesting that although there's a perception that Asia is full of amazing technology companies, in reality, there are very few global leaders in Asia. There are some big players from a regional perspective, like the internet companies in China, but there are more global technology winners in Europe than there are in Asia. You know, there's SAP, there's SML leading their parts of the market.</p><p>JOHNSON: Right.</p><p>HAWTIN: There are very few real global leaders in Asia.</p><p>JOHNSON: Great to see you this morning, Mark. Thank you very much indeed --</p><p>HAWTIN: Thanks.</p><p>JOHNSON: -- for coming to see us here at Bloomberg.

So mostly it's counterintuitive, but I would probably say  the U.S. equities.</p><p> LEVINE:  When I look at the possibility of buying equities, I always think  from a value perspective maybe that is because I'm a bargain hunter by  nature.  U.S. equities seem to be pretty highly valued, I think 20 -- the  last time I checked, 23 times forward earnings compared to 15 or 16 times  forwards earnings here in Europe.  I realize there's a mix difference,  right, more tech stocks in the U.S.  But what do you think about value  hunting in this market?</p><p> HAWTIN:  OK.  So I think you've got to stick to, you know, strong  fundamental work.  And if you look within, I mean from the sector I cover  which is technology, so the sector I have the most knowledge about, I can  see that certain parts of that sector look quite stretched compared to  history.  Semiconductors, for example, where (INAUDIBLE) supposed have gone  up to well over 13 times from a low in 2011 in 5.5 times.  So there you had  a big valuation increase.</p><p> But if you look at big cap tech more broadly, it's actually trading  relative to the S&amp;P at the lower end of its range because some of these big  growth facets, these big growth countries have not rerated.  In fact,  according to a piece of research by Bernstein put out over the term of the  year, big cap tech has actually derated slightly in the last 12 months in  spite of share price performance.</p><p> LEVINE:  All right, thanks very much, Mark.</p><p> HAWTIN:  OK.</p><p> LEVINE:  We're going to continue to talk about the technology side of that  as well.  Glad you mentioned that because we're going to focus in on it.   Guy?</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes, absolutely, that is what's coming up.</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> JOHNSON:  Mark Hawtin is still with us, GAM Investment Director.  Let's  talk about tech kind of -- let's take a step back and kind of away from CES  and the razzle-dazzle of what is going on there.  Tech just had a great  run.  Is it going to continue to have a great run in 2018 and do I need to  be even more concentrated in the way that I hold tech because (INAUDIBLE)  this morning basically what it seems you are saying is that FANGS are going  to continue to do well.  But other areas, semis, et cetera may have such a  great year.</p><p> HAWTIN:  Yes.  So this is my view.  I think that overall, technology is not  as overvalued as you might think, looking at how shares performed last year  because earnings growth was extremely strong.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> HAWTIN:  But it's differentiated within the sector.  So for example, some  of the really big cap incumbent technology companies, companies like Cisco  or IBM or some of the semis companies have very pedestrian growth but their  share price performance are still strong.  So they got heavily rerated.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> HAWTIN:  Some of the FANG names, their growth was actually faster than  their share price performance so they actually got slightly derated.  So I  think they're going to be more and more selective in favor of growth and  away from what's perceived as value.  And that might well tie in as well  with any chance we'll start to get in bond yields because I think investors  will are tended to go for dividend yielding tech companies and that will  become less attractive as rates rise.</p><p> JOHNSON:  What does that mean for companies like Microsoft?</p><p> HAWTIN:  I think Microsoft struggles almost directly between the two in a  sense.  It's got some great growth initiatives particularly with its public  crowd offering.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> HAWTIN:  It has some incumbent businesses.  It has a yield.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Throws off a lot of cash too.</p><p> HAWTIN:  Throws off a lot of cash.  I think it probably sits in between the  two.  I still quite like it as an investment amongst that incumbent group.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Why don't you like Apple?</p><p> HAWTIN:  OK.  So it is a tricky one because it's cheap.  Apple is cheap.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> HAWTIN:  And if I was a pension fund manager, I'd probably be more  seriously considering it as the kind of company to have in the portfolio.   But as a growth technology company, it's far from growth to be honest.   Expectations of growth over the next couple years is a low single digit top  line.  If the X is actually less successful than is expected, and that  seems to be what's panning out here, then actually growth could be full  even lower than that.  So it's going to be a low to no growth company with  a number I think of longer term risks.</p><p> JOHNSON:  It feels in many ways a bit like kind of Microsoft a few years  ago.  It's kind of not generating a lot of top line growth but it's kind of  kicking off a lot of cash and in many ways it depends on what kind of  investor you are as to your attitude to whether or not you own it.</p><p> HAWTIN:  It does and it does depend on what they do to change their  business roadmap.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> HAWTIN:  And I think, you know, since the iPhone, there's not been an  enormous amount of innovation.  And even where there has been innovation,  the opportunity for those innovative changes to create additional  significant revenue are very limited against this massive sort of iceberg  of iPhone unit sales.  So I think that, you know, everyone is focusing on  the service business now but that's coming under a lot of competitive  pressure from companies like Amazon Prime Video, for example on the iTunes  side.</p><p> JOHNSON:  One thing that people talk about when they talk about big tech is  the regulatory risk.  And we were talking about this yesterday on the  program.  It feels like we're coming out of a kind of 15-year regulatory  cram down for the telecom sector.  Is there a discount that I need to apply  coming back to phase (ph) to some of these stocks because of the potential  regulatory position that we may be getting over the next few years?  And is  that why the market almost did what it did last year?  It's beginning to  kind of factor in external factors other than simply what they can do in  terms of top and bottom line and kind of what the bigger trajectory is  here?  Like Mark Zuckerberg talks about this year, he's got to fix  Facebook.  From the investor point of view, that sounds quite serious.</p><p> HAWTIN:  Yes.  Well, he would say that obviously because he needs to make  sure that he is saying the right things.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p> HAWTIN:  As such a large company, it's important that he is seen to be  politically correct.  And, you know, they are hiring another 15,000 people  this year to monitor content and they're going to spend a lot of money  doing that.</p><p> But I think that -- I think a lot of it has been factored in already and I  think you're dead right.  One of the reason why these growth names perhaps  didn't do better last year was because of this perceived regulatory risk.   But I think it will be an evolutionary factor.  I don't think we're going  to have a crashing down of regulation, which is going to heavily constrict  these companies because to do that, quite frankly, it needs to be done on a  global scale.  And I cannot see a global initiative to crack down on the  regulation of these businesses and no one country is going to want to risk  being too aggressive themselves because then they risk vulcanizing  themselves.</p><p> JOHNSON:  So the Europeans who don't really have a tech sector to worry  about.</p><p> HAWTIN:  No, but they do I think realize that the internet is a vital part  of their economy.  The digital economy is becoming, you know, in many ways  is because the physical economy.  If you decide as one geographic unit to  clamp down from a regulatory perspective and you risk the internet growth  in your area, you're vulcanizing yourself and it could have long reaching  consequences.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Just from a kind of asset allocation point of view, do I  overweight Asia and underweight Europe?  Just kind of in sort of big  picture here because of the fact that Asia has better tech companies and  Europe doesn't have many.  You've kind of named a couple already, SAP and  so forth.  But there aren't many.  Is that a reason to be underweight  Europe in 2018 do you think?</p><p> HAWTIN:  I don't think it's right to make a decision on geographic  allocation purely on how tech will do.  And if you were going to make that  decision, then you just continue to stick with the U.S.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p> HAWTIN:  I think it's interesting that although there's a perception that  Asia is full of amazing technology companies, in reality, there are very  few global leaders in Asia.  There are some big players from a regional  perspective, like the internet companies in China, but there are more  global technology winners in Europe than there are in Asia.  You know,  there's SAP, there's SML leading their parts of the market.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p> HAWTIN:  There are very few real global leaders in Asia.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Great to see you this morning, Mark.  Thank you very much indeed  --</p><p> HAWTIN:  Thanks.</p><p> JOHNSON:  -- for coming to see us here at Bloomberg.

Joining us now London is Mark Hawtin, Investment Director at GAM.   Mark, what do you think about really the story of the day, I've had to say  is the prospect of rising yields?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARK HAWTIN, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR, GAM:  I think it's an interesting term.   We've had a really strong start to markets in the first week of January.   There are clearly some issues that investors are beginning to look at.  But  for me, I think one needs to guide in the inflation outlook.  It's all  going to be about how the inflation prints come through from a fundamental  points of view unless the market might be positioning for worse inflation  data.  I think that from a fundamental perspective, that's what needs to be  focused on most and Friday obviously is a key day for that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GUY JOHNSON, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Yes, U.S. CPI will deliver it on Friday.   If inflation starts to tick higher, if yields start to go higher, how does  that change how I invest in equities?</p><p>HAWTIN:  Well, I think it will have an impact.  Always when market move  away from the perceived view, you get changes.  So I think the initial  position will be that markets will probably sell off if we get a big tick  up in yields and inflation data comes through stronger than expected.  But  I think as long as it's measured, equities will still be OK in the medium  to longer term.</p><p>LEVINE:  Isn't that the trade-off, Mark?  I mean, if I'm sitting here with  cash to put to work, the last thing I want to do is put it in bonds if  we're looking at a bear market here, especially if I'm not going to get any  return anyway.  The only place to go is equities.</p><p>HAWTIN:  Yes, I mean, obviously as an equity investor, I'd have to agree  with that.  But I think what tends to happen is that when you get the kind  of shock effect initially, it affects all asset classes.  So I think it  will actually give you probably a better opportunity on a very short-term  basis, perhaps a better to buy because it's all a bit cheaper.</p><p>JOHNSON:  But in terms of how I position within the market -- I want to get  this chart up so I can show you what is going on here.  If rates go higher,  how does that affect my kind of cyclical value balance?  Cyclicals have  been doing relatively well.  Financial -- you saw it yesterday in the S&amp;P,  markets sold kind of bond proxies and bought into financials, et cetera.   Is that the rotation that you would now expect to start to really sort of  gain even more traction?</p><p>HAWTIN:  I'm not sure.  I think in General, cyclical assets and growth  assets actually tend to do quite well in rising rate environment --</p><p>JOHNSON:  OK.</p><p>HAWTIN:  -- because we're seeing continued and stronger growth than  expected coming through.  So apart again from the initial shock factor, I  think we will see growth assets in particular doing very well in a steady  raising right environment.</p><p>JOHNSON:  But it's all about the delta, it's all about the rate of change?</p><p>HAWTIN:  Correct.</p><p>JOHNSON:  And in terms of how does this work from my geographical point of  view, is -- the U.S. is later in the cycle.  Do I kind of rethink what I'm  doing in the U.S. versus what's happening in Europe?  Europe doesn't have  much tech.  We'll talk about tech a little bit later on.  Is that a  hindrance in this kind of environment?  How do I position myself around the  world?</p><p>HAWTIN:  Well, I think we've already seen from the U.S. equity point of  view, we've obviously already seen the tightening cycle beginning.  So some  of the shock factor is already built in there.  If we were to start to see  that occurring in Europe or in Japan, then you've probably got the shock  factor to come.  So mostly it's counterintuitive, but I would probably say  the U.S. equities.</p><p>LEVINE:  When I look at the possibility of buying equities, I always think  from a value perspective maybe that is because I'm a bargain hunter by  nature.  U.S. equities seem to be pretty highly valued, I think 20 -- the  last time I checked, 23 times forward earnings compared to 15 or 16 times  forwards earnings here in Europe.  I realize there's a mix difference,  right, more tech stocks in the U.S.  But what do you think about value  hunting in this market?</p><p>HAWTIN:  OK.  So I think you've got to stick to, you know, strong  fundamental work.  And if you look within, I mean from the sector I cover  which is technology, so the sector I have the most knowledge about, I can  see that certain parts of that sector look quite stretched compared to  history.

So I think that, you know, everyone is focusing on  the service business now but that's coming under a lot of competitive  pressure from companies like Amazon Prime Video, for example on the iTunes  side.</p><p>JOHNSON:  One thing that people talk about when they talk about big tech is  the regulatory risk.  And we were talking about this yesterday on the  program.  It feels like we're coming out of a kind of 15-year regulatory  cram down for the telecom sector.  Is there a discount that I need to apply  coming back to phase (ph) to some of these stocks because of the potential  regulatory position that we may be getting over the next few years?  And is  that why the market almost did what it did last year?  It's beginning to  kind of factor in external factors other than simply what they can do in  terms of top and bottom line and kind of what the bigger trajectory is  here?  Like Mark Zuckerberg talks about this year, he's got to fix  Facebook.  From the investor point of view, that sounds quite serious.</p><p>HAWTIN:  Yes.  Well, he would say that obviously because he needs to make  sure that he is saying the right things.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Yes.</p><p>HAWTIN:  As such a large company, it's important that he is seen to be  politically correct.  And, you know, they are hiring another 15,000 people  this year to monitor content and they're going to spend a lot of money  doing that.</p><p>But I think that -- I think a lot of it has been factored in already and I  think you're dead right.  One of the reason why these growth names perhaps  didn't do better last year was because of this perceived regulatory risk.   But I think it will be an evolutionary factor.  I don't think we're going  to have a crashing down of regulation, which is going to heavily constrict  these companies because to do that, quite frankly, it needs to be done on a  global scale.  And I cannot see a global initiative to crack down on the  regulation of these businesses and no one country is going to want to risk  being too aggressive themselves because then they risk vulcanizing  themselves.</p><p>JOHNSON:  So the Europeans who don't really have a tech sector to worry  about.</p><p>HAWTIN:  No, but they do I think realize that the internet is a vital part  of their economy.  The digital economy is becoming, you know, in many ways  is because the physical economy.  If you decide as one geographic unit to  clamp down from a regulatory perspective and you risk the internet growth  in your area, you're vulcanizing yourself and it could have long reaching  consequences.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Just from a kind of asset allocation point of view, do I  overweight Asia and underweight Europe?  Just kind of in sort of big  picture here because of the fact that Asia has better tech companies and  Europe doesn't have many.  You've kind of named a couple already, SAP and  so forth.  But there aren't many.  Is that a reason to be underweight  Europe in 2018 do you think?</p><p>HAWTIN:  I don't think it's right to make a decision on geographic  allocation purely on how tech will do.  And if you were going to make that  decision, then you just continue to stick with the U.S.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p>HAWTIN:  I think it's interesting that although there's a perception that  Asia is full of amazing technology companies, in reality, there are very  few global leaders in Asia.  There are some big players from a regional  perspective, like the internet companies in China, but there are more  global technology winners in Europe than there are in Asia.  You know,  there's SAP, there's SML leading their parts of the market.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Right.</p><p>HAWTIN:  There are very few real global leaders in Asia.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Great to see you this morning, Mark.

Joining us now London is Mark Hawtin, Investment Director at GAM. Mark, what do you think about really the story of the day, I've had to say is the prospect of rising yields?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARK HAWTIN, INVESTMENT DIRECTOR, GAM: I think it's an interesting term. We've had a really strong start to markets in the first week of January. There are clearly some issues that investors are beginning to look at. But for me, I think one needs to guide in the inflation outlook. It's all going to be about how the inflation prints come through from a fundamental points of view unless the market might be positioning for worse inflation data. I think that from a fundamental perspective, that's what needs to be focused on most and Friday obviously is a key day for that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GUY JOHNSON, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Yes, U.S. CPI will deliver it on Friday. If inflation starts to tick higher, if yields start to go higher, how does that change how I invest in equities?</p><p>HAWTIN: Well, I think it will have an impact. Always when market move away from the perceived view, you get changes. So I think the initial position will be that markets will probably sell off if we get a big tick up in yields and inflation data comes through stronger than expected. But I think as long as it's measured, equities will still be OK in the medium to longer term.</p><p>LEVINE: Isn't that the trade-off, Mark? I mean, if I'm sitting here with cash to put to work, the last thing I want to do is put it in bonds if we're looking at a bear market here, especially if I'm not going to get any return anyway. The only place to go is equities.</p><p>HAWTIN: Yes, I mean, obviously as an equity investor, I'd have to agree with that. But I think what tends to happen is that when you get the kind of shock effect initially, it affects all asset classes. So I think it will actually give you probably a better opportunity on a very short-term basis, perhaps a better to buy because it's all a bit cheaper.</p><p>JOHNSON: But in terms of how I position within the market -- I want to get this chart up so I can show you what is going on here. If rates go higher, how does that affect my kind of cyclical value balance? Cyclicals have been doing relatively well. Financial -- you saw it yesterday in the S&amp;P, markets sold kind of bond proxies and bought into financials, et cetera. Is that the rotation that you would now expect to start to really sort of gain even more traction?</p><p>HAWTIN: I'm not sure. I think in General, cyclical assets and growth assets actually tend to do quite well in rising rate environment --</p><p>JOHNSON: OK.</p><p>HAWTIN: -- because we're seeing continued and stronger growth than expected coming through. So apart again from the initial shock factor, I think we will see growth assets in particular doing very well in a steady raising right environment.</p><p>JOHNSON: But it's all about the delta, it's all about the rate of change?</p><p>HAWTIN: Correct.</p><p>JOHNSON: And in terms of how does this work from my geographical point of view, is -- the U.S. is later in the cycle. Do I kind of rethink what I'm doing in the U.S. versus what's happening in Europe? Europe doesn't have much tech. We'll talk about tech a little bit later on. Is that a hindrance in this kind of environment? How do I position myself around the world?</p><p>HAWTIN: Well, I think we've already seen from the U.S. equity point of view, we've obviously already seen the tightening cycle beginning. So some of the shock factor is already built in there. If we were to start to see that occurring in Europe or in Japan, then you've probably got the shock factor to come. So mostly it's counterintuitive, but I would probably say the U.S. equities.</p><p>LEVINE: When I look at the possibility of buying equities, I always think from a value perspective maybe that is because I'm a bargain hunter by nature. U.S. equities seem to be pretty highly valued, I think 20 -- the last time I checked, 23 times forward earnings compared to 15 or 16 times forwards earnings here in Europe. I realize there's a mix difference, right, more tech stocks in the U.S. But what do you think about value hunting in this market?</p><p>HAWTIN: OK. So I think you've got to stick to, you know, strong fundamental work. And if you look within, I mean from the sector I cover which is technology, so the sector I have the most knowledge about, I can see that certain parts of that sector look quite stretched compared to history. Semiconductors, for example, where (INAUDIBLE) supposed have gone up to well over 13 times from a low in 2011 in 5.5 times. So there you had a big valuation increase.</p><p>But if you look at big cap tech more broadly, it's actually trading relative to the S&amp;P at the lower end of its range because some of these big growth facets, these big growth countries have not rerated. In fact, according to a piece of research by Bernstein put out over the term of the year, big cap tech has actually derated slightly in the last 12 months in spite of share price performance.</p><p>LEVINE: All right, thanks very much, Mark.</p><p>HAWTIN: OK.</p><p>LEVINE: We're going to continue to talk about the technology side of that as well. Glad you mentioned that because we're going to focus in on it. Guy?</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes, absolutely, that is what's coming up.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>JOHNSON: Mark Hawtin is still with us, GAM Investment Director. Let's talk about tech kind of -- let's take a step back and kind of away from CES and the razzle-dazzle of what is going on there. Tech just had a great run. Is it going to continue to have a great run in 2018 and do I need to be even more concentrated in the way that I hold tech because (INAUDIBLE) this morning basically what it seems you are saying is that FANGS are going to continue to do well. But other areas, semis, et cetera may have such a great year.</p><p>HAWTIN: Yes. So this is my view. I think that overall, technology is not as overvalued as you might think, looking at how shares performed last year because earnings growth was extremely strong.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>HAWTIN: But it's differentiated within the sector. So for example, some of the really big cap incumbent technology companies, companies like Cisco or IBM or some of the semis companies have very pedestrian growth but their share price performance are still strong. So they got heavily rerated.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>HAWTIN: Some of the FANG names, their growth was actually faster than their share price performance so they actually got slightly derated. So I think they're going to be more and more selective in favor of growth and away from what's perceived as value. And that might well tie in as well with any chance we'll start to get in bond yields because I think investors will are tended to go for dividend yielding tech companies and that will become less attractive as rates rise.</p><p>JOHNSON: What does that mean for companies like Microsoft?</p><p>HAWTIN: I think Microsoft struggles almost directly between the two in a sense. It's got some great growth initiatives particularly with its public crowd offering.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>HAWTIN: It has some incumbent businesses. It has a yield.</p><p>JOHNSON: Throws off a lot of cash too.</p><p>HAWTIN: Throws off a lot of cash. I think it probably sits in between the two. I still quite like it as an investment amongst that incumbent group.</p><p>JOHNSON: Why don't you like Apple?</p><p>HAWTIN: OK. So it is a tricky one because it's cheap. Apple is cheap.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>HAWTIN: And if I was a pension fund manager, I'd probably be more seriously considering it as the kind of company to have in the portfolio. But as a growth technology company, it's far from growth to be honest. Expectations of growth over the next couple years is a low single digit top line. If the X is actually less successful than is expected, and that seems to be what's panning out here, then actually growth could be full even lower than that. So it's going to be a low to no growth company with a number I think of longer term risks.</p><p>JOHNSON: It feels in many ways a bit like kind of Microsoft a few years ago. It's kind of not generating a lot of top line growth but it's kind of kicking off a lot of cash and in many ways it depends on what kind of investor you are as to your attitude to whether or not you own it.</p><p>HAWTIN: It does and it does depend on what they do to change their business roadmap.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>HAWTIN: And I think, you know, since the iPhone, there's not been an enormous amount of innovation. And even where there has been innovation, the opportunity for those innovative changes to create additional significant revenue are very limited against this massive sort of iceberg of iPhone unit sales. So I think that, you know, everyone is focusing on the service business now but that's coming under a lot of competitive pressure from companies like Amazon Prime Video, for example on the iTunes side.</p><p>JOHNSON: One thing that people talk about when they talk about big tech is the regulatory risk. And we were talking about this yesterday on the program. It feels like we're coming out of a kind of 15-year regulatory cram down for the telecom sector. Is there a discount that I need to apply coming back to phase (ph) to some of these stocks because of the potential regulatory position that we may be getting over the next few years? And is that why the market almost did what it did last year? It's beginning to kind of factor in external factors other than simply what they can do in terms of top and bottom line and kind of what the bigger trajectory is here? Like Mark Zuckerberg talks about this year, he's got to fix Facebook. From the investor point of view, that sounds quite serious.</p><p>HAWTIN: Yes. Well, he would say that obviously because he needs to make sure that he is saying the right things.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>HAWTIN: As such a large company, it's important that he is seen to be politically correct. And, you know, they are hiring another 15,000 people this year to monitor content and they're going to spend a lot of money doing that.</p><p>But I think that -- I think a lot of it has been factored in already and I think you're dead right. One of the reason why these growth names perhaps didn't do better last year was because of this perceived regulatory risk. But I think it will be an evolutionary factor. I don't think we're going to have a crashing down of regulation, which is going to heavily constrict these companies because to do that, quite frankly, it needs to be done on a global scale. And I cannot see a global initiative to crack down on the regulation of these businesses and no one country is going to want to risk being too aggressive themselves because then they risk vulcanizing themselves.</p><p>JOHNSON: So the Europeans who don't really have a tech sector to worry about.</p><p>HAWTIN: No, but they do I think realize that the internet is a vital part of their economy. The digital economy is becoming, you know, in many ways is because the physical economy. If you decide as one geographic unit to clamp down from a regulatory perspective and you risk the internet growth in your area, you're vulcanizing yourself and it could have long reaching consequences.</p><p>JOHNSON: Just from a kind of asset allocation point of view, do I overweight Asia and underweight Europe? Just kind of in sort of big picture here because of the fact that Asia has better tech companies and Europe doesn't have many. You've kind of named a couple already, SAP and so forth.

It was the top performer in 2017 with a 37 per cent gain, and is number one again so far this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It\"s the most dominant sector in the market, now representing 25 per cent of the S&amp;P 500 index.</p><p>However, there are signs of increasing challenges on the horizon. While all those exciting disruptors still have very strong prospects, the outlook has become a little more complicated.</p><p>Earnings growth remains well and truly in favour of the tech sector, with profits forecast to grow an impressive 22 per cent this quarter, compared to the same period a year ago. That\"s well ahead of the S&amp;P 500 average, which is also impressive at 17 per cent.</p><p>Netflix shares hit a record high last week on the back of a great result, which exceeded expectations. I\"ll be surprised if we don\"t see some equally impressive headlines from the likes of Amazon, Visa, Google and friends.</p><p>On the other side of the ledger, rising interest rates and increasing government scrutiny have taken the shine off some of the big tech companies. On the back of an improving economy, better wage growth and expectations of rising inflation, US interest rates are going up. The two-year Treasury yield is at the highest since 2008, and the Fed Funds Rate will soon surpass our Official Cash Rate for the first time in 17 years.</p><p>That\"s a headwind for companies in the tech sector, or at least their share prices.</p><p>While sales and customer numbers are growing strongly, many still post only modest profits. Much of their valuation hinges on the profits we expect them to earn in the future, sometimes years from now.</p><p>When interest rates are very low, the opportunity cost of waiting for those profits and dividends to arrive is low. Investors aren\"t missing much, because they aren\"t getting any return in cash or bonds anyway.</p><p>As interest rates rise, that all changes. The opportunity cost of waiting rises, as those other asset classes all of a sudden generate a half-decent income, for very little risk.</p><p>In short, because the earnings streams for many tech companies are long dated, investors may not be willing to pay as much for them as interest rates rise.</p><p>Then there\"s the prospect of increasing regulation, which is also a risk to some in the sector. We hadn\"t heard of most of these companies 10 years ago, but today they are intertwined in our lives and we\"ve become dependent on them.</p><p>They\"ve established dominant positions in their industries, and it has become so difficult for competitors. They\"ve become monopolies in some ways.</p><p>Having strong market power is a sure-fire way to attract the attention of regulators, while questionable behaviour around privacy issues has also raised the ire of the authorities.</p><p>The tech sector is wide and varied, and these risks don\"t apply across the board to every company. The growth prospects are as exciting as they\"ve ever been, so despite a few headwinds, the tech sector will still tick a lot of boxes for many long-term investors. However, it might not be plain sailing from here on.</p><p>bull Mark Lister is Head of Private Wealth Research at Craigs Investment Partners.

Why? Most experts will tell you to spread your dollars among multiple asset classes, Markman says. Indeed, they'll tout the benefits of foreign diversification. Or explain why you must own small-cap stocks. Or sell you on the long-term potential of value-style funds. There's just one problem. That strategy, Markman says, results in poor results. \"The conventional wisdom in the fund world may be conventional, but it's not wisdom,\" wrote Markman in his new book, \"Hazardous to your Wealth: Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Mutual Fund Experts.\" \"All the fancy charts, arcane terminology and pseudo-scientific research can't hide one uncomfortable fact: The 'smart money' - the experts - have been turning in crummy results for some time.\" So what's Markman's recipe for investment success? Build an all-American portfolio of large-cap U.S. stock funds with big tech stakes - and resist the temptation to trade. \"It's probable that you're much better off keeping the equity portion of your portfolio right in your own backyard,\" Markman wrote, adding that short-term money should be invested in risk-free investments like cash and short-term bonds. While Markman calls his strategy simple, critics say it's irresponsible, inappropriate and even dangerous. \"His approach is dead wrong because it's a bet on a single market and a single asset class,\" said Harold Evensky, a Coral Gables, Fla.</p><p>-based financial planner who is a staunch defender of portfolio diversification and asset allocation. \"If Markman is right and someone follows that strategy, he might be rich. But if he's wrong, he might end up poor.\" Markman disagrees. Planners like Evensky, he says, are overly cautious. They mistakenly equate short-term volatility with risk. Planners focus too much on protecting capital rather than building wealth, Markman believes. Rather than zeroing in on investments with the best long-term return potential, such as U.S. blue chips, they spread the risk among a bunch of investments. That strategy increases the odds that at any given time some portion of your portfolio will do well. It also means some holdings will fare poorly. \"Deviations from long-term strategies in reaction to shorter-term events are most likely to detract value from your portfolio,\" Markman wrote. \"The rule is that the connection between volatility and risk decreases as the time increases.\" If the fund industry is guilty of anything, it is that they have \"been schooled on nonpredictive communications,\" said Geoff Bobroff, a fund industry consultant. Concentrating one's bets on America's biggest, fastest-growing companies has worked wonders the past five years, as U.S. big caps outperformed other types of stocks by a wide margin. Markman expects that trend to continue. The U.S. Advantage Why? U.S. companies have decided advantages over their foreign counterparts in today's global, high-tech economy, he argues. Wall Street benefits from stringent regulations, which results in an honest playing field, Markman says. That reduces the chances of market meltdowns caused by Russian-style corruption or the crony capitalism practiced in Asia. America's entrepreneurial spirit, superior colleges and the ease of quickly allocating capital to new ideas also help U.S. companies. America's biggest corporations also enjoy competitive advantages over foreign rivals and smaller companies, he says. Their vast resources give them an edge in marketing and R&amp;D. Markman isn't saying that value stocks, small caps and foreign stock markets won't outperform U.S. large caps from time to time. Just that investing in U.S. blue chips is a sound long-term strategy that will increase your odds of achieving your long-term financial goals. Markman is highly critical of \"tactical asset allocation.\" That strategy requires planners to tweak a client's asset mix to increase potential return or decrease risk. A Matter Of Timing But there's a downside, Markman said. Reducing your holdings in, say, \"overvalued\" U.S. blue chips and adding to your stake in \"undervalued\" value stocks is basically market timing in disguise. If value doesn't rebound, \"you'll have little chance of achieving decent returns,\" Markman wrote. The other problem is that \"at some point, this portfolio will be subject to another decision\" - when to cut back on value stocks. \"If you're an investor with a 10- to 20-year time horizon, shifting assets based on how you think tech stocks may perform over the next six to 12 months is, frankly, schizophrenic,\" according to Markman. One problem with Markman's strategy, critics say, is that it requires investors to stay committed to large-cap growth stocks in down markets. Most investors say they have long- time horizons, but in reality their holding period is much shorter, says Sheldon Jacobs, editor of The No-Load Fund Investor. Thus, betting on one asset class may be a risky strategy for investors who may need to tap their accounts to pay for college or purchase a home. \"Nothing is forever,\" Jacobs said. \"He's assuming the trend of large-cap performance is permanent. At some point, small caps and other asset classes will do better.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2000</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3YT4-HYK0-003M-X4FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"897\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Investor's Business Daily</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2000 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"01\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>January 25, 2000</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000342</classCode><className>COMPANY STRATEGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009FY9</classCode><className>EXPERIMENTATION &amp; RESEARCH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>N525910GG</classCode><className>MUTUAL FUNDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001821</classCode><className>WEALTH MANAGEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00093QP</classCode><className>FINANCIAL PLANNING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000198</classCode><className>BONDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>GS125</classCode><className>FLORIDA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Emily? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Mark, thank you so much.  Joining us now the new CEO of Expedia, Mark Okerstrom from Expedia Headquarters in Redmond, Washington.  </p><p>      Mark, thank you for joining us and congratulations.  I know it's been a dramatic last few days.  So I'm curious from your perspective, how did Dara tell you that he was considering this job and what was your reaction?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OKERSTROM</emphasis>:  Well, you know, these things that you talked about them for years, you -- something like a sports analogy, you prepare the team for the big game.And you get a call on Sunday night and suddenly the game is in two weeks from now, it's in fact, tomorrow.  </p><p>      So it kind of unfolded a little bit like that.  I think we were all ready for this events reality when it did unfold.  I don't think it unfolded exactly how everyone would plan, but I think we're all pretty excited around Expedia.  We're very happy for Dara and, you know, I'm really happy for the people at Uber, I think he's going to do a fantastic job there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Now, when it comes to you and your job, Barry Diller said no one else was even considered.  I know that you and Dara have been working together for many, many years.  </p><p>      But, you know, what is your vision?  What are some things that you might do differently?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OKERSTROM</emphasis>:  Well, you know, as I've said I've been very involved in the strategic direction of this company for a very long time.  Dara and I really have been locked, stepped in, in really all of the major strategic decisions along with our Chairman Barry Diller.  </p><p>      So I really don't have a long list of things that I'm dying to change.  We've got a number of priorities across the company, certainly, becoming more international as one of our key priorities.  </p><p>      So I'll be very focus on making sure we continue to expand globally.  The big transition we're doing at HomeAway is a huge priority.  </p><p>      So I think you're going to see a lot more of the same for us and if I do my job well maybe we can go even a little bit faster.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So let's talk about that.  You now have some deep ties to Uber's new CEO, what are some new way that you could work together, like perhaps, free Uber rides for Expedia customers?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OKERSTROM</emphasis>:  You know, we've talked a long time about possible ways that we could work with Uber, integrating our service in to the Expedia app, of the hotels.com app or the HomeAway app.  </p><p>      I'm hopeful then in the future now that we've got a direct connection, those talks might be a little bit easier.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Dara is walking in to an incredibly challenging situation by all accounts, an ousted founder who still wants a role in the company, several lawsuits, very difficult board dynamics.  </p><p>      I mean, we've heard a lot about how he can deal with big personalities.  Tell us a little bit more about, you know, what -- why you think he has what it takes to take on some of these personnel challenges?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OKERSTROM</emphasis>:  Well, I think above all, you know, Dara has one of the highest levels of emotional intelligence that I've ever seen.  </p><p>      He knows people, he is humble, he listens.  And I think above all, you know, Dara makes the people around him better.  </p><p>      People want to be around him, people want to think like he does. He's a great role model, he's a man of high integrity, he values diversity, he values gender balance.  </p><p>      He really stands for a lot of the great things that from what we read anyways maybe lacking in Uber.  </p><p>      So I have 100 percent confidence that Uber is going to be a much better company under Dara's leadership.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Now, the information retracted, a report that you were going with Dara to Uber, they were wrong.  But there is a point there that Dara has a lot of executive positions to fill.  </p><p>      Are you at all concern that a number of executives from Expedia are going to follow him there?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OKERSTROM</emphasis>:  Well, listen, I think we feel very good about our executive team.  We've got I think one of the most talented executive teams out there.  </p><p>      We've been together for a very long time and they're really excited about the prospects around Expedia, Inc.  They're highly engaged, they're highly committed.  </p><p>      We've been working together on a strategy that were not yet done. So there's lots of work yet to do ahead of us and I think we've been pretty good about our team.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  So speaking about Expedia specifically, Google in particular is becoming a bigger potential threat.  They're making bigger moves in the travel business.  </p><p>      Do you see more opportunities there to take them on from a U.S. antitrust perspective as they make these moves and given this political climate, the skepticism around big tech in general?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OKERSTROM</emphasis>:  Well, I think we're going to continue to protect our interest have we -- as we always has.  I mean, Google is has been and we expect continue it will be a really great partner for us.  </p><p>      Now, they obviously have a very powerful position in the industry both in the U.S. and around the world.  </p><p>      We encourage regulators to keep them in check so that we can continue to have a healthy economy.  </p><p>      Meanwhile, organically, we're very focus on making sure that we execute strategies to ensure that we're always the first place for people to come to shop and book their travel.  </p><p>      I think there are combination of all of that, it will mostly be fine and I hope we'll have a constructive and positive relationship with Google for many, many years to come.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Meantime, Airbnb continues to grow, of course, you guys have HomeAway.  But are you happy with your home rental business or do you think you still have a long way to go to catch up to Airbnb?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OKERSTROM</emphasis>:  Yes, well, you know, we're never happy with anything to be honest.  We want our business to be significantly larger.  This is a massive industry, 100 billion dollars of vacation rental bookings every year.  </p><p>      That's probably an understatement of the opportunity ahead.  I think Airbnb has done an exceptional job of creating huge amount of awareness around the category.  </p><p>      And we're very fortunate to be in the position where we've got a business that is on the phenomenal trajectory to step up, you know, alongside Airbnb.  </p><p>      Our experience has been in our industry that there's always room for two.  We think that Airbnb is going to be a great success and we also think that HomeAway is going to be a great success within the Expedia family.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  What about when it comes to Priceline there, you know, making bigger moves with Booking.com especially in your home market, how would characterize competition from Priceline and its intensity?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OKERSTROM</emphasis>:  Well, it's been intense for, let's see, the last, you know, 15 years really since the beginning of our competition and I expect that to continue.  </p><p>      In terms of changes, I think no major change, you know, Priceline, Booking.com really exceptional companies.  And we have the outmost respect for them.  </p><p>      They're making good progress in the U.S. as far as we can tell. We're making good progress in Europe and Asia, and Latin America as far as we can tell versus them.  </p><p>      And again, I think there's room for both of them, both of us. And I think we'll both have great futures ahead of us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Dara was very outspoken about politics especially when it came to President Trump.  Do you think he will take a similar approach when it comes to not just policy issues but also moral issues?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OKERSTROM</emphasis>:  Well, I think that we have a very important role as senior executives of companies to speak out against those things that are, you know, against our company's interest and against the interest of our employees.  </p><p>      So I will take, you know, as active role is required to do these things on a go forward basis.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  Now, one last question.  When it comes to global growth, Ctrip.com also making some big moves around the world, where do you see the biggest competition coming from them?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OKERSTROM</emphasis>:  Well, I think certainly, you know, China and Asia is the competitive grounds for Ctrip.  They're also an excellent competitor.  </p><p>      You know, I've just say that in an industry as large as travel which is at 1.4 trillion dollar industry where online penetration around the world is, you know, shy of 50 percent where the opportunities are so huge, you're going to have competitors that are -- that are fierce competitors and strong competitors everywhere you look.  </p><p>      We've got many of them.  I expect that'll continue for a long period of time.  But we're happy with our progress, we've got a good relationship with Ctrip.  We expect all of that could continue in the future.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  All right.  Mark Okerstrom, new CEO of Expedia.  Mark, thanks for joining us on your first, second day on the job, I guess it is.  Mark Barton --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OKERSTROM</emphasis>:  Exactly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CHANG</emphasis>:  -- I'll send it back to you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">OKERSTROM</emphasis>:  Thanks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BARTON</emphasis>:  Emily, great job.  Thanks for joining us today, Bloomberg's Emily Chang there speaking to the new Chief Executive of Expedia.

They're making bigger moves in the  travel business.</p><p> Do you see more opportunities there to take them on from a U.S. antitrust  perspective as they make these moves and given this political climate, the  skepticism around big tech in general?</p><p> OKERSTROM:  Well, I think we're going to continue to protect our interest  have we -- as we always has.  I mean, Google is has been and we expect  continue it will be a really great partner for us.</p><p> Now, they obviously have a very powerful position in the industry both in  the U.S. and around the world.</p><p> We encourage regulators to keep them in check so that we can continue to  have a healthy economy.</p><p> Meanwhile, organically, we're very focus on making sure that we execute  strategies to ensure that we're always the first place for people to come  to shop and book their travel.</p><p> I think there are combination of all of that, it will mostly be fine and I  hope we'll have a constructive and positive relationship with Google for  many, many years to come.</p><p> CHANG:  Meantime, Airbnb continues to grow, of course, you guys have  HomeAway.  But are you happy with your home rental business or do you think  you still have a long way to go to catch up to Airbnb?</p><p> OKERSTROM:  Yes, well, you know, we're never happy with anything to be  honest.  We want our business to be significantly larger.  This is a  massive industry, 100 billion dollars of vacation rental bookings every  year.</p><p> That's probably an understatement of the opportunity ahead.  I think Airbnb  has done an exceptional job of creating huge amount of awareness around the  category.</p><p> And we're very fortunate to be in the position where we've got a business  that is on the phenomenal trajectory to step up, you know, alongside  Airbnb.</p><p> Our experience has been in our industry that there's always room for two.   We think that Airbnb is going to be a great success and we also think that  HomeAway is going to be a great success within the Expedia family.</p><p> CHANG:  What about when it comes to Priceline there, you know, making  bigger moves with Booking.com especially in your home market, how would  characterize competition from Priceline and its intensity?</p><p> OKERSTROM:  Well, it's been intense for, let's see, the last, you know, 15  years really since the beginning of our competition and I expect that to  continue.</p><p> In terms of changes, I think no major change, you know, Priceline,  Booking.com really exceptional companies.  And we have the outmost respect  for them.</p><p> They're making good progress in the U.S. as far as we can tell.  We're  making good progress in Europe and Asia, and Latin America as far as we can  tell versus them.</p><p> And again, I think there's room for both of them, both of us.  And I think  we'll both have great futures ahead of us.</p><p> CHANG:  Dara was very outspoken about politics especially when it came to  President Trump.  Do you think he will take a similar approach when it  comes to not just policy issues but also moral issues?</p><p> OKERSTROM:  Well, I think that we have a very important role as senior  executives of companies to speak out against those things that are, you  know, against our company's interest and against the interest of our  employees.</p><p> So I will take, you know, as active role is required to do these things on  a go forward basis.</p><p> CHANG:  Now, one last question.  When it comes to global growth, Ctrip.com  also making some big moves around the world, where do you see the biggest  competition coming from them?</p><p> OKERSTROM:  Well, I think certainly, you know, China and Asia is the  competitive grounds for Ctrip.  They're also an excellent competitor.</p><p> You know, I've just say that in an industry as large as travel which is at  1.4 trillion dollar industry where online penetration around the world is,  you know, shy of 50 percent where the opportunities are so huge, you're  going to have competitors that are -- that are fierce competitors and  strong competitors everywhere you look.</p><p> We've got many of them.  I expect that'll continue for a long period of  time.  But we're happy with our progress, we've got a good relationship  with Ctrip.  We expect all of that could continue in the future.</p><p> CHANG:  All right.  Mark Okerstrom, new CEO of Expedia.  Mark, thanks for  joining us on your first, second day on the job, I guess it is.  Mark  Barton --</p><p> OKERSTROM:  Exactly.</p><p> CHANG:  -- I'll send it back to you.</p><p> OKERSTROM:  Thanks.</p><p> BARTON:  Emily, great job.  Thanks for joining us today, Bloomberg's Emily  Chang there speaking to the new Chief Executive of Expedia.

Emily?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Mark, thank you so much. Joining us now the new CEO of <person><nameText>Expedia, </nameText></person><person><nameText>Mark Okerstrom </nameText></person>from <person><nameText>Expedia </nameText></person>Headquarters in Redmond, Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mark, thank you for joining us and congratulations. I know it's been a dramatic last few days. So I'm curious from your perspective, how did Dara tell you that he was considering this job and what was your reaction?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK OKERSTROM, </nameText></person>CEO, <person><nameText>EXPEDIA</nameText></person>: Well, you know, these things that you talked about them for years, you -- something like a sports analogy, you prepare the team for the big game.And you get a call on Sunday night and suddenly the game is in two weeks from now, it's in fact, tomorrow.</p><p>So it kind of unfolded a little bit like that. I think we were all ready for this events reality when it did unfold. I don't think it unfolded exactly how everyone would plan, but I think we're all pretty excited around <person><nameText>Expedia. </nameText></person>We're very happy for Dara and, you know, I'm really happy for the people at Uber, I think he's going to do a fantastic job there.</p><p>CHANG: Now, when it comes to you and your job, Barry Diller said no one else was even considered. I know that you and Dara have been working together for many, many years.</p><p>But, you know, what is your vision? What are some things that you might do differently?</p><p>OKERSTROM: Well, you know, as I've said I've been very involved in the strategic direction of this company for a very long time. Dara and I really have been locked, stepped in, in really all of the major strategic decisions along with our Chairman Barry Diller.</p><p>So I really don't have a long list of things that I'm dying to change. We've got a number of priorities across the company, certainly, becoming more international as one of our key priorities.</p><p>So I'll be very focus on making sure we continue to expand globally. The big transition we're doing at HomeAway is a huge priority.</p><p>So I think you're going to see a lot more of the same for us and if I do my job well maybe we can go even a little bit faster.</p><p>CHANG: So let's talk about that. You now have some deep ties to Uber's new CEO, what are some new way that you could work together, like perhaps, free Uber rides for <person><nameText>Expedia </nameText></person>customers?</p><p>OKERSTROM: You know, we've talked a long time about possible ways that we could work with Uber, integrating our service in to the <person><nameText>Expedia </nameText></person>app, of the hotels.com app or the HomeAway app.</p><p>I'm hopeful then in the future now that we've got a direct connection, those talks might be a little bit easier.</p><p>CHANG: Dara is walking in to an incredibly challenging situation by all accounts, an ousted founder who still wants a role in the company, several lawsuits, very difficult board dynamics.</p><p>I mean, we've heard a lot about how he can deal with big personalities. Tell us a little bit more about, you know, what -- why you think he has what it takes to take on some of these personnel challenges?</p><p>OKERSTROM: Well, I think above all, you know, Dara has one of the highest levels of emotional intelligence that I've ever seen.</p><p>He knows people, he is humble, he listens. And I think above all, you know, Dara makes the people around him better.</p><p>People want to be around him, people want to think like he does. He's a great role model, he's a man of high integrity, he values diversity, he values gender balance.</p><p>He really stands for a lot of the great things that from what we read anyways maybe lacking in Uber.</p><p>So I have 100 percent confidence that Uber is going to be a much better company under Dara's leadership.</p><p>CHANG: Now, the information retracted, a report that you were going with Dara to Uber, they were wrong. But there is a point there that Dara has a lot of executive positions to fill.</p><p>Are you at all concern that a number of executives from <person><nameText>Expedia </nameText></person>are going to follow him there?</p><p>OKERSTROM: Well, listen, I think we feel very good about our executive team. We've got I think one of the most talented executive teams out there.</p><p>We've been together for a very long time and they're really excited about the prospects around <person><nameText>Expedia, </nameText></person>Inc. They're highly engaged, they're highly committed.</p><p>We've been working together on a strategy that were not yet done. So there's lots of work yet to do ahead of us and I think we've been pretty good about our team.</p><p>CHANG: So speaking about <person><nameText>Expedia </nameText></person>specifically, Google in particular is becoming a bigger potential threat. They're making bigger moves in the travel business.</p><p>Do you see more opportunities there to take them on from a U.S. antitrust perspective as they make these moves and given this political climate, the skepticism around big tech in general?</p><p>OKERSTROM: Well, I think we're going to continue to protect our interest have we -- as we always has. I mean, Google is has been and we expect continue it will be a really great partner for us.</p><p>Now, they obviously have a very powerful position in the industry both in the U.S. and around the world.</p><p>We encourage regulators to keep them in check so that we can continue to have a healthy economy.</p><p>Meanwhile, organically, we're very focus on making sure that we execute strategies to ensure that we're always the first place for people to come to shop and book their travel.</p><p>I think there are combination of all of that, it will mostly be fine and I hope we'll have a constructive and positive relationship with Google for many, many years to come.</p><p>CHANG: Meantime, Airbnb continues to grow, of course, you guys have HomeAway.

And I think we'll both have great futures ahead of us.</p><p>CHANG: Dara was very outspoken about politics especially when it came to President Trump.

Emily?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Mark, thank you so much.  Joining us now  the new CEO of Expedia, Mark Okerstrom from Expedia Headquarters in  Redmond, Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mark, thank you for joining us and congratulations.  I know it's been a  dramatic last few days.  So I'm curious from your perspective, how did Dara  tell you that he was considering this job and what was your reaction?</p><p>MARK OKERSTROM, CEO, EXPEDIA:  Well, you know, these things that you talked  about them for years, you -- something like a sports analogy, you prepare  the team for the big game.And you get a call on Sunday night and suddenly  the game is in two weeks from now, it's in fact, tomorrow.</p><p>So it kind of unfolded a little bit like that.  I think we were all ready  for this events reality when it did unfold.  I don't think it unfolded  exactly how everyone would plan, but I think we're all pretty excited  around Expedia.  We're very happy for Dara and, you know, I'm really happy  for the people at Uber, I think he's going to do a fantastic job there.</p><p>CHANG:  Now, when it comes to you and your job, Barry Diller said no one  else was even considered.  I know that you and Dara have been working  together for many, many years.</p><p>But, you know, what is your vision?  What are some things that you might do  differently?</p><p>OKERSTROM:  Well, you know, as I've said I've been very involved in the  strategic direction of this company for a very long time.  Dara and I  really have been locked, stepped in, in really all of the major strategic  decisions along with our Chairman Barry Diller.</p><p>So I really don't have a long list of things that I'm dying to change.   We've got a number of priorities across the company, certainly, becoming  more international as one of our key priorities.</p><p>So I'll be very focus on making sure we continue to expand globally.  The  big transition we're doing at HomeAway is a huge priority.</p><p>So I think you're going to see a lot more of the same for us and if I do my  job well maybe we can go even a little bit faster.</p><p>CHANG:  So let's talk about that.  You now have some deep ties to Uber's  new CEO, what are some new way that you could work together, like perhaps,  free Uber rides for Expedia customers?</p><p>OKERSTROM:  You know, we've talked a long time about possible ways that we  could work with Uber, integrating our service in to the Expedia app, of the  hotels.com app or the HomeAway app.</p><p>I'm hopeful then in the future now that we've got a direct connection,  those talks might be a little bit easier.</p><p>CHANG:  Dara is walking in to an incredibly challenging situation by all  accounts, an ousted founder who still wants a role in the company, several  lawsuits, very difficult board dynamics.</p><p>I mean, we've heard a lot about how he can deal with big personalities.   Tell us a little bit more about, you know, what -- why you think he has  what it takes to take on some of these personnel challenges?</p><p>OKERSTROM:  Well, I think above all, you know, Dara has one of the highest  levels of emotional intelligence that I've ever seen.</p><p>He knows people, he is humble, he listens.  And I think above all, you  know, Dara makes the people around him better.</p><p>People want to be around him, people want to think like he does.  He's a  great role model, he's a man of high integrity, he values diversity, he  values gender balance.</p><p>He really stands for a lot of the great things that from what we read  anyways maybe lacking in Uber.</p><p>So I have 100 percent confidence that Uber is going to be a much better  company under Dara's leadership.</p><p>CHANG:  Now, the information retracted, a report that you were going with  Dara to Uber, they were wrong.  But there is a point there that Dara has a  lot of executive positions to fill.</p><p>Are you at all concern that a number of executives from Expedia are going  to follow him there?</p><p>OKERSTROM:  Well, listen, I think we feel very good about our executive  team.  We've got I think one of the most talented executive teams out  there.</p><p>We've been together for a very long time and they're really excited about  the prospects around Expedia, Inc.  They're highly engaged, they're highly  committed.</p><p>We've been working together on a strategy that were not yet done.  So  there's lots of work yet to do ahead of us and I think we've been pretty  good about our team.</p><p>CHANG:  So speaking about Expedia specifically, Google in particular is  becoming a bigger potential threat.  They're making bigger moves in the  travel business.</p><p>Do you see more opportunities there to take them on from a U.S. antitrust  perspective as they make these moves and given this political climate, the  skepticism around big tech in general?</p><p>OKERSTROM:  Well, I think we're going to continue to protect our interest  have we -- as we always has.  I mean, Google is has been and we expect  continue it will be a really great partner for us.</p><p>Now, they obviously have a very powerful position in the industry both in  the U.S. and around the world.</p><p>We encourage regulators to keep them in check so that we can continue to  have a healthy economy.</p><p>Meanwhile, organically, we're very focus on making sure that we execute  strategies to ensure that we're always the first place for people to come  to shop and book their travel.</p><p>I think there are combination of all of that, it will mostly be fine and I  hope we'll have a constructive and positive relationship with Google for  many, many years to come.</p><p>CHANG:  Meantime, Airbnb continues to grow, of course, you guys have  HomeAway.  But are you happy with your home rental business or do you think  you still have a long way to go to catch up to Airbnb?</p><p>OKERSTROM:  Yes, well, you know, we're never happy with anything to be  honest.  We want our business to be significantly larger.  This is a  massive industry, 100 billion dollars of vacation rental bookings every  year.</p><p>That's probably an understatement of the opportunity ahead.  I think Airbnb  has done an exceptional job of creating huge amount of awareness around the  category.</p><p>And we're very fortunate to be in the position where we've got a business  that is on the phenomenal trajectory to step up, you know, alongside  Airbnb.</p><p>Our experience has been in our industry that there's always room for two.   We think that Airbnb is going to be a great success and we also think that  HomeAway is going to be a great success within the Expedia family.</p><p>CHANG:  What about when it comes to Priceline there, you know, making  bigger moves with Booking.com especially in your home market, how would  characterize competition from Priceline and its intensity?</p><p>OKERSTROM:  Well, it's been intense for, let's see, the last, you know, 15  years really since the beginning of our competition and I expect that to  continue.</p><p>In terms of changes, I think no major change, you know, Priceline,  Booking.com really exceptional companies.  And we have the outmost respect  for them.</p><p>They're making good progress in the U.S. as far as we can tell.  We're  making good progress in Europe and Asia, and Latin America as far as we can  tell versus them.</p><p>And again, I think there's room for both of them, both of us.  And I think  we'll both have great futures ahead of us.</p><p>CHANG:  Dara was very outspoken about politics especially when it came to  President Trump.  Do you think he will take a similar approach when it  comes to not just policy issues but also moral issues?</p><p>OKERSTROM:  Well, I think that we have a very important role as senior  executives of companies to speak out against those things that are, you  know, against our company's interest and against the interest of our  employees.</p><p>So I will take, you know, as active role is required to do these things on  a go forward basis.</p><p>CHANG:  Now, one last question.  When it comes to global growth, Ctrip.com  also making some big moves around the world, where do you see the biggest  competition coming from them?</p><p>OKERSTROM:  Well, I think certainly, you know, China and Asia is the  competitive grounds for Ctrip.  They're also an excellent competitor.</p><p>You know, I've just say that in an industry as large as travel which is at  1.4 trillion dollar industry where online penetration around the world is,  you know, shy of 50 percent where the opportunities are so huge, you're  going to have competitors that are -- that are fierce competitors and  strong competitors everywhere you look.</p><p>We've got many of them.  I expect that'll continue for a long period of  time.  But we're happy with our progress, we've got a good relationship  with Ctrip.  We expect all of that could continue in the future.</p><p>CHANG:  All right.  Mark Okerstrom, new CEO of Expedia.  Mark, thanks for  joining us on your first, second day on the job, I guess it is.  Mark  Barton --</p><p>OKERSTROM:  Exactly.</p><p>CHANG:  -- I'll send it back to you.</p><p>OKERSTROM:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTON:  Emily, great job.  Thanks for joining us today, Bloomberg's Emily  Chang there speaking to the new Chief Executive of Expedia.  Fantastic  interview here on Bloomberg Markets.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Emily?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EMILY CHANG, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Mark, thank you so much. Joining us now the new CEO of <person><nameText>Expedia, </nameText></person><person><nameText>Mark Okerstrom </nameText></person>from <person><nameText>Expedia </nameText></person>Headquarters in Redmond, Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mark, thank you for joining us and congratulations. I know it's been a dramatic last few days. So I'm curious from your perspective, how did Dara tell you that he was considering this job and what was your reaction?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK OKERSTROM, </nameText></person>CEO, <person><nameText>EXPEDIA</nameText></person>: Well, you know, these things that you talked about them for years, you -- something like a sports analogy, you prepare the team for the big game.And you get a call on Sunday night and suddenly the game is in two weeks from now, it's in fact, tomorrow.</p><p>So it kind of unfolded a little bit like that. I think we were all ready for this events reality when it did unfold. I don't think it unfolded exactly how everyone would plan, but I think we're all pretty excited around <person><nameText>Expedia. </nameText></person>We're very happy for Dara and, you know, I'm really happy for the people at Uber, I think he's going to do a fantastic job there.</p><p>CHANG: Now, when it comes to you and your job, Barry Diller said no one else was even considered. I know that you and Dara have been working together for many, many years.</p><p>But, you know, what is your vision? What are some things that you might do differently?</p><p>OKERSTROM: Well, you know, as I've said I've been very involved in the strategic direction of this company for a very long time. Dara and I really have been locked, stepped in, in really all of the major strategic decisions along with our Chairman Barry Diller.</p><p>So I really don't have a long list of things that I'm dying to change. We've got a number of priorities across the company, certainly, becoming more international as one of our key priorities.</p><p>So I'll be very focus on making sure we continue to expand globally. The big transition we're doing at HomeAway is a huge priority.</p><p>So I think you're going to see a lot more of the same for us and if I do my job well maybe we can go even a little bit faster.</p><p>CHANG: So let's talk about that. You now have some deep ties to Uber's new CEO, what are some new way that you could work together, like perhaps, free Uber rides for <person><nameText>Expedia </nameText></person>customers?</p><p>OKERSTROM: You know, we've talked a long time about possible ways that we could work with Uber, integrating our service in to the <person><nameText>Expedia </nameText></person>app, of the hotels.com app or the HomeAway app.</p><p>I'm hopeful then in the future now that we've got a direct connection, those talks might be a little bit easier.</p><p>CHANG: Dara is walking in to an incredibly challenging situation by all accounts, an ousted founder who still wants a role in the company, several lawsuits, very difficult board dynamics.</p><p>I mean, we've heard a lot about how he can deal with big personalities. Tell us a little bit more about, you know, what -- why you think he has what it takes to take on some of these personnel challenges?</p><p>OKERSTROM: Well, I think above all, you know, Dara has one of the highest levels of emotional intelligence that I've ever seen.</p><p>He knows people, he is humble, he listens. And I think above all, you know, Dara makes the people around him better.</p><p>People want to be around him, people want to think like he does. He's a great role model, he's a man of high integrity, he values diversity, he values gender balance.</p><p>He really stands for a lot of the great things that from what we read anyways maybe lacking in Uber.</p><p>So I have 100 percent confidence that Uber is going to be a much better company under Dara's leadership.</p><p>CHANG: Now, the information retracted, a report that you were going with Dara to Uber, they were wrong. But there is a point there that Dara has a lot of executive positions to fill.</p><p>Are you at all concern that a number of executives from <person><nameText>Expedia </nameText></person>are going to follow him there?</p><p>OKERSTROM: Well, listen, I think we feel very good about our executive team. We've got I think one of the most talented executive teams out there.</p><p>We've been together for a very long time and they're really excited about the prospects around <person><nameText>Expedia, </nameText></person>Inc. They're highly engaged, they're highly committed.</p><p>We've been working together on a strategy that were not yet done. So there's lots of work yet to do ahead of us and I think we've been pretty good about our team.</p><p>CHANG: So speaking about <person><nameText>Expedia </nameText></person>specifically, Google in particular is becoming a bigger potential threat. They're making bigger moves in the travel business.</p><p>Do you see more opportunities there to take them on from a U.S. antitrust perspective as they make these moves and given this political climate, the skepticism around big tech in general?</p><p>OKERSTROM: Well, I think we're going to continue to protect our interest have we -- as we always has. I mean, Google is has been and we expect continue it will be a really great partner for us.</p><p>Now, they obviously have a very powerful position in the industry both in the U.S. and around the world.</p><p>We encourage regulators to keep them in check so that we can continue to have a healthy economy.</p><p>Meanwhile, organically, we're very focus on making sure that we execute strategies to ensure that we're always the first place for people to come to shop and book their travel.</p><p>I think there are combination of all of that, it will mostly be fine and I hope we'll have a constructive and positive relationship with Google for many, many years to come.</p><p>CHANG: Meantime, Airbnb continues to grow, of course, you guys have HomeAway. But are you happy with your home rental business or do you think you still have a long way to go to catch up to Airbnb?</p><p>OKERSTROM: Yes, well, you know, we're never happy with anything to be honest. We want our business to be significantly larger. This is a massive industry, 100 billion dollars of vacation rental bookings every year.</p><p>That's probably an understatement of the opportunity ahead. I think Airbnb has done an exceptional job of creating huge amount of awareness around the category.</p><p>And we're very fortunate to be in the position where we've got a business that is on the phenomenal trajectory to step up, you know, alongside Airbnb.</p><p>Our experience has been in our industry that there's always room for two. We think that Airbnb is going to be a great success and we also think that HomeAway is going to be a great success within the <person><nameText>Expedia </nameText></person>family.</p><p>CHANG: What about when it comes to Priceline there, you know, making bigger moves with Booking.com especially in your home market, how would characterize competition from Priceline and its intensity?</p><p>OKERSTROM: Well, it's been intense for, let's see, the last, you know, 15 years really since the beginning of our competition and I expect that to continue.</p><p>In terms of changes, I think no major change, you know, Priceline, Booking.com really exceptional companies. And we have the outmost respect for them.</p><p>They're making good progress in the U.S. as far as we can tell. We're making good progress in Europe and Asia, and Latin America as far as we can tell versus them.</p><p>And again, I think there's room for both of them, both of us. And I think we'll both have great futures ahead of us.</p><p>CHANG: Dara was very outspoken about politics especially when it came to President Trump. Do you think he will take a similar approach when it comes to not just policy issues but also moral issues?</p><p>OKERSTROM: Well, I think that we have a very important role as senior executives of companies to speak out against those things that are, you know, against our company's interest and against the interest of our employees.</p><p>So I will take, you know, as active role is required to do these things on a go forward basis.</p><p>CHANG: Now, one last question. When it comes to global growth, Ctrip.com also making some big moves around the world, where do you see the biggest competition coming from them?</p><p>OKERSTROM: Well, I think certainly, you know, China and Asia is the competitive grounds for Ctrip. They're also an excellent competitor.</p><p>You know, I've just say that in an industry as large as travel which is at 1.4 trillion dollar industry where online penetration around the world is, you know, shy of 50 percent where the opportunities are so huge, you're going to have competitors that are -- that are fierce competitors and strong competitors everywhere you look.</p><p>We've got many of them. I expect that'll continue for a long period of time. But we're happy with our progress, we've got a good relationship with Ctrip. We expect all of that could continue in the future.</p><p>CHANG: All right. <person><nameText>Mark Okerstrom, </nameText></person>new CEO of <person><nameText>Expedia. </nameText></person>Mark, thanks for joining us on your first, second day on the job, I guess it is. Mark Barton --</p><p>OKERSTROM: Exactly.</p><p>CHANG: -- I'll send it back to you.</p><p>OKERSTROM: Thanks.</p><p>BARTON: Emily, great job. Thanks for joining us today, Bloomberg's Emily Chang there speaking to the new Chief Executive of <person><nameText>Expedia. </nameText></person>Fantastic interview here on Bloomberg Markets.</p><p>[*]</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Both spent six weeks each time exploring South-east Asia in two trips.</p><p><br/><br/>Today, the closest the president and chief executive officer of Expedia Group gets to a holiday, he says, is a 'work trip' which he is currently on with his family. But the appetite for local authentic experiences remains and while in Singapore, he and his family went for a private home-cooked dinner with a local host.<br/><br/>'It was our first experience with private dining and we enjoyed it. Travel is about meeting new people, new experiences, it's not about sitting in that middle seat on an aircraft,' said Okerstrom who took over the reins of Expedia Group two years ago.<br/><br/>Of course, much has changed in South-east Asia since those backpacking days and 'these things have done it,' said Okerstrom, pointing to my iPhone that's recording our conversation.<br/><br/>Mostly, they have changed for the better from a business perspective, he said, but the downside is 'during those times of backpacking, the places we visited, they hadn't seen a lot of Westerners and that was a unique experience. So that freshness has gone away. If you look at the big Asian cities and compare them with the big European cities, they are starting to look more alike.'<br/><br/>So how do you feel being responsible for this, I asked. 'I blame Apple and Google for that, not us,' he laughed. 'We are the platform to allow people to experience the world and we are working with governments in countries like Thailand to get tourists to understand that yes, city centres are incredible, but there's much more to discover.<br/><br/>'It's good for travellers (to spread out), they crave authentic experiences and this is great for those who work in the travel business - from tour guides to hosts - and we help create new economies.'<br/><br/>Mark Okerstrom: '... we are on the cusp of a new vector in innovation that is much more personalised and automated.'<br/><br/>(Image credit: Expedia Group)<br/><br/>Here's what Okerstrom and I caught up on during his 'work trip/holiday' to Singapore this week.<br/><br/>Q: We last caught up in December in Las Vegas, just eight months ago. What has the past eight months been like for you?<br/><br/>It's been a whirlwind, tons of change, across the group too, moving at the speed of light.<br/><br/>Q: You've also lost Aman (Bhutani, president of Brand Expedia, who's left to join GoDaddy)?<br/><br/>Yes, Aman is a great leader but as with any big organisation, we are able to train great leaders who can go off to do wonderful things. Great companies plan for succession.<br/><br/>Q: Like with you and Dara (Khosrowshahi)? What are the events you'd rather not have happened?<br/><br/>There isn't anything I'd single out. Every disappointing event and negative surprise somehow lead to some piece of serendipity and, two years after, we're glad that happened. Look at what's happened with meta search channels - Trivago has gone through transformation the last couple of years and it will emerge a stronger company with better service for its customers. Had what happened with the OTAs pulling back not happened, they wouldn't have been forced to innovate.<br/><br/>Q: Wouldn't you rather the legal dispute with United Airlines not have happened?<br/><br/>In all relationships with major strategic partners, when at any point, you're forced with a choice, not to be in business or be in business together, it forces people to ask, how do you create more value, how do you increase the piece? What companies like Marriott, Hilton or United do is incredible - they do things we can't do and, at the same time, we do a whole bunch of things really well.<br/><br/>Any conversation that starts with 'if you don't do this, we're out of business with each other' - I say, 'if you don't want to be in business, go' but let's actually acknowledge that it's not a good outcome. Instead, let's get back to the table and create win-win scenarios. I am optimistic that will be the case with United and all our strategic partners.<br/><br/>Q: You believe a happy medium can be found?<br/><br/>Not only that but a greater plane - we are looking for deals where our airline partners are truly better off and so are we.<br/><br/>Q: And what are the events you're happy that they happened?<br/><br/>We have been very focused on three major strategic themes - be more customer centric, getting away from the world where we think of traffic and transactions but actually recognising that traffic (those 750m monthly site visits) is actually our customers (you) and we can learn more about them, and be locally relevant.<br/><br/>The last item is about unleashing the power of our platform, 7,000 of the brightest data architects, AI experts, product and engineering folks - it's about putting our engineering power and resource towards things that really matter. For example, the great revenue management tools we have built for our lodging partners and on the customer side, how we solve family travel, how do we book two connecting rooms, how can we book a whole house?<br/><br/>Q: On that subject, what do you think of Agoda's new 'Mix and Save' feature?<br/><br/>The challenge is the customer experience - we have a similar functionality - the issue is if you can do it in the same hotel, how do you make sure the customer doesn't have to change rooms? It's tricky.<br/><br/>Q: Everyone's trying to innovate and differentiate in competitive times<br/><br/>...Yes, and with AI and computing power, the pace of that is changing and I feel we are on the cusp of a new vector in innovation that is much more personalised and automated.<br/><br/>Q: So you are still in love with big tech and not disillusioned? There's been so much backlash ...<br/><br/>There's been backlash against the big platforms that have not necessarily anticipated some of the abuses that can take place on their platforms. I am not disenchanted. Big tech needs big leaders who understand the responsibility and I think in some cases a certain degree of regulatory oversight is important as well.<br/><br/>Q: You took over a very well-run, established company and some might argue it's a harder ask to take over than to start over - growth is harder to achieve, competition has become more intense, the organization has become more fixed and set in its way, it is 23 years old. What did you have to unlearn when you took over?<br/><br/>It would have been easy for me to step in and say I will continue on essentially the path that Dara and I were on. But we had gotten to a point where to go to the next level, we had to do a bunch of things differently, and so I had to never totally forget, but never rest on your laurels. I had to forget the successes of the past, forget the things that we had tried before that didn't work and we had to push everyone to say, how can you imagine a better future, standing on the shoulders of what we have done but not shackled by them?<br/><br/>Q: How do you keep fighting like a hungry startup, assuming that's important to you?<br/><br/>The tech world is littered with the bodies of the complacent. The second we are not delivering incredible experiences for customers and partners, that's the second a new competitor will emerge that will do better than us. If you combine ambition, fear and passion with incredible assets and capabilities, you can produce a great company.<br/><br/>Q: You say we are at a new vector in innovation and things are moving really fast. So at this time, do you feel a collaborative style of leadership still works or do you need a more autocratic form of leadership to move faster?<br/><br/>It's a combination. At least in our industry, you need so much expertise and no one sits on top of all this information to be able to make top down decisions without collective input.<br/><br/>Know the knowable - if a decision is incredibly important and irreversible, you have the obligation to collect as much information as possible before you make that decision. If a decision is not that important, you collect enough information and then you just go. There's a trade-off between speed and quality and decisions that do not have major consequences, you can sacrifice quality for speed because you can fail fast and try again. For decisions that are irreversible, you can sacrifice speed.<br/><br/>Q: Know the knowable. What do you know a lot of?<br/><br/>Travel, because I do a lot of it. I am reading 'Sapiens' right now - about the evolution of man. I can get passionate and curious about a bunch of things and everytime I think I am somewhat of an expert in something, I meet someone who's smarter than me, more expert than me, and I love that.<br/><br/>Q: Competition is coming at you from several angles and it's like you have to set up a defence on many fronts, from flights to hotels to tours  activities and vacation rental. Let's do a quick checklist on each.<br/><br/>Hotels - what's the most interesting development happening in this sector, as far as you are concerned?<br/><br/>The in-stay experience, the mobile check in. We have Alice that we own the majority of - with your phone, you're essentially tapping into the back office system and we are able to, for our hotel partner, track responsiveness and help deliver better customer experience.<br/><br/>Seeing companies like Marriott help blend the reliable trustworthy experience of a hotel with the uniqueness of alternative accommodation - that's interesting. Back to our conversation about negative events - if you had asked any of the hotel chains three years do, do you wish Airbnb did not exist, they would have said yes but yet, you can see innovation happening and it will produce better outcome for our customers and they will become stronger companies for it.<br/><br/>Q: Tours  activities - hot sector, lots of acquisitions and funding coming into it. Would you pay so much money for companies like Klook or GetYourGuide?<br/><br/>If I would pay that much money, I would have paid that much money.<br/><br/>Q: That's a non-answer.<br/><br/>There's a lot of excitement, it's a space where the Internet has not penetrated as deeply and where intermediaries can provide a lot of value. So it's not surprising that it's attracting a lot of capital. Expedia's well positioned and executed really well, we've been doing it for 20 years, we have not invested as aggressively as we could have but we are on the path to get much more serious about - cross-sell and push notifications - so watch this space.<br/><br/>Q: Booking.com is getting pretty active on putting together the connected trip.<br/><br/>It's in our DNA. It's interesting that Booking is doing this but when you are the platform that provides the flight, cruise, car rental, lodging experience, we have the capability to stitch it all together and be able to when your flight is delayed, offer you a room, breakfast or a tour,<br/><br/>The concept of the connected trip is the promise of the Expedia Group. I don't think anyone in this industry in the world is as well-positioned to do it and we are doing it. We just have to get better and better at it.<br/><br/>Q: There's a lot of talk about superapps - Trip.com wants to be a travel superapp, Traveloka the travel and lifestyle platform, Grab the everyday superapp. What does Expedia want to be?<br/><br/>We are the world's travel platform. No other company can literally take anybody from any place in the world, give them an incredible stay, experience ... the global breadth of what we do, our geographic footprint, 575 airlines ...<br/><br/>Q: But how do you stitch it all together? Do consumers, you think, want to book a hotel through a ride-hailing app?<br/><br/>I'd say no. But do people want a seamless experience when they are travelling, to have a trusted global player standing behind them, when things go wrong, do people want that? $ 100 billion in bookings in 2018 says yes.<br/><br/>Q: Let's talk vacation rentals - why Vrbo? HomeAway just seems easier to say. In July, this business reported an uptick in revenue, reversing two quarters of declines. You must have been relieved - does this signal renewed momentum in your fastest-growing category?<br/><br/>It's coming up. Vrbo was the birthplace of alternative accommodation. Before that term came up, people were using Vrbo in the US, some parts of Canada and Europe. We went out and surveyed people to find the best word and Vrbo was it. We are super excited about the business and integrating all that alternative accommodation (570,000 properties) onto Expedia, onto Hotels.com and that unleashes a huge opportunity to expand into urban centres like Paris.<br/><br/>Q: Let's talk Google - it is into everything and it's getting better and better and it's looking more like an OTA.<br/><br/>Google is and will continue to be a great partner but as it relates to search generally in most parts of the world, they have become dominant and dominant players have economic incentives that can harm industries and in that respect, a certain amount of regulatory oversight is needed but oversight has to be appropriate and thoughtful. Rushed regulation is generally bad. They are one of the great examples of innovators that have changed the world and we have to be careful not to crush that.<br/><br/>Q: This is the turn of a decade - 2019. Name one key event that has happened this year that you think will have profound impact on the future of travel.<br/><br/>US-China relations. We have to do better there, I fear we're moving in the wrong direction, that we are becoming more polarized as opposed to more connected. Travel is the antidote to solve that.<br/><br/>Q: We are the right industry at a time of hate?<br/><br/>We are the right industry, one of the most important industries for the current times, but I fear that the climate is causing people to be fearful.<br/><br/>Q: What do you wish you understood more of?<br/><br/>Everything<br/><br/>Q: What would you like people to understand more about you?<br/><br/>I am a pretty open book, maybe to my detriment.<br/><br/>Q: What's the strangest question you've ever been asked?<br/><br/>If I dance, and I have danced during interviews.<br/><br/>Q: How do you stop a compulsive talker at meetings?<br/><br/>Ask someone else a question.<br/><br/>Q: You love to dance - who's got the best moves in the industry? Who are you watching?<br/><br/>I am watching all of them closely and all of our competitors have great moves. Ctrip and how it's orchestrating its expansion outside China, Booking.com has done a phenomenal job in so many areas, Airbnb for having that emotional connection with customers. They each have their own strengths and we are trying to leverage our strength.<br/><br/>Q: What's Expedia's strength?<br/><br/>We ultimately are the future of travel. When you look at what matters - global, scale, assortment, quality of brands, customer experience, partner experience - we are the whole package. It's hard for a big tech company to be excellent at everything simultaneously and that's one of our weaknesses and that's what we are working on.<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WT1-XPY1-JD3Y-Y4FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 12, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
