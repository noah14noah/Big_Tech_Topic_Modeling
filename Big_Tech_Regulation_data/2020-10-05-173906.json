Its main purpose is to evaluate the situation for journalists in 180 countries and territories across the globe.</p><p>In this regard there's no doubt the index has become an extremely useful advocacy tool in helping promote free, independent and pluralistic journalism and in defending media workers rights.</p><p>But vital as such a role is, this serves as little consolation to the fact that the conclusions drawn by the index these past few years have been far from heartening. The current index is no exception, or then again perhaps it is, for rarely in recent times has it portrayed a bleaker picture of the threats facing media freedom worldwide.</p><p>Those threats, of course, have inevitably been amplified by the coronavirus pandemic, as existing and aspiring autocrats around the world crack down on journalists' ability to do their jobs at a time when transparency is more vital than ever.</p><p>In fact, so pressing are those threats that RSF has warned that the next 10 years will pretty much determine the fate of journalism as we know it. \"We are entering a decisive decade for journalism linked to crises that affect its future,\" says RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire. \"The coronavirus pandemic illustrates the negative factors threatening the right to reliable information, and is itself an exacerbating factor,\" Deloire added in his recent summation of the current index ratings.</p><p>Questioning what all this means for freedom of information, pluralism and reliability by 2030, Deloire maintains the answer to that is already being determined and as we move through this \"decisive decade\", five converging crises are having a malign influence and potentially devastating impact on international journalism.</p><p>The first of these is what RSF says is a \"geopolitical crisis\" due to aggressiveness of authoritarian regimes, which coronavirus has already starkly highlighted.</p><p>The second is a \"technological crisis\" resulting from the lack of appropriate regulation of digitalised communication, creating a kind of \"information chaos\" blurring the lines between fact, fiction, propaganda and advertising, often putting them in direct competition with mainstream bona fide journalism.</p><p>The third crisis in this perfect storm facing journalism highlighted by RSF is a growing physical hostility towards journalists globally.</p><p>Much of this hostility, it concludes, is an offshoot of the hatred towards the press fomented by some political leaders such as US President Donald Trump and his counterpart Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil.</p><p>\"Hostility toward journalists and news outlets in the US deepened and intensified, and few attacks were as vitriolic as those that came from the president,\" the media watchdog concluded.</p><p>\"The abuse is only getting worse amid the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, as journalists covering the Trump administration's response to the crisis are subjected to the president's attacks during his press briefings,\" it added.</p><p>According to the index ratings, the US now ranks 45th out of 180 countries. A \"dangerous anti-press sentiment\" as well as the arrest, physical assault, public denigration and harassment of journalists had trickled down to the local level in America, the report determined.</p><p>Related to this open hostility and the last of the five elements in the crises press freedom faces is one of trust, says RSF. Or put another way the public suspects broadcast and print news to have been contaminated by unreliable information.</p><p>In making its case for this, the media watchdog cites a recent Edelman Trust Barometer conducted by the US-based public relations group that studies public trust in institutions.</p><p>According to those polled in Edelman's latest international survey, 57% of people believed the media they used were contaminated with information they thought untrustworthy. That in itself, most would admit, is cause for serious concern, but combined with the other threats outlined, all five converge into one enormous challenge to the worldwide press of the future.</p><p>It's a sobering thought not least today, May 3, as we mark World Press Freedom Day along with its theme this year of \"journalism without fear or favour\".</p><p>In order to understand in real terms just what these threats mean to journalism's future, it's worth drilling down a little deeper into their implications.</p><p>The obvious place to start is with the impact of the pandemic itself. Having said that, long before the emergence of coronavirus, world press freedoms were recognised as being in decline.</p><p>For many years journalists have weathered authoritarian regimes and threats to their safety. But where most observers are now in near total agreement is that the pandemic has brought a new dynamic to the media landscape exposing the long-term risks of suppressed press freedoms</p><p>As Robert Mahoney, deputy executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) points out, those countries that stifle independent news and jail journalists in \"normal\" times have already been hard at work.</p><p>In what some journalists have called the global \"Covid crackdown,\" China and Iran, 177th and 173rd respectively in the Press Freedom Index, tried to quarantine the truth. In Iran's case the leadership there censored news of its spread with devastating consequences for public health.</p><p>Many media monitoring groups are now concerned that, for the most part, governments have been getting away with their efforts to impede independent journalism without being called out by other countries, all of which are also preoccupied in dealing with the pandemic.</p><p>\"Governments in Thailand, through Hungary and Egypt to Honduras, are using the cloud cover of the diseases to introduce emergency measures that could roll back basic freedoms, clamp down on the press, or restrict foreign correspondents,\" warned Mahoney of the CPJ recently on Al azeera.</p><p>At its worst this manifests itself in arrests, detention, intimidation, physical threats and sometimes murder.</p><p>In terms of Covid-19-related reporting, human rights group Amnesty International last week highlighted a handful of cases where reporters have been prosecuted or threatened. Among them was that of Russian journalist Elena Milashina whose newspaper Novaya Gazeta on April 12blished an article in which she criticised the Chechen authorities' response to the pandemic.</p><p>Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov in turn posted an Instagram video in which he threatened Milashina, appealing to the Russian government and Federal Security Service (FSB) to \"stop those non-humans who are writing and provoking our people\". In Egypt, meanwhile, security forces arrested Atef Hasballah, the editor-in-chief of AlkararPress newspaper on March 18, and subjected him to enforced disappearance for nearly a month, following a post on his Facebook page in which he challenged the official statistics on Covid-19 cases.</p><p>In Venezuela, it was journalist Darvinson Rojas who spent 12 days in detention after reporting on the spread of the virus in the country and was pushed by authorities to reveal his sources.</p><p>These are only three of many instances globally where reporting on the pandemic brought journalists under threat, but it's not only during the current crisis that such measures have been documented</p><p>Last year, 142 serious threats to press freedom were recorded, including 33 physical attacks on journalists. A total of 43 cases of intimidation and direct threat have been listed in a report compiled by several media organisations, among them RSF, the Association of European Journalists and the International Press Institute.</p><p>Late last year, too, 105 journalists were imprisoned for their work, primarily in Turkey, Russia, and Azerbaijan.</p><p>As Otmar Lahodynsky, president of the Association of European Journalists (AEJ) wrote recently in the EU affairs newspaper NewEurope, the takeover of media by oligarchs and governments in Hungary, Poland, and Serbia were also noted and criticised in the report.</p><p>\"Many public-service broadcasters have been turned into uncritical propaganda channels for the government. Abuses of media freedom are also increasing in Western Europe,\" says Lahodynsky, adding that political influence on the media is increasing in many of the 47 countries that count themselves as members of the Council of Europe.</p><p>But beyond these obvious threats to journalism and its future lie others, many economic, with job cuts gutting newsrooms. As RSF makes clear, the digital transformation has brought the media to their knees in many countries.</p><p>Falling sales, the collapse in advertising revenue and the increase in production and distribution costs have in turn forced news organisations to restructure and lay off journalists.</p><p>\"The economic crisis has also accentuated the phenomena of ownership concentration and, even more, conflicts of interest, which threaten journalistic pluralism and independence,\" warns the watchdog.</p><p>The bottom line here is that global journalism currently faces both old threats and new, raising the inevitable question of how best to protect and nurture its existence in the \"decisive decade\" that lies ahead.</p><p>According to Farhana Haque Rahman, senior vice-president of the global news agency Inter Press Service, ultimately, just as in a pandemic, the freedom of the press can only be guaranteed by a co-ordinated global effort and a focus on highlighting the long-term advantages of a more critical world.</p><p>\"This means pressure to reinforce legal frameworks, including prosecuting harassers and killers, perhaps just as the international community would persecute war criminals, while offering a global protection for journalists,\" says Rahman.</p><p>\"Finding and promoting innovative ways of subsidising independent media, as well as getting big tech companies to pay for the content they share, is also crucial to help a free press to thrive,\" she says.</p><p>Just as the response to the coronavirus pandemic has been described as a marathon not a sprint, so must the long-term future of journalism be viewed in the same terms.</p><p>Ever since the United Nations proclaimed World Press Freedom Day on this date back in 1993, the obstacles facing independent reporting have consistently been immense.</p><p>Censorship, smear campaigns, harassment, intimidation, arrest and detention, threats of physical assault and murder are the challenges journalists across many parts of the world have had to contend with.</p><p>These are unprecedented times and, as one colleague recently observed, no working journalist alive has ever covered anything like this story of the pandemic. Even veterans of war reporting or Ebola coverage have had to re-evaluate risk and learn new skills.</p><p>As we mark World Press Freedom Day it's obvious that many challenges beyond the current one lie in wait. Most likely these will put the very heart of journalistic practice and the ability to carry it out without fear or favour to an unprecedented test.</p><p>To say we need journalism now more than ever is true. But it also masks a reality worth reiterating, one that makes clear the importance of having a free press each and every day, whether the story is of global or local concern.</p><p>In either instance, holding power to account and performing a public interest role is fundamental to this. But just as the press holds the powers at be to account, so too do we need reasoned critical consumers of the media, those similarly capable of holding the media to task for any misrepresentations of the truth.</p><p>It was the great French author and journalist Albert Camus who once observed that: \"A free press can of course, be good or bad, but most certainly without freedom, the press will never be anything but bad.\"</p><p>If, as the World Press Freedom report suggests, the next 10 years prove to be an unprecedented test for the media, then good journalism will need all the allies it can muster.</p><p>As RSF secretary-general Christophe Deloire, rightly pointed out: \"For this decisive decade to not be a disastrous one, people of goodwill, whoever they are, must campaign for journalists to be able to fulfil their role as society's trusted third parties, which means they must have the capacity to do so.\"</p><p>Speaking as someone with a vested interest in that happening, I can only say how welcome that trust would be. But equally, however, those within my profession must realise that in order for that to take place, we too must prove ourselves worthy of that same trust.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HRDSCL-18423173</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HRDSCL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YTH-FR81-JD39-X0DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464262</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2208\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Scotland</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"2880\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 3, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>REPORTERS WITHOUT BORDERS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDk1NjM1M0M1QUYxNDlEMDgxNjI1Qzk3NkRDNDhCRjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwRjUxMDRFN0JBNEMxMEI3MDhDNzhBMjA4NzU2MzM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000760</classCode><className>FREEDOM OF PRESS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUMwRjUxMDRFN0JBNEMxMEI3MDhDNzhBMjA4NzU2MzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode><className>Free Press</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009J49</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS &amp;

I'd laugh, if gambling wasn't such a serious subject. Preposterously, that's the slogan of the advertising campaign created by the Senet Group, the \"independent\" body funded by the gambling industry and set up to promote responsible gambling standards.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Consider the pernicious underlying message: it's fun to gamble. Can you imagine the authorities allowing Big Tobacco to present smoking in the same \"fun\" way, knowing everything we do today about the dangers of inhaling the fumes from burning tobacco? When the cancer starts, stop?</p><p>Smoking kills and gambling destroys lives. Indeed, gambling addiction is one of the new threats facing the health service, according to Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England.</p><p>He has warned of an increasing link between problem gambling and stress, depression and other mental health problems.</p><p>An estimated 430,000 people in the UK have a gambling problem. A further two million are at risk of developing a gambling problem. This piles pressure on the NHS, which has to try to repair these broken lives. </p><p>It gets worse. The number of children with a gambling problem has doubled in the last year, according to the Gambling Commission. The regulator blamed television advertising and online promotion for this appalling growth. </p><p>Jeff Stelling, the football pundit, and Ray Winstone, the tough guy actor, should be ashamed of themselves for promoting gambling, as should Sky, which millions of people view as a trusted source of information, although I am not suggesting they are targeting children with their ads. </p><p>Gambling has seized control of our national game. Research suggests that 60 per cent of football clubs in England's top two leagues have the names of betting firms and online casinos emblazoned on their players' shirts. That's nine of 20 in the Premier League and 17 of 24 in the Championship. </p><p>It's not just Sky that is pumping out the message. The BBC is complicit too with its Match of the Day highlights package, beaming all those \"fun\" logos into family homes. </p><p>So what is the Government doing about this clear and present danger? Not very much, it seems, in the face of a powerful industry lobby. </p><p>Gambling is big business and generates many billions of pounds of revenue in the UK and incredible riches for shareholders such as Denise Coates, the founder of Bet365 who paid herself \u00a3265m last year. It is also a major employer in Leeds, home of the Sky Bet powerhouse and the digital operations of William Hill.</p><p>Online gambling is a highly sophisticated and data-driven business. It successfully employs many of the same tactics as the social media giants in developing addictive behaviours. I have spent two decades in the technology industry and it saddens me to watch some of the finest minds in the world applying themselves to the tasks of encouraging people to click on ads for things they don't want or make bets they can't afford. </p><p>It is some consolation that when an online gambling firm mounted a recruitment raid on staff at WANdisco's office in Sheffield, only one person fell for its charms in spite of the potentially higher pay. </p><p>Our team members resisted. They would rather develop data software that helps farmers plough fields, studios make movies and healthcare companies predict cancers. We have real world applications that are making people's lives better, not making people's lives worse. </p><p>Data analytics are being used in a cynical and negative way in pursuit of profit, regardless of the social, economic and democratic consequences. Taxation is part of the answer, but we know all too well that big tech is adept at finding legal loopholes to avoid paying its fair share. </p><p>Instead, I believe the Government should legislate for much stronger regulation of the online gambling industry. It must control the use of powerful and corruptible technology to limit the harm. </p><p>In addition, we cannot allow blanket advertising of a public ill to continue. That must mean an end to the pollution of our national sport by gambling companies. </p><p>No doubt some football clubs will complain about the loss of revenue as their sugar daddies are run out of town.</p><p>They should have a higher opinion of themselves and their social responsibilities and try to set a better example in their communities. Formula One racing survived the death of big tobacco advertising. F1 is a thriving multi-billion dollar sport. Football should do the same and wean itself off gambling. </p><p>When the gambling stops, let the fun begin.</p><p>David Richards is the founder and CEO of WANdisco. The David and Jane Richards Family Foundation works to advance education in computer science and ecology in UK state schools. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YOPOST-EB353C2FB5184BAFA97B2CA85586CE26ASH104311189NLYP</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YOPOST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TVG-63H1-F15K-2154-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">250237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"779\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Johnston Press Plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Yorkshire Post</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 29, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Columnists</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>economy business and finance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>economic sector</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>tourism and leisure</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>casino and gambling</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Places</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>England</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>towns and cities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Leeds</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Places</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>England</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>towns and cities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sheffield</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

He's the co-president of Goldman Sachs.  David, good morning.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Good morning, Erik.  Nice to be here with you. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  Nice to see you again.  We'll begin with the obvious. I think the general consensus is that Goldman had by Goldman standards a rough first quarter.  It's a trading business back on track.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Our trading business is a great franchise.  We work very, very hard, you know, to serve our clients.  Clearly, we didn't meet expectations in the first quarter.  You know, although, when you look at the firm broadly, IBD, or Investment Management division, the equities divisions, all performed in line.  The FICC, you know, FICC did not.  So look, it's great opportunity to take a look at the margin and see what's going on in the business and other ways that we can continue to invest, tighten up the franchise, understand why in the quarter that we were presented with, we got a slightly different result, but we feel very good about our client franchise and our position in the business.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  So now that you have had an opportunity to take a close look, what conclusions have you drawn?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  You know, the conclusions are that we drew in looking at the quarter, where there a number of things about the quarter that just given our mix of clients and the way we're positioned and the way we navigate at the quarter, it didn't lead to the best performance for us.  But look, we could look back the last quarter, we outperformed by an equal amount.  And, you know, we've got a business where we're working with clients, we work with them, their activity levels, the flows that they have.  We're in certain businesses that some of our competitors are not in like the commodities business, et cetera.    </p><p>      And based on that mix of businesses, we can have a slightly different result than others.  But we've got a really terrific franchise.  I obviously can't comment on other peoples', you know, earnings.  But when I look at our relative and competitive position, I feel great about our people, the work we're doing for our clients and the way those businesses are positioned.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  Are those positions still losing money?    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  There -- there are positions that are losing money. You -- you kind of pop that right in.  I assume you're referring to the article, the -- the Bloomberg -- the -- the -- the credit article that Bloomberg wrote.  I wouldn't put a lot of credence into that. This was not a quarter that was defined by positions losing money. This was a quarter that was defined by lower client activity.  And the firm, not maximizing the revenue opportunity.  But look, we had a few hundred million dollars more money, more revenue on those businesses, we probably wouldn't be having this discussion.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  So strictly a matter of planned activity and nothing to do with, say, a risk management problem?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  No, there's absolutely no risk management problem. That was not what defined that the quarter at all.  This was a quarter that was defined by low volatility, a lack of conviction with our clients, and one of the things that I'd say is our business is definitely weighted or levered to times when our clients have a lot of conviction.  I think one of the things that happened in the first quarter is conviction kind of ebbed and flowed away a little after period in the fourth quarter after the election when people were very, very conflicted about the reflation trade, and that backed off a little bit during the quarter.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  You know why we're talking about this.  We're talking about it for two principal reasons.  One is Goldman has a record, a track record of consistently beating earnings expectations, and secondly, of course, all of your competitors had double-digit increases in FICC trade ...  </p><p>      (AUDIO GAP)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Erik, we didn't meet expectations this quarter.  OK? It's not the first quarter we didn't.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  It doesn't happen very often.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  But it happened this quarter.  We've got a terrific franchise.  We feel very good about our franchise.  There's no risk management issue.  We feel -- we feel very, very good about the work we're doing for our clients in the way we're positioned.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  ... we didn't meet expectations this quarter.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  We know.  Do you do anything differently going forward?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  You know, I think when you had a situation where you don't meet expectations, you take a hard look at your business.  And, you know, our people are always very, very intense around our clients, what their clients' needs are and the activity of the services we provide, and you just redouble out all that, make sure that you're doing -- if you spend time talking to your clients, covering your clients, delivering value for your clients over a long period of time, good things happen.  And we feel very good about the way we're positioned.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  FICC is getting all the attention.  But equities wasn't the star performer it's been in the past either.  Five years ago, Goldman's equities business was twice as large as Morgan Stanley's and now Morgan Stanley's is bigger.  What happened?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Yeah.  Well, Morgan Stanley -- Morgan Stanley, definitely, the businesses are weighted in different ways.  We have a leading institutional equity franchise.  We've got a strong position across institutional work, high touch, low touch, also prime brokerage.  But one of the places where we're not as invested as Morgan Stanley is in -- is in quants.  And there are variety of reasons.  It's a business that's grown very significantly and Morgan Stanley has a bigger position in that business.  And that ...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  What do you do about it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Well, it's actually -- it's a business we're investing in.  But candidly, it's a business, it's not a straightforward business.  There's lots of operational risks in that business.  And while we're investing in it, we want to be in that business.  You know, we -- we're -- we've been a little bit more cautious in terms of our investment in that business, but we're building up that capability.  And Morgan Stanley has a platform of quants that's a little bit larger.  But if you look at the institutional business away from that, you know, we have a very, very significant institutional leading equity franchise.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  Can you take some of that market share and quant away from Morgan Stanley?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  I think there are opportunities with a set of clients that we don't do as much business with to increase our market share with those clients.  We're focused on that.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  How?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  By continuing to invest in technology and making sure our offering, which has developed meaningfully over the course over the last year, (inaudible) continuous to develop and is competitive. Now, we started to grow our market share with some of those clients and that's something we're going to continue to focus on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  At what point did it become clear that, if you will, a strategic error had been made and not investing in quant early enough?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Well, I wouldn't say that it was a strategic error.  I would say it was a choice that was made.  You know, you only see over time how all these businesses run.  And look, part of this -- we're not always just looking for revenue in these businesses.  We're also looking for returns.  OK?  And it's -- it's a -- it's a balance.  And so, you know, I know that you want to point to it and say, this is a strategic error.  You know, we've run our business.  We have a leading equity franchise.  We're very focused on returns, which is one of the reasons why when you look at our returns as an institution, we've outperformed the competitive peer (ph) set over a long period of time.   </p><p>      We're focused on returns.  We're focused on servicing our clients.  And, you know, at times, people pick and choose to be in different investments.  But over time, you know, you balance that out, you hopefully make the right long-term decisions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  Now that you're co-president of the firm, many people may forget that once upon a time, you're a leveraged finance guy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  That was -- that was a once upon a time.  I still watch that market very closely.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  I'm sure you do.  There is a lot of that capital available for M&amp;A right now, and financing terms appear to be getting very loose, would you agree? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  You know, look, when you look at the leveraged finance market at the moment, we're definitely running at relatively tight, you know, robust levels.  You know, I think when I look just over the weekend, we're running kind of a two-year tight, and there's obviously been a big momentum of funds into the loan market, the floating rate market, obviously, given the interest rate environment we're potentially moving into.  But even high-yield activity is up significantly, obviously, off a low base last year but up significantly.  </p><p>      And the pricing, you know, very, very tight.  So we're in a relatively robust environment at the moment, but I wouldn't say there's been a lot of supply.  And I wouldn't say that leverage levels, given the regulatory environment on a significant amount of the product, have really been pressed that significantly.  So ...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  Is Goldman doing what your shareholders would want, which is to say being prudent about how it uses its balance sheet and leveraged finance?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  We -- we -- we have very, very strong risk management culture.  Leveraged finance business, and important business to service our client, but, you know, I'd say from an overall perspective, our leveraged finance risk are deal risk given the activity we've had.  We -- we have some on our books but it's lower actually than what I'd like to see at this point in time.  There actually hasn't been as much of that activity, that M&amp;A activity, that -- that financing activities we're like to see.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  So I'm going to do something which you would probably consider unfair, which is pick on a single deal.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  OK.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  OK.  Charter NEX.  This is a packaging company that Leonard Green is buying the leveraged buyout, and Goldman is providing the junior financing.  $245 million of junior debt all unsecured, all balance sheet lending, 7.1 times leverage, covenant-lite LIBOR plus 775, or with a PIK-toggle LIBOR plus 825.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  So you've now -- you've now -- in -- in about 30 seconds, you've now exceeded my knowledge of this particular transaction by a very, very wide margin.  But what I can say is the leadership of the firm feels very, very good about our risk management processes around this product.  We have a leading franchise in the leveraged finance business, but part of the leveraged finance business is it's a risk management business, you have to have a strong risk management culture.  And I'm sure we have a team that's looking carefully at this transaction, has a strong point of view about the distribution capability of the transaction.  And, you know, we're very disciplined in the way we underwrite.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  In general terms, PIK toggle and cov lite sound a lot like 2007.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  You know, in general terms, those were -- those were tools that were used, you know, first in that time period, 2005 through 2007.  Like anything else, you know, it's a question of balance.  None of these things are black-and-white, good or bad, it's the extent to how they're used, on what kind of leverage in the capital structure to what -- to what degree, and how much instrumental or fundamental leverage they're creating in a transaction.  So I'm not familiar with these transactions, so I can't comment on the specific transaction.    </p><p>      But I'd say, generally speaking, the leveraged finance market is getting robust, but defaults are low, the economic environment is quite constructive, and it's something to watch.  It's always a space to watch.  But I would say while it's tighter and a little bit more aggressive, I don't think we're at the point where we're right at the end of that running.  A lot of it is going to be correlated to the economic environment here.  And to some degree, deal activity, you know, has not really expanded in a way that's really built up a much, much larger calendar ...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  You raised an important point.  Do you believe sitting here right now that the valuations we see in the equity market and the credit market reflect a realistic expectation for economic activity?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  You know, look, it's hard -- it's hard to answer a question like that.  I know that the people would point to the fact and say that if you look at the S&amp;P valuation, it's a top decile valuation when you look historically.  However, in 1995, it was a top decile valuation that we ran for another five years before we saw a significant hiccup in the market.  A lot of it's based on, you know, where the earnings momentum goes from here.  And I think corporate earnings actually are pretty good.  If you look at earnings so far this quarter, you know, we're really operating in a pretty strong corporate earnings environment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  And analysts are raising estimates.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  And analysts are raising estimates.  Now, we've only seen kind of half the picture.  We've seen a lot of industrials, financials, big tech, there's still more to go with respect to consumer, REITs (ph), energy, but you've got a pretty good earnings environment, you've got a lot of economic policy that's been talked about, which could be good for asset prices in markets.  You know, I think, for the moment, that's got people kind of hanging in.  And, you know, we'll have to watch and see.  Do we get some momentum on the policy side?  Can we get tax reform in some way?  All that could be constructive.    </p><p>      So I'd say, you've got to watch very carefully, but there's no question valuations are (inaudible) in the equity markets at the moment.  If you don't maintain this earnings momentum and the growth that we have in the economy, we get the 3 percent growth, you know, I don't think you and I will be saying that these market multiples, you know, look high when we look back at that point, but we have to watch and see.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  Well, the one thing that doesn't make sense, or that I'm having trouble calculating, those valuations in the equity market, the tightness of credit spreads, but the 10-year, 228.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  You know, it's -- there's -- there's a lot going on, and there's a lot of uncertainty and it's a complicated -- it's a complicated matrix.  But generally speaking, you would have expected, you know, more movement in that.  But generally, we've all had that, you know, that's -- that's -- that's not the way things have played out over the course of the last few months.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  David, so good to see you.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Always good to see you.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  Thanks for your time.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOLOMON</emphasis>:  Thanks for your time.  (Inaudible).    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCHATZKER</emphasis>:  Oliver, that's David Solomon.  He's the co-president of Goldman Sachs, here at the Milken Global Conference in Beverly Hills.         </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>         THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 percent ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

The two of you --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOWERBY</emphasis>:  There's enough money for --  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Do you wish you could be Howard Ward?  Do you wish it would just be easy and go after the big visible names like Howard does?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOWERBY</emphasis>:  No, I'd rather find names where there's five or fewer Wall Street analyst who follow it than the 50 plus who follow Apple. Ideally how much value add can I do in analysis of Apple, not that you can't you certainly can, but I'd rather find names where they're under followed and where they spun out of a larger company and people don't want to own them but there's value there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  How do you go with the steer, I mean I know you said you got a portfolio mandate to do larger companies and all that --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOWERBY</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  But, you got to love the idea of an information gap that you can take advantage of, as Mr. Sowerby does.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  How do you avoid a value trap, Howard's career is a legacy of value traps he tries to avoid.  How do you avoid a mid cap, small cap value trap?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOWERBY</emphasis>:  I want to avoid a mid cap stock that looks value like that's on its way to small cap.  And is the company very shareholder focused?  Are they generating return on invested capital, great free cash flow?  That really sums it up, are they good on capital discipline, and if that's the case, an evaluation is compelling and the free cash flow is going to improve, then you have a value opportunity and not a value trap.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  David, we live to a world of increasing passive investment, what does that mean for small company research?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOWERBY</emphasis>:  Great, but always beware of the active manager who walks in and talks about this being a great stock picker's market. You'll never hear me say the word stock picker's market, but in this environment we've seen active management now since last July start to gain better footing, 2017 its gaining better footing.  The macro backdrop is a better tailwind to good active managers.  And last and most important, if you're active, be active, don't be a coward and be a closet indexer.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Theresa May has just started speaking in the U.K.  The British Prime Minister on her feet talking about sensibly the gig economy, talking about what is happening here in terms of the changes that are taking place in the U.K.  Let's take a listen to exactly what she has to say.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  This is a special moment, we have Howard Ward with us of Gabelli Fund and David Sowerby of Loomis Sayles, two different worlds of larger cap and mid cap, small cap.  I want to open it up, and Howard Ward I want to start with you.  Back to what you and I remember, which is, people loved the comfort of owning general dynamics.  And eclipse (ph) into his world, people used to like to go out and find stocks that weren't that familiar, where did that go, how did we get away from individual stock enthusiasm in America?  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Are protected from momentum, are you protected from any potential shock (ph) there?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOWERBY</emphasis>:  No.  No.  We know and markets do correct.  The rule of thumb is small cap, mid cap stocks will go down more because of their economic sensitivity.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Let me show a chart here, I did this just for Howard Ward, and David Sowerby you're going to love this.  This is the Ibbotson chart, I use the Dow here, and this goes back to 1905, which is when Howard Ward started working in the market.  These little red arrows are bear markets, that's a percent change 18 percent.  We got a huge bear market here, the collapse in 1929.  Over here, 1987 you can barely see it there.  And here's the latest roll over there, how do you handle a bear market, the two of you with the different class (ph), how do you handle a bear market?  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOWERBY</emphasis>:  I'll quickly add.  You want the micro to complement the macro, which is, when I have a hard time finding individual securities based on the price I'm paying on earnings or cash flow, that's telling me something quite profound.  And even today, companies on a cash flow basis are back to the evaluations we saw when the market corrected in 2011, later 2015 and it's telling you that we're overdue for that 5 to 10 percent hiccup.  And when you can't find good names you start to either hold a little bit more cash or try to gravitate to overused term higher quality.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Guy Johnson, jump in here please.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  David, let me ask you, are CEOs, the CFOs, are CTOs, are management buying their own stock right now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOWERBY</emphasis>:  They are but they're buying less than they were a year ago.  Buybacks have declined, importantly dividend growth is still quite healthy and I want to find companies even in the mid cap range that are growing their dividends.  The most important thing you can say about CEOs and CFOs, CFOs is that they're still deploying what we call capital discipline in the best interest of the shareholder.  And that gives you comfort that we can still avoid that perennial 20 percent bear market. </p><p>      Hiccup, yes, companies are still quite, I think sensible in deploying their cash.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  We're going to comeback with David Sowerby and Howard Ward here.  Continue the discussion on your equity market.   </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Let's get back and talk a little bit about what's happening in these markets right now.  David Sowerby from Loomis Sayles still with us, Howard Ward of Gabelli Fund also still with us as well.  Howard, when we look at what is happening in the big caps, the money seems to be made at the moment, not on what's happening really at the headline level but what's happening at the sector rotation level.  What are you seeing there and where do you expect to make money going forward?  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Yes absolutely hence the rotation story.  David, if Janet Yellen continues on rails (ph) to raise rates and we continue to see negative balance sheet story gathering pace and we start to see maybe a roll off there, how does that trickle down to the real economy, to the smaller mid cap companies, how does the cost of capital affect the businesses that you cover?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOWERBY</emphasis>:  They will naturally be more sensitive to higher interest rates than large company stocks.  Rule of thumb is if the market goes down 5 to 7 percent small caps, mid caps could go down 10 percent.  I think interest rates for the treacherous interest rate forecast are continuing to trend higher as they have in the last few weeks.  And I think the Fed should be raising interest rates.  </p><p>      The Fed's number one mission is price stability with a stable economy.  And in this period of eight plus, nine years of very low interest rates, the Fed needs to be very mindful while inflations is quite low, that they need to start to raise interest rates and a couple of more hikes in 2017.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  David, if we were to see the President being able to deliver on a kind of homeland investment act 2.0 and money starts to comeback, it's mainly held by the big tech companies that Howard has just been talking about.  Would that further widen out the gap between the big caps and the medium and the small cap companies?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SOWERBY</emphasis>:  I think it actually could be beneficial to the smaller caps because, as -- the economy has the expectations to grow faster, think back to the November 8th elections, out of that rally the day after, what led the market?  Not just small cap but micro caps did even better, and they were I think the beneficiary of more sensible regulation, corporate tax reform.  </p><p>      I think, while that's on hold, if we can still get that done that would be more beneficial to those cyclicals and that would be in the small cap area. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>:  Gents we'll have to leave it there, time beats us as ever, Howard Ward of Gabelli Fund and David Sowerby of Loomis Sayles joining us.  Thank you very much indeed, both of you for your time.      </p><p>      ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>        THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100 percent ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

That cycle might turn down sharply next week, next month or next year or maybe even in in a few years\u2019 time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Timing the turn is impossible but precisely because we are late in the cycle investors need to be aware of the increasingly obvious risks and prepared for them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That line of thinking has led me to think aloud about diversification in previous articles. I\u2019ve argued strongly that we should be sensibly diversified between different geographies and not overly UK focused. I also think that mid and small caps have a place in a portfolio alongside large-cap funds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This week I want to take that discussion about size bias one step further and talk about concentration risk. Put simply, are we collectively betting too much on just a few winner-takes-all global mega large cap leviathans? The hard numbers say we are.</p><p>That may be the right thing to do, largely because there is a strong economic narrative that suggests that only global, scaleable brands can capture abnormal profits from increasingly competitive, lower growth global markets. But the downside of this argument is that we are concentrating our bets on a bunch of idiosyncratic businesses that could be vulnerable to all manner of hazards, like regulation and trade wars.</p><h>Know the risks</h><p>My point here is not to say whether concentration risk is a bad thing or a good thing. Rather that we as investors need to be aware of the risks we are taking and know the numbers.</p><p>To flesh out this point I want to start by repeating from an earlier column an observation by equity analysts at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, led by Andrew Lapthorne. They looked at the performance of big benchmark indices, analysing how the standard version of the index performed versed one weighted equally between its members. Equal weight indices tend to flatter smaller and mid-cap businesses whereas market cap indices are inevitably biased towards very large, mega caps stocks.</p><p>Their first observation is that in 2018 and again this year, the MSCI World equal-weighted index has slumped versus the more closely watched market cap index. \u2018In other words, a majority of companies are struggling\u2019 reckon the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u00a0team. The chart below splits a very large global universe of 17,000 stocks into market-cap grouped portfolios and measures their median annual performance over the last 12 months.</p><p>Here\u2019s the key point of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u00a0analysis:</p><p>\u2018The mega-cap group (i.e. those above $100 billion) is powering ahead whilst those in the sub $1 billion market cap range are still struggling to make back last year's loss. The more remarkable numbers are this $100 billion portfolio represents <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">just 77 companies but 27% of the global market cap</emphasis> [my emphasis]. </p><p>\u2018Meanwhile that sub $1 billion represents 7% of the market capitalisation yet over 11,000 companies, or 65% of total numbers. And this is the problem, our increasing focus on a few large cap indices populated by just a fraction of the world's companies is giving investors a false impression. Corporates are struggling!\u2019</p><h>Tech stocks dominate</h><p>Big multi-asset fund managers are also alive to this issue. Aviva Investors put out a note last November which observed that \u2018the top five stocks constitute nearly 18% of the MSCI Emerging Markets index, with the technology sector once again dominant. As for the UK, the five biggest companies account for nearly a third of the FTSE 100\u2019.</p><p>The quant team at Schroders has also weighed in on this numbers watching, focusing its attention on emerging markets in a note published in February. It worries that \u2018many investors in passive investment vehicles are unlikely to be aware of the level of risks they are exposed to\u2019. The team\u2019s core concern is that most of the returns from the emerging markets index has come from just five big (tech) stocks called the \u2018Bants\u2019: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Samsung (005930.KS)</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tencent (0700.HK)</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Baidu (BIDU.O)</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Naspers (NPNJn.J)</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alibaba (BABA.K)</emphasis>.</p><p>Now to be fair this concentration issue in emerging market stocks is hardly new. The top 10 companies in this index have amounted to around 25% since the beginning of this century, when the top 10 accounted for 27%. What has changed is the source of concentration. Whereas previously resource-related industries were dominant, now growth-oriented technology and consumer discretionary companies hold sway.</p><p>And what\u2019s true of regional markets and their indices is also true of national markets. Take India. A recent article\u00a0in the Economic Times, a local business newspaper, observed that \u2018mutual funds are gravitating to the top 10 Nifty stocks in a collective dash for safety. The concentration of fund exposure in the biggest Indian stocks, by weight, is at a decade high, pointing to a likely lull in broader economic activity\u2019.</p><p>Legal and General Investment Management has also warned about concentration risk, this time with global developed market equities. Multi-asset fund manager Justin Onuekwusi points to global equity benchmarks\u2019 domination by US companies. A small handful of these firms \u2013 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple (AAPL.O)</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft (MSFT.O)</emphasis>, Google\u2019s parent company <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet (GOOGL.O)</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook (FB.O)</emphasis> \u2013 currently exceed the index weigh of Germany and France combined. In the first half of 2018, this stock concentration meant that 90% of the overall return for the top 100 stocks in the US were driven by five companies.</p><p>\u2018This concentrated stock risk has been beneficial to global equity benchmarks over the last few years in terms of return,\u2019 says Onuekwusi.</p><p>\u2018In some ways that is not the point \u2013 investors need to be aware of how much risk they are taking to get that return. Such an allocation leaves them exposed to considerable stock-specific risk, making their portfolios sensitive to newsflow emanating from\u00a0just a handful of the world\u2019s\u00a0largest companies. This is particularly relevant if volatility picks up.\u2019</p><p>There is no right or wrong in this debate except to say that any strategy that goes with the flow of market momentum is opening itself up to the risk of investing in a few global winner-takes-all mega caps. If you are happy with that, fine, good on you. Just be aware though of how many concentrated bets you are taking!</p><p>Any opinions expressed by Citywire or its staff do not constitute a personal recommendation to you to buy, sell, underwrite or subscribe for any particular investment and should not be relied upon when making (or refraining from making) any investment decisions.

Yet, if we asked them what branch of government should take the lead in adapting policy to a revolution in technology, they would say that's a job for Congress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alas, I reckon they would be gobsmacked by today's Congress, too. The august creation of Article I of the Constitution can't walk and chew gum at the same time. Often, Congress can't even walk. Gridlock in Congress stalls all causes: the bitterly divisive ones and the vital nonpartisan ones, too. The mobile digital age presents pressing issues, from privacy to the price of broadband. But Congress does, basically, diddly.</p><p> So the need for action falls to the executive branch and the courts \u2014 both of them problematic.</p><p> Relying on executive-branch regulators can result in radically shifting rules of the road. The Federal Communications Commission is a good example. Under Trump-appointed Chairman Ajit Pai, the FCC is preparing to reverse existing policy on \"net neutrality,\" which requires that broadband providers treat all data equally. A change of presidents produces a screeching U-turn.</p><p> As for the courts, their limitations were on display Wednesday in Washington, when the Supreme Court heard arguments over cellphone privacy. You might not realize that your cellular provider keeps track of your travels even when you have your GPS switched off. Each call, text, email and alert that enters or leaves your phone must pass through a nearby antenna.</p><p> In the case before the court, Timothy Carpenter's cellular provider supplied investigators a record of his smartphone's whereabouts. The pings placed Carpenter in the vicinity of several armed robberies in Ohio and Michigan. Now behind bars, he is asking the justices to find this a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be safe from warrantless searches of his private domain.</p><p> Lower courts ruled that pre-iPhone case law was adequate to uphold Carpenter's conviction. Under existing law, if a person passes information through another entity \u2014 a \"third party\" such as a phone company or shipping firm \u2014 the fact of the transaction is not private. If you send a letter, for instance, the writing on the outside of the envelope can be read. If you dial a phone number, the fact of the call (though not its content) is information owned by the phone company. And the carrier can share that fact with police.</p><p> Carpenter's appeal is supported by big tech firms, leading civil liberties groups and digital privacy advocates. They argue that the transformative capabilities of the smartphone demand new protections against search and seizure of our personal digital property. If our entire lives \u2014 not just conversations but also shopping, studying, dating, navigating, playing, dining and documenting our experiences \u2014 take place with and through these devices, should all of it be public? Yet we have no choice but to use these increasingly indispensable tools.</p><p> Justice Sonia Sotomayor saw this issue coming. Writing in 2012, she found existing law \"ill suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks.\"</p><p> No doubt other justices share this insight. Judges are human, after all, and few humans with smartphones haven't fretted over the breadth and depth of the data collected by our digital overlords. And the problem doesn't stop with collection. The capacity to store nearly infinite amounts of data assures that our virtual trails will never go cold.</p><p> The need for new privacy protections seems clear. But in such an intricate web of issues, the courts aren't well-suited to making policy. Their mandate is to decide the discrete legal questions presented one case at a time. A fully formed body of law from the bench may require decades of maturation through a series of cases.</p><p> Which brings us back to Congress \u2014 and, more hopefully, to state legislatures. The legislative branch is best equipped to define big issues, gather research, hold hearings, weigh competing interests and draft comprehensive reforms. Writing as a friend of the court in the Carpenter case, George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr, an authority on the Fourth Amendment and writer for the Volokh Conspiracy blog hosted by The Washington Post, has urged the justices to restrain themselves. \"The Court should continue to allow legislatures to debate and decide how much protection cell-site records should receive,\" Kerr asserted, pointing out that California recently passed very strict new privacy laws.</p><p> Partisan game-playing and mutual suspicion in Congress come at a high price. Pressing decisions that ought to be made by elected representatives in open deliberation are instead pushed into the cloistered chambers of the Supreme Court. Lawmakers claim to resent judges who legislate from the bench \u2014 but they're making it a last resort.</p><p> David Von Drehle writes for The Washington Post.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLSWLD-15913c2dcdfe4c06e6df0e9632c183e60118a1d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABE8E0824E33 TLSWLD2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R32-HKJ1-JBCN-43XD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 BH Media Group, Inc. d/b/a Tulsa World All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tulsa World (Oklahoma)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 1, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjJBNjQ3RjNENTI2NEVCQkJFMTI4RTMxNzIyM0QyNjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODRCNkU5NTg3RTNGNDUzMUFEREU0RURCMTEwMDNDMUE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

There are varying formulations of this movement, but proponents generally point to the purported increase in economic concentration and corporate profits in the U.S. economy to advocate for more aggressive antitrust enforcement, with respect to both mergers and other conduct. One notable element of this movement is a push to expand or even replace the established 'consumer welfare' standard\u2014which focuses on prices and outputs in balancing potential competitive harms against procompetitive efficiencies\u2014by adopting a more rigid presumption that corporate 'bigness' and large market share in themselves harm consumers. Some proponents, moreover, advocate for consideration of nontraditional factors in antitrust analysis, such as wages, employment levels, or growing inequality. </p><p>Such approaches, which could significantly increase the burden on merging parties and allegedly dominant firms, have gained support from prominent figures on both the left and the right. Nevertheless, thus far, the new populism has not made notable inroads with antitrust practitioners, antitrust enforcement agencies, or the courts. The differences between long-standing practice and the new progressive antitrust proposals have come into sharp focus in recent weeks, taking center stage at the FTC's ongoing 'Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century.' Could populist antitrust proposals replace the established consumer welfare framework for antitrust analysis in the United States? Whether the new populist antitrust agenda will take hold depends on the extent to which it can persuade the antitrust enforcement agencies, Congress, and the courts\u2014all of which are interrelated and influence one another\u2014of its underlying evidence and policy prescriptions. Indeed, the willingness of one of these government institutions to advance or reject populist perspectives could affect how open the others will be to revising antitrust thinking. It is too early to tell whether any significant change will occur, or whether that change will reflect a fundamental departure from or just more aggressive enforcement within the existing framework. It is clear, however, that antitrust policy is in the midst of an important debate that could affect how antitrust agencies evaluate business conduct, potentially increasing burdens on merging parties, raising the likelihood of significant divestiture requirements, and limiting the business activities in which firms with large market share can engage. This client memorandum examines the core elements and growing influence of the progressive antitrust movement, reviews its possible acceptance by government institutions, and considers whether it could modify the consumer welfare standard as the framework for antitrust analysis in the U.S.IntroductionDebate over the appropriate standard for evaluating the competitive effects of business transactions and business conduct has long existed in the United States, with the dominant ideology shifting over time. Antitrust sentiment emerged during the Gilded Age of the 1880s in the midst of populist concern over growing corporate concentration and power, with both Democrats and Republicans rallying against the 'trusts' that had come to dominate commerce. During the Progressive Era that followed, Congress enacted the Sherman and Clayton Acts, and antitrust suits led to thebreakupof corporate entities that restrained trade and manipulated markets. Following the First World War, however, American hostility to big business began to fade and antitrust enforcement ebbed. By the 1960s, however, the pendulum had swung back to aggressive antitrust enforcement, especially against mergers. The leading perspective at the time was that consolidation was inherently bad and that efficiency provided scant justification in competition reviews. This thinking allowed the antitrust agencies to block mergers without putting forward much evidence that the mergers were likely to harm competition. For example, during this era the Supreme Court held that the merger of the 10th and 18th largest beer brewers in the U.S. (resulting in a combined national share of 4.49% and no higher than 24% in any state) was a violation of the merger laws in light of 'a history of concentration in the beer industry.'[1][1] In response to numerous enforcement actions that blocked business activities that would likely have benefited consumers, a new approach to antitrust thinking rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s. Known as the 'Chicago School' because of its origin among economists and lawyers at the University of Chicago, this school of thought called for a greater emphasis on benefits to consumers and more rigorous economic analysis. It endorsed a 'consumer welfare' standard for antitrust reviews, which balances an activity's potential harm to consumers\u2014generally experienced through higher prices, lower output, decreased quality, less choice, or reduced innovation\u2014against procompetitive benefits such as lower prices, greater choice, or increased innovation.[2][2] Over time the consumer welfare standard, with its emphasis on economic benefits over structural presumptions, ultimately became the dominant approach, and it continues as the prevailing standard today, even as other elements of the Chicago School's economic approach have been challenged from time to time. Today's emerging antitrust populism movement is a reaction to this post-Chicago status quo, which the movement criticizes as having resulted in under-enforcement, industry concentration, and greater wealth inequality. Accordingly, rather than emphasizing 'consumer welfare,' measured by price and output levels, this loose-knit coalition promotes the incorporation of factors currently not included in antitrust analysis. These factors include loss of employment, increase in political influence, economic inequality, and impact on startup companies. Advocates point to the uneven recovery following the Great Recession as another catalyst for this new populist thinking\u2014arguing that while stock markets and M...ctivity have risen dramatically, ordinary Americans have been left behind. As in the 1880s, large corporations find themselves to be the populist antitrust movement's primary target. This movement, limited until recently to a few academics and advocacy groups, has garnered more mainstream attention from practitioners and government actors, particularly members of Congress.The Antitrust Enforcement AgenciesThe populist movement appears to have developed an audience, at least, with U.S. antitrust enforcement agencies, especially the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC'). Indeed, at the FTC's hearings on antitrust and consumer protection issues (which will run through January 2019), populist arguments have taken center stage during some sessions.[3][3] In his opening statement at the hearings, FTC Chairman Joseph Simons cited recent criticism of the consumer welfare standard as one of the primary challenges that the hearings were meant to address.[4][4] Thereafter, a variety of panelists cited corporate consolidation as a major driver of economic inequality and suggested that some proposals characterized as 'populist' may not be all that unreasonable.[5][5] Even before the hearings began, FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra (one of the Commission's two Democratic members) published a comment letter proposing that the FTC use its rulemaking authority to 'bolster antitrust enforcement.'[6][6] In contrast, panelists at the second day of hearings generally leaned toward maintaining the status quo. While a few participants still made impassioned calls to scrutinize big companies more stringently (notably, Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz of Columbia University), panel discussions focused on practical steps for reform within the existing antitrust framework rather than adoption of new approaches. For instance, the panelists discussed more aggressive enforcement by agencies, the issuance of revised guidelines (e.g., vertical merger guidelines), the performance of industry-specific studies (e.g., on drug patents), and neglected facets of the consumer welfare standard (e.g., buy-side concentration, non-price effects, and encouraging innovative startups).[7][7] Panelists noted that the consumer welfare standard is flexible and can address an array of competitive harms, but that antitrust law is ill-suited to address broader policy concerns, such as inequality or unemployment. Such arguments regarding the appropriate criteria and presumptions for evaluating antitrust harm will likely resurface in future sessions\u2014notably on panels that will discuss the competitive effects of mergers, measurement of market power and barriers to entry, and the interaction between large technology companies and antitrust. Perhaps most importantly, though the FTC's hearings entertained a diversity of viewpoints, President Trump's appointees to the FTC and the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division ('DOJ') have expressed support for established norms. While Chairman Simons has acknowledged criticisms levied against the consumer welfare standard, as Director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition (from 2001 to 2003), he took an economics-driven approach to enforcement and recognized the importance of procompetitive justifications.[8][8] Further, since he became chairman, Simons has made clear his view that 'basing antitrust policy and enforcement decisions on an ideological viewpoint (from either the left or the right) is a mistake.'[9][9] Perhaps more strongly, the head of the Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, stated that 'we don't need to go beyond the consumer welfare standard, because it can get the job done on its own' and that 'there are serious risks to democracy in abandoning the consumer welfare standard.'[10][10] Accordingly, we view it as unlikely that the current slate of antitrust enforcement officials will depart much from the consumer welfare standard, certainly not dramatically or immediately.CongressLegislation might present a more likely path for changing our current antitrust framework. Some Democrats have already outlined a plan to strengthen the antitrust laws in order to 'address excessive concentration' and end corporate 'abuse of economic power.'[11][11] A recent Democratic congressional platform, 'A Better Deal,' includes proposals that would appear to depart from the consumer welfare approach as well as otherwise toughening the antitrust laws. These proposals include: (1)requiring the antitrust agencies to consider whether mergers eliminate jobs or hinder the ability of small businesses to compete; (2)requiring post-merger reviews of companies to ensure that they are not harming competition (which could allow the imposition of post-closing remedies); (3)creating a 'consumer competition advocate'\u2014independent of the antitrust enforcement agencies\u2014that would recommend investigations; and (4)providing that 'the largest mergers would be presumed to be anticompetitive and would be blocked unless the merging firms could establish the benefits of the deal.'[12][12] To this end, Senate Democrats have already introduced several bills.[13][13] Most notably, the Consolidation Prevention and Competition Promotion Act of 2017 ('CPCPA') introduced by Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the Ranking Democrat on the Antitrust Subcommittee, would amend Section 7 of the Clayton Act (the statute governing merger enforcement) to make it easier for the antitrust agencies to prohibit a transaction. The core of the proposal would lower the standard of proof for an agency to block a merger from a 'substantial' to a 'material' lessening of competition (although the practical difference is hard to pin down from the language itself). Another provision of the CPCPA, which would apply to targets worth more than $5 billion when the acquiring company has a market capitalization of at least $100 billion, would require the merging parties to prove that there is no 'material' lessening of competition. (The long-standing current standard puts the burden of proof on the antitrust agency.)[14][14] Relatedly, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) suggested requiring Amazon to divest all of its assets other than its e-commerce platform, much as banks were once required to do under the Glass-Steagall Act.[15][15] As a practical matter, if turned into law, these proposals would make it notably easier for the enforcement agencies to block transactions, particularly large ones\u2014affecting many of the almost 2,000 transactions each year that parties report to the FTC and DOJ.[16][16] Transaction data suggest that in the first half of 2018 almost 20% of transactions were valued at over $5 billion,[17][17] while another source notes that there have been 243 announced transactions valued at over $5 billion in the past five years.[18][18] Just listing a few recent mergers with buyer market capitalization over $100 billion and targets valued at over $5 billion provides a glimpse of the potential impact the 'large merger' provision could have: Disney/21st Century Fox; UTC/Rockwell Collins; Amazon/Whole Foods; Dow/DuPont; and AT...ime Warner. In addition to these merger-related impacts, under the various proposed measures, companies run the risk of triggering heightened antitrust consequences as they cross certain size thresholds, even if purely through successful competition on the merits of their products and services. Some Republicans, most notably Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and President Trump, have also adopted populist antitrust rhetoric. A former Director of the FTC's Office of Policy Planning, Senator Cruz has suggested using the antitrust laws to curtail the position of large technology platforms.[19][19] President Trump has often made public statements that echo populist antitrust rhetoric. While on the campaign trail, he pledged to block the AT...ime Warner transaction, stating that it would concentrate too much 'power in the hands of too few.'[20][20] He also promised to break up companies that he considered to be too large and to have too much political influence. More recently, the White House has reportedly drafted an Executive Order that calls for the antitrust agencies to probe leading tech companies for alleged 'antitrust' violations relating to a perceived bias against conservatives on online platforms.[21][21] As of the date of this Client Memorandum, the Executive Order has not been publicly released. While these legislative proposals and supportive rhetoric should give companies pause, there has so far been nothing close to a clarion call or imminent consensus for competition law reform in Congress. Though statements like those from Senator Cruz might suggest bipartisan interest in antitrust reform, a notably different take comes from Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT): commenting on the Democrats' 'A Better Deal' platform, Hatch, stated that this 'peculiarset of proposals' leaves him 'deeply unimpressed.'[22][22] The silence on the issue from most legislators on both sides of the aisle does not suggest antitrust reform at this time has much momentum. But the Congress next year may have a different calculation.The JudiciaryThe judiciary has historically played arguably the most critical role in antitrust enforcement, interpreting the vast delegations of authority given to it under the antitrust laws as well as reviewing cases brought by the agencies and private parties. Indeed, the Supreme Court has noted that antitrust is, perhaps uniquely, a form of federal common law because of its largely court-driven evolution. Notably, in recent years the Supreme Court has repeatedly taken positions making antitrust enforcement more difficult, holding that antitrust laws do not limit certain types of conduct and rejecting efforts to minimize plaintiffs' burdens of proof. For example, in 2004 the Supreme Court in Trinko (and again in 2009, in Credit Suisse) placed important limits on antitrust intervention in regulated sectors of the economy. The Trinko Court also warned about the overextension of antitrust intervention, noting that 'The Sherman Actdoes not give judges carte blanche to insist that a monopolist alter its way of doing business whenever some other approach may yield greater competition.'[23][23] Moreover, just last term the Supreme Court ruled in Ohio v. American Express that plaintiffs bear a particularly high burden when proving anticompetitive effects in two-sided markets when there are 'pronounced indirect network effects and interconnected pricing and demand.'[24][24] Courts must balance the benefits that the platform's actions bring to one side of the platform against any potential harm to the other side. The practical effect of this decision is that it becomes more difficult for a plaintiff to establish an antitrust violation, which could have a notable impact in the growing technology sector of the economy.[25][25] The Supreme Court's conservative/centrist bent in antitrust cases is likely to strengthen with the addition of Justice Kavanaugh, and even sitting 'liberal' Justices Breyer and Kagan have expressed support for the existing 'consumer welfare' standard.[26][26] Lower courts have also resisted changes to the consumer welfare approach and to the economic methods used to assess conduct under that standard, as exemplified this summer when the D.C. District Court rejected the DOJ's effort to block the AT...ime Warner transaction. AT...ime Warner involved a rare agency challenge to a vertical merger, and in his opinion, Judge Leon emphasized that the vertical merger would result in savings and no elimination of competition.[27][27] The case is on appeal to the D.C. Circuit, with a decision likely in early 2019. Should the case end up before the Supreme Court, it would be the first merger case before the Court in several decades. Accordingly, it seems unlikely that populist antitrust proposals will take hold through judicial intervention in the foreseeable future.[28][28]ConclusionThe conflict between emerging populist antitrust ideas and the established consumer welfare standard has become a central topic in the press, among lawmakers, and at the ongoing FTC Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century. Whether the outcome of these hearings leads to a new consensus in antitrust thinking or leaves the current standard intact is unclear, although, as we have stated, we do not think significant change is imminent through the agencies, Congress, or the courts. Nonetheless, this unfolding debate and the responses of government institutions warrant continuing attention, given the potential stakes for enterprises doing business in the United States.

[2][30] There are still some antitrust matters that are per se illegal, without any balancing of potential harms and benefits once the conduct is proven, such as collusion between competitors ('price-fixing') and members of the board of directors of one company sitting on the board of a competitor ('interlocking directorates').

Multiple other bills have also recently been introduced that would impact antitrust, particularly merger, enforcement. In May 2018, the House passed the SMARTER Act (which lowers the FTC's burden to block a transaction in order to match the DOJ standard); the SMARTER Act is still pending in the Senate. The Food and Agribusiness Merger Moratorium and Antitrust Review Act of 2018 would impose a moratorium on large agribusiness, food and beverage manufacturing, and grocery retail mergers and would establish a commission to review competition issues in those industries. The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2018 would temporarily exempt small news publications from the antitrust laws in order to give them negotiating leverage against the 'duopoly' of Google and Facebook in online advertising.

The President said he had a \"great relationship\" with Mrs May and that trade would \"increase many times\" after Brexit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earlier this month the President cancelled a planned visit to open the US Embassy in London, prompting speculation that he was riled by a rebuke from Mrs May over his apparent support of a right-wing group.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Trump is also said to be concerned that he will face ugly protests in the capital after Labour MPs and London Mayor Sadiq Khan made it clear he was not welcome.</p><p>But as Mr Trump held a one-to-one meeting with Mrs May in Davos, he insisted he will make a visit in 2018, adding: \"We love your country.\"</p><p>                     Mrs May was one of the first world leaders to meet Mr Trump after he arrived at the World Economic Forum at the Swiss ski resort, and discussed topics ranging from Iran and Syria to the US trade levy on Ulster-made Bombardier aircraft wings.</p><p>Mr Trump said: \"We've had a great discussion - we're on the same wavelength, I think, in every respect. And the Prime Minister and myself have had a really great relationship, although some people don't necessary believe that, but I can tell you it's true. \"I have tremendous respect for the Prime Minister and the job she's doing. And I think the feeling is mutual from the standpoint of liking each other a lot.</p><p>\"And uh, so it was a little bit of a false rumour out there, I just wanted to correct it, frankly, because we have great respect for everything you're doing and we love your country.

The prospects for trade and global economic growth, tech companies (feted at previous meetings but now in regulators\u2019 sights), the future of multilateralism and the geopolitical order all face growing challenges.</p><p>Adding to attendees\u2019 sense of pressure and self-doubt is a multi-faceted environmental crisis which this year occupies all five of the top slots in the WEF\u2019s annual report on the greatest risks facing the world \u2014 for the first time.\u00a0</p><p>Here are five key subjects that are likely to occupy delegates\u2019 attention at Davos 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will Donald Trump play nice?</emphasis></p><p>A partial government shutdown kept Donald Trump at home last year, but in 2018 the US president used his Davos speech to strike a combative note on trade\u2014 an early sign of the tensions that were to come. </p><p>Given that he signed the first phase of his renegotiated deal with China last week, Mr Trump is expected to take a softer tone at this year\u2019s event. Last week he said: \u201cWe want those business leaders [in Davos] all to come to the United States.\u201d</p><p>But Mr Trump will be closely watched for any geopolitical manoeuvres \u2014 his recent decision authorising the killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in Iraq has heightened instability across the Middle East. </p><p>Davos will be the first time that world leaders, including Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel and Spain\u2019s Pedro S\u00e1nchez, have a chance to meet face-to-face to discuss the developments. But some are staying away: France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and Canada\u2019s Justin Trudeau will not attend, while the UK is sending chancellor Sajid Javid, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson stays at home.</p><p>Mr Trump\u2019s appearance on the world stage will be a notable contrast with what is going on back home in Washington \u2014 opening arguments in his impeachment trial are expected to begin in the Senate on Tuesday, shortly after his Davos speech.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can global growth recover?</emphasis></p><p>Although Mr Trump has eased off on the trade rhetoric, the tensions his administration triggered leave lingering questions about the prospects for global growth.</p><p>The IMF cited \u201ctrade barriers\u201d as a key reason for cutting its economic expansion forecasts last autumn, and on Monday lowered its outlook further.</p><p>Earlier this month the World Bank downgraded its global growth forecast for 2020 by 0.2 percentage points to 2.5 per cent, warning that the easing of trade tensions between the US and China is unlikely to deliver a rapid economic improvement.</p><p>That leaves Davos attendees to grapple with the question of whether fresh stimulus efforts are needed \u2014 and, if so, who should be responsible: governments, or central banks? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will companies match pledges with substance?</emphasis></p><p>The theme for this year\u2019s meeting \u2014 \u201cstakeholders for a cohesive and sustainable world\u201d \u2014 reflects the number of chief executives who have pledged to start paying as much attention to employees, customers and the environment as to their shareholders.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe centrepiece is stakeholder governance,\u201d said Marty Lipton, the veteran Wall Street lawyer. </p><p>Last year\u2019s Business Roundtable letter, signed by 181 US chief executives, became a symbol of the shift away from shareholder primacy. Mr Lipton called for such rhetoric to be matched by action, especially from large investors, following a lead set by BlackRock\u2019s sweeping changes last week.\u00a0</p><p>The Big Four accounting firms will launch an initiative to standardise how companies report their contributions to the UN\u2019s sustainable development goals.</p><p>But for climate campaigner Greta Thunberg \u2014 who will be attending \u2014 the Davos-going classes are in her crosshairs. Ms Thunberg will demand that business and political leaders halt investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction, end fossil fuel subsidies and divest from fossil fuels.</p><p>At a rally on Friday, she warned those in power: \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen anything yet.\u201d\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Can Big Tech be a force for good?</emphasis></p><p>From digital privacy to taxes, there is much at stake for the tech executives who are descending on Davos, Mr Schwab told the FT last week. </p><p>Satya Nadella, who pledged last week that Microsoft would be \u201ccarbon negative\u201d within a decade, Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Huawei\u2019s Ren Zhengfei will all address the forum.</p><p>Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg will host journalists and publishers in a \u201cFacebook Space\u201d set up to persuade them that the company, which is under pressure from Brussels to Washington, can increase economic opportunity and \u201cbring the world closer together\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>Its challenge was illustrated by a recent report from media monitoring group Media Tenor, which found that the technology sector is now seen by the press \u201cwith the same scepticism as the tobacco or finance industry\u201d.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Do shoe grips offset carbon footprints?</emphasis></p><p>After years of mocking headlines about the fuel-hungry private jets that ship in delegates to wring their hands over climate change, the WEF has this year encouraged participants to use low-carbon transport options such as the train. </p><p>It is also offering shoe grips to encourage them to walk the snowy promenade between meetings rather than take cars.\u00a0</p><p>The effort to be sustainable extends to advising caterers not to serve luxuries such as foie gras and caviar, and one day of the meeting has been set aside for \u201cvegetarian menus and the discovery of alternative protein sources\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>This year\u2019s events \u2014 including the launch of an initiative to plant 1tn trees in the next decade \u2014 will take place in rooms decorated with seaweed-based paint and carpets made from \u201cend-of life fishing nets\u201d. The scores of companies hosting their own events have been asked to consider offering local wines and \u201cmountain herbal infusions\u201d instead of imported drinks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-fb75b61c3a8611eaa01abae547046735</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y16-37Y1-DXP9-902M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1041\"/><timeReceived>3:44 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 19, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

The global economy, after all, is tootling along: there are generally low levels of unemployment, interest rates and inflation; progress has been made in the China/US trade war; and, closer to home, a \"Brexit resolution\" of sorts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But fear for the future of the planet quickly cast a shadow on this sunny outlook. All other risks to global stability - wealth inequality, mass migration, conflict - were overwhelmed by concerns that governments and companies are insufficiently committed to combating the climate crisis.</p><p>WEF Presenters displayed powerful visuals showing how rising sea levels will disappear large chunks of Shanghai and Florida; former Vice-President Al Gore warned the conference that if we continue at our current rates of consumption, by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. Meanwhile, Greta Thunberg sat impassively on stage with the luminosity of a mystic. Shy yet with a single-minded intensity, the 17-year-old delivered her message that the world must act now to prevent temperatures from swelling above 1.5 degrees.</p><p>The WEF's 2020 manifesto was \"stakeholder capitalism\", a model in which corporations have a duty beyond their shareholders to society at large. But, as growing pressure from the financial sector reveals, CEO's are struggling to make meaningful strides towards their environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals. Some business leaders accepted the need for concrete government action, such as subsidising renewables, taxing carbon and regulating big tech. Others joined civil society leaders to push into new frontiers of sustainability, such as \"re-scaling people\" and \"mind-facturing\" smarter cities.</p><p>It was significant that geopolitics hardly featured in Davos this year, even in the context of re-configuring an outdated global order. Instead, maintaining peace was about raising awareness that the planet's future survival depends more today on its disappearing Amazonian rain forests than on nuclear proliferation in the Middle East.</p><p>This change in emphasis was difficult for some to absorb, including a group of confused SwissDavos old-timers who, coated in luxurious furs, were overheard questioning why the climate was featuring so heavily at this year's forum.</p><p>Heads of state who typically attend Davos in the hopes of securing foreign investment this year pitched their sustainability credentials alongside their credit-worthiness.</p><p>Among them were Pedro Sanchez (Spain's on-off prime minister), with his determination to \"deliver an ecological transition\"; Angela Merkel, boasting of her country's coal detox and the new EU Commission President Ursula von de Leyden, touting Europe's Green New Deal.</p><p>Meanwhile, The Obama-esque Juan Guaid\u00f3, Venezuela's leader-in-waiting, delivered a deeply moving speech, pledging to bring dignity and prosperity back to his people, emphasising the importance of safeguarding Venezuela and Colombia's common natural resources - and elicited one of the conference's few standing ovations.</p><p>Davos 2020 was less a new dawn to a greener planet than a dawning to the business community that its time may be up; that their carbon-intensive, profit-dominated ways of doing business are impoverishing life on this planet.</p><p>That said, many hoped that climate consciousness could be good for business. A couple of tech industry attendees passing each other in the corridor, exchanged briefings. \"How's the future?\" called out one. \"We won!\" replied the other. The Chief Strategy Officer of GSMA estimated that 5G connectivity could add $2.2 trillion to the world economy.</p><p>A digitised, 5G-connected and less extractive world should also be more environmentally-friendly and sustainable. And for some, including WEF founder Klaus Schwab, greater connectivity could deliver greater governance efficiency and nanosecond accountability, making the sort of breaches of political trust that have driven the recent populist upsurge more difficult in the future.</p><p>Yet Greta had a warning for those who are counting on the powers of technology to solve the world's climate crisis. Governments need to pass legislation now that incentivises zero-carbon economies, instead of relying on technologies that may never come.</p><p>In any case, perhaps next year's Davos meeting will focus on the new security risks of the 25 billion devices connected to the new internet of things.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-59779690</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INPDWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2W-97V1-F021-63FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"744\"/><timeReceived>4:50 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent (United Kingdom)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19720\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Oh, my god. What a way to start the week.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: A librarian from Chicago takes down Jeopardy James Holzhauer, ending his $2.4 million run.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START, everybody. I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p>ROMANS: And I'm Christine Romans. It is 4:30, 4:31 in the East, 31 minutes past the hour this Tuesday morning.</p><p>We'll get through it this Tuesday.</p><p>BRIGGS: We will.</p><p>ROMANS: I don't know what time.</p><p>BRIGGS: But over the next few hours, President Trump and the British Prime Minister Theresa May will be spending an awful lot of time together.</p><p>First up on the schedule, there's a business round table at St. James Palace. Then the president and prime minister host a breakfast attended by the duke of York and prominent U.S. and British business leaders. Bilateral talks follow later in the day. Now, the two leaders already had a rocky relationship before the president publicly second guessed the prime minister and her take on the Brexit strategy.</p><p>Let's go live to London and bring in CNN's Nic Robertson.</p><p>Hi, Nic.</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Yes, good morning, Christine.</p><p>Well, that business meeting is expected to get underway shortly. Five major British companies, and leading U.S. companies, along with President Trump, Theresa May, the CEOs, they are sitting down together. Theresa May is likely to point to this as a way to show how strong the trade relationship is between Britain and the United States. She'll point to the people around the table, the CEOs and say between these companies, they employ 176,000 people in jobs in Britain and the United States.</p><p>You'll have Barclays Bank. You have JPMorgan. You'll have GlaxoSmithKline. You'll have Lockheed Martin. You'll have British BAE Systems.</p><p>All these companies she will say are important in the strength and depth of a trade relationship between Britain and the United States. However, she'll also expected to say that this can be deepened, that it can be strengthened, that a future trade deal between the two countries could really improve the foundation here.</p><p>So, although this meeting itself is not about actually doing more business per se right now, it's part of the optics of showing President Trump, in particular, the strength of the relationship, what there is already, and what can be built on.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, it's just remarkable, Nic. Both of these countries sort of embroiled in disputes between trade partners, European Union, for example, for U.K.'s perspective, Mexico, and China, some of the biggest players in the world, sitting down to talk about trade.</p><p>All right. Nic, Keep us posted on any developments. Thank you.</p><p>BRIGGS: OK. President Trump and the first lady attended a banquet last night hosted by the queen at Buckingham Palace. The president walking with the queen as Melania chatted with Prince Charles in brief speeches before the dinner. Both the queen and Mr. Trump celebrated the special relationship between the U.S. and Britain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: She has embodied the spirit of dignity, spirit and patriotism that beats proudly in every British heart. On behalf of all Americans, I offer a toast to the eternal friendship of our people, the eternal friendship of our people, the vitality of our nations, and to the long cherished and truly remarkable reign of her majesty, the queen. QUEEN ELIZABETH II, UNITED KINGDOM: Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you all to rise and drink a toast to President and Mrs. Trump to the continued friendship between our two nations and to the health, prosperity and happiness of the people of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Prior to the event, the first couple had tea with Charles and Camilla.</p><p>[04:35:08] And earlier in the day, Britain rolled out the red carpet for President Trump, receiving him with the royal troops salute.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Back home, congressional Republicans may be planning a revolt to block President Trump's new threatened tariffs on Mexico. And according to \"The Washington Post,\" the vote could also block billions of dollars in border wall funding announced by the president in February when he declared a national emergency.</p><p>Now, Senate Majority Whip John Thune tells the post, we have a lot of members who are very concerned about where this is headed. Congress is going to want to hear -- be heard from in terms of trying to limit Trump's tariff authority. The president is threatening to impose a 5 percent tariff on Mexican imports beginning next week and the rate rising incrementally to 25 percent tariffs by October 1st, and not to fix a trade deficit but to punish Mexico for illegal immigration.</p><p>So, using trade as a tool for a different policy goal, it's got Republicans concerned.</p><p>BRIGGS: We have said this before but this is a moment of truth for conservatives in congress, we shall see.</p><p>A setback for Democrats in their bid to stop President Trump from building a border wall. A federal judge ruled the president can transfer funds from appropriate accounts to pay for construction. The judge also says the House lacks standing to challenge the president and concludes the courts should get involved in the fight between the president and Congress. The ruling is not expected to impact other lawsuits by House Democrats and various states to block border wall construction.</p><p>ROMANS: House lawmakers are launching a top-to-bottom antitrust probe of big tech, Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, some of the targets. Rhode Island Democrat David Cicilline leading this investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): This is a broad investigation of the whole marketplace. So, it involved a whole range of companies. But it's really to look at competition in the digital marketplace, to look at anti-competitive behavior and determine whether our existing antitrust statutes are working, when whether they need to be modernized and updated.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) ROMANS: Scrutiny after scandal upon scandal for the tech industry. Critics have called for tough regular regulations. They have demanded in some cases these companies be broken up. The investigation comes as the Justice Department and federal trade agreed to divide oversight of tech.</p><p>Congressman Cicilline said this is the first time Congress has launched a significant antitrust investigation in decades.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CICILLINE: Frankly, you know, I don't have a lot of confidence that this administration has been particularly aggressive in their antitrust enforcement. In fact, they very often have co out on the side of monopolists and big mergers. So, I think, again, they have a responsibility in particular, enforcement actions.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Officials have notified Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook of the coming investigation. Amazon and Google declined to comment. Apple and Facebook did not respond immediately to our request for a comment.</p><p>BRIGGS: The House passing a $19.1 billion disaster aid package, sending it to the president for signature. The Senate passed the bill last week. President Trump said he supports it. The legislation will speed relief funds to communities hard hit by tornadoes, floods, wildfires and other disaster. The bill includes money for Puerto Rico, which is still rebuilding after Hurricane Maria.</p><p>ROMANS: Right after the House passed that disaster relief bill, the president, President Trump, fired up his Twitter account at 1:00 a.m. London Time to praise it. He declared, now we will get it done in the Senate. One problem, the bill is already headed to the president's desk for signature. At least that's what Chuck Schumer hopes.</p><p>The Senate minority leader tweeting: President Trump, you're clearly confused. The Senate passed the bill two weeks ago. Hopefully, after blocking it for so long, you're not too confused to sign it.</p><p>BRIGGS: The long reign of Jeopardy James Holzhauer is now over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TREBEK: So, Emma, it's up to you. If you came up with the correct response, you're going to be the new \"Jeopardy\" champion. Did you? You did. What did you wager? Oh, gosh, $20,000. What a payday? $46,801. What a game? Oh my god.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Emma Boettcher, a librarian from Chicago, dethroned the champ. Holzhauer's remarkable run ended after 32 straight wins, less than $60,000 away from Ken Jennings old time record for \"Jeopardy\" earnings. But don't shed any tears for the professional sports gambler from Vegas, he won a total of $2.464 million during his jeopardy reign.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. People around the world are publicly marking 30 years. It's been 30 years since the Tiananmen Square massacre. We go live to Hong Kong where it will be commemorated. You will not hear about it in China.</p><p>[04:44:14] BRIGGS: Four-forty-four p.m. in Beijing where 30 years ago today, the world witnessed a massacre in Tiananmen Square. Hundreds of people killed in Beijing as the People's Liberation Army cracked down on pro-democracy protesters. Events will be held and speeches will be held around the world today but not in China. Any coverage or discussion of the event will be tightly censored there.</p><p>Let's go live to Hong Kong and bring in CNN's Ivan Watson.</p><p>An interesting study in the \"New York Times\" referenced this afternoon, Ivan, saying that more people worldwide recognize the images of Tiananmen Square than they do in China. How will it be marked there in Hong Kong?</p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I mean, people here are allowed to talk about it. They're allowed to commemorate the 30th anniversary, which is what people are gearing up to do here later this evening on this soggy day in Hong Kong in Victoria Park.</p><p>[04:45:09] But in China, it is strictly sensors, even references to the date, June 4, 1989 and code words that suggest that are strictly censored on the Chinese social media. It's been stricken from the history books in mainland China, so Hong Kong, which has this special status is the only place in modern day China where people are allowed to honor not only the massacre with tanks and troops of the protesters that gathered by the hundreds and thousands in Beijing's Tiananmen Square but they're also able to remember the weeks of pro-democracy protests that led up to the deadly massacre.</p><p>We still don't know officially how many people died on that dark and bloody day. So, that's what we're anticipating to see right here. The thing is in Hong Kong, which enjoys many Democratic freedoms that mainland China does not have, Hong Kong fears that its new Democratic freedoms are being chipped away at by the central government in China which is why you get some signs here that say end one party rule -- Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: Ivan Watson live in Hong Kong this morning. Thank you, Ivan.</p><p>ROMANS: Let's go live to London, St. James Palace, where the president of the United States is meeting with the outgoing British prime minister, Theresa May, and some business leaders from the U.K. and the U.S. about transatlantic ties. Let's listen for a moment on this.</p><p>TRUMP: I appreciate it very much. We are your largest partner, a lot of people don't know that. I was surprised. I made that statement yesterday, and a lot of people said, gee, I didn't know that, but that's the way it is.</p><p>And there's an opportunity, you think a great opportunity to greatly enlarge, in light of what's happening, make a much bigger trading relationship. So we're going to be working on that today and tomorrow, and probably into the next couple of weeks, but I think we'll have a very, very substantial trade deal. It will be a very fair deal, and I think that this is something your folks want to do, my folks want to do, and we want to do, and we're going to get it done.</p><p>I'd just like to congratulate you on having done a fantastic job on behalf of the people of the United States and it's an honor to have worked with you, and I don't know exactly what your timing is, but stick around, let's do this deal. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.</p><p>ROMANS: Here in the United States, talking about doing a deal, talking about the trade ties between the U.S. and the U.K. It's interesting to me, Dave, because they're talking about the U.S. and U.K., strengthening transatlantic ties in a time when the U.K. is embroiled in this messy divorce from the E.U., pulling itself away from integrated trade with the European Union. The United States is threatening tariffs on Mexico in a trade war yearlong almost with China.</p><p>So, talking about trade deals at a time when both countries have been receding from their leadership on the global stage in trade.</p><p>BRIGGS: On the global stage, a lot of questions about what does our word mean today. When you look at what happened, we had NAFTA torn up, we had the USMCA agreed to, that is being threatened by the tariffs.</p><p>John Kennedy, Republican senator, said he is very concerned about what world leaders make of our word, given how many agreements President Trump has torn up. You can talk about the TPP. The Iran nuclear deal, Paris climate deal.</p><p>So, what does our word mean to the U.K., especially with Theresa May outgoing?</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, outgoing, the British Prime Minister Theresa May.</p><p>All right. Let's switch back to politics here in the United States for a moment. Democratic candidate Julian Castro unveiling his reform plan for police. The former HUD secretary wants to restrict the use of deadly force by making officers responsible for intervening if they see fellow officers abusing excessive force or engaging in inappropriate conduct. Castro says the idea is to increase accountability and transparency and what he calls over aggressive and racially discriminatory law enforcement.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIAN CASTRO (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: How many of these videos do we have to watch to understand that even though we have some great police officers this is not a case of bad apples. The system is broken.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Castro says he would prohibit any federal funds to state and local governments for buying high caliber rifles, armored vehicles, and other military weapons and equipment.</p><p>All right. Despite reports of his untimely demise, sources tell CNN North Korea's top diplomat with his hands over his face is still alive. Why are his hands over his face? Details ahead.</p><p>[04:54:20] BRIGGS: Four-fifty-four Eastern Time.</p><p>And sources tell CNN North Korea's top diplomat is alive, despite a report last week suggesting he had been executed. We're told Kim Hyok Chol remains in custody and under investigation for his role in the failed summit February in Hanoi between President Trump and Kim Jong Un.</p><p>CNN's Will Ripley is live for us in Hong Kong with the latest on this intriguing story.</p><p>What is going on here, Will?</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Dave, this really speaks to the difficulty of getting at the heart of what's happening in highly secretive North Korea. South Korean media reported last week and we started checking with sources that Kim Hyok Chol, who is one of the key negotiators, not the person in the picture here but the other video we're about to show you, someone who negotiated with Stephen Biegen, the U.S. special representative for North Korea policy.</p><p>[04:55:07] He was reported executed by firing squad. That's what the South Korean media was saying. I checked with source after source. Nobody would confirm that information. What my sources are telling me is that Kim Hyok Chol is actually still alive, he's in custody along with other members of his negotiating team, the people who were at Hanoi with President Trump, they are all in custody and under investigation, potentially facing serious punishment but they are still alive as of right now.</p><p>Now, Kim Yong Chol, the man in the photo released over the weekend with his hands over his face, he is the North Korean who was in charge of the whole team. He traveled to the White House. He met with President Trump at the oval office but now he, sources tell me, has been stripped of all of his power as a result of President Trump walking out of the summit in Hanoi. And his punishment, South Korea media said he had to go to a labor camp.</p><p>I'm told that's not true, but his punishment was mentally grueling, he had to sit in his office, locked in his office, I'm told, for a period of weeks. He was out of public view for almost two months and he was forced to write sentences of self-criticism in silence in his office, and now he's been trotted before the cameras to show he's alive and well and after basically having to be stripped of all his power and sit in his office and write about the mistakes he made that caused embarrassment for Kim Jong-un empty-handed.</p><p>This man with his hands over his face is sitting at an art performance about as far away as Kim Jong-un in the VIP section as he can get, after being one of the most powerful figures in the country, being released, trotted around to show he's alive, but having to sit in his office, writing about what he did wrong. That's what it works there, Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: And the man overseeing his brutalities, Kim Jong-un, President Trump says he feels special chemistry with him, and at one point said fell in love with over his beautiful letters.</p><p>Bill Ripley, live for us this morning, thank you.</p><p>ROMANS: That's why it's called the Hermit Kingdom.</p><p>All right. A notorious YouTube prankster sentenced to prison in Spain for a video that drew outrage on social media. Kanghua Ren known to followers as ReSet filmed himself offering a homeless man in Barcelona an Oreo cookie that he filled with toothpaste.</p><p>A Spanish court gave Ren a 15-month sentence and ordered him to pay $22,000 in compensation to the victim. He is unlikely to serve time behind bars. Spanish law typically allows sentences under two years for first time offenders and nonviolent crimes to be suspended.</p><p>BRIGGS: The Stanley Cup Final, a best of three series. The Blues beat the Bruins 4-2 last night in St. Louis to even the final at two games apiece. The win for the Blues, the first Stanley Cup final victory in franchise history, if you can believe it or not. The series goes back to Boston for game five on Thursday night.</p><p>Jon Hamm, the most famous Blues fan, firing up the crowd last night, complete with a rock solid playoff period.</p><p>ROMANS: Good Midwestern boy, cheering on his team.</p><p>Let's get a check of CNN Business this morning, taking a look at markets around the world. You can see futures on Wall Street this morning a little bit lower. Look at the mixed performance, I would say, really barely moving overall. U.S. stocks closed lower on Monday as investors worried about the possible crack down of the tech industry and lingering trade fears. The Dow finished up five points, the S&amp;P closed lower, the Nasdaq ended the day down 1.6 percent.</p><p>Frankly, I'm surprised how resilient the broader markets were given where we are in the tech war. Tech stocks hit hard. Google closed down 6 percent. Facebook fell 7 1/2 percent.</p><p>One of the biggest artists in the world is now the first billionaire rapper.</p><p>A fortune of $1 billion, the rapper whose real name is Sean Carter owns a stake in Uber, an art collection, a sports management company, real estate and his extensive music catalog. He's now the 5th black billionaire, joining Robert Smith, the billionaire investor who pledged to pay off Morehouse grads' student loans. Also Oprah on that list.</p><p>All right. It's the end of an era. Apple announcing it replacing iTunes with a trio of apps called Music TV and podcast. ITunes launched in 2001. you know, iTunes changed the way people buy and listen to music.</p><p>The move to phase out iTunes not a big surprise. Apple has been pushing users toward Apple music subscription service. Users will be able to purchase and download songs through iTunes. Gift cards will also stay active.</p><p>It was interesting, the \"Wall Street Journal\" wrote the whole story as an obituary.</p><p>BRIGGS: I guess I'm old school. I'm still an iTunes users.</p><p>All right. EARLY START continues right now with the latest out of the U.K.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019060402CNV34</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8F-V511-JB20-G2WK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3408\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 4, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000290O</classCode><className>BAE SYSTEMS PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000275Z</classCode><className>LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0001QM1</classCode><className>GLAXOSMITHKLINE PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Shares of Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc., Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. built on already-torrid rallies after each reported earnings or revenue that crushed analyst estimates. Combined, the companies put up sales of US$200 billion in the three months ended in June, with Amazon reporting a record quarter.     The earnings served as further evidence to frenzied stock investors that the companies\u2019 automated, algorithmically optimized businesses are not only weathering the coronavirus pandemic but are thriving in it. Politically, they could reinforce suspicions that growth in U.S. technology providers has gotten unhinged. The firms are booming while Old Economy industries like retailing and car-making falter, pushing scores of companies into insolvency and costing millions of Americans their jobs.    \u201cI will tell you this, it\u2019s good that these tech giants did their hearings yesterday and not tomorrow given all these results,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Bloomberg Television.    Combined, Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook boast a market-cap above US$5 trillion, about a fifth of the entire S&amp;P 500. While the average S&amp;P 500 stock is still down seven per cent in 2020, an index of Fang stocks is up 34 per cent.    The chief executives were forced to defend themselves from the sometimes withering criticism of lawmakers who said they were abusing monopoly-like power to expand influence. Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos was grilled on his company\u2019s treatment of small merchants who use Amazon\u2019s online marketplace, while Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, faced questions about whether its Google unit exploited its dominant position in advertising.     \u201cThese companies as they exist today have monopoly power,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who is leading a yearlong House investigation into the companies. \u201cSome need to be broken up, all need to be heavily regulated.\u201d    In written testimony and in their responses, the CEOs told Congress that competition is thriving across the tech industry and consumers are benefitting.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Microsoft said it was pursuing a deal to buy the U.S. operations of the TikTok social media app popular with Gen Z. NASDAQ Composite closed at 10,902, just a breath away from 11,000, as it continues its relentless rise. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose nearly 1%, to 26,675.</p><p>Stocks also got a boost from strong earnings reports in recent days and data showing manufacturing is rebounding better than expected.</p><p>Anticipation is building over Friday's monthly jobs report for July as lawmakers on Capitol Hill continue to argue over whether to reinstate a $600 weekly federal pandemic assistance payment to those who are unemployed.</p><p>Here are some things that could affect the markets tomorrow:</p><p>1. Banks are tightening the credit spigot</p><p>Banks are tightening their lending standards and terms for everything from commercial loans to household loans like mortgages and credit cards, according to the Federal Reserve's loan officer survey. That could mean higher borrowing costs or less credit available for already Covid-challenged businesses and consumers.</p><p>Regulators have already told banks to hold off on stock buybacks so they can preserve capital out of fear that a looming credit crisis could leave them holding big losses. But at the same time, the Fed and other agencies have been encouraging banks to make more credit available to aid in the economic recovery process.</p><p>Still, financials are the second-worst performing sector of the S&amp;P 500 so far this year, down more than 20%. Only energy was worse, down 40%. Shares of Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) are down 29% since the beginning of the year, while JPMorgan Chase&amp;Co (NYSE:JPM) is down 30% through July.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) is down 36%.  Wells Fargo &amp;Company (NYSE:WFC) is down 54%.</p><p>2. Investors eye Nikola's earnings report on Tuesday</p><p>Nikola\u00a0Corp (NASDAQ:NKLA) shares jumped 21% on Monday as the company prepared to release second quarter earnings on Tuesday. The shares gave back some of that gain in after-hours trading, falling 4.3%.</p><p>Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said in a note on Monday that the electric truck maker could provide business updates that would drive the shares higher in the short term. Among the things investors are hoping to learn more about are the customer pipeline for Nikola's electric semi, its plans to build a hydrogen refueling network, and a manufacturing partner for its Badger pickup truck, according to Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner, according to The Motley Fool.</p><p>Analysts have recently been raising their estimates for the quarter, which is typically a bullish sign.</p><p>3.

It did not work: four years later, the tobacco industry agreed on a $US206 billion settlement to resolve dozens of government lawsuits.</p><p>On Wednesday (Thursday AEST),similar attention will be turned towards today's corporate bogeyman: Silicon Valley.</p><p>Apple's Tim Cook, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Google's Sundar Pichai are due to appear before Congress' antitrust sub-committee.</p><p>The four horsemen of tech could avoid the courtroom drama of standing to take oaths, since they have the option of testifying by video call, but the companies' antagonists hope the hearing, will be a moment similar to that when the tobacco industry was brought to heel.</p><p>The timing couldn't be worse. This week, all four of the tech giants are expected to provide fresh evidence of their power when they report their quarterly results.</p><p>Amazon and Apple, in particular, which both report results on Thursday, are expected to be lifted by demand for products and services from people staying at home during the pandemic.</p><p>Apple, which generated sales of $124 billion in the six months ending March 28, is forecast to beat Wall Street expectations.</p><p>Katy Hubery, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, says strong product revenues and growth from its services division will help it beat forecasts.</p><p>Amazon, meanwhile, is expected to avoid posting its first quarterly loss in five years, despite earlier warnings over heavy spending, thanks to big gains in users of its one-day delivery service and cloud capabilities.</p><p>Apple's 32 per cent surge in 2020 increased its market capitalisation to $1.61 trillion,while Amazon is at $1.49 trillion. The big tech companies together are now worth $5.85 trillion - nearly treble the combined market valuation of all the companies in the FTSE 100, which stands at \u00a31.7 trillion ($3.06 trillion).</p><p>It is two decades since the US government took on Microsoft over allegations that it illegally crushed competition.</p><p>Since then, Silicon Valley's main competition watchdog has instead been Europe. EU commissioner Margrethe Vestager has pursued multiple cases resulting in fines of billions of euros. Regulators in Germany, France, and most recently the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), have also studied the companies.</p><p>The US's hands-off approach is changing. The Department of Justice is expected to charge Google within weeks in a case expected to focus on its giant advertising business, which accounted for $135 billion of the company's $161 billion total revenues last year.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission, America's other competition authority, is investigating Facebook's dominance of social media, estimated at 80 per cent of industry revenues. A joint inquiry by 48 of America's 50 states is also focused on the two companies.</p><p>America has a history of break-ups, most famously Standard Oil and the telecoms monopoly AT&amp;T. Similar measures against tech giants are not out of the question.</p><p>Google could be forced to spin off parts of a complex chain of businesses that allows it to dominate each stage of how advertisements are bought, sold and placed online. Facebook, meanwhile, could be forced to undo its takeovers of Instagram and WhatsApp, an idea that has even been backed by one of its co-founders, Chris Hughes.</p><p>Amazon and Apple occupy a second tier of interest for regulators, but scrutiny is growing.</p><p>Cook has insisted that Apple's minority share of smartphone sales means it is not a monopoly, but the company's shift from relying on hardware sales to digital media such as apps, music and news increasingly puts it at odds with suppliers of those services. Last week, Apple felt compelled to release a report defending the 30 per cent commission it charges developers for purchases made on its App Store.</p><p>Mark Thompson, the outgoing CEO of The New York Times Company and former director general of the BBC, last month pulled the US newspaper's material from Apple News, the iPhone maker's news aggregation app. News publishers say Apple demands too much control over the presentation of their journalism and too great a share of subscription revenue in exchange for easier access to iPhone users.</p><p>\"It is entirely reasonable that authorities on both sides of the Atlantic should ask all the right questions about these gigantic companies,\" says Thompson, although he is wary that regulation risks making news publishers financially dependent on rules set by politicians. \"My blood really runs cold when I hear the future could be a kind of government-regulated subsidy from Silicon Valley companies into publishers.\"</p><p>Amazon also disputes claims it is a monopoly, saying last year it represented just 4 per cent of US retail sales. But sellers that rely on its website have alleged that it unfairly uses data about their sales to launch copycat products.</p><p>Bezos's Washington grilling will be his first. A feud with Donald Trump, stemming from his ownership of The Washington Post, means the world's richest man could face more heat than his rivals. Investigators will fear the possibility of the hearing descending into political theatre, instead of surgical questioning.</p><p>If the four horsemen expect patriotism to protect them from being broken up, the hostile reception they are likely to face from Washington may change their mind. After all, America's tobacco executives might have expected the same thing.AFR</p><p>ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY CHRISTOPHER WILLIAMS.</p><p>THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7blz8lpszklvjl736pz</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G4-CNN1-F0J6-J2YT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"991\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

About a decade ago, that is. The fellow of London think tank Demos grew increasingly worried about what was happening under Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and the rest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Finally he confessed to a mild panic about the industry and opened his most recent book with these words: \"In the coming few years either tech will destroy democracy and the social order as we know it, or politics will stamp its authority over the digital world.\"</p><p>Big Tech has had 23 years to do exactly what Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg urged in his company's old motto: \"Move fast and break things.\"</p><p>Because the tech firms haven't just had an unbounded Wild West opportunity to roam and raid unregulated territory. Twenty-three years ago, the US Congress passed a law that actually suspended the normal operation of law so that the tech industry could have unique advantages.It was Section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act that cast a magical protective spell to give the tech companies a special immunity - they're not responsible for what others put on their platforms. Other countries, afraid of seeming uncool and anti-innovation, generally followed America's lead.</p><p>So the tech firms moved fast and broke a lot of things and now the governments of the world have had enough. They're no longer quirky, fun, garage start-ups. They are among the biggest and most ruthless corporations on the planet. Google's parent, Alphabet, for instance, has a share market value three times that of entertainment behemoth Walt Disney, six times that of the biggest Australian company, BHP Billiton, and 140 times that of the New York Times Company.</p><p>Do they really need special legislative immunity from the consequences of their businesses any longer? Consequences like the propaganda and recruitment successes of the terrorist army Daesh, or Islamic State. Or the Russian government's subversion of US elections and democracy everywhere. Consequences like the exponential proliferation of child abuse images. And the US Congress didn't actually grant them immunity from paying tax on their earnings - that's a little extra liberty the tech firms granted themselves.</p><p>After 23 years, the reckoning has arrived. The Australian government is at the forefront. It started four years ago with the Office of the e-Safety Commissioner, a world first designed to protect kids from cyberbullying and other web-borne harms. Now it also removes revenge porn from the web. It's been a success, which is why other nations are studying it and the tech companies are lobbying to curb it.</p><p>Three other examples. First. After an Australian man walked into two Christchurch mosques in March and murdered 51 people in a hate crime partially livecast on Facebook, Scott Morrison joined his New Zealand counterpart, Jacinda Ardern, to get a G-20 agreement to work towards the elimination of terrorist and violent extremist content online. The G-7 summit in France next month will develop the theme. France's President Emmanuel Macron invited Morrison and Ardern in recognition of their leadership.</p><p>Second. The Australian Tax Commissioner, Chris Jordan, had a gutful of big multinational firms dodging their Australian taxes. He went after the big mining firms too, but the tech companies were the main target. They were collecting billions in Australian sales but booking the revenue through low-tax subsidiaries in Ireland or Singapore. In four years, armed with new laws and a hand-picked taskforce, he's got the multinationals booking an extra $7 billion of revenue a year in Australia. And paying tax on it in Australia. Recently, some European governments have reached the same breaking point and announced new tax regimes specifically to target the tax-dodging tech titans.</p><p>Third. Last week the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission delivered its final report into digital platforms. Its chair, Rod Sims, spoke of \"many adverse effects\" that flow from the market dominance wielded by Google and Facebook in particular. In neat symmetry, the commission delivered 23 recommendations for action to protect Australia from some of those effects, one for each year of the era of untrammelled techxploitation. The Morrison government immediately agreed to one of the 23 - for the ACCC to create special branch to protect online privacy and prevent abuse of market power - and is considering the other 22.</p><p>There are two big caveats. First is that while Australia's government can be proud that it is leading in the much-needed regulation of Big Tech, it should also be working to allow Australian business to lead in innovation, as well. Second is that all these initiatives are positive, but they are piecemeal and partial. For instance, none of the Australian measures address Jamie Bartlett's larger worry - the \"manipulation, endless distraction and the slow diminishing of free choice and autonomy\" that Big Tech delivers.</p><p>Is Bartlett's mild panic giving way to paranoia perhaps? Read what Google's then boss, Eric Schmidt, said in 2010 and make up your own mind: \"You give us more information about you, about your friends, and we can improve the quality of our services. We don't need you to type at all. We know where you are. We know where you've been. We can more or less know what you're thinking about.\"That's not creepy at all.</p><p>Peter Hartcher is international editor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc76fgxtkz3yp8ycckbix</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP2-0K61-F0J6-J4GC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"910\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

The House Judiciary Committee says it is launching a \"top-to-bottom\" antitrust probe of the tech industry as the ever- increasing power and influence of the biggest tech companies -- Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google -- has alarmed many and there have been multiple calls to break them up.

I'm Christine Romans.</p><p>And I guess some pictures of this leaked over the weekend, so that was the other scandal.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes, and a few people on Twitter let the cat out of the bag early and they were not happy with him.</p><p>I'm Dave Briggs, 5:32 Eastern time on a Tuesday. It is 10:30 in the U.K. and that's where we begin this morning.</p><p>Over the next few hours, President Trump and the British Prime Minister Theresa May, who is outgoing, will be spending a lot of time together and it's anyone's guess how this will go.</p><p>First up on the schedule, a business roundtable that began just moments ago at St. James Palace. Then, the president and prime minister host a breakfast attended by the Duke of York and prominent U.S. and British business leaders.</p><p>Bilateral talks will follow later in the day. The two leaders already had a rocky relationship before the president publicly second-guessed the prime minister this week on her Brexit strategy.</p><p>Let's go live to London and welcome in CNN's Nic Robertson. Nic, it should be a very interesting day in this special relationship.</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: And, President Trump seemed to want to make it a little more special for the outgoing prime minister, doing pretty much what he did during his visit last summer, which was criticize Theresa May in the newspapers. But when he gets in a room with her, he's very nice to her.</p><p>Today, he said she should stick around and not leave her job, essentially, at the end of the week, as she's planning to do. That she could work out a new trade relationship between the two countries. He said that she was doing a fantastic job for the country and that it was an honor to work with her.</p><p>And on that free trade deal, he said that it would be substantial and it would be fair, obviously, trying to ally (ph) British concerns there that a Britain outside of the European Union would have much less leverage over negotiating a favorable deal with the United States.</p><p>And that meeting -- that business meeting this morning all about pointing out the strength of the relationship. Right now, those CEOs from 10 different companies sitting around the table there. Theresa May talking about how this can be deepened and strengthened.</p><p>After this meeting, President Trump will be coming here to Downing Street. He may get a glimpse of some of the protesters on the streets here in London. They're not so numerous as yet.</p><p>They are putting up that now-infamous Trump baby blimp. That is going to be floated up in the air this morning. But we understand from the police that they won't be able to -- the protesters won't be able to get close to where President Trump and Theresa May will be meeting here on Downing Street.</p><p>That although they will get just down the road from here, they will not be -- get in a position to have sight of Downing Street. Therefore, President Trump may not have sight of them. So, the protesters may, again, be elusive to him however many they are in number, Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: Joining that Trump baby is what we're told is a 16-foot Trump on a golden toilet, tweeting. Nic Robertson, get us some photos of that later on today. Thank you.</p><p>[05:35:09] President Trump and the first lady attended a state banquet last night hosted by the Queen at Buckingham Palace. The president walking with the Queen here as Melania Trump chatted with Prince Charles.</p><p>In brief speeches before the dinner, both the Queen and Mr. Trump celebrated the special relationship between the U.S. and Britain.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: She has embodied the spirit of dignity, duty, and patriotism that beats proudly in every British heart. On behalf of all Americans, I offer a toast to the eternal friendship of our people, the vitality of our nations, and to the long-cherished and truly remarkable reign of Her Majesty, the Queen.</p><p>ELIZABETH II, QUEEN OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: Ladies and gentlemen, I invite you all to rise and drink a toast to President and Mrs. Trump to the continued friendship between our two nations and to the health, prosperity, and happiness of the people of the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Prior to the event, the first couple had tea with Charles and Camilla.</p><p>And earlier in the day, Britain rolled out the red carpet for President Trump, receiving him with a royal troop salute.</p><p>ROMANS: All right.</p><p>But back home, according to \"The Washington Post,\" congressional Republicans may be planning a revolt to block President Trump's new tariffs on Mexico. If there is a vote it could also wind up blocking billions of dollars in border wall funding announced by the president in February when he declared a national emergency.</p><p>Senate Majority Whip John Thune tells the \"Post,\" \"We have a lot of members who are very concerned about where this is headed. Congress is going to want to be heard from in terms of trying to limit Trump's tariff authority.\"</p><p>The president is threatening to impose a five percent tariff on Mexican imports beginning next week. And then, that rate rises incrementally to 25 percent by October first. Again, the first time we've seen using trade as a tool for a completely separate issue, which is immigration.</p><p>BRIGGS: This is a big story in the nation's capital. Let's go there and bring in \"Washington Post\" reporter Karoun Demirjian. Karoun, good morning to you.</p><p>ROMANS: Hi, Karoun.</p><p>BRIGGS: We've said this many times, in particular with the national emergency declaration on the border, but this is another moment of truth for the Republican Party. You're seeing Senators Kennedy, Cornyn, Tumey, and Ernst, as well as John Thune, really speaking out against the president here.</p><p>And here's what John Thune told \"The Washington Post.\" \"We have a lot of members who are very concerned, I think, about where this is headed.\" He added, \"Congress is going to want to probably be heard from in terms of trying to limit Trump's tariff authority.\"</p><p>What can and what do you expect them to really do here when push comes to shove against a president they're very reluctant to push back against?</p><p>KAROUN DEMIRJIAN, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, the question is, do they go beyond expressing concern and disagreements to actually taking a legislative step that could block the president?</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: Congress could try to pass a resolution of disapproval that would keep the president from being able to move forward with these tariffs. Of course, they'd have to get a strong enough coalition that the president couldn't veto that first.</p><p>But they do have that option to try to work to put up roadblocks that would effectively make it difficult or too impossible for the president to do this. But that takes not just chutzpah in the GOP to stand up to the president, but reaching across the aisle with Democrats, too, to make sure that whatever move they take will stand.</p><p>Now, to do that it would be fairly revolutionary for the GOP as well because they have -- at various points we've heard discord in the party about moves that the president has made. But this kind of cuts to the heart of what really matters to a lot of their constituents very, very deeply and this goes to just the way that we perceive terrorists. The president has sold them as if they are just --</p><p>ROMANS: Sure.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: -- a punishment on others.</p><p>A lot of these lawmakers know that it's going to be their people that end up paying this, which is kind of like a tax, which just goes against everything they stand for. So does that kind of cut to the quick enough that they make the move is the big question.</p><p>ROMANS: Which is why I think you see Sen. Joni Ernst on that list.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: And I think that's why Chuck Schumer --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: -- has started this -- Sen. Chuck Schumer, from Iowa, is starting to sound a little tougher --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: -- against some of the president's --</p><p>BRIGGS: In one month -- this first month will be a $17 billion tax increase on U.S. businesses -- ROMANS: Right.</p><p>BRIGGS: -- and consumers. It is a tax increase, plain and simple.</p><p>ROMANS: Let's talk about Congress and big tech because you've got the Nasdaq now falling into correction territory -- a really tough month because of trade.</p><p>But then now because of what looks as though it's going to be Congress looking into whether big tech should be regulated more thoroughly, whether there should be maybe a breakup. We've been hearing that on the campaign trail from some Democrats they should break up big tech. These stocks tumbled all day yesterday because it looks like that threat is real.</p><p>What are you looking at or what are you hearing in terms of Congress and its oversight now of these big tech companies, which have been plagued by scandal after scandal?</p><p>[05:40:00] DEMIRJIAN: Scandal after scandal. Look, you didn't really have -- as much as you had discussions, generally speaking, about the Internet and these companies, you didn't really have this sort of focused scrutiny until after people got really serious at looking at what happened in the 2016 elections --</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: -- and how these companies were often used to -- for manipulative purposes.</p><p>And so, there's been incredible resolve in Congress to be upset about it. To look at things like this -- to do something. They haven't defined what that something really is, though, very well until, potentially, this point.</p><p>I mean, look, this is going to be a very broad inquiry. We still don't know exactly what their end game plan is. Is it to break up these companies? Is it just to impose more regulations?</p><p>But really, Congress has not done much to tread into the Internet space even though we've had an Internet world, really, that we've been living in for decades at this point. But this is going to potentially give them an opportunity to make some of these moves.</p><p>The question is how forceful do they want to be and can they do something that both appeals to Democrats, Republicans, privacy advocates, corporate advocates? There's a big coalition here to work through. But this seems to be the point at which we're going to see something happen.</p><p>And look, in the process, the side benefit may be that we see lawmakers learning more about how the Internet works --</p><p>ROMANS: Works, yes.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: -- which has always been a little bit of handicap -- ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: -- for them. This process is that they're trying to regulate something that they fundamentally don't understand --</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: -- as well as the tech companies do.</p><p>So this is a way for them to get up to speed and actually think about what makes sense to do at the end of the day.</p><p>ROMANS: Well, that's been the big concern is that Congress is going to regulate this very high-tech, complicated industry. I mean, do they -- do they have that skill set? That's been the big question.</p><p>BRIGGS: Watch campaign donations from big tech to Congress ahead of the 2020 cycle --</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BRIGGS: -- and this conversation might change.</p><p>But let's circle back to our top story, which is the president in the U.K. and a visit that started with him anger-tweeting at CNN and our parent company AT&amp;T, as well as the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, with some pomp and circumstance in between, which he loves.</p><p>How will this trip be remembered, and how will it button up with that press availability -- Theresa May side-by-side with the president, probably talking Brexit and trade?</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: Well, this is a moment for the president. He's trying to make nice with the -- with the British. But it also is a question of how much is it going to matter going down the line?</p><p>Theresa May isn't going to be in charge anymore. The Queen is a figurehead. The president has stirred up things with the mayor, but that was kind of always the way that things were anyhow.</p><p>So, are they really going to talk about some substantive trade deals? Maybe this will lead to the feeling of goodwill with the country because there has been a lot of acrimony between -- as you've seen, the protesters in the streets, the acrimony between the British and the United States lately over President Trump --</p><p>Will this be turning the page on a new chapter or will this just kind of be calming everybody down because we're in an era right now where the president is slapping tariffs left and right on many other countries, including allies. So will he take a more open-minded approach -- open trade approach, really, with the U.K., which is really the most important thing for them?</p><p>But I don't think you can necessarily take the temperature of exactly how things go forward from here because everybody he's meeting with is not going to be who's going to be the decision makers -- ROMANS: Right.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: -- in the months ahead. And so, that could completely change the environment that they're -- everybody's in.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right. Karoun Demirjian, thanks so much, from \"The Washington Post\" and CNN here.</p><p>She mentioned taking the temperature. We took the temperature of the U.K. front pages. Let's just give you a glimpse at what they're saying over there upon the president's visit to the U.K.</p><p>TEXT: \"The Guardian\" -- \"Tea and antipathy: insults mark start of Trump visit.\"</p><p>BRIGGS: You've got to remember, he has a 21 percent approval rating there. Thousands are expected to protest today.</p><p>TEXT: \"Daily Mirror\" -- \"Pomp &amp; Protest.\"</p><p>BRIGGS: And that one probably nails it the best -- \"Pomp &amp; Protest.\" That will really represent these couple of days.</p><p>TEXT: \"Daily Mail\" -- The Winners...and Stone Cold Losers.\"</p><p>BRIGGS: But, does he want to support Theresa May, Christine --</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: -- after really endorsing Boris Johnson ahead of her exit? It will be an interesting couple of hours. \"NEW DAY\" will have that press availability.</p><p>ROMANS: And meanwhile, people around the world are publicly marking 30 years since the Tiananmen Square massacre. We're going to go live to Hong Kong, next.</p><p>[05:47:58] BRIGGS: Five forty-seven p.m. in Beijing where 30 years ago today the world witnessed a massacre in Tiananmen Square. Hundreds of people killed in Beijing as the People's Liberation Army cracked down on pro-democracy protesters.</p><p>Events will be held and speeches will be made around the world today, but not in China. Any coverage or discussion of the event will be tightly censored there.</p><p>Let's go live to Hong Kong and bring in CNN's Ivan Watson. Good morning, Ivan.</p><p>Matt Rivers just checked in with us a bit ago from Beijing where there is not a whisper of it. What's the situation there?</p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's kind of remarkable because this is the only place in modern day China -- this former British colony -- where people can gather and commemorate not only the massacre of hundreds, perhaps thousands of demonstrators 30 years ago today in Beijing, but they can also honor the weeks of pro-democracy protests that occupied Tiananmen Square that led up to that fateful decision to send in the tanks and the troops who began gunning unarmed demonstrators down.</p><p>And I just spoke with one of the organizers here and he says not only are they trying to keep the memory alive -- and his t-shirt said, in Chinese, \"Never Forget\" -- but they're also fighting for their own freedom because many Hong Kongers fear that the democratic freedoms they enjoy as part of the deal that was made to hand Hong Kong back to Beijing's control decades ago -- that those freedoms are now under threat as the central government in Beijing slowly and incrementally tightens its grip over this island city.</p><p>So, people here feel like they've got to fight for their own freedoms while also fighting to keep the memory of what happened 30 years ago, in Beijing, alive.</p><p>Just this weekend, I heard the Chinese defense minister, in Singapore, defending the crackdown, saying hey, look at 30 years of economic growth -- essentially, justifying the crackdown and saying that there was a bargain.</p><p>And in response, one of the organizers here says it's a shame because that economic growth is built on bloodshed -- Dave and Christine.</p><p>[05:50:12] ROMANS: Wow.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right, Ivan Watson. A very important story today, 30 years since Tiananmen Square. Thank you.</p><p>Back here, the long reign of \"JEOPARDY!\" James Holzhauer is over.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TREBEK: So, Emma, it's up to you. If you came up with the correct response, you're going to be the new \"JEOPARDY!\" champion.</p><p>Did you? You did. What did you wager? Oh gosh, $20,000.</p><p>What a payday -- $46,801.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Sealed with a high-five from James. Emma Boettcher, a Princeton-educated librarian from Chicago who wrote a masters paper at North Carolina on \"JEOPARDY!\" dethroned the champ.</p><p>Holzhauer's remarkable run ended after 32 straight wins. He was less than $60,000 away from Ken Jenning's all-time record for \"JEOPARDY!\" earnings.</p><p>Don't shed tears for James, though. The professional gambler from Las Vegas won more than $2.4 million during his \"JEOPARDY!\" reign.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Speaking of money, let's get a check on \"CNN Business\" this Tuesday morning.</p><p>Taking a look at markets around the world, really a mixed performance. I would call this treading water here. On Wall Street right now, one of the indications for the opening bell may be slightly higher here, although nothing is even registering one percent.</p><p>Stocks closed lower Monday as investors worried about the possible crackdown of the tech industry and lingering trade fears. The Dow finished up just five points. I would say that's actually kind of remarkable that it's treading water this way with so many cross- currents. The S&amp;P 500 closed lower.</p><p>News that big tech companies face antitrust scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and regulators has pushed the Nasdaq now into correction territory. It is 10 percent off its recent high.</p><p>The Nasdaq ended the day down 1.6 percent. It is now 11 percent down from the highs at the beginning of May.</p><p>A tough, tough month for tech investors. Tech stocks were hit hard by the news of the antitrust probe of the industry. Google closed down six percent, Facebook fell 7 1/2 percent.</p><p>All right, I'll show you what Jay-Z's got. He's got a spot on the Forbe's billionaires list. He is now the first billionaire rapper.</p><p>The rapper, whose real name, of course, is Sean Carter, owns a stake in Uber, his streaming service title, an art collection, a sports management company, real estate, and his extensive music catalog.</p><p>He is now the fifth black billionaire in the U.S., joining Robert Smith, the billionaire investor, of course, who pledged to pay off Morehouse grad's student loans. Oprah is also on that list. Congratulations to him.</p><p>It's the end of an era. Apple announcing it is replacing iTunes with a new trio of apps called Music, T.V., and Podcasts.</p><p>Remember, iTunes launched back in 2001. This was the game changer. It changed the way people buy and listen to music.</p><p>The move to phase out iTunes is not a complete surprise. Apple's been pushing users toward its Apple music subscription service.</p><p>An Apple spokesperson said users will still be able to purchase and download songs through iTunes. iTunes gift cards will also stay active.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>[05:57:25] BRIGGS: A Miley Cyrus getting far too close for comfort in Barcelona this past weekend. Video shows the fan grabbing Cyrus and trying to kiss her as she was leaving her hotel with her husband, Liam Hemsworth. She was said to be unsettled by the incident but doing just fine.</p><p>The Stanley Cup Final now a best of three series. The Blues beat the Bruins 4-2 last night in St. Louis to even the Cup Final at two games apiece. The win for the Blues -- believe it or not -- their first- ever Stanley Cup Final home win in franchise history.</p><p>The series now goes back to Boston for game five Thursday night.</p><p>While you were sleeping, comics had a field day -- oh, here's -- first, we saw Jon Hamm there -- pardon me -- cheering on the crowd. The mad man with the playoff beard rocking the crowd.</p><p>Let's get now to the \"Late-Night Laughs\" across the pond. While you were sleeping, they had some fun with this presidential trip to the U.K.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEPHEN COLBERT, HOST, CBS \"THE LATE SHOW WITH STEPHEN COLBERT\": Trump also met with the Queen and greeted her with the ceremonial fist bump. Come on, man.</p><p>He got the classic royal tour, complete with a review of the famous Royal Guardsmen. How do you get your hair that much height? What do you do?</p><p>I cannot imagine how much Aqua Net you've got up there. Nobody smoke -- nobody smoke around this guy.</p><p>Then there was the traditional exchange of gifts. Queen Elizabeth gave Trump a first-edition copy of Churchill's World War II book. Look, thank you so much, but don't tell me how it ends, all right?</p><p>TREVOR NOAH, HOST, \"THE DAILY SHOW\": That's right. The Queen's gift for Donald Trump was a book. Either she doesn't know Trump or she's trolling him. Why would you give Donald Trump a book? Everyone knows the man doesn't read.</p><p>I wish I was there when the Queen gave him his gift.</p><p>She's like, \"Here you go, Donald. A book about World War II.\"</p><p>He's like, \"Wow, this is sad.\"</p><p>\"Yes, many lives were lost.\"</p><p>\"No, I mean the fact that I have to read. It's so sad.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: All right, thanks for joining us. I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p>Christine Romans has the effort to break up big tech, right now, on \"NEW DAY.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TRUMP: Stick around and let's do this deal.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: President Trump is set to meet with outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Here you have a man who knows nothing about the European Union giving kind of trade advice.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People will actually share his view about the way Brexit is being handled.</p><p>ROMANS: New details from Joe Biden revealing a key new policy plan.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our country is in a time of crisis. The time for small ideas is over.</p><p>TREBEK: What did you wager? Oh, gosh, $20,000.

For Tan Su Shan, managing director and group head of consumer banking and wealth management at DBS, these are exciting times.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Year-on-year, the Singapore-based bank's total earning assets have jumped by 22%, hitting an impressive S$240 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, income has risen by 21% to S$546 million, and assets under management (AUM) have increased by 23% to S$195 billion \u2013 thanks in part to DBS' acquisition of ANZ.</p><p>The decision to acquire its rival's wealth management and retail banking businesses in five markets \u2013 Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Indonesia \u2013 was announced last October, and will cost the bank approximately S$110 million.</p><p>In 2016, the portfolio of businesses that DBS acquired from ANZ consisted of total deposits of S$17 billion, loans of S$11 billion and total revenue of S$825 million. The former ANZ businesses serve approximately 1.3 million customers, of whom more than 100,000 are affluent private wealth customers. The remaining 1.2 million are retail customers.</p><p>Following the full integration of ANZ, DBS expects to add S$23 billion in AUM to its books, with high-net- worth clients alone accounting for around S$6 billion. So far, the bank has completed the migration of three markets. In July, it finalised the transfer of ANZ's wealth management and retail banking business in China, followed by Singapore in August andHong Kong in September. The process has seen DBS' relationship manager (RM) headcount swell to about 300.</p><p>For Tan, looking from a top-down perspective, this has been a very good deal for DBS. It provides the group access to businesses at a scale that would have taken a long time to build.</p><p>\u2018We are now busy with Taiwan and then next February we will do Indonesia,' she explains. \u2018It's very complicated because it's five countries, five different regulations, five different systems, five different sets of clients and five very different businesses.'</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scoring big</emphasis></p><p>The ANZ acquisition will add a large customer franchise to DBS in Indonesia and Taiwan, which are key markets for the bank. In Indonesia, DBS will gain about 410,000 customers, effectively increasing its base by six times. In Taiwan, DBS will add around 530,000 customers, expanding its base by 2.5 times. A significant portion of these are credit card customers.</p><p>\u2018In Taiwan and Indonesia, we don't have a cards base. ANZ's credit card base is largely high-net-worth, high-end clients. It's an excellent business and a great franchise, which would have taken me years to build,' Tan says.</p><p>According to the executive, both Taiwan and Indonesia are tough markets because the credit card systems are very different. DBS will have to build new systems from scratch and then integrate them with its existing systems. Then, there are the mobile banking, internet banking, wealth management, and dry -un procedures to consider. In every country, DBS tries to do at least five dry runs.</p><p>Despite the teething problems, the acquisition is a smart move for DBS. ANZ's wealth business is largely offshore, and Tan describes how this complements DBS's 80% onshore market share in Hong Kong and Singapore.</p><p>\u2018So has it been complicated? Yes. Has it been hard work? Yes.' At least it seems to be worth the effort.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Regulating AI</emphasis></p><p>Private banks in Singapore and Hong Kong are dealing with a whole host of new regulations, many of which will be  implemented from 2018 onwards. This includes the OECD's Automatic Exchange of Information \u2013 a measure designed to prevent tax evasion \u2013 and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), a pro-transparency reform from the EU that is due to come into effect in January.</p><p>What's more, wealth managers dealing with US clients are already struggling with the reporting burdens of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca) \u2013 a US law that targets non-compliance with the tax laws by American citizens using overseas accounts.</p><p>Another set of OECD tax regulations, the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) guidelines, are also going to impact the way  Asia's high-net-worth individuals structure their busines ses. The BEPS guidelines aim to prevent tax evasion by those who exploit gaps and mismatches in the tax rules of different countries.</p><p>As a result of this growing regulatory burden, private banks in the region have been expanding their compliance teams and spending extensively on compliance technology, including tools for Know Your Customer (KYC) checks.</p><p>\u2018There are so many players in the market and you have got to have rules that everyone abides by. Both KYC and anti-money laundering are important private banking codes of conduct, plus obviously channel supervision,' Tan says. \u2018I think we have evolved over the years,' she adds.</p><p>\u2018What is tricky now is that the fintechs are coming in, meaning the big tech companies. One day Amazon will start doing financial services \u2013 it could do wealth management services tomorrowif it wanted to.</p><p>\u2018Alipay and WeChat are already doing it. These guys already have their customers and for them to layer on wealth management services is very easy. They sell virtually, through the phone.</p><p>\u2018So then, do they have the same regulations as banks?' she wonders. \u2018I think the rules will have to change with the use of AI [artificial intelligence], robots and robo advice.'</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Embracing change</emphasis></p><p>Thanks to the rise of the internet and new technologies, banking has become a lot more convenient, not to mention more digital. Deloitte estimates that the majority of the population will be technologically adept by 2025.</p><p>As such, DBS has transformed its wealth management business with the latest enhancement to its wealth platform, DBS iWealth. The improved application allows clients to conduct their banking transactions, manage their wealth and make trades on a single platform.</p><p>The bank has also adopted usability testing, human-centred design and Uber-like ratings to solicit constant feedback from its wealth clients.</p><p>\u2018Now it's all automated, even for our RMs,' Tan says. \u2018In the past, before an RM went to see a customer they had to pull data from four different cylinders: the customer relationship management for KYC, the portfolio itself for the portfolio, the banking system for the banking staff and the research for research.</p><p>\u2018This took about 45 minutes, and then you had to set an agenda. Today, RMs have iPads with an app called RM Mobility. The AI picks all the research that is relevant to you. You don't have to lift a finger,' she explains.</p><p>\u2018It puts an agenda together for the meeting, puts your portfolio together for the meeting, puts your research together for the meeting. Not only that, but we also have something called Project Cycle, which is all the data analytics on the client.'</p><p>However, this impressive technology raises a big question for the industry: will AI make RMs obsolete?</p><p>'I don't think the role of an RM will go away because people still want that human-to-human interaction,' Tan says. \u2018You will still need RM assistance for some segments of the population, especially the elderly.</p><p>\u2018In fact, RM assistance is a business that's doing very well. It has gone from half a billion to two billion dollars for us in the past five years, so we will keep growing that because that's organic wealth being created in Asia.</p><p>'But the younger ones, the really young ones like generation Z, are quite happy to never have a human-to-human relationship. So as a wealth manager you need both,' she adds.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Next-gen thinking</emphasis></p><p>The world of finance is becoming more and more interested in how millennials spend their money, with several studies finding that they are more likely to make new investments and explore alternative ways to generate income than the baby boomers.</p><p>Tan says the next generation of wealth investors is particularly aware of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, and thinks of investing as an attempt to do some good in the world. In practice, this means millennial investors will sometimes refuse to invest in companies they think will cause environmental damage.</p><p>\u2018They are all about leaving an impact. If you tell them we were the first to do a women's livelihood bond, they are very supportive of that. They are also more prepared to say \u201cI'll try a bit of private equity, I'll try bonds and I'll try different kinds of equities.\u201d So they are a little bit more diverse than their parents and they are able to have multiple focuses.'</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Three big pillars</emphasis></p><p>Beyond the acquisition of ANZ, DBS is keen to grow its global Chinese and global non-resident Indian (NRI) footprints. For example, the bank is looking to grow its presence in China through new partnerships, as the country's domestic and offshore markets have already proved to be valuable. Another key focus is continuing to grow the bank's footprint in Southeast Asia, and particularly in Indonesia, where ANZ has been a game-changer for the bank.</p><p>According to Tan, Indonesia has been one of the group's fastest growing countries, and is a market with yet more scope for growth.</p><p>\u2018Its domestic wealth management has been fantastic. We have been doing really well there on the domestic side for high-net-worth. And with the Common Reporting Standard coming in and more monies going back onshore, we must be there to receive our customers who go back home,' she says.</p><p>\u2018We launched our digital bank in Indonesia about a month ago. It has surprised us with the uptake and the funding. It has been very good. I am very optimistic on Indonesia. Chinese global, NRI and Indonesia are the three big pillars for us in this region.'</p><p/><h>Out of the office</h><p>Currently reading: Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari</p><p>Life lesson: \u2018Don't take life for granted.

The incident, which affected more than 87 million users, beginning in 2014, came to light this March, sparking investigations around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The opening salvo from the D.C. attorney general ended a protracted silence on the part of many U.S. regulators, who have faced immense pressure - from members of Congress and average web users - to discipline Facebook for what many see as a reckless disregard for online privacy. Some of Silicon Valley's toughest critics have urged the government to slap Facebook with severe fines and other penalties that might force it to rethink a business model that monetizes the most intimate details of consumers' lives.</p><p> \"It's about time,\" said Christopher Wylie, who exposed the Cambridge Analytica controversy through reports in several news organizations.</p><p> But the fact that the first legal action came from local D.C. officials - not their federal counterparts located a 10-minutes walk away - left some privacy advocates fearful that the U.S. government's primary consumer-protection cop increasingly is outmatched by Silicon Valley. That agency, the Federal Trade Commission, started investigating the Cambridge Analytica controversy weeks after it became public, out of concern that Facebook violated a pledge it made to regulators to honor its users' privacy settings. On Wednesday, representatives of the FTC again declined to comment on its progress.</p><p> \"The agency needs to show us that it can stand up to Big Tech,\" said Hal Singer, a senior fellow at George Washington University's Institute of Public Policy.</p><p>Facebook said in a statement Wednesday it is \"reviewing the complaint and (looks) forward to continuing our discussions with attorneys general in D.C. and elsewhere.\" Facebook's stock price closed down more than 7 percent Wednesday.</p><p> The D.C. case threatens to develop into an even worse headache for Facebook. Racine told reporters that his office has \"had discussions with a number of other states that are similarly interested in protecting the data and personal information of their consumers,\" though he cautioned there is no formal agreement for them to proceed jointly. And the attorney general's aides said they could add additional charges to their lawsuit as other details about Facebook's privacy lapses become public.</p><p> In the months since the Cambridge Analytica scandal began, Facebook has fielded considerable criticism for a series of privacy missteps. Last week, Facebook said as many as 6.8 million users' photos may have been improperly accessed by third-party apps. On Tuesday, new details emerged about Facebook's extensive data-sharing arrangements with corporate partners, including Amazon and Spotify. The report from The New York Times quickly triggered another round of calls from Capitol Hill for the tech giant to be penalized.</p><p> \"It appears that Facebook has not been honest with Congress or the public about how it treats its users' data,\" said Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., the incoming chairman of the tech-focused House Energy and Commerce Committee. \"Based on these revelations, I'm concerned that Facebook may have provided the Committee with inaccurate, incomplete or misleading responses to our questions, and we'll be following-up.\"</p><p>Facebook's troubles with Cambridge Analytica came to light in March, after Wylie revealed that the political firm sought to create \"psychographic\" profiles about social media users - by analyzing their Facebook data - and target them with messages that preyed on their hopes and fears. Among those affected were half of D.C. residents, said Racine, the District's attorney general, when he announced his lawsuit in a call with reporters. Citing the region's consumer-protection law, Racine contended that Facebook misled users about the security of their data, made it difficult for users to control their privacy settings and failed to inform them promptly after discovering Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed personal information.</p><p> \"Facebook's lax oversight of its privacy protocols and confusing privacy settings put the personal information of millions of Americans at risk,\" Racine said.</p><p> The D.C. lawsuit also took issue with other business practices at Facebook, including its relationships with device-makers, such as BlackBerry, that could access social data in ways that could \"override\" a user's privacy settings, according to the complaint. In response, the attorney general's office said the District sought an injunction to \"ensure Facebook puts in place protocols and safeguards to monitor users' data,\" along with \"restitution for consumers, penalties, and costs.\"</p><p> While D.C. takes aim at Facebook, federal regulators remained quiet about their next steps. The Cambridge Analytica controversy initially drew the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. The FTC in particular has probed whether Facebook's relationship with Cambridge Analytica - and its handling of users' data - violated a 2011 agreement brokered by the U.S. government that required the tech giant to improve its privacy practices or risk major fines. The penalty, which is assessed based on the total number of violations and users affected, could reach into the billions of dollars, experts have said.</p><p> In recent weeks, though, FTC Chairman Joe Simons repeatedly has declined to update members of Congress about the probe - or the extent to which the government has started studying Facebook's other privacy mishaps. Appearing at a Senate hearing in November, Simons said it would be \"inappropriate for me to comment on a specific nonpublic investigation\" - even though the FTC itself previously confirmed that it is investigating.</p><p> The FTC's silence did little to satisfy Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. \"We need to know when you will have some results, because these continuing violations clearly show we have something more than a single bad-actor problem, and it is not only Facebook,\" he said at the time. \"I think you have an obligation to tell us when you think this investigation will be done.\"</p><p> Veterans of the FTC - which tends to operate in secrecy - acknowledged that the agency can take upwards of a year to probe a violation fully, and that the scope of investigations can expand as new information emerges. But analysts said the commission faces a major time-sensitive test with Facebook: Should the FTC fail to act swiftly in the social media giant's case, at a moment when its privacy mishaps are piling up, the agency could find itself weakened in its ability to hold the rest of Silicon Valley accountable.</p><p> \"The stakes are extremely high for the agency,\" said Marshall Steinbaum, research director at the New York-based Roosevelt Institute, a left-leaning think tank. \"The companies want Congress to empower the FTC as the sole arbiter of privacy issues. If the companies can run the table on them \u2026 then we can't seriously entertain the idea that this agency is capable of regulating the sector.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKTN-2068448</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898FC6AFE8AB7 NWBKTN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V0W-J0C1-JBCN-43RX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401981</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1257\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Daily Herald, Stephens Media, LLC, d/b/a The Daily Herald<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Racine on Wednesday targeted Facebook mainly for its entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that harvested names, \"likes\" and other data from the social site without users' permission. The incident, which affected more than 87 million users beginning in 2014, came to light in March, sparking investigations around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The opening salvo from the D.C. attorney general ended a protracted silence on the part of many U.S. regulators, who have faced immense pressure - from members of Congress and average web users - to discipline Facebook for what many see as a reckless disregard for online privacy.

Racine on Wednesday targeted Facebook mainly for its entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that harvested names, \"likes\" and other data from the social site without users' permission. The incident, which affected more than 87 million users beginning in 2014, came to light in March, sparking investigations around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The opening salvo from the D.C. attorney general ended a protracted silence on the part of many U.S. regulators, who have faced immense pressure - from members of Congress and average web users - to discipline Facebook for what many see as a reckless disregard for online privacy. Some of Silicon Valley's toughest critics have urged the government to slap Facebook with severe fines and other penalties that might force it to rethink a business model that monetizes the most intimate details of consumers' lives.</p><p>\"It's about time,\" said Christopher Wylie, who exposed the Cambridge Analytica controversy through reports in several news organizations.</p><p>But the fact that the first legal action came from District officials - not their federal counterparts located a 10-minute walk away - left some privacy advocates fearful that the U.S. government's primary consumer-protection cop increasingly is outmatched by Silicon Valley. </p><p>That agency, the Federal Trade Commission, started investigating the Cambridge Analytica controversy weeks after it became public out of concern that Facebook violated a pledge it made to regulators to honor its users' privacy settings. On Wednesday, spokespeople at the FTC again declined to comment on their progress.</p><p>\"The agency needs to show us that it can stand up to Big Tech,\" said Hal Singer, a senior fellow at George Washington University's Institute of Public Policy.</p><p>Asked about the lawsuit, Facebook said in a statement Wednesday it was \"reviewing the complaint and [looks] forward to continuing our discussions with attorneys general in D.C. and elsewhere.\" </p><p>Facebook's stock price closed down more than 7 percent Wednesday.</p><p>The D.C. case threatens to develop into an even worse headache for Facebook. Racine told reporters that his office has \"had discussions with a number of other states that are similarly interested in protecting the data and personal information of their consumers,\" although he cautioned there is no formal agreement for them to proceed jointly. And the attorney general's aides said they could add additional charges to their lawsuit as other details about Facebook's privacy lapses become public.</p><p>In the months since the Cambridge Analytica scandal began, Facebook has fielded considerable criticism for a series of privacy missteps. </p><p>Last week, Facebook admitted that as many as 6.8 million users' photos may have been improperly accessed by third-party apps. And on Tuesday, new details emerged about Facebook's extensive data-sharing arrangements with corporate partners, including Amazon and Spotify. The report from the New York Times quickly triggered another round of calls on Capitol Hill for the tech giant to be penalized.</p><p>\"It appears that Facebook has not been honest with Congress or the public about how it treats its users' data,\" said Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.), the incoming chairman of the tech-focused House Energy and Commerce Committee. \"Based on these revelations, I'm concerned that Facebook may have provided the Committee with inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading responses to our questions, and we'll be following up.\"</p><p>Facebook's troubles with Cambridge Analytica came to light in March when Wylie revealed that the political firm sought to create \"psychographic\" profiles about social media users, using their Facebook data, and target them with messages that preyed on their hopes and fears. Among those affected were half of all D.C. residents, Racine said when he announced his lawsuit in a call with reporters. </p><p>Citing the District's consumer protection law, Racine contended that Facebook misled users about the security of their data, made it difficult for users to control their privacy settings and failed to inform them promptly after discovering Cambridge Analytica had improperly accessed personal information.</p><p>\"Facebook's lax oversight of its privacy protocols and confusing privacy settings put the personal information of millions of Americans at risk,\" Racine said.</p><p>The D.C. lawsuit also took issue with other business practices at Facebook, including its relationships with device-makers such as BlackBerry that could access social data in ways that could \"override\" a user's privacy settings, according to the complaint. The attorney general's office sought an injunction to \"ensure Facebook puts in place protocols and safeguards to monitor users' data\" and provide \"restitution for consumers, penalties, and costs.\"</p><p>While the District took aim at Facebook, federal regulators remained quiet about their next steps. The Cambridge Analytica controversy initially drew the attention of multiple agencies - the Securities and Exchange Commission, the FTC and the Justice Department. The FTC in particular has probed whether Facebook's relationship with Cambridge Analytica - and its handling of users' data - violated a 2011 agreement brokered by the U.S. government that required the tech giant to improve its privacy practices or risk major fines. The penalty, which is assessed based on the total number of violations and users affected, could reach into the billions of dollars, experts have said.</p><p>In recent weeks, though, FTC Chairman Joseph Simons has repeatedly declined to update members of Congress about the probe or the extent to which the government has started studying Facebook's other privacy mishaps. </p><p>Appearing at a Senate hearing in November, Simons said it would be \"inappropriate for me to comment on a specific nonpublic investigation\" - even though the FTC itself previously confirmed it was investigating.</p><p>The FTC's silence did little to satisfy Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). \"We need to know when you will have some results because these continuing violations clearly show we have something more than a single bad actor problem, and it is not only Facebook,\" he said at the time. \"I think you have an obligation to tell us when you think this investigation will be done.\"</p><p>Veterans of the FTC, which tends to operate in secrecy, said that the agency can take upward of a year to probe a violation fully, and that the scope of investigations can expand as new information emerges. </p><p>But analysts said the commission faces a major, time-sensitive test with Facebook: Should the FTC fail to act swiftly against the social-media giant, at a moment when its privacy mishaps are piling up, the agency could find itself weakened in its ability to hold the rest of Silicon Valley accountable.</p><p>\"The stakes are extremely high for the agency,\" said Marshall Steinbaum, research director at the New York-based Roosevelt Institute, a left-leaning think tank. \"The companies want Congress to empower the FTC as the sole arbiter of privacy issues. If the companies can run the table on them . . . then we can't seriously entertain the idea that this agency is capable of regulating the sector.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:brian.fung@washpost.com\">brian.fung@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:aaron.davis@washpost.com\">aaron.davis@washpost.com</email></p><p>Craig Timberg contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-f96f57c603df11e9b6a90aa5c2fcc9e4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V0W-4411-JCDY-T4H3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1276\"/><timeReceived>3:54 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 20, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

President Trump  sounding of speaking in Iowa yesterday.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The predictions from 3.8 to  5.3, right?  I have been saying we're going to do all pretty well but  nobody thought we were going to be this big.  When I took over, those  numbers were bad and they were heading in the wrong direction.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ahead of the report, futures are mixed.  Take a look, Dow  Industrials up 10 points, S&amp;P 500 lower by half a point and the NASDAQ is  up 3-3/4 points.  Fractional moves across the board.  Mixed performance  yesterday on Wall Street.  The Dow was up but others down, the Dow posting  a triple digit gain while the NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 were in the red.  In  Europe this morning, gains across the board.</p><p>Take a look, money moving into equities in a big way, DAX Index up a half  of a percent as is the FT-100 in London.  In Asia overnight, markets were  mostly higher with the exception of China, Shanghai Composite down a third  of a percent.  Investors are also watching earnings, Twitter earnings out  last hour, decline in monthly users, taking the stock down this morning.   It is down 16 percent on Twitter as investors are rethinking what the  growth numbers are.</p><p>Really, for social media companies.  We are waiting on ExxonMobil this  morning.  The first of the oil giants to report their second quarter this  morning.  We'll get the highlights from the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange coming up with Exxon shares down almost one percent going into the  numbers.  Then there's this, finally coming home.  North Korea handing over  the remains of some U.S. soldiers killed in the line of duty during the  Korean War.</p><p>We have the details as one of President Trump's promises becomes reality.   The wildfire in Northern California turns deadly.  The flames tearing  through small towns, forcing thousands to flee their homes.  The very  latest developments coming up this morning straight ahead.  All those  stories coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down in New  York, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.</p><p>The Wall Street Journals' assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman,  and national security analyst Morgan Ortagus.  A lot happening this  morning, guys.  Good morning to you.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria  Bartiromo.  I can't wait for that number of (INAUDIBLE) find out how fast  this economy is growing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it was Atlanta Fed, James Freeman, who predicted 4.8  percent.  But did they walk that down to 4.5 percent recently?  I know --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  They might even be slightly under four after that data we got  Thursday, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But still very optimistic and, you know, more good news, this  rising household formation.  That was kind of a story of the Obama years  was kids living in parents' basements waiting for the opportunity to move  out so that that surge I think is very hopeful sign that we turn the corner  and maybe some of those millennials who everyone says, believe in socialism  will now see some of the benefits of free markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Morgan?</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think certainly, anyone running  us, a Democratic socialist, this number today is not going to help the  cause, you know, which is a good thing.  We can just look as far as south  as Venezuela to see what socialism does in our hemisphere.  So, it's going  to be a good number today and it's going to help the White House continue  to focus on jobs.</p><p>And the people that elected Donald Trump, that care about getting their  jobs back, they care about economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we're going to get the White House reaction firsthand.  I'm  here in Washington this morning for an exclusive interview with Vice  President Mike Pence that will air this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES,\" on Fox News at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  We will have -- plus more of  that interview of my sit down on Monday morning right here on \"MORNINGS  WITH MARIA\" beginning 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Don't miss my interview with the Vice President, coming out.  Coming up on  the program.  We have this breaking news, we want to get out right now.   Exxon earnings are out.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York  Stock Exchange with the details.  And Nick, ExxonMobil shares were down  going into the quarter.  </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  And you know what,  it's now the third quarter of weakness for Exxon.  A big miss on earnings  per share, Maria.  You could see it's now down 1.8 percent, 92 cents versus  a buck 27.  Revenue did come in and beat 73.5 versus 72.5.  The CEOs saying  second quarter results were primarily impacted by significantly scheduled  maintenance undertaken to support operational integrity.</p><p>But the big picture here is that it's a miss, again.  Last quarter the  profit missed on the estimates on refining and chemical woes.  So again,  another miss for Exxon, Dow component too.  So we'll watch for that.  But  for the most part, we've seen a lot of beats, 72 percent have beaten on  revenue and 84 percent have beaten on earnings per share thus far.  That  being said, let's also take a look at Twitter which this morning you noted,  the active users fell by a million.</p><p>So that really surprised Wall Street because they were expecting a million  gain in users.  So, with that move to the downside, the stock has been down  about 16 percent.  And take a look at Facebook which had the biggest fall  ever since its 2012 IPO.  It's the biggest loss ever for a company over 100  billion lost in one day.  Zuckerberg losses 16 billion of his own money and  so you can see the stock is coming back by one percent.</p><p>But we have a discussion about this yesterday, some people want to consider  buying this back and others don't want to touch it concerned about  management and the company overall, Maria.  And I will leave with you this,  Jeffrey Frankel just came over from Stuart Frankel.  You know him well and  basically continues to say, there is no better place to buy them in the  U.S., and he reiterated equity is the place to go.</p><p>The volatility has been wild, what an exciting week it has been and the  value players have been picking them and liquidating in them throughout the  day.  We had a wild close yesterday too on some very heavy volume.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I'm just scratching my head, how do you have a miss when  oil prices are where they are.  We're going to take a look at that, Nic.   Thank you so much as you see, that stock is lower.  The GDP report less  than 30 minutes away.  That will likely set the tone for markets but  because of the ExxonMobil numbers, things have come in a bit for futures.   We're expecting a higher opening but not where we were earlier.</p><p>President Trump touted the strength of the economy and alluded to the  strong GDP number yesterday. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  We've never seen anything like going on right now.  We're going to  have very big numbers announced tomorrow.  I don't know what they are but a  lot of big predictions, I think they're going to be to be terrific.  You  know, we took over, it was really low and it was heading lower, a lot lower  and was going to be there fast and great things have happened.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk more about that, Fox News  contributor, former senior adviser for President George W. Bush, Karl Rove.   Karl, good to see you, my friend.</p><p>KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  And look, I want to get  started on a positive note.  I'm willing to contribute $5.00 to the  Zuckerberg relief fund.  Make sure the lad gets a nice lunch today.  So,  five bucks, count me in.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ohm goodness.  Listen, he is still a multibillionaire, Karl, so  let's not go crazy on this upset for Facebook stock, but what's your take  in -- I want to ask you about that because the -- your reaction to what  we're seeing in terms of the censoring of conservative ideas on Twitter, on  Facebook and this backlash that these companies are now facing.  </p><p>ROVE:  Well, I think that's a part of the story.  The bigger part of the  story is the vulnerability of our tech companies.  These tech companies  have grown so fast, the expectations are so high, they've got so many  things that they have to deal with, whether it's like concerns on Twitter  about Conservatives being sort of dislodged and pushed to the side or  Facebook where the question is your privacy rights.</p><p>So, all of these, many issues that they face I think demonstrated the  vulnerability of this once thought invulnerable big tech companies. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And we'll see if there's a heavier government hand in  terms of regulation as a result of some of this.  They're going to be going  testifying in front of the Senate, Sheryl Sandberg and others, so we'll  watch that.  But let me ask you about the GDP and the economy, Karl because  when President comments on economic data, before it's actually released,  it's usually an indicator of the strong report.  What are you expecting?  </p><p>ROVE:  Well, he doesn't know what the number is.  When he talked yesterday  in Granite City, I want to be clear, he had not yet been informed, he was  probably informed maybe sometime this morning, maybe sometime late last  night.  But Presidents are not supposed to talk about that number publicly  once they're given it.  So my suspicion is he was looking at the same day  that we've all been looking at.</p><p>April, May and June, capital investment, investment in capital goods  excluding aircraft up dramatically, April, May, June, retail numbers up  significantly.  So this is going to be the first GDP number that's going to  be actually have all of the regulatory reform baked in and see the  beginning of the impact of the tax reform measure.  So, we've seen  estimates from three to five, the consensus appears to be just around four,  just slightly north of four.</p><p>And it's going to be a very good number.  Ironically, I will tell you  politically this is a -- you can't just bask in the glory of the moment.   I've been through a couple of these moments in the White House myself and  there's an ironic thing, is when the economy is really going good, they pay  momentary attention to good news like this and then they sort of say, well,  the economy is doing good.  I'm on the other things.</p><p>So the administration needs to not only sort of say, well, look at the good  results of our policies, but all incidentally, here are some additional  things we want to do to keep our economy going strong because there is a --  there is a -- real -- you know, temptation by ordinary people to say, I'm  banking that the economy is good, now I'm looking on other things that  concern me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  But that's the thing, I mean, we talk about this  every morning and that is trade. And we are wondering if these tariffs and  trade are going to have an impact on this number, Karl. </p><p>ROVE:  Well, about in fact, the people over the American Action Network say  one thing might be baked into these numbers is people -- companies were  afraid of the impact of tariffs so they forward ordered, they said, OK, I'm  going to need more steel and aluminum, so before that tariff gets put in on  steel and aluminum, I'm going to preorder it.  There are things that might  be coming from China.</p><p>Where I want to get ahead of the tariffs so that I get these -- so there  may be some and we'll see that in the inventory numbers but, yes, there are  some instability there.  The president this week with the E.U., they  already change (INAUDIBLE) foe, now we're going to be allies together in  reducing tariffs and tariffs barriers, non-tariff barriers and we're going  to be also I thought largely passed over in public comment but really  important.</p><p>The E.U. and the United States are going to be working together at the two  in order to rein in China's trade abuses.  So good news on that front but  you're right, this number, the last quarter, there have been, you know,  this was the quarter of talk about tariff wars and trade wars and that's  going to be reflected maybe to the good in people pre-ordering but also  reflected in the ongoing with people being concerned about what the economy  is going to look like in the months ahead. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. But, look, Dagen has pointed this out correctly, like the  Wall Street Journal editorial board, like 24 lawmakers who are up in arms  and have been yesterday that these trade -- these tariffs are cutting into  growth.  Correct, Dagen? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They are.  Karl, when you have the President on the --  essentially at a campaign rally as he was yesterday bragging about the  steel industry coming back.  I can't help but think what about all the  industries that will be hurt by the higher price of steel, small businesses  far and wide, people who's costs have gone up, their supply chains have  been disrupted whether they make kegs of beer or nails or even school  lockers.</p><p>And then you've seen in these earnings reports this week but Ford and  General Motors came out and talked about how much that they have been hurt  by the higher costs.</p><p>ROVE:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Each day and the commodity prices have shaved $300 million from  their second quarter results.  Even Coca-Cola is raising prices.  So  politically, you need to be careful about -- crone about one industry and  then basically ignoring all the ones that are -- basically not your  favorite business. </p><p>ROVE:  Yes.  Well, look, I couldn't agree more.  If somebody has to pay  that tariff, the tariff is not being paid by the people abroad, it's being  paid by us here, largely in the form of higher costs and missed  opportunities and lost jobs.  If you're going to raise the price or  something by 25 percent which is what has happened with steel, there are  going to be some victims of it.  Same with A.G. products.</p><p>The President talked yesterday about how the E.U. is going to buy a bunch  of soybeans.  Well, the markets have not yet reflected that, because the  cost for soybeans is down.  Since the Chinese canceled the contracts,  soybean prices have plummeted, so have pork prices which when the Chinese  retaliated on us by placing tariffs on pork.  So I'm with you, that's why - - maybe I'm hanging on the good news more than I should.</p><p>But the President has finally revealed he had three choices, he sounded  sometimes like a mercantilist, there's no good trade deal unless you buy  more from us than we buy from you.  Sometimes he sounded like a rules based  trader, you know, everybody ought to abide by the rules but this week he  sounded like a free trader and we got a -- all tariffs and obstacles to  trade to zero and frankly, I like that and it's going to be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see if it's fixed.  We'll see if it's fixed, Karl.</p><p>ROVE:  -- in a trade deficit today with Nicaragua. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you so much.</p><p>ROVE:  Why?  Because they grow bananas and we don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will see if it's fixed.  Stay with us.  We'll brining you  the first reading of the second quarter GDP in under 20 minutes.  15  minutes form now.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  I'm Gerri Willis with your headlines.  Wildfires raging through  Northern California turning deadly.  The fire near Redding, California  killing a bulldozer operator as he fought to combat the blaze.  Officials  say the man was quickly surrounded by flames and unable to escape. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BRETT GOUVEA, CAL FIRE INCIDENT COMMANDER CHIEF:  we mourn the loss, we  also battle the fire that is moving extremely quickly and erratically into  Western Redding.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>WILLIS:  Sad story.  At least three firefighters and several residents have  also been injured in the fire which started on Monday and it since tripled  in size.  Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in Redding  and surrounding Shasta County.  And earnings a big story today. Results  from Dow component, ExxonMobil coming in just minutes ago.  The company  reporting a big miss on earnings per share.  </p><p>Mainly due to what Exxon is calling significant rescheduled maintenance.   Revenue top expectations.  ExxonMobil stock under pressure in the  premarket, Merck though, another Dow component is out with better-than- expected earnings.  Sales of the company's cancer drug, you've heard of it,  Keytruda nearly doubling.  Merck also raised its profit outlook for the  full year, even so the stock slightly lower in the premarket.</p><p>But it is a different story for Colgate-Palmolive.  The company's latest  quarterly sales missed the street forecast.  The sales in Latin America  falling seven percent from a year ago.  Colgate shares are sharply lower  ahead of the opening bell.</p><p>Here's my favorite story today.  Krispy Kreme donuts marking 81st birthday  with a special deal for today only.  Krispy Kreme is selling a dozen glazed  donuts for a dollar.  That's my favorite kind.  The offer is available at  all Krispy Kreme locations in the U.S. and Canada, also going on sales  today are Krispy Kreme's limited edition, confetti donuts.  It's birthday  cake-flavored dough mixed with confetti sprinkles.</p><p>Covered in the company's classic glaze before being topped off with even  more sprinkles because you can't have enough.  Dagen, here is my dollar, I  got to get going and get over there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get over there.  Thank you so much, Gerri.</p><p>WILLIS:  You're welcome.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to wish the most special woman in my life a very happy  birthday. My mama.  There she is with my dad, her partner in crime since  she was like 13 years of age.  My mother turned 80 today.  She will kill me  for that.  But this woman is the embodiment of grace and strength, wisdom,  devotion and in the last four years since she's been battling stage four  lung cancer, she is the epitome of courage.</p><p>She is an icon to me and so many people.  I love with you all my heart,  mama.  That fellow, my daddy turns 82 on Sunday.  So they look pretty good  for 80 and 82.  Go McDowells.  And by the way, here's a lot of love to  anybody battling cancer today.  I think about, you know, say prayers for  you every single day, them and their families.</p><p>Coming up.  We are awaiting the first reading of second quarter GDP due out  in 10 minutes exactly.  Economist expecting growth, north of four percent,  4.1 percent?  Will we see a five?  You have to.  Stay with us to find out.   We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Protecting America's vote.  President Trump  gearing up for a meeting today of the National Security Council on election  security.  A session that could include a discussion of possible Russian  interference in November's midterm elections.  Joining us right now is the  former deputy national security adviser under George W. Bush and former  National Security Council senior director for Near East and North African  Affairs, Elliott Abrams.</p><p>Elliot, good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us. </p><p>ELLIOT ABRAMS, FORMER SENIOR DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  Glad to  be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You watched this for a long time, Elliot.  So, I want to get  your take first on how long we have been watching Russia undermine the  west? </p><p>ABRAMS:  You know, it isn't really that long that we've watched them under  the line elections.  Obviously go back to the Cold War, they were the main  enemy in Cold War.  Really since World War II.  What we used to think of  election security as, you know, fraud.  People in the cemeteries, voting.   This is new.  This notion that voting is part of the critical  infrastructure like the banks and the power plants subject to hacking by an  enemy government abroad.</p><p>That's new and that really is only since 2016. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  So Russian hackers already attempted to interfere in the  2018 midterms targeting vulnerable Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill.   The Daily Beast is reporting on this attempted August 2017 hack with  Senator McCaskill issuing a statement and here's what she said yesterday.   Russia continues to engage in cyberwarfare against our democracy.  While  this attack was not successful it is outrageous that they think they can  get away with this.</p><p>I will not be intimidated, I've said it before and I will say it again,  Putin is a thug and is a bully.  So do politicians need to make election  security a higher priority for their staff in terms of training going into  the midterms? </p><p>ABRAMS:  They do.  They really do.  You know, the problem is we don't have  one election, we have 50-state elections that we have in this country, more  than 3,000 counties.  So election security is really hard to do and hard to  coordinate.  And we are not making the Russians pay a price for this.  You  know, now we know about the Claire McCaskill hack by Russia, so what  happens?  Are there sanctions?  Is there a punishment or you know they try  again?</p><p>Until we impose some costs, we just have to assume the Russians will keep  trying it every level of government. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So that's what we need to do.  Come back with some kind of  punishment because is there anything we can do to actually stop it before  they start?</p><p>ABRAMS:  Yes.  There are ways.  I mean, the -- there needs to be are better  coordination between CIA, FBI, Homeland Security and the people who are  actually administering elections, you know, the state election boards are  not Federal.  There's 50 of them, and they're the ones that really need to  have the improved security and many of them are not yet up to the about  task. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Makes sense.  All right.  We'll keep watching that.   Thanks very much for weighing in on this important issue. </p><p>ABRAMS:  You're welcome. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Elliot Abrams joining us.  Coming up.  We are waiting the first  reading of second quarter GDO.  The number out in three minutes' time right  after this break.  Catch it right here.  Back in a minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo come to you live from  Washington, D.C. this morning where I will interview Vice President Mike  Pence later today.  You'll see that exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\" on the Fox News Channel this Sunday and right here on MORNINGS  WITH MARIA on Monday.  Join me for the White House reaction to the GDP  number.</p><p>We are getting a first look at the second quarter GDP out any second in  about 10 seconds time.  We will have the number.  The expectations call for  growth of 4.1 percent.  Let's take a look at futures right before this  number hits the tape.  It's about to hit and as we see, markets right now  are lover with Dow industrials down seven points and the S&amp;P down a  fraction but the NASDAQ has reversed and it is actually up.</p><p>J.P. Morgan managing director and chief economist Anthony Chan will join us  right now to talk more about it.  4.1 percent is the number, Anthony, right  in line with expectations.  Good to see you this morning, your reaction to  the GDP, 4.1 percent growth.</p><p>ANTHONY CHAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CHIEF ECONOMIST, J.P. MORGAN:  I think  that's a great number, it really shows that consumers are getting  energized, getting a little bit more consumer confidence.  We'll have to  look at the details.  Obviously, the net exports are going to be strong, a  lot of countries trying to sort of get a jump-start ahead of the tariffs so  that was boosted a little bit there, then we'll have to look at the  inventory to see what happens to the next quarter. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you want to look at inventories.  What about business  spending?  Is that a component that you are focused on in terms of giving  us a window of where we head next?  As you see, markets have turned around  and now we're looking at a gain on the -- well, it's back-and-forth so it's  unchanged right now.  But tell us what's most important about this number  right now, Anthony?</p><p>CHAN:  I think the important thing is to look at these things, not only  just in a given quarter but certainly over multiple quarters.  I think that  certainly the instant expensing of business investment will boost capital  spending, and that will in turn boost productivity growth as you know,  Maria, that has been one of the things that has held down economic growth,  and now giving a shot in the arm to encourage businesses investment, will  definitely give a shot in the arm to productivity, and I think that will  help elevate the growth rates for real GDP moving forward. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Dagen, you've got details now as we're looking and zeroing  in on this number, what strikes you about this 4.1 percent report?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, one thing that we should note is the fact that the  estimates by a lot of economists after the durable goods report yesterday  started coming down.  That Atlanta Fed number that we watch so closely had  been lowered to 3.8 percent, so this number does come in higher than that.   And we had other economists that were projecting close to five percent,  they had lowered it to about 4-1/2 percent, but again, this is still such a  solid number.  This is the first time that we've gotten growth for any  quarter before four percent since the third-quarter of 2014.  So, nearly  four years.  It's been that long since we've seen a four in front of  quarterly growth.  That's a very -- that's something very important to  note.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I just want to also point out that the first-quarter GDP is  being revised upward, it was two percent, now it's 2.2 percent, a revision  on the first-quarter GDP, Anthony Chan, we were looking at a good quarter  as it was but now they're saying first-quarter GDP revised upward.</p><p>CHAN:  That certainly helps the yearly numbers, as you know, Maria.  This  was a report that was going to revise all the way going backwards.  So,  it's not just one calendar quarter but it's a multiple number of quarters  that are going to be revised, that gives you a very good idea of where the  economy is going to go because the first quarter had been originally  revised down now it's coming back.  That will give you a little bit of a  boost.  It looks like this year we're going to come really, really close to  about a three percent growth when all is said and done if this trend  continues. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's going to be the first time in a long time, James  Freeman, for three percent.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, kaboom, this is huge news.  This is now kind of officially  the end of the new normal two percent sluggish growth era.  This is 12  months of better than three percent growth, this is what the White House  was hoping for, what everyone was hoping for, and we -- you know, we talked  about these numbers, this is more jobs, more opportunity for people in this  country, and millions of people who look for work within the last few  years, but maybe weren't looking this year, we know they could rejoin the  labor force, maybe they will now.  It's just fantastic news to see that  we've turned a corner.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well -- yes, go ahead, Anthony.</p><p>CHAN:  And one thing, Maria, that's really important about this number is  that it's real in the sense that consumer spending coming in so strong,  giving you a four percent number, you can look at all the components and  quibble about them, but when you see consumer spending this strong, that's  impressive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a really important point, because the consumer has  been debatable, right?  I mean, earlier in the year, we were looking at a  consumer that perhaps was saving more money than they were actually  spending.  Are you saying that's changed?</p><p>CHAN:  I think it has in the sense that in the first quarter, you got only  about a half a percent growth in consumer spending, that's two-thirds of  the overall economy.  Remember that confidence on the part of the consumers  is what drives this economic growth.  And then, when businesses see the  consumers are excited, guess what, they're even more encouraged to spend  more and that in turn boosts productivity and boost the underlying growth  trend of the overall economy.  So, I always look to see what consumers are  doing because that drives the future path of real GDP.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, two-thirds of economic growth consumer activity.   Dagen, how do you see it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Trade played a big part of this second-quarter number, net  exports added more than one percentage point to the 4.1 percent GDP growth  that we got, 1.06 percentage points there.  Some of that would have been  buying by overseas of trading partners of soybeans ahead of these tariffs,  these retaliatory tariffs that went into effect in the beginning of July.   That was after the end of the second quarter.  So, we're going to have to  wait for the third-quarter GDP to really find out the impact of the -- this  trade fight as it picked up steam moving into the month of July.  So again,  it was maybe buying that was pulled forward into the second quarter, and  then that will be buying that isn't present in the third.  I would just  leave it at that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The important point, Morgan Ortagus, the president likes  to say economic security is national security and vice versa.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes, absolutely, I mean, this is exactly what he ran on, this is  what he pledged to the American people that if you don't elect a  politician, if you elect someone from the business community, Maria, that  we're going to get exceptional growth.  And this is what Republicans said,  you know, over the past eight years, sure, the economy grew, but very  marginally.  We did got out of the great recession.  But when you unleash  the powers of the business community, it's not just about tax reform, it's  also about -- and you've talked so much on your show, Maria, about the  expansive regulatory reform that's gone on.  And so, businesses feel on  fire again.  I think that this number -- it's important for the economy,  it's a huge blow to Democrat socialists, but I think more importantly,  putting the politics aside, it's good for America, it's good for mom and  pop shops, it's good for corporations.  This is a great day for the Trump  presidency. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you look for next, Anthony Chan, in terms of another  window into where we're going?  The administration is talking about Tax  Plan 2.0, it's questionable whether or not that passes in the Senate right  before the election, the midterm election, of course, but do you see more  stimulus coming?  What are you going to be focused on post this GDP number?</p><p>CHAN:  Well, one of the things that many people are not talking about is  that when you look at employment, for example, you've been seeing more and  more people coming from out of the labor force into the labor force.  So, a  lot of the new jobs that are being created, not so much from people that  are unemployed because that pool is so small, but people that are being  pulled out of an area that was people that were not in the labor force.   So, I look for that to continue to move forward and I look for confidence  to continue to support the overall economy.  So, those things, I think, are  in themselves quite good in this form of stimulus.  And then, I'm hopeful  that we'll get some more positive progress on the trade front.  We've got  some good news yesterday from Europe, maybe that will spread into other  parts of the world, and that will even give more business confidence, so  that this growth and momentum continues a bit further.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was this all priced in, guys?  Anybody surprised that we're not  seeing much of a market reaction, in fact, the Dow Industrials down now 28  points?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, look, I think people were expecting a blowout quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The President's remarks, yes, he was talking about private  estimates, but you've heard the President and others.  I think he even  mentioned who knows we may be get close to five.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- people were expecting this one would be great.  I think now  obviously, it'd be hard to repeat this next time, but I think there's a  reason to think, we've talked about these are really systemic changes in  terms of tax and regulation that are not one-quarter stories, I think  there's reason to think this growth continues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because there's that runway.  Dagen, yes? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In optimism, we're looking at the 10-year yield, it is below  three percent.  There was actually a worry that you would see that 10-year  yield go back above three percent.  So again, that's taken -- this is just  -- it's just hot enough to keep people from really dumping their treasuries  here, worried about much faster growth, and a couple of things to note  about the Dow that Intel and ExxonMobil are going to shave about 40 points  off the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  So, that's really just a reaction  particularly to Exxon's earnings which were a miss, rather than a reaction  to this extremely healthy growth number on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a great point, absolutely.  Anthony, there is a  narrative going on that the consumer slows down quite a bit, going into  2019, going into 2020 as a result of a number of things, not to, you know,  at least of which is the Federal Reserve.  The Feds raising interest rates,  that may very well cut into -- cut into growth.  Your thoughts on where  this economy heads after '18, and this robust performance.</p><p>CHAN:  Well, I think at some point, the economy has to rest if it doesn't  get re-energized, just from quarter to quarter, it's simply.  Like for  example, this quarter, one of the things that held up growth even though  it's an impressive 4.1 percent was the change in inventories, it subtracted  basically one percent off economic growth.  That's not bad news, Maria,  because that means that next quarter, if this momentum continues, you've  got to build those inventories, so will add to economic growth.  So, even  though we came in a little bit weaker than some people may have thought,  maybe a little bit over 4.2 or 4.3, but you basically are taking some --  you're going to give some back next quarter.  </p><p>But in terms of what moves us forward, I think that we need to see a  business sentiment picking up.  And to the extent that we're making some  progress on international trade issues, that will be, I think, the catalyst  to give us that extra boost over the next couple of calendar quarters.   But, Maria, the bottom line is this economic expansion now is the second  longest basically in the history of the United States.  So, at some point,  it will have to rest.  The question is, is it going to be a soft landing or  is it going to be a hard landing, but there are going to be some slowdown  at some point, and we think 2020 is a possibility.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the Fed has pencilled in two more rate hikes this year,  three rate hikes in 2019, this report basically gives you a shoo-in that  the Fed continues raising rates, right?</p><p>CHAN:  There is no doubt that the Fed will continue to raise rates, but  remember, the Fed is not tone deaf, if they see any sort of a slowdown,  they're not going to exacerbate it, they will in fact try to pause.  So,  I'm confident that the Fed will do the right thing, and in fact, they've  gotten some encouragement from comments made by the President to do the  right thing and be a bit more cautious. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Guys, what do you think about the trade number playing a  big role in the second-quarter's growth?  Dagen, you mentioned exports  adding 1.06 percentage points to the quarter's 4.1 percent GDP growth rate,  exports up as well, strong.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Indeed, a lot of that was the Commerce Department reported that  soybean exports did surge in the second quarter, again, ahead of those  tariffs going on those retaliatory tariffs from China, and then our tariffs  on imported -- with 34 billion in imported Chinese good that first week in  the month of July, that will be -- that will be critical.  How do we offset  any drop in our exports in the current quarter?  But again, to just focus  on the health of the U.S. economy, this is -- we're looking at soybeans.   Soybeans are actually up a little bit today.  But if you look at the broad  economy, I think that the tariff truce, the de-escalation of tensions that  we found out from -- with Europe this week is really helping, it comes at a  critical time that if you could actually pick up exports into Europe in the  month of August and September, that will be much-needed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And how about the personal savings rate -- it's now at  6.8 percent, Anthony, that's in the second quarter, it's down from 7.2  percent in the first quarter, so just what we were just talking about,  where consumers were saving a lot of their tax gains in the first quarter,  they spent that money in this quarter.</p><p>CHAN:  Maria, that's again, another sign of confidence.  Remember, the 6.8  percent number is still high, I think it could go a little bit lower, I  would not be uncomfortable if it moves a little bit lower and that means  the consumer spending, but that can only happen when consumers feel a  little bit more confident about the future.  And we have an opportunity for  that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, big news.  Anthony, great to see you, thank so much  for weighing in this morning.</p><p>CHAN:  Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anthony Chan, J.P. Morgan.  Remember to stay tuned for my  exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence.  It will air this  weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox News at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  We  will have more of that sit-down on Monday morning right here on MORNINGS  WITH MARIA, beginning at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join me for the White House's  reaction when I sit down with Vice President Mike Pence.  </p><p>First though, coming up, Stuart Varney is weighing in on the first reading  of the second-quarter GDP.  We'll get Stuart's thoughts, coming up.  And  then big oil reporting quarterly results below estimates, Chevron and Exxon  under pressure this morning.  Take a look, Exxon is down four percent,  Chevron is down almost three percent.  These are Dow components, that's the  problem in the Dow, as you just heard.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're watching oil prices this morning.  We just  got the GDP number out.  It is 4.1 percent, pretty much in line with  lowered expectations.  We're also watching the price of oil here, down a  fraction, back below $70.00 a barrel.  </p><p>Phil Flynn is joining us right now to talk more about that.  He's from The  PRICE of Futures Group, Phil, good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning, Maria.  It's  great to be here, but not a big day for oil today.  It's kind of a small  day, at least, for ExxonMobil.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, we're looking at oil at $70.00 a barrel, pretty  much.  And you got ExxonMobil reporting a miss in its earnings, explain?</p><p>FLYNN:  It really is -- and years ago, ExxonMobil cut back capital spending  probably way too much.  And that they made some very bad decisions when it  came on that.  Their actual production was the lowest level expense since  2008, and that isn't good when oil prices are going back up.</p><p>Now, they have increased their capital spending by a dramatic amount, but  it might be too little too late in the short term to take advantage of  these high prices.  I think ExxonMobil made some bad decisions and that's  what it's showing up on the earnings.</p><p>Now, they have made some big investments in the Permian Basin and some  other areas, to get that production up.  But, it's not going to show up in  the earnings for a period of time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you think this is the right reaction?  ExxonMobil shares  down almost five percent this morning.  That's one of the issues holding  back the Dow Industrials.</p><p>FLYNN:  I think, initially, based off this shock value, it is, but  ExxonMobil is a great stock.  I own it in my own portfolios.  I would use  this as a long term buying opportunity, because, the bottom line is, is  that U.S. energy is going to come back in a big way.  This is going to be a  major factor in this country.  I think ExxonMobil is starting to get their  act together.</p><p>They're going to be focusing more on production, more on the refining end,  and I think that's why they are going to do so good.  Chevron, on the other  hand, they did a little better because they have been focusing on the  refining that did much, much better, a lot smarter, made some better  decisions.  </p><p>And that is why they're doing a little bit better.  So, maybe, hopefully,  Chevron can lead back ExxonMobil today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And yet, that stock is also down about two percent on Chevron.   Look, we heard a lot about the boom in U.S. energy capacity, this week.   President Trump's agreement with Jean-Claude Juncker of the European  Commission, promising to boost liquid natural gas exports to Europe.   Here's what Energy Secretary Rick Perry told me about that yesterday on  this program.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICK PERRY, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF ENERGY:  They know that we have this  extraordinary supply of what's happened in the energy sector is phenomenal  from the standpoint of production of liquefied natural gas.  </p><p>And it has multiple impacts, obviously, for National Security, in America,  the idea that we're being able to supply our own gas and oil supply.  But,  also, to go to our allies, and that was the message the President had for  the E.U.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Flynn, your reaction?</p><p>FLYNN:  Finally, an energy secretary that gets it, and big energy.  And I  was amazed to see after your interview yesterday, all the people that were  kind of downplaying President Trump and Rick Perry's movement to Europe  with L&amp;G, because, really, that is our future.  </p><p>L&amp;G is going to make the U.S. an economic and energy powerhouse in the  future.  Europe is starting to get that right now.  Europe's actual  production of natural gas is plunging.  They're going to become more  reliant and other people to provide their natural gas and that U.S. should  be first in line.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Phil, good to see you this morning, thanks very  much, Phil Flynn.  We'll be right back, a lot more to come.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The first read on second quarter GDP is out.  It  is in line with the economists' expectations, 4.1 percent growth is what we  saw in the second quarter.  Markets this morning have been back-and-forth.  </p><p>Not a major reaction, but certainly, back-and-forth negative, positive  territory.  We're looking at the Dow up seven points, the NASDAQ up 22-1/2.  </p><p>We have breaking news right now, President Trump will speak about the  economy, this morning, at 9:30 a.m. Eastern, of course, Fox Business  Network will have full coverage.  And we will take you to the White House,  live, when the President makes those comments and gives his reaction to  this GDP number.</p><p>Look, we've got to talk earnings, team.  So, the GDP number, obviously,  very strong, on a consumer level, on a business spending level, but then  there's Twitter, there's ExxonMobil, there's Facebook.  What's your  takeaway?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's talk about Amazon, since that's some of the good news this  morning.  As you pointed out Exxon's profit misses pulling the Dow down a  little bit or holding it back with this great reading on the economy, best  in almost four years.  </p><p>But Amazon reported a profit.  This used to be a company, just a couple  years ago, that would lose money.  But because of these additional  businesses like the Whole Foods acquisition, because of its growth, in  cloud computing, which you talked to Satya Nadella about, in Microsoft, a  competitor of Amazon, the stock's up four percent in premarket trading.  </p><p>Amazon made more than $2-1/2 billion in the most recent quarter.  So this  is a -- this is a standout report from Amazon.  And one worth noting  particularly with what happened with its operating margin is at 5.6  percent.  That's the highest rate in over a decade for Amazon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and it's certainly a standout when you look at the Twitter  report, and when you look at Facebook, Twitter shares this morning, was  sliding.  Revenue beat expectations, but the company's monthly users  declined.  James, take a look at this reaction, down better than 11  percent, as people get out of Twitter this morning.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  You wonder why people are a little less eager to use these  services.  Maybe it's political concern, maybe they don't want their data  being abused, we'll see.  It's a first time, really.  It's the first  quarter that these concerns are showing up in the numbers, as our  colleague, Dagen, predicted they would.  </p><p>But, overall, this is a greet earning season and I think some of these  problems, Exxon, Facebook, et cetera, are specific to those companies.   This is a fantastic economic report, as well.  </p><p>We were talking about the investment, wasn't as great as the first quarter,  but 7.3 percent growth in non-residential fixed investments, spending by  businesses, the tax cuts on corporate income is working exactly as planned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is big.  That is a big number.  And you got to also point  to the rollback in regulations for that.  Let's look at a quick break,  everybody, and then we'll have some final thoughts.  Don't forget to stay  tuned for my exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence, airing  this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox News at 10:00 a.m. Eastern,  Sunday.  </p><p>We'll have more of my sit-down on Monday morning right here, MORNINGS WITH  MARIA, beginning at 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show today, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.   James Freeman, Dagen McDowell, Morgan Ortagus, great to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Love you.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Good to be here.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Thank you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will see you soon.  Have a great weekend,  everybody, thanks for joining us.  That will do it for us.  Join me on  Sunday for Vice President Mike Pence.  Here's Stuart Varney in Varney &amp;  Company.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Welcome  back, everybody.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>I'm here in our nation's capital this morning where I will sit down for an  exclusive interview later this morning with Vice President Mike Pence.   You'll see that interview on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on the Fox News  Channel and then again, once again right here on Monday morning on MORNINGS  WITH MARIA.</p><p>We are all in on the GDP number.  It is Friday, July 27th.  And we are  watching headlines.  Here are your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on  the East Coast.</p><p>The economy firing on all cylinders -- the first look at the second quarter  GDP is out later this morning in an hour and a half.  It is expected to  show growth of 4.1 percent for the quarter.</p><p>Ahead of the report, futures show the markets look like this; mixed story  this morning, mostly higher.  The Dow Industrials up 20 points.  The Nasdaq  is up 15 points.  S&amp;P 500 is flat.  This, after mixed performances  yesterday.</p><p>The Dow posted a triple digit gain while the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500  yesterday posted declines.  The Dow up 113 points at the close.  The Nasdaq  down 80 points on continuing weakness in technology, down one percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning gains across the board, check it out.  FT 100 up  two-thirds of a percent.  The DAX index in Germany up one-half of 1  percent.</p><p>And in Asia overnight markets were mostly higher at the close with the  exception of China.  Shanghai composite down a third of a percent.</p><p>Social media stocks in focus once again this morning.  Twitter earnings are  out.  A decline in monthly users is what investors are reacting to.  It's  taking the stock with it, lower by 13 percent.</p><p>It comes amid the fallout from Facebook's wipe on Wall Street yesterday.   The stock suffering the worst ever decline in market value for any company  -- that was yesterday -- with a decline of $120 billion of market value  wiped away.</p><p>President Trump fulfilling another promise.  North Korea is turning over  remains of soldiers killed during the Korean War.  What it means for the  military families who have been waiting for this for decades.  That is  coming up.</p><p>And then there is this -- Roseanne speaks out.  She sat down for her first  television interview since her firing.  She apologized for her tweet but  also defended herself and Trump supporters.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSEANNE BARR, COMEDIAN:  I know who I am.  And I'm not a racist.  And the  people who voted for Trump they are not racist either.  And Trump is not a  racist.  Sorry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have the reaction coming up this morning later this hour.</p><p>Plus there's this -- Flippy the robot has a new gig.  It is now heading to  the baseball stadium helping out with concessions at Dodgers games.  More  machines doing jobs.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning.  And joining me from New  York Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street Journal's\"  assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and national security  analyst Morgan Ortagus.  Good morning -- team.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS:  Good morning.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's on your mind?  Lots to talk about this morning -- Dagen.   I know the GDP is going to be strong -- a lot of conversation around that.   But are the expectations too high?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, they're not too high.  I think if you get anything with a 4  in front of it that's going to be incredible news and it just highlights  the fact that this economy is really firing on all cylinders.</p><p>This will be the fastest growth.  We haven't had growth in any one quarter  above 4 percent since back in 2014.  And it is the impact of those tax  cuts, the tax reform, particularly the corporate tax overhaul -- the  permanence of that and then also the rollback in regulation.</p><p>Everything else right now even with the trade war, trade fight, tiff --  whatever you want to call it -- it's mostly noise.  This is just a  testament to how -- what great shape this U.S. economy is in.</p><p>And what we really want to focus on with this GDP James is something you  mentioned earlier -- that is business investment, capital spending.  That  roll back in regs that Dagen just mentioned -- that was really unleashing  animal spirits.  Businesses started spending money again.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  We'll see just how good the number is.  But I think we're  in a period of I would say very rational exuberance.  There is a sense that  the war on business is over.  People have new incentives to invest and they  are.</p><p>And I think that suggests if we see that continued big investment by  corporations building new factories, new plants and equipment that this is  not a sugar high.  This is a long-term change in the competitiveness of the  U.S. economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What I loved about it is that when you speak with the  business managers and CEOs they continue to say there is a runway for this;  that we haven't seen the full impact of the tax plan and the rollback in  regulations.  There's a runway that we will continue to see an impact.</p><p>I'm here in Washington this morning for an exclusive interview with Vice  President Mike Pence that will air this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\"  on the Fox News Channel at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  We will have more of my sit  down right here on Monday morning on MORNINGS WITH MARIA beginning at 6:00  a.m.  Don't miss it.</p><p>We're going to get the Vice President's reaction to the GDP number among  others.  We will get the White House's reaction.  As soon as we get those  numbers and, of course, I'll tell you where they believe things are going  in terms of that runway.</p><p>Meanwhile there's this, this morning -- breaking news.  Twitter shares are  plunging now -- the latest in terms of social media's wreck.  The company  revenue beat expectation but it also reported a decline in monthly users.   Twitter continues to delete fake accounts.</p><p>Joining us right now is the founder of Endpoint Technologies Associates  Roger Kay.  Roger -- good to see you.  We've been looking through these  numbers, trying to understand the broader impact and what's going on in  terms of growth in the sector.  Your reaction.</p><p>ROGER KAY, FOUNDER, ENDPOINT TECHNOLOGIES ASSOCIATES:  Well sure.  First of  all, good morning -- Maria.  </p><p>What I would say is that at this point people should be aware that social  networks have a life cycle -- if you recall AOL and MySpace.  At one point  AOL was so big -- it was able to almost eat Time Warner.  And then it  disappeared almost.  I mean actually it still exists but it's not relevant.</p><p>And I think that people have taken for granted that Facebook and Twitter  are somehow permanent objects.  And they're not at all because essentially  the lifecycle goes like this.  People find a new way to communicate with  each other.  It's all delightful.  They meet new people.  It's great fun.</p><p>And then, you know, these nasty people kind of come in and start taking pot  shots at people and it gets unpleasant and unfun.  And then a bunch of  people -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, we know.  </p><p>KAY:  -- bail out and go somewhere else.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KAY:  So I think -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well -- </p><p>KAY:  -- you know, what you're seeing here is the beginning of that.  It's  the sort of maybe we've hit peak Facebook already, for example.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But I mean people are questioning the overall growth  story.  And I know that we are still talking about the strong growth when  you look at a Facebook.</p><p>But there's also backlash about how they operate their businesses -- all  these companies.  A report that Twitter so-called shadow bans some top  Republicans.</p><p>KAY:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  President Trump took at swipe at the company over Twitter.  But  the company said it's fighting back, its offering explanation for what it  thinks happened in the situation.  \"We do not shadow-ban,\" is what Twitter  is saying.  \"You are always able to see the tweets from accounts you follow  although you may have to do more work to find them like go directly to  their profile.  And we certainly don't shadow-ban based on political  viewpoints on ideology.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Twitter went on to say, \"For the most part\" -- I'm just reading  their statement -- \"For the most part we believe the issue had more to do  with how other people are interacting with these representatives' accounts  than the account themselves.\"  </p><p>Roger -- what's your take on this?  Do you believe this?  </p><p>KAY:  Well, you know, there's a -- well the answer is I don't think the  story totally adds up yet.  Essentially, rather than something like shadow  banning with the idea that someone can tweet but you can't really see what  they're tweeting there's this question of the search bar.  </p><p>So there's letter by letter search.  If you start typing in some of these  names, common names should pop out there then you select one.  And if for  example you don't get that then some people are saying that that's a form  of shadow banning.</p><p>I think it's pretty subtle and pretty technical.  I don't totally buy  Twitter's explanation for it.  But I'm not really sure that the Republicans  have said well, we had that happen to us but it didn't happen to Democrats.   I don't know that their research was all that rigorous in terms of, you  know, who got banned or whose name didn't come up in the search bar when  you type two or three letters of their first names.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KAY:  So, I think, you know, we need to see some more research on this  before we start saying oh yes, they did something or these other guys are - - you know, anyway.  So that's my take on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Well, you know, I don't know because the CEO of  Twitter, Jack Dorsey, responded in an almost accusatory tone complaining  that there was still a lot more work to do to earn people's trust.  Then he  said this.  He used vague language in his tweet.  He referred to these  actions that resulted in shadow banning as conversational health work --  conversational health work.</p><p>KAY:  That makes no actual sense so -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.  </p><p>KAY:  -- I don't know how to interpret that.</p><p>I mean one thing is that, you know, Twitter is benefiting from being kind  of the paper of record for Donald Trump.  And I think, in fact, that has  given the whole company kind of a lift.  But in other words, if that hadn't  happened then I think Twitter would be in worse shape than it is now  because I think the network itself has been struggling to redefine itself  and, you know, remain meaningful for people.</p><p>And so the Twitter problem is slightly different from Facebook's problem.   But I think that the administration's use of it as an outlet has actually  helped it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, one common theme here -- Dagen is the fact all of these  companies may be facing a heavier hand from government.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because they ask for it.  Because we have sat on this program  literally for a couple of years and warned them about -- with Facebook's  recklessness and rolling out features like that live video and people were  killing people and committing suicide on it and there are -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- technology's approach and Silicon Valley's approach has  always been just throw it out there and we'll fix it later.  Even Larry  Ellison did that with Oracle.  But again, when you are now reaching some  new people around the globe you can't be careless like that.  And one of  the -- the old soul out of these companies in terms of the censorship of  conservative's speeches.  It is the algorithm.  Well, you know what,  somebody wrote that algorithm.  And somebody tested it.  So we're done with  that excuse.  And they've got a very short window of time to fix this  nonsense before people do go somewhere else.</p><p>I would point to Linkd-in quite frankly.  There is a lot of opportunity  there for Microsoft to do something with that that gets rid of all the hate  and the nonsense and the censorship.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's what we really want to see, right James.  You want  to seek competition.  You want to see competition coming in to actually  take market share so that maybe we can see some honesty here on the secure.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think as far as the regulation Google seems to be perhaps  benefiting from it, certainly not hurt by it in the European privacy  context.  So kind of I question whether regulation will be the answer here.   I think it goes back to individuals.</p><p>And to Dagen's point Twitter saying, \"We're screaming for bad behavior and  trolling but -- and you can give a technical explanation but it comes down  to some pretty subjective human judgments and I wonder if that is the  bigger danger, Roger is that people with certain point of vies decide that  Twitter or Facebook is not for them.</p><p>KAYE:  Yes.  I mean a lot of people are abandoning the platform.  You know,  my own experience with Facebook for example is that despite how frothy and  nasty it was during the election period is actually less interesting now.   The fact that all of those nasty people have been screened out means that I  just see a bunch of, you know, dog pictures and things like that.  And  there are people posting about their vacation.  </p><p>And it's actually -- I don't really need that.  So, you know, they tamed it  down a bit.  They're trying to tame it down but frankly it's less  interesting than it was.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Meanwhile a trio of the tech giants announced earnings  this week and now we see the impact of all of this.  Facebook taking a  massive hit -- Roger, the stock plunging; 19 percent on the earnings  report.  And this new worry about growth wiping out $120 billion in the  company's market value -- the biggest loss in stock market history.  No  company in history of the stock market has ever loss is much in market  value in a day.</p><p>Was it warranted -- Roger?  </p><p>KAY:  I think we've seen peak Facebook.  And we're now moving into a new  ear.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peak Facebook.</p><p>KAY:  So I guess the answer is yes.  Peak Facebook.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Ok.</p><p>KAY:  We were there and we're now going somewhere else.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you know, they talked about investing in security --  Morgan Ortagus.  I mean look, security is something they are going to have  to invest in.  So how do you just, you know, take that out of the equation?  </p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Yes.  You're right -- Maria.   You're not going to be able to.  And in fact, there is a report this  morning that Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and Jack Dorsey CEO of  Twitter of course are going to go before the Senate Intelligence Committee  to testify about the Russia probe that's currently going on in the Senate.</p><p>So when you look at that, you look at the Europeans and other jurisdictions  potentially saying that they may ban all targeted advertising.  It's still  a proposal at this point.  For Facebook I think the regulatory scrutiny is  not going away anytime soon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Also I guess, part of your analysis Roger, that things  have peaked.  </p><p>KAY:  Yes.  I mean I'm not sure I feel all that bad about it.  So we're  like, ok, bye.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Roger -- good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>KAY:  All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Roger Kaye.</p><p>We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back, an outlandish slip-off Nancy Pelosi calling the  deadliest attack on U.S. soil an incident. Yes she referring to the deadly  9/11 attacks.  We will tell you what else the House minority leader if  saying now.</p><p>Then an extra cook in the kitchen -- Flippy, now headed to the baseball  stadium.  We'll tell you what the burger flipping robot is cooking up now.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>The White House threatening to impose sanctions on Turkey over a detained  American Pastor.</p><p>Gerri Willis on the story now with headlines -- Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  That's right.</p><p>The President Trump tweeting the United States will impose large sanctions  on Turkey for their long time detainment of Pastor Andrew Brunson.  \"A  great Christian family man and a wonderful human being he is suffering  greatly.  This innocent man of faith should be released immediately.  The  50-year-old pastor was arrested in Turkey in December 2016 on terror and  espionage charges.  He faces 15 years in prison for the terror charges and  an additional 20 years for espionage.  We will watch that.</p><p>Meanwhile investors are looking to profit from a breakthrough in  Alzheimer's research.  They may want to proceed with caution.  Biogen and  its Japanese partner Eisai unveiled data for its Alzheimer's program  Wednesday afternoon.  Now, while some data was encouraging, other aspects  drew concern from investors -- shares of both Biogen and Eisai plunged 10  percent during yesterday's selloff.</p><p>Now while these stocks seem like they're available at a discount, the \"Wall  Street Journal\" has warned its readers that it may take years to know if  commercial success is possible.</p><p>And Wal-Mart has found a new bank to handle its stored credit card  business.  The company has picked Capital One ending a 20-year relationship  with Synchrony Financial as of next year.  Capitol One will issue credit  cards that can be used in Wal-Mart stores and on its Websites along with  co-branded cards for wider use.  Synchrony is the largest issuer in the  country of retail store credit cards.</p><p>Shares of Wal-Mart are down 10 percent this year.  Capitol One shares are  down three percent.  Synchrony Financial tumbled 10 percent yesterday.</p><p>And do you remember Radio Shack?  It's planning a come back of sorts. The  company which just filed for bankruptcy is teaming up with Hobby Town to  open a store within a store in 100 Hobby Town locations across the U.S.   RadioShack is another familiar brick and mortar retail name that fell on  hard times due to the popularity of online shopping.  </p><p>And wow, I guess file bankruptcy twice in three years -- that's crazy.   There's something wrong with what you're doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right.  Thanks -- Gerri.</p><p>WILLIS:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up next.</p><p>First Nancy Pelosi calls the tax bill bonuses crumbs.  Now the House  minority leader describes the 911 terrorist attacks as an incident -- the  outrage next.</p><p>Then the happiest place on earth is making a big change.  We'll tell you  what Disney if getting rid off in its parks and resorts.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back we are waiting the first reading of second quarter  GDP this morning.  It is due out in roughly one hour.  Economists are  expecting a gain and show growth of 4.1 growth.  President Trump sharing  his predictions during the Work Force round table In Iowa yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We're going to do awfully well.  But nobody thought we were going  to be this great.  We've already hit 3.2 percent.  When I took over those  numbers were bad and they were heading in the right direction because of  regulation. Really the taxes were too high.  People were leaving the  country.  Companies were leaving the country.  Jobs were --forget it --  they were really being abandoned.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is House Foreign Affairs and House  financial services committee member New York Congressman Lee Zeldin.   Congressman -- good to see you this morning.</p><p>REP. LEE ZELDIN (R), NEW YORK:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your expectation on this economy.  I know this is one quarter.   So where do we go from here?  What are you expecting from this quarter?  </p><p>ZELDIN:  Well, after this court order I guess we'll try to put two amazing  quarters together in a row.  That will be next.  There's obviously many  metrics to measure the economy.  So as we see employment numbers hitting  historic lows and the markets hitting historic highs and people signing up  for a Snap getting millions of people lower.</p><p>All of this is good.  So you know, we want to see a really great GDP  number. You know, for those who are rooting for our country what's pretty  amazing as, you know, you see headlines this morning from the \"New York  Times\" saying, you know, why the GDP numbers may be too big.</p><p>So we've reached that point where, you know, maybe the markets are, you  know, they're saying our too high is unemployment is too low, consumer  confidence is too high.  Welcome to 2018 in the life of the Trump  resistance.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They're tired of winning.  </p><p>ZELDIN:  Yes, I guess so.  Maybe they'll give themselves a shoot.  They  just -- they just got tired right out of the gate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  What does this mean for the year though?  You said you're  going to put two quarters of strong growth together.  Do you think we'll  see 3 percent for the year?  Is that what you are expecting?</p><p>ZELDIN:  Well, you know, let's see what the numbers look like today.  I  think we definitely have that possibility.  There's still a lot of  uncertainties.</p><p>So, you know, the trade battles that are going on with other nations or  other regions of the world, we had a good week as it related to the E.U.  big week for the President.  </p><p>But I think that's a huge factor.  The government has funded until the end  of September.  You have an election in November. So we have -- from  domestic politics to just decisions that are being made by, you know,  individual corporations and their ability to expand to markets abroad.</p><p>So there aren't many factors over the course of the next -- over the course  of the Second half for the year.</p><p>And what's most important is, you know, it really isn't, you know,  Congress.  It's not government that is going to decide this alone.  But I  think the biggest factor that's at play is certainly the future of these  trade battles going on the second half of the year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's right.  And James even in the Journal today, good  story about how some lawmakers now are worried that this trade spat that  were talking about is going to impact their reelection chances.  You've got  Andy Barr in Kentucky worried about bourbon makers who are facing higher  expenses, who are -- Representative (INAUDIBLE) -- both of whom are  mentioned in the Journal story, worried about high raw material costs.</p><p>So while we have growth on one end of the spectrum, you also have worries  that that growth goes away because of these tariffs.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  And I think we've seen this kind of maybe a battle within  the White House and I'm wondering Congressman -- what impact do you think  this has had?  Maria mentioned Congressman Barr, obviously others this week  saying this trade fight is not good for growth.  It's not good for farmers  and factories.</p><p>ZELDIN:  Well, you have members who do an exceptional job sticking up for  their districts, for their constituents, for employers, employees in their  district.  So, you know, where you have a national debate where we're  talking about different products, you know, if you actually represent the  district where one particular product, you know, if bourbon is your thing  in your district.</p><p>I'm on the east end of Long Island.  We have wineries.  For other  districts, maybe in Kentucky, they might be talking about bourbon.  So I  think their ability to continue to have great dialogue with the White  House.  We had Peter Navarro on the Hill.  This week we had Larry Kudlow of  the Hill.  So continuing that dialogue is important.  There is an ability  here to achieve a better result where within weeks from now or months from  now, you know, certain threats of tariffs don't have to actually happen. </p><p>And maybe what you end up a seeing like what we saw this week with the E.U.  is that you will have barriers on the other end where, you know, for people  who are fighting for their home districts now maybe as you get closer to  November some of these people are fighting hard for their districts will  actually wins to be talking about.</p><p>But, you know, really it's uncertainty at this moment because we're still  working really hard to secure that concession from some of these other  nations and hugely risky high-stakes negotiation. </p><p>But certainly what America's best interests at heart.  I think the election  isn't today.  They are doing a good job of fighting for their district.   Hopefully by November they will be able to talk about a win.  But that's  not certain.</p><p>So even if it's not by November, maybe at some point this year, in the  months ahead whether it is China -- whether it's friend or foe, we are able  to figure out how to secure some of the concessions on there and to bring  down walls abroad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But what about immigration Congressman?  Now we  understand that this is becoming the leading issue for the midterms.   People are worried about it.  President Trump doubled down on his support  for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency yesterday.</p><p>This coming as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is defending her party's  stance on border protection.  And then she refers to the 9-11 terrorist  attacks as an incident.</p><p>Listen to this.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Democrats -- how about the  new one.  They want to get rid of ICE.  ICE is tough.  And ICE is smart and  they go in and they knock the hell out of the MS 13.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  We have a responsibility  to protect our borders.  Let's make no mistake about that.  Democrats had  been strong on that point all of our borders.  As I said to some of you  before that when we have the 9-11 incident and the commission was formed  and they made the recommendation they made recommendations to protect  America.  But the Republicans would never take them up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman your take on this.</p><p>ZELDIN:  I mean she's getting sicker each day.  I do support her for  minority leader.  She -- I think what's really telling is that as you have  this move more and more towards this Democrat socialism where you might  have people who are telling that woman who beat Joe Crowley in the primary  to wait her turn.  That she should get along with Joe Crowley better.   That, you know, she's not helping their cause for November.  </p><p>Notice that substantively when they speak of on the policies that she's  talking about, they're actually an agreement.  Especially, you receive the  people who are -- they want the Democratic nomination for president.  Their  tripping over each other in supporting these abolished ICE movement.  </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p>ZELDIN:  It certainly, completely out of touch to in any way she performed  of showing any type of lack of -- you know, sensitivity and appreciation  for the magnitude of the 9/11 attacks.  You know, so, Pelosi is wrong on  that as well.  And I think -- you know, tied into the economy -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ZELDIN:  -- we've also want other statistic.  We now had more available  jobs than we are -- you know, people who are available to fill them.  </p><p>So, there makes a strong argument for the presidents pushed towards more  merit-based legal immigration.  So, their certainly an overlap there.  Not  just on national security but the economy as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ZELDIN:  And I think that you know, the voters understand that the  Republicans are the ones that are pushing for stronger border security and  stronger interior enforcement.  They also understand that Democrats are  sitting their hand.  They're actually --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ZELDIN:  -- shutdown the government last January over it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, let me ask you who you're supporting for the house  speaker?  Ohio Congressman House Freedom Caucus member Jim Jordan announced  his plans to run for speaker of the House yesterday.  Kevin McCarthy we  know is also running, your thoughts.  </p><p>ZELDIN:  I think it's great that he got in.  I'll tell you one thing for  sure, I'm not voting for Nancy Pelosi for speaker of the House.  I look  forward to sitting down with Jim and Kevin and whoever else decides they  want to step forward and run.  </p><p>I think it's most important for our party between now and November to be  working on policy just continuing to move our country forward and to be as  united as possible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ZELDIN:  There will be a speaker's battle that will take place after the  November election, that's good.  There'll be a lot of questions to be head.   The president as the -- you know, the leader of our country, the leader of  the world but also a Republican.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you haven't decided yet?  You haven't decided yet,  congressman?  </p><p>ZELDIN:  No, I haven't.  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're going to sit down with both of them?</p><p>ZELDIN:  I look forward to it.  Yes, absolutely.  They are both very  talented members of congress.  Who would do --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ZELDIN:  -- an exceptional job.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, it's good to see you this morning.  </p><p>ZELDIN:  You too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Always a pleasure.</p><p>ZELDIN:  All right.  Thank you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lee Zeldin, joining us there.</p><p>A big morning for earnings this morning.

It is not over just yet.  Twitter out  this morning.  The stock down sharply right now on the premarket.  Take a  look, it reported one million user drop in the last quarter.  Even though  some of the report was better than expected.  People were focusing on the  growth of users and it's not good.  Down 16 percent on the stock.</p><p>We are also watching Facebook after crushing yesterday.  The social media  company got hammered, losing 19 percent of its value.  That was $120  billion in market value gone in a single day.  </p><p>Futures this morning sow markets will open like this.  We are looking at  some gains.  Dow Industrial is up 27 points.  This right here, this is the  high of the morning on Futures.  Dow up 27, NASDAQ up 10.  S&amp;P is flat  right now.  This after a mixed close for the markets last night.  The Dow  was off triple digit in fact, up 113 points.  But the NASDAQ took a hit due  to the weakness in tech. down one percent.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, European indices looking like this, this morning  with money moving in to stocks.

In an interview with Sean Hannity last night on the Fox News  Channel.  Roseanne defended her tweets against former White House Aide  Valerie Jarrett.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSEANNE BARR, ACTRESS:  That is a tweet about asking for accountability  from the previous administration about the Iran deal, which Valerie Jarrett  is the author of, and that was what was in my head.  </p><p>Well, I don't understand a lot, to tell you the truth.  The first thing was  shock that they were saying it was racial, when it's political.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Roseanne says she just doesn't understand a lot of what  happened.</p><p>Meanwhile, big changes coming to Disney across all of its theme parks and  resorts.  We will break it down and give you the latest there.  </p><p>And then this, check out this video of Flippy the burger flipping robot at  Dodger Stadium.  The future for this robot is looking awfully tasty.  We've  got the details, coming up.  </p><p>But first, breaking news overnight.  North Korea fulfilling a promise to  the United States.  Handling over the remains of service members killed in  the Korean conflict more than six decades ago.  </p><p>Joining us right now is U.S. Army Green Beret, former MMA fighter and star  of the upcoming Discovery program \"Hard to Kill\", Tim Kennedy is here.   Tim, good to see you this morning.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>TIM KENNEDY, FORMER FIGHTER, MMA AND GREEN BERET, U.S. ARMY:  My pleasure.   Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for your wonderful service to our great country.  As  a service man, what does this news this morning mean to you?</p><p>KENNEDY:  That means everything.  You know, the -- we leave by no -- leave  no man behind.  You know, it's something that we've had since Roger's  Rangers British (INAUDIBLE) Indians and the British.  Before we even have  independence.  We don't get treated the same way as we treat our prisoner's  war.  It's a scary thing.  It's a bad thing.  And it's been that way.  And  every war that we've ever been in, we have to bring our soldiers back.   That we can't move forward and talk about peace.  We can't move forward and  talk about denuclearization when there's still baggage there.  </p><p>You know, and while this as start, there's still 5,000 plus soldiers  missing.  And that's something that is painful.  I can't even imagine  leaving one of my teammates, leaving one of my brothers behind.  </p><p>You know, it's something that we have to have a shift, we have to have a  change.  And hopefully this is the beginning of that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you think this is the beginning of some healing?</p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes, when we talk about the Korean war finally coming to an end.   You know, we're 60 plus years of war that is pretty much forgotten.  That's  one of the bloodiest in American history.  One of the most violent we've  ever had.</p><p>I've been in special operation for 15 years.  And the things that they did  in the Korean war.  I cannot even imagine my worst nightmare.  And we  started on this on 53 to 5700 bodies.  Some can never be recovered maybe.   You know, but we know that they have some and this is a start.  </p><p>Fortunately, we have -- kind of unfortunately, we have really great DNA  evidence to know exactly what bodies these are and that's something that  we've been doing for a really long time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>KENNEDY:  So, we'll be determined who these bodies are that are coming  back.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president calls his strategy peace through strength  doctrine.  Is it paying dividends in your view?  How are you and your  fellow serviceman reacting to the president's policies in this regard?  </p><p>KENNEDY:  Man, so, night and day -- night and day.  We're talking about --  you know we're (INAUDIBLE) province and you messed with some green berets.   We go and get the biggest bomb that we have an arsenal and we drop it on  you.  </p><p>You know, you start taking some of our City in Falujah (INAUDIBLE) city and  -- we don't just come and fight you.  We push you out of the entire country  of Iraq.  </p><p>ISIS 95 percent wiped off in the face of planet in a matter of years -- in  a matter of a year.  So, we have to talk to North Korea from a position of  strength.  And giving our bodies back, giving our soldiers back, is giving  us that cornerstone.  And giving closure to a wound that will -- that will  never heal unless it finally reaches some resolve.  And I think we're  scratching that surface now.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  And Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to -- Tim is one of the voices out there on social  media and everything he does.  Whether it's in fitness, whether it's  highlighting the service of men and women at uniform.  On Tim's bio he says  he's unapologetically American.  And he constantly reminds us.  </p><p>Just like Jocko Willink who we know so well, that freedom isn't free.  And  that we have to stand by those who have served in our -- just like Morgan  Ortagus.  That it is important to remember that every single day, Tim  Kennedy.  Sorry I'm banging the desk.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you, Dagen.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Absolutely.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Can I ask you a question about your  program \"Hard to Kill\".</p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  So, Green Beret, MMA fighter.  I assume you're not easily scared.   Were there any of these jobs were you said, wow, this is terrifying.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes, (INAUDIBLE) I'll show you my shoulder which is a bunch of  (INAUDIBLE) that flashed.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  I mean, you could do that.  We will be OK with that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You got to follow Tim on Instagram.  Because he really doesn't  wear a shirt very often.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes, very often.  I was in a scene yesterday, and everyone's like  wait, what's going on?  Why are you wearing clothes?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Hey, sun's out.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  It got happened in an aircraft to a minor cockpit.  Cockpit's on  fire, aviation fuel burns fast.  And seatbelt melts, shirt melts.  This is  on the show.  And the (INAUDIBLE) melts close and I get stuck in the  cockpit.  So, I have a bunch of scars and burns on my shoulder from the  show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Which matched my blown (INAUDIBLE) in 2008.  So, it's like --  which is this.  You know, I can't figure it out.  The show scares the crap  out of me.  Every single day I show to work trying to figure out how I'm  not going to get permanently disfigured, damaged or dead.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, the analyst of American (INAUDIBLE) this sounds kind of  like that moment in the right stuff when Chuck Yeager has his helmet on  fire.  And he's falling to earth and he -- I guess, positions himself to  put the fire out.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes, I think I just need to be not so dumb.  You know, I got to  take it off or underwater basket feeding, figure skating.  There has to be  another option than (INAUDIBLE) on planes on fire.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  That's so boring.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tim, also is -- you ride a bull.  You do bull riding, you do  deep sea fishing.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  Yes, I get wrecked by a bull.  It's kind of like riding but you  just hit.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but -- what I was trying to point out, Maria, is that we  are missing those Chuck Yeager's in this world.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  I agree.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The very outspoken figures.  And he was an icon of mine and  still is when I was growing up.  And this is not a male to male thing.   This is not about masculinity.  This is just about strength and drive and  endurance and remembering what's important in life.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Powerful is OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>KENNEDY:  From a position of compromise, from negotiation, from a position  of human.  Power is OK.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tim, we love having you on the program.  Thank you so much for  all your fantastic service.</p><p>\"Hard to Kill\" premiers Tuesday night 10:00 p.m. on the Discovery Channel,  don't miss it.  Tim Kennedy, thank you so much, sir.  </p><p>KENNEDY:  My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will see you soon.  Best of luck on the program.</p><p>Coming up, a big change coming to the happiest place on earth.  We will  tell you what Disney is getting rid of in its parks and resorts, coming up.  </p><p>And flipping for the Dodgers.  What the robot Flippy is now cooking up for  fans in the L.A. Baseball Stadium.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Now, salmonella concerns prompting a new recall.   Gerri Willis on headlines now, Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  Pinnacle  Foods recalling Hungry Man Chipotle BBQ Sauce Boneless Chicken Wyngz with a  z.  Date of nine six 19.  They were shipped to retailers and MassachusettsPennsylvania and Virginia.  This comes just days after four variety of  Goldfish crackers were recalled over salmonella concerns.  Shares of  Pinnacle Foods are up 11 percent so far this year.  </p><p>And Disney, the latest company to announce a policy banning plastic straws  and stirrers.  It's getting rid of the single used plastics at all of its  theme parks, resorts and cruises by mid 2019.  Disney says the change will  eliminate 175 million straws, 13 million stirrers every year.  Shares of  Disney are up five percent so far this year.  </p><p>Remember Flippy the burger flipping robot that made its debut earlier this  year in Pasadena, California?  Well, Flippy has been working full time at  that burger restaurant.  But now, Flippy is found a new gig.  Flippy has  been called up to the majors and wills soon start working at Dodger Stadium  in Los Angeles.  He'll be responsible for cooing chicken tenders and tater  tots.  Alongside, human  co-workers.  Flippy makes it Dodger debut in mid- August.  And let's just hope Maria that it all goes better than the first  time around when it had just few problems.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I'd say.  All right, thank you so much, Gerri.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up next.  Roseanne comes out swinging.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARR:  I know who I am.  And I'm not a racist.  And the people who voted  for Trump, they're not racist either, and Trump isn't a racist, sorry. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That story with comedian Joe Piscopo's reaction right after  this break.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARR:  You know, I made a mistake, obviously. It cost me everything, my  life's work.  I admit I made a mistake.  And I paid the price for it. </p><p>If she's watching, I'm so sorry that you thought I was racist and that you  thought that my tweet was racist because it wasn't, it was political. </p><p>I'm someone who cares about civil rights.  I reject what you call me.  You  call me a racist, I don't accept it.  I know who I am and I'm not a racist.   And the people who voted for Trump, they're not racist either, and Trump  isn't a racist, sorry. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was comedian Roseanne Barr in an exclusive last night on  Hannity.  Her first interview since being canned by ABC over her disparity  tweets against Valerie Jarrett.  SNL alum and AM970 Radio host Joe Piscopo  was with us this morning with reaction.  Joe, good morning to you.  Good to  see you as always.  What are you thinking here?  Your thoughts on what  Roseanne said?</p><p>JOE PISCOPO, RADIO HOST, AM970:  I think it was great that she came out.   Sean did a great job and good morning, Maria.  I think she -- everybody is  too sensitive now.  In comedy -- in comedy's comedy.  Because they say one  thing and (INAUDIBLE) it's a double standard.  It's nice to see -- and you  know, I have never -- I have to tell you honestly, Maria because I love you  and I'm so honest when I talk to you.  </p><p>I've never been a huge Roseanne fan.  But she had a right to say what she  wanted to say.  It was reprehensible and it was wrong.  But everybody is  going to relax.  And if you've got to go after Roseanne, then you got to go  after the rest of Hollywood.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>PISCOPO:  And the double standard should not be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's the thing Joe.  I mean, comedy used to be just  funny.  But comedy has gotten mean.  </p><p>PISCOPO:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it's got mean.  And I don't think she was trying to be  funny with that tweet, by the way.  </p><p>PISCOPO:  Yes, maybe.  It was reprehensible.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PISCOPO:  You can't make up excuses.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right</p><p>PISCOPO:  But, you know, I'm on the road.  I speak here from a Baltimore,  we'd play the blue jazz.  Were on our way to New Orleans to Biloxi.  You  know, and I'm not staged this night, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PISCOPO:  I can find myself as I'm doing -- we do the whole (INAUDIBLE) and  I have a ball of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I know you do.  Nobody does it better.  </p><p>PISCOPO:  Thanks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.</p><p>PISCOPO:  But when you go to the -- when you go to the comedy on stage.  I  find myself checking myself.  And I'm talking to some of my buddies who I  came up with.  I go -- Gilbert Gottfried was on my show the other day on  AM970.  And Gilbert and I were saying, you could not on stage do -- if back  in the day, you couldn't -- if we did today what we did back then, our  careers would have never have made it anyway.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PISCOPO:  You know, nowadays, it's like -- it's like the more we preach  tolerance, the less intolerant we become.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think people will forgive Roseanne?  I mean, will -- she  said she's lost everything.  Here's another clip from last night before you  -- before you answer, listen, watch this clip.</p><p>PISCOPO:  OK.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARR:  That is a tweet about asking for accountability from the previous  administration about the Iran deal, which Valerie Jarrett is the author of,  and that was what was in my head.  </p><p>Well, I don't understand a lot, to tell you the truth.  The first thing was  shock that they were saying it was racial, when it's political.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joe, it was political.</p><p>PISCOPO:  Well, in today's culture -- in today's culture, condemnation is  in and forgiveness is out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PISCOPO:  And also, don't forget she has a clause on her contract did you  see?  That she had 24 hours to correct any inappropriate tweets in her  contract.  So, ABC maybe -- you know, they may be on the line for her.  </p><p>I think we're getting to crazy with it.  I -- look, you're like (INAUDIBLE)  Maria, everybody -- let's just be nice to everybody.  Let's keep everything  nice, don't be mean, don't tweet me but if you do -- you know, let's not  have a double standard.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PISCOPO:  And it was nice Roseanne come out and speak on her behalf.  Sean  did a great job on that interview.  But it's comedy.</p><p>When I think of Richard Pryor, I came up Pryor was the king.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PISCOPO:  What he said about Ronald Reagan I used to go, my God, don't say  it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PISCOPO:  But he didn't get fired for it.  I think people's a little bit  too sensitive today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But let's face it, she says it was political -- it was probably  political.  But a lot of people saw that as a racist.  A lot of people.  </p><p>PISCOPO:  yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they were upset with her.</p><p>PISCOPO:  Yes.  I did.  I kind of saw it as racist too.  But again, don't  forget, I come from the comedy club in the 1970's, Maria.  My God, what 80  and everybody did.  You could say it and you could get away with it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>PISCOPO:  Now, I could tell you it's just -- it's just not -- it's  something you have to be careful.  For me to have a step on stage now and  be careful last night.  I'm going to go on tonight.  And on Saturday Night,  but let's see, I got to watch what I say.  I'm not going to offend  everybody.  </p><p>You know, it's not -- it's not fun to be in the entertainment.  And maybe,  we should all just get off Twitter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've got to come to one of your show soon.  Because I've got to  catch you on stage.  What you've done -- I've heard you up close and  personal with your Frank Sinatra.  We're going to take a break.  You want  to take us to the break with some Frank?  </p><p>PISCOPO:  Fly me to the moon.  Let me swing among the stars.  You are coco  Maria.  I love you.  You are swinging baby.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joe Piscopo, thank you so much my friend.  We'll see you soon.</p><p>PISCOPO:  I love you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All eyes on the GDP, 30 minutes away.  President Trump  predicting a terrific report.  We're bringing you the numbers and analysis  as soon as it crosses.  Next hour, right here.  MORNING WITH MARIA.  Back  in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Friday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.

Maria, watch out for that swamp out there,  I hear it's pretty brutal.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Thank you, I will do that.</p><p>WILLIS:  All right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you ladies, good morning to you.  Hi everybody, thanks  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  I'm coming to you today from our  nation's capital where I will interview Vice President Mike Pence to get  his reaction to the economic data.</p><p>You will see that interview on Sunday Morning Futures on the FOX News  Channel and right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA on Monday.  Good Friday  morning, it is Friday, July 27th right now.  Your top stories right now  6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>The economy firing on all cylinders, the first look at the second quarter  GDP out later this morning.  Expected to show growth to 4.1 percent.   President Trump sounding optimistic while speaking in Iowa yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  There are predictions from  3.8 to 5.3.  Frankly I've been saying we're going to do awfully well.  But  nobody thought we were going to be this great.  When I took over, those  numbers were bad and they were heading in the wrong direction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ahead of the report, Futures showing the markets are higher  fractionally.  The Dow Industrials up about 11 points right now, NASDAQ up  25 points, this after a mixed performance yesterday on Wall Street.</p><p>Yesterday, the Dow posting a triple digit gain while the NASDAQ and the  S&amp;P500 posted declines at the close as you see there.  In Europe this  morning check the activity, gains across the board this morning.  FT-100 up  42 points, the CAC Quarante in Paris up 12, and the DAX Index in Germany up  52 points right now.  </p><p>And in Asia overnight, markets were mixed at the close there.  Take a look,  as you can see, worst performer once again China down a third of a percent.</p><p>Investors are also watching earnings, again, a hue week for earnings,  Amazon reporting a record profit last night.  The technology sector however  still reeling from Facebook's space plan, nearly $120 billion wiped out of  the social media giant market value in yesterday's trade.  The stock  continues lower.</p><p>This morning we are looking at a bit of a bounce, up $2.00 and Amazon, of  course, up four percent. </p><p>Among the names out ahead of the open, Twitter, Merck, Chevron, ExxonMobil  all coming out with second-quarter numbers.  We will have those numbers and  analysis, tell you what it means for the broader economy.</p><p>Finally this morning coming home, North Korea handing over the remains of  some U.S. soldiers killed in the line of duty during the Korean War.

The Wall Street Journal's Assistant  Editorial Page Editor, James Freeman.  And National Security Analyst,  Morgan Ortagus.  Great to see everybody this morning.  Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  We miss you, but you are live  from Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen, it's a big day, we're waiting on that GDP, lot of  expectations above four percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, absolutely.  This will be the fastest quarterly growth that  we've gotten since back in 2014.  But, again, what does the future hold and  the earnings have been so good coming in.</p><p>Let's set Facebook aside.  I've got some incredible statistics on  Facebook's market CAP loss yesterday that kind of put it an exclamation  point on how stunning it was.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we got to talk about that.  Facebook, what a story.  And  James, even though we're looking at a very strong economy, those tech  stocks have been the leadership names but the air certainly came out of  them this week.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  I think up to this point we  really hadn't seen any of the political controversy leak into the operating  results of these companies.</p><p>The Facebook results make you wonder.  I mean, they're blaming European  privacy rules in part for their troubles, I'm not sure that's the whole  answer but it does seem like surely growth is slowing and maybe customers  are getting a little more weary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's a good point.  We're going to -- we're going to watch  all of the above.  I'm coming to you this morning from Washington for an  exclusive interview this morning with Vice President Mike Pence that will  air this weekend on Sunday Morning Futures on the FOX News Channel at  10:00a.m.</p><p>We will have more of my sit down Monday morning right here on MORNINGS WITH  MARIA starting at 6:00 a.m.  Don't miss our interview as we get the first  White House reaction to the GDP and the economic data and so many other  issues on the agenda for Mike Pence, the Vice President.  So stay with us  for that.</p><p>First though our top story this hour and it is, of course, a busy earnings  week winding down this morning.  Twitter and then three Dow components,  ExxonMobil, Chevron and Merck all reporting their second quarter before the  opening bell.</p><p>This after the world's largest internet retailer Amazon reported last night  hosting a narrow miss on revenue but a huge beat on earnings.  As you can  see the numbers right there.  Facebook meanwhile posted the largest one-day  loss in market value by any company in stock market history.</p><p>It released the quarterly report and the disastrous commentary in terms of  where growth goes next.  We want to get right into it right now with LJH  Investment Advisors Managing Director, Entertainment and Media Analyst  Larry Haverty.  Larry, good to see you this morning --</p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, MANAGING DIRETOR, LJH INVESTMENT ADVISORS: Hi Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- thanks very much for joining us.  Is Facebook still a buy  for you?  Tell us how you see this situation?</p><p>HAVERTY:  Yes.  I absolutely think that Facebook is a buy Maria.  And I'm  looking at the loss and it's really pretty stunning but a quarter ago  Zuckerberg told people he was going to hire 10,000 people who would not be  revenue generating.</p><p>And you had to expect that one way or another margins were going to  contract.  So the job of an investor is to figure out where you are now and  right now you're 17 times cash flow.  Facebook's really a very simple  company, it eats by collecting ad dollars.</p><p>The ad collection was 42 percent, I think basically it has to slow to the  25 percent area.  But it has the ability in collecting ad dollars to have a  very high rate of profitability for each incremental ad dollar that it  collects.</p><p>So if you assume that Facebook's going to grow probably 20, 25 percent  which would be, God forbid slowing from where it is now, in a year from  now, Facebook hits a multiple of a conventional media company like Disney,  Fox, those kind of things.  Facebook's a much, much better business than a  conventional media company.  It's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But do you -- do you still want to pay this price for  Facebook knowing that the growth story has in fact changed?  You're right,  25 percent is a great number, 20 percent growth.</p><p>But if investors have been buying the stock on an expectation of 30 percent  or higher, does it still make sense to buy it at this level?</p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, I don't -- I don't think a year from now Maria Facebook's  going to sell at a market -- at a media company, old media company  multiple.  And Zuckerberg's got a bushel of cash, he can buy the stock.</p><p>If he decides to buy the stock aggressively, he can support the stock and  the stock is going to go a lot higher than 12 times cash flow.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Dagen, how do you see it?</p><p>HAVERTY:  Pardon?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  He -- she -- hey Larry, she was just asking.  I want to  give you the statistic because I just think that is -- shines a spotlight  on how devastating that loss was yesterday, $119.1 billion in market cap  loss.</p><p>That drop is larger than the individual market caps of 457 of the 500  companies in the S&amp;P500, that's larger than the combined market cap or the  bottom 20 companies in the S&amp;P in terms of just the size of that loss.</p><p>And Maria, on this very program, early this year when there was a lot of  heat coming down on Facebook about them essentially selling individuals  data and they didn't even -- and individuals users didn't even know about  it, I said it look like Facebook was reaching a level of saturation in  terms of the ads that it could push users.</p><p>Even a cap on user growth and that's the problem that we saw yesterday is  those Instagram stories, they're not generating the ad revenue that, say,  the feeds do on Instagram and Facebook and that's where the growth is.   That's where people are expected to spend most of their time on these  platforms and within the next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you say Larry?</p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, I think all of that -- all of that is terrific but you  can't break your neck Maria falling out of the basement.  And you're at 17- times cash flow.  If it slows to 25, which I think is going to, in a year  you're going to be a 12-times cash flow, in two years you're going to be at  nine times cash flow.</p><p>That company is worth more than twelve or nine times cash flow.  You make a  decision in investing at the margin, where you are now.  The stock doesn't  know that it lost $170 billion last year.  It knows that it's at 17-times  cash flow now, it knows that if things break the way I think they are and  all the problems collecting ad dollars, they only went up 40 percent plus  in the last quarter in the market that grows five percent.</p><p>So they're gaining massive share of market and the advertising market.  So  --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right.  So you're holding on, you're still -- you're  still on this stock --</p><p>HAVERTY:  I'm all in -- I'm all in in the stock.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You still want to own the stock.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Oh yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you this, James Freeman, Morgan, weigh in here  because President Trump is weighing in on another key economic figure ahead  of the release this morning.  Speaking in Granite City, Illinois yesterday,  the cut -- the president predicted strong GDP numbers this morning, watch  this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Somebody actually predicted today 5.3, I don't think that's going  to happen, 5.3.  If it has a four in front of it, we're happy.  If it has  like a three but it's a 3.8, 3.9, 3.7 we're OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction?  Morgan, this is not the first time the  president discussed economic data before the release but he was talking  about somebody else making the prediction, what do you think?</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  He's certainly playing by his own  rules, it's not traditional for a president to do this and he has set  expectations quite high.</p><p>Seeing that, there's a lot going in the news today and if this number is --  does have at least a four in front of it, I think that this is -- as Dagen  has pointed out the statistics earlier, this is going to be a huge, huge  boom for him, a huge boom for the economy, of course.</p><p>But if you look at it purely from a political perspective, going into the  midterms I think that this is a shot in the arm that the republicans need  to make the case to the American people to continue these policies and to  continue a Republican Congress.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So what should we focus on in this GDP number?  James,  Dagen, what are you looking at specifically when we get this growth number  in two and a half hours.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  You want to see corporate investment, I think the White  House is expecting really good numbers there, that was the point of the tax  cut.  </p><p>And as you know, what the White House really wants is 3.8 percent number or  higher because that allows them to say for the last year we've had three  percent growth and that hasn't happened in more than a decade.</p><p>So our enthusiasm got curbed a little yesterday with the export and durable  goods orders numbers, a little softer than expected but I think everybody  is rightly expecting a pretty strong report.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, for sure.  We've had a lot of expectation there anyway.   Back to Larry, 21st Century Fox and Disney shareholders Larry set to vote  on whether the two companies should merge that vote later today.  Rupert  Murdock and Bob Igar will not be in attendance, are you expecting any  fireworks from this?</p><p>HAVERTY:  No.  I think it -- everybody at the end of the day Maria had an  opportunity to take stupid pills and decided not to.  The price for Fox  from the Fox shareholder's point of view, I think is a full price.</p><p>I think from the point of view of Disney it's a fair price.  Comcast I  think walked away intelligently, I think they may end up with BSkyB or Sky  as it's -- as it's now known as a consolation price.  But I think the die  has been cast here and we're going to have a very, very powerful media  company that I think is going to be a vigorous competitive in the over the  top market.</p><p>And I would note that the most interesting stock here is Netflix which I  think the technicians would be noting is not acting terribly well and this  is not a positive for Netflix because that Disney content is going to go  off there and we'll see if that stock can hold its multiple.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how do you -- how -- yes, go ahead Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I was going to say -- and Larry, you get Homer and Mickey in  the same place, Homer Simpson.  I think that's some T.V. Magic maybe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you said Netflix not acting very well right now Larry.  How  do you see this whole environment playing out when you've got Disney  getting stronger post the FOX Entertainment assets acquisition?</p><p>Time Warner, AT&amp;T getting together and then the whole streaming part of the  business really strengthening in terms of audience, Netflix, Hulu, et  cetera, even Amazon.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, I think at the end of the day you have to go back to what  Sumner Redstone said many moons ago, content is king and the guy who  produces the content, the best content is going to be the winner.</p><p>And then the question is, as an investor, how much do you pay for producing  the content?  And I think Netflix has become a content producer an you're  paying an ungodly multiple for Netflix over a hundred times earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY:  And why would you do that when you can get people that own  content like Homer Simpson and, you know, if you go to Warner, Bugs Bunny - -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY:  -- et cetera, to say nothing of the Star Wars businesses that now  were in the Disney's table.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, they are.</p><p>HAVERTY:  It seems to be the die is very much in favor of one of the -- one  side of the equation, that's the DisneyFOX crowd against the Netflix  crowd.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Larry, great to get your insights on all of this.  Larry  Haverty thanks for joining us this morning.</p><p>We'll take a short break.  As we've mentioned, it is a not only a big  morning for earnings but the first reading of the second quarter GDP number  is out today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Stay with us, we've got the numbers as  soon as they hit the tape and the smartest analysis around that GDP.</p><p>First though, coming up next, breaking overnight, coming home, the remains  of U.S. veterans from the Korean War finally handed over by North Korea.   We will have the very latest right there, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking overnight, North Korea fulfilling a  promise to the United States handing over remains of service members killed  in the Korean conflict more than six decades ago.</p><p>Fox News Correspondent Griff Jenkins live in Washington with more on this  story.  Griff, good morning to you.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria.  It's hard to  oversee the significance of this story.  You know, there's some 7,700  servicemen listed as missing from the Korean War.</p><p>Now, 55 cases containing the remains of what the U.S. believes are U.S.  servicemen killed during that war are on the ground in South Korea at this  hour.  They were flown by U.S. Air Force C17 out of Wonton, North Korea  late yesterday to Osan Airbase South Korea on the 65th anniversary of the  armistice that ended the fighting.</p><p>The president was quick to applaud the effort tweeting, \"The remains of  American servicemen will soon be leaving North Korea and heading to the  United States.  After so many years, this will be a great moment for so  many families.  Thank you to Kim Jong-un.\"</p><p>The return of remains was a major commitment by Chairman Kim at last  month's Singapore's Summit.  The White House issuing this statement,  \"Today's actions represent a significant first step to re-convince the  repatriation of remains from North Korea and to resume field operations in  North Korea.  The search for the estimated 5,300 Americans who have not yet  returned home.\"</p><p>All this comes as satellite images were released earlier this week showing  the North dismantling this whole test sites and the president telling a  crowd in Granite City yesterday the progress is happening. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Kim Jong-un making terrific progress.  When I met with President  Obama it sounded like he was ready to go to war with North Korea.  Sound  like he was ready to go to war.  I said, \"Did you ever speak to him?\"  No.</p><p>I said, \"Wouldn't it be nice to at least speak?\"  Now I have a great  relationship, I think.  I think with Chairman Kim and I think a lot of good  things are going to happen.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS:  Now just a little short while ago the commanding general of U.S.  forces in south Korea says the remains will receive full honors Maria and a  repatriation ceremony Wednesday in South Korea before they continue to  Hawaii where those remains will have further processing under the defense  POW/MIA accounting agency.</p><p>And just to give you a little context Maria, I've covered a lot of military  stories and spent time with families.  For those grieving families of  POW/MIAs, few words are more powerful than their coming home.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I'm sure.  Griff, thank you.  Griff Jenkins here in D.C.   Coming up, the raging Northern California wildfires turning deadly as  firefighters struggle to get the blaze under control, we've got those  details coming next.</p><p>And then Virgin Galactic's passion to rocket zooms to a new milestone,  we'll tell you why it's so important this morning.  Back in a moment right  here live from D.C. this morning.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Wildfires raging throughout California and they  have turned deadly.  Gerri Willis on headlines this morning.  Gerri, good  morning.</p><p>WILLIS:  Good morning Maria.  That's right, a sad story out of Redding,  California where a bulldozer operator was killed as he fought to combat the  blaze.  Official say the man was quickly surrounded by flames and unable to  escape the machine.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRETT GOUVEA, CALIFORNIA FIRE INCIDENT COMMANDER CHIEF:  As we mourn the  loss, we also battle a fire that is moving extremely quickly and  erratically into Western Redding.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  At least three firefighters and several residents have also been  injured in the fire which started on Monday and has since tripled in size.   Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in Redding and  surrounding Shasta County.</p><p>And B.P. agreed to buy U.S. shale oil and gas asset from global minor BHP  Billiton for $10.5 billion.  Now, the acquisition marks a big turning point  for B.P. since the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in  2010 and into disastrous seven-year business in the shale oil business.   Shares of B.P. are slightly lower in the premarket this morning.</p><p>Meanwhile, Virgin Galactic soaring higher than ever before.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's beautiful black sky.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Amazing view.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well that is a $1 million (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  Pretty cool.  The VSS Unity took its third rocket-powered test  flight yesterday and made it halfway to space in a milestone achievement.   Virgin Galactic pilots broke Mock2 and ventured into the mesosphere for the  first time.</p><p>The spacecraft is designed to carry six passengers and two pilots.   Customers could one day take a VSS Unity flight and experience five minutes  of weightlessness before gliding back down to earth.  And guys, that's --  the mesosphere is between the stratosphere and the thermosphere, just  saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my goodness.  Wow, that was pretty extraordinary.  What do  you think about that guys, team in New York?</p><p>WILLIS:  I could do it.  I would totally do it.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Would you go in the five minute ride with me Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, absolutely.  As long as you pack the barf bags.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Barf bag.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  I went up with the Thunderbirds and it was rough.  I would  do it again but that was -- I took a nap on the Tarmac, put that it that  way Maria.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  That comes with a complementary beverage service, doesn't  it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh boy, I hope.  All right.  We will take a break.  When we  come back food fight, the founder of Papa John's is now suing the company's  board.  It is the latest twist in his resignation drama, we've got it here.</p><p>Then heavenly reboot, Charlie's Angels coming back to the big screen with  some new faces, we'll check it out.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you live from  Washington, D.C. this morning where I will be interviewing Vice President  Mike Pence.  We will get his reaction to the GDP as well as the status of  business this -- today.</p><p>That exclusive interview on Sunday Morning Futures on the Fox News Channel  on Sunday.  And then, again, right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA on Monday  morning.</p><p>First though your top stories right now 6:30 on the East Coast.  We are  getting our first look at second quarter GDP later this morning.  It is  expected to show growth for the quarter of 4.1 percent.  We're also  finishing up a big week for earnings, ExxonMobil, Merck, Twitter all  reporting this morning all overshadowed by a sharp move this week in  Facebook.</p><p>Investors are logging off the social media company.  The stock lost another  19 percent yesterday after disappointing earnings nearly $120 billion wiped  from Facebook's market value in yesterday's trade.  That was the most ever  loss for a U.S. company in a day.  It was pretty extraordinary.</p><p>Futures this morning indicating a gain at the start of trading for  Facebook, and take a look at the broader averages up 20 points on the Dow  Industrials, up 18 points on the NASDAQ this morning. </p><p>Yesterday's close meanwhile, well it was a mixed story but largely positive  for the Dow Industrials, up 113 points at the close yesterday, that was  almost one half of a percent.  But take a look at the NASDAQ due to that  weakness in technology, on the heels of Facebook, NASDAQ gave up one  percent yesterday, 80 points lower.</p><p>This morning, in Europe, take a look at the indices.  We are looking at  money moving into stocks, there.  FT-100 up almost half a percent, 37  points higher, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up 10 points and the DAX Index  in Germany is up 54 points right now.</p><p>Asian markets mixed overnight, China, as you see, the one loser, down  three-tenths of a percent on the session.  Ousted Papa John's founder, John  Schnatter, is suing the company over a possible smoking gun that he says  could clear his name.  We've got the details, coming up.</p><p>American Airlines has something special in the air for basic economy  customers, the airline planning to remove restrictions on carry-on luggage.   And we've got a box office bonanza this upcoming weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHELLE MONAGHAN, ACTRESS:  How is he?</p><p>VING RHAMES, ACTOR:  Oh, you know, same old Ethan.</p><p>REBECCA FERGUSON, ACTRESS:  What the heck is he doing?</p><p>SIMON PEGG, ACTOR:  I find it best not to look.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mission Impossible looks to rake in the gold, this weekend.  We  will tell you who signed on, meanwhile, to the new Charlie's Angels reboot,  that's also coming out, this weekend.  </p><p>Upcoming too today from Washington for an exclusive interview this morning  with the Vice President Mike Pence, that will air this weekend on \"SUNDAY  MORNING FUTURES\" over on the Fox News Channel 10:00 a.m. Eastern, Sunday.  </p><p>We'll have more of my sit-down interview, right here, Monday morning on  MORNINGS WITH MARIA, beginning at 6:00 a.m.  So, don't miss this exclusive  interview, coming up.</p><p>We kick this half an hour off right now, with this top story, protecting  America's democracy, President Trump expected to hold a National Security  Council meeting later today, to address election security.  Remember, it  was two years ago that then presidential candidate, Donald Trump, asked  Russia to find Hillary Clinton's missing e-mails.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Russia, if you're listening, I hope you are able to find the 30,000  e-mails that are missing.  I think you will probably be rewarded mightily  by our press.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is Former Whitewater Independent Counsel,  Former Federal Prosecutor, Robert Ray, Robert, it is good to see you this  morning, thanks for joining us.</p><p>ROBERT RAY, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  From your standpoint and from a legal perspective, how can the  states help to stop election meddling?</p><p>RAY:  I think, frankly, effort.  I mean, there doesn't seem to be much  bipartisan dispute about the fact that it is in the country's interest to  secure our elections.  It's a little difficult, you know, given the fact  that it's an operation across the country that is controlled and governed  by local authority.</p><p>So, it has to be a coordinated effort but, you know, I think, whenever in  this country, we put our minds to an objective that everyone seems to  believe is in the country's best interest, that is to say that we have  secure elections, and that it can't --</p><p>You know, we do what we can do, so that foreign interests including Russia,  cannot penetrate that system.  I don't think it, you know, is an impossible  task.  I think that's a task that is well worth the effort.  I imagined  that.  You'll see the result of that after --as soon as the midterm  elections.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So this meeting today, is there anything that this meeting can  result in where we actually have more confidence that we can stop this?</p><p>RAY:  I think it's, you know, an emerging national consensus.  I think,  initially, there were some reluctance by the Trump administration to jump  all over this because, I think, the President, frankly, and correctly, and  rightly saw it as an effort to undermine the legitimacy of his election by  calling into question at least, initially, the results.</p><p>I think everyone seems to have come to the conclusion it seems, that there  wasn't anything that we, at least, know of now, that would undermine the  result of that election.  But, I think, also, we clearly know based upon  the intelligence community, that there was concerted effort and some degree  of penetration by Russian interests.</p><p>And, you know, that, obviously, needs to be addressed, and will.  I think  what the - you know, what the President can do is lead the federal effort  to coordinate with state and local efforts, to do what is necessary to  secure the integrity of election results and also to ensure the integrity  of the -- of the election process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Robert, let me switch gears.  I want to get your take on  this, and bring in the team, as well there, in New York, lawyer --  lawmakers now have departed for their August recess, but not before House  Conservatives filed articles of impeachment against Deputy Attorney  General, Rod Rosenstein.  Something House Speaker Paul Ryan said he does  not support.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  Do I  support impeachment of Rod Rosenstein?  No, I do not.  I do not for a  number of reasons.</p><p>First, it takes -- I don't -- I don't think we should be cavalier with this  process or with this term, number one.  </p><p>Number two, I don't think that this raises the level of high crimes and  misdemeanors, that's really high standard.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on this?  Does Rosenstein's actions, warrant  impeachment?  There obviously is a big movement to get him out from the  right, with a couple of lawmakers like Mark Meadows, pushing for it.</p><p>RAY:  Look, ordinarily, the process would be, if Congress is unhappy with  compliance by the Department of Justice and specifically, Rod Rosenstein's  office, and obviously, impeachment is personal.  The way of that process is  to start with holding somebody in contempt of Congress for failure to do  what Congress expects to be done.</p><p>And then also, with regard to an impeachment effort, you would expect  ordinarily following that, that there would be articles of impeachment, but  hearings, and self-worth on a process where you really, kind of, get into  the question about whether or not, the high bar of high crimes and  misdemeanors is warranted.</p><p>I mean, a lot of this, to me, looks like Congress and the White House, to  some degree, are unhappy with the Department of Justice and the office of  the Deputy Attorney General but not specifically Rod Rosenstein himself.   And you can't impeach the office.  I mean, I think --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>RAY:  that's kind of what I see in this, it's like that, and I think that's  what the speaker is referring to.  That wouldn't meet the test.  And it's  understandable unhappiness but, you know, unhappiness doesn't mean that the  high crimes and misdemeanors have been accomplished.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.  Now, one of -- one of the issues weighed in here,  team in New York, one of the issues has been the fact that the  Congressional Congress wants documents.  And they feel that Rosenstein is  telling the DOJ and people outside that we can't supply those documents.  </p><p>That's one issue.  And the other issue, of course, is that Rosenstein was  among those who signed off on the FISA warrant.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maria, I'll add something that Chad Pergram over on the Fox News  Channel, reported a couple nights ago, that, in fact, GOP leaders had  actually been rather, pleased, at the document production.</p><p>It's -- it will not happen that Rosenstein gets removed from office.  No  one, based on impeachment proceedings, has ever been removed from the  executive branch and it would require a two-thirds majority in the Senate  to do that.</p><p>Robert Ray mentioned contempt, Attorney General Eric Holder was held in  contempt of Congress, back in 2012, for failure to turn over documents in  the investigation, in the fast and furious operation.  But the Justice  Department declined to pursue prosecution and pretty much nothing happened  to him.</p><p>Alan Dershowitz, yesterday, raised the issue of why even introduce anything  that has the word, impeachment, involved, when that is a talking point from  the left, the central talking point from Democrats?  And you keep that,  kind of -- that word in the vernacular by doing this.  And it doesn't help  Republicans going into the midterms.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.  Robert, your reaction?</p><p>RAY:  Well, I think that's exactly right.  I mean -- I think, politically,  this is also a loser.  I mean, I -- if you're heading into the midterm  elections and the perception is with the public, that the Republican Party  is at, you know, engineering an effort to try to ultimately undermine the  Mueller investigation by attacking Rod Rosenstein.  </p><p>I don't think that that's what the public expects to see.  The public  expects to see the institution of the Justice Department through the Deputy  Attorney General's office to continually conclude this investigation  properly, responsibly and in a cost-effective manner.  You know, let's get  it done.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, but, OK.  I think the impeachment effort is rightly seen as  a shot across the bowel, sort of, an old days sending Bob Probert out on  the ice where the other hockey team is taking liberties.    But in terms of this contempt issue, we've seen a lot of these documents  with black marker throughout.  Do you think there is a case here and should  Mr. Ryan be saying, impeachment is off the table, but, Rod Rosenstein is  headed toward a contempt vote if he doesn't cough up more information?</p><p>RAY:  Well, we don't even see that, right?  I mean, he didn't say that.  I  don't expect-- </p><p>FREEMAN:  But should he say that?</p><p>RAY:  Well, you know, what, I think -- it seems to me that both in terms of  impeachment and even contempt, is an overreaction to what, Dagen, I think,  was suggesting, is an overreaction to -- well, you are not happy about, you  know, the level of reduction that goes on.  </p><p>Look, nobody likes reductions because it's concealing from the public what,  you know, Congress is, obviously, about, which is making sure that the  American people are informed.  But there are good and sufficient  institutional reasons why sometimes the information is withheld from the  public and the vehicle for doing that is redaction.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Do you think all these redactions are justified?</p><p>RAY:  I think it's a cooperative process.  I mean, I don't always think  that all reductions are justified.  I mean, sort of, the same issue we get  to with regard to withholding classified information.  I mean, there are  some legitimate, you know, need, to protect the privacy of information for  the government to do what it is it does.</p><p>Same with regard to the integrity of an on-going investigation on  reductions, you know, in that -- in that light and there's always a balance  between the executive branch's interest and wanting to withhold information  and Congress' interest in the oversight in making sure that the public is  informed and people have a way to evaluate whether or not the Justice  Department is acting appropriately.</p><p>And in that tension between the legislative and the executive branch, you  know, there is room to wiggle and move around.  But generally speaking, we  don't overreact to that to say, wait a second, I don't like the level of  reduction, so I'm going to hold you in contempt.</p><p>And, you know, even beyond that, I'm going to try to impeach you.  I really  don't think that's what this is about.  I mean, these are the two  institutions, kind of, jocking for position here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>RAY:  And it's appropriate that that happens, that's in the public  interest.  But I do think the heavy hammer of impeachment is not warranted.   And I also don't think it's politically wise and I think that's what the  speaker was addressing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we are going to have Chairman Devin Nunes weigh in on all  of this on Sunday, the Chairman of the Intel Committee.  Obviously, he is  among those who've been demanding more documents and more information.  </p><p>Robert, it's good to see you this morning, thanks so much for weighing in  on this important topic.</p><p>RAY:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon, Robert Ray, joining us there.  All eyes on  the GDP this morning, the President predicts a \"terrific number,\" that's  the first reading of the second quarter.  We are expecting growth of above  four percent.</p><p>We will find out what the number is at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  We've got the  best analysis in the business, so stay with us, as we navigate that GDP  number and its impacts on markets.</p><p>First, though, coming up, American Airlines is backtracking, the company  will now let basic economy flyers bring on carry-on bags and then seeing  double, Tom Brady meets his twin namesake, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Papa John's founder now suing the pizza chain.   Gerri Willis on headlines this morning in New York.  Gerri.  </p><p>WILLIS:  That's right, Maria.  Ousted Chairman John Schnatter is suing the  company he founded 34 years ago.  Schnatter claims Papa John's failed to  produce documents related to the decision to have him removed as chairman  after he allegedly used a racial slur during a marketing meeting.  The  board of directors recently approved a so-called poison pill defense which  would prevent Schnatter from gaining control or more control of the  company.  That poison pill goes into effect next week.  Schnatter owns 29  percent of Papa John's.  Papa John's shares down 20 percent this year.  </p><p>And some good news for flyers.  American Airlines dropping its unpopular  carry-on ban for basic fares, reversing a decision made last year.  The  company said that idea was no longer competitive with other airlines that  have looser restrictions.  Customers will once again be allowed to bring a  free carry-on bag with a basic economy ticket starting in September.   Shares of American Airlines are down 26 percent so far this year.  </p><p>And here's a happy story: Tom Brady meeting with twin Patriots fans with  close connections to the quarterback.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Tom.</p><p>TOM BRADY, QUARTERBACK, NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS:  What's up, dude?</p><p>(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)</p><p>BRADY:  That's Brady, and you are Tom.  But I'm Tom too.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  He's Tom.</p><p>BRADY:  We have the same name.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>WILLIS:  Is that not heartwarming?  The pair of boys were named Tom and  Brady after the Patriots Star Q.B.  Now, despite living halfway across the  world in Hong Kong, their father, a huge Patriots fan but Tom Brady's not  the only player the boys are named after, Brady's middle name is Edelman,  like Julian Edelman, one of Tom Brady's favorite receivers.  Dagen, isn't  that just the most amazing Tom Brady story?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I will give you, Gerri, that there are bigger villains on this  planet than Tom Brady and that was very sweet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was the nicest thing you could say.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  How did dad sell that to mom?  Naming the kids Tom and Brady?  I  don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, it's really not a fight worth picking.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  My twin's name is Megan.  And it was really cute when you're 3- years-old to be Morgan and Megan.  But then when you're in your 30s and  it's like Morgan and Megan, with same last name, same birthday.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  It sounds like --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just hope there are a lot of little girls out there named  Venus and Serena.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Coming up, Tom Cruise looking to smash global box  office records this weekend with his new \"Mission Impossible: Fallout.\"   We've got your weekend movie preview, right here, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How is he?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Now, you know --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a clip from \"Mission Impossible: Fallout,\" the newest  action-packed film in a series starring Tom Cruise hits theaters today.   Joining me now, \"IN THE FOX LIGHT\" Host, Michael Tammero.  Michael, good to  see you.  </p><p>MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST AND VICE PRESIDENT FOR MARKETING:   Hello, my Maria, where are you?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm in Washington but I'm going to the movies this weekend.   What's your take?</p><p>TAMMERO:  Go see \"Mission Impossible.\"  It's fantastic.  The critics are  liking it.  A lot of demand for it.  This is arguably the last big tentpole  movie of summer of 2018.  We're already there.  And Paramount needs a hit.   They've had a string of duds with the exception of \"A Quiet Place\" on a new  (INAUDIBLE) with Jim Gianopulos.  And this movie, the \"Mission Impossible\"  franchise, is the sixth installment in little over a decade.  Never big  hits, but they deliver at the box office and they're very profitable.  This  movie looks to be no exception to that rule.  And Tom Cruise in that clip  you just saw, you see him leaping from one building to another and I cringe  every time I see that shot because he broke his ankle in that scene.  You  know, he's known for doing all his stunts.  There's a lot of stunts, a lot  of action in this installment, and it looks to be coming at number one.   About $50-plus million at the box office.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I want to get back to that in a second, because you're  right this whole series is known for these amazing stunts.  And is he going  to do all the stunts, do you think?  </p><p>TAMMERO:  He does all his stunts himself.  In the last installment, he  jumped out of a plane 106 times to shoot one scene.  So, you can say a lot  about Tom Cruise, but he is all in with these movies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does it overtake last weekend's box office champion, \"The  Equalizer 2\"?  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Yes, \"The Equalizer\" looks coming about number two, about $20  million.  It's going to fall about 50 percent this weekend at the box  office.  Tom Cruise will be the reigning champion, once again, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How about the reboot of \"Charlie's Angels\"?  We've got  Elizabeth Banks directing the film, starring Kristen Stewart, who is best- known for her role in \"Twilight.\"  What do you make of that?  </p><p>TAMMERO:  You know, I woke up this morning I said the world needs now is a  reboot of \"Charlie's Angels\", and look, voila!  You know, Elizabeth Banks  puts all -- comes at these projects the way she did with the \"Pitch  Perfect\".  I think we'll definitely have a hit.  You know, I sat down with  Jacqueline Smith who was in the original television series and I got to  say, if they're smart, they'll bring in her and some of the original cast  members.  She looks fantastic and she's willing to do it.  She told me she  just -- if there is a movie, she would love to be part of it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, that is great.  Wow!  That is really -- takes you back.  I  grew up with the \"Charlie's Angels\": Jacqueline Smith, Farrah Fawcett.   Meanwhile, this past weekend, Michael, the annual San Diego Comicon, saw  the release of several major trailers of upcoming blockbusters.  One of  those biggest trailers was premiered, it was \"Aquaman.\"  We heard about  \"Aquaman.\"  Well, we're going to hear more about it this weekend on Wall  Street, when I sit down with the CEO of IMAX, because Richard Gelfond said  this is going to be big for Christmas.  It's starring Jason Momoa.  Let's  take a look. </p><p>TAMMERO:  Sure.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That was awesome.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFEID MALE:  The war is coming to the surface.  And I'm bringing the  wrath of the seven seas with me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TAMMERO:  Whoa!  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on \"Aquaman\"?  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Look, Warner Bros. has yet to knock it out of the park with any  of these D.C. movies.  This one looks exciting.  We're seeing a lot of  different things, a lot of creatures.  Jason Momoa's about to -- it's his  first big Motion Picture, that he's going to carry by himself.  Aquaman  battles his evil twin brother for control of the seas, not unlike, you  know, what we've seen \"Thor\" and some of the Marvel movies.  It looks good.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It does look good.  Michael, good to see you.  Have a great  weekend.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Good to see you.  You, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Michael Tammero joining us.  We showed you on the screen while  Michael and I were talking, Twitter earnings are out, $0.17 a share is in  line with expectations.  But it looks like the revenue is a little better  than estimates, $710.5 million, and yet, look at the stock, guys, it is  down 15 percent right now.  The worries around tech and growth slowing  down, obviously, penetrating all of these stocks. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Maria, financial analysts expected a gain of one million  users but instead Twitter reported that the number of monthly users fell by  one million to 335 million in the second quarter from the prior three  months, that's because they increased the removals and suspensions of  accounts as people dig into these numbers.  Maybe they will find some  better news, but 16 percent loss is pretty devastating.  Twitter also  facing the same regulatory scrutiny as Facebook, if not more in some ways,  with the president tweeting about Twitter yesterday.  We should focus on  Amazon too, though, because Amazon reported quarterly profits of two --  more than $2.5 billion, and that stock is up nearly five percent today.   Its operating margin was 5.6 percent, which was a huge jump from last  year's second quarter.  The highest rate in a decade for Amazon.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  New questions about growth but Amazon keeps on tracking.  We'll  take a break.  When we come back, Roseann Barr speaks out for the first  time on T.V. about the racially insensitive tweet that ended her program.   Her explosive new comments, we've got them right here, next hour in  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Friday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Happy Friday, and coming to you live this morning from nation's capital, where I will sit down for an exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence. You will see that on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox News Channel this Sunday and here on \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\" on Monday morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Happy Friday. It is Friday, July 27th. And your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. one the East Coast. The economy firing on all cylinders. The first look at the second quarter GDP, it's out in less than 30 minutes. It is expected to show growth in the economy of 4.1 percent. President Trump sounding of speaking in Iowa yesterday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The predictions from 3.8 to 5.3, right? I have been saying we're going to do all pretty well but nobody thought we were going to be this big. When I took over, those numbers were bad and they were heading in the wrong direction.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ahead of the report, futures are mixed. Take a look, Dow Industrials up 10 points, S&amp;P 500 lower by half a point and the NASDAQ is up 3-3/4 points. Fractional moves across the board. Mixed performance yesterday on Wall Street. The Dow was up but others down, the Dow posting a triple digit gain while the NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 were in the red. In Europe this morning, gains across the board.</p><p>Take a look, money moving into equities in a big way, DAX Index up a half of a percent as is the FT-100 in London. In Asia overnight, markets were mostly higher with the exception of China, Shanghai Composite down a third of a percent. Investors are also watching earnings, Twitter earnings out last hour, decline in monthly users, taking the stock down this morning. It is down 16 percent on Twitter as investors are rethinking what the growth numbers are.</p><p>Really, for social media companies. We are waiting on ExxonMobil this morning. The first of the oil giants to report their second quarter this morning. We'll get the highlights from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange coming up with Exxon shares down almost one percent going into the numbers. Then there's this, finally coming home. North Korea handing over the remains of some U.S. soldiers killed in the line of duty during the Korean War.</p><p>We have the details as one of President Trump's promises becomes reality. The wildfire in Northern California turns deadly. The flames tearing through small towns, forcing thousands to flee their homes. The very latest developments coming up this morning straight ahead. All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down in New York, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.</p><p>The Wall Street Journals' assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman, and national security analyst Morgan Ortagus. A lot happening this morning, guys. Good morning to you.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria Bartiromo. I can't wait for that number of (INAUDIBLE) find out how fast this economy is growing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And it was Atlanta Fed, James Freeman, who predicted 4.8 percent. But did they walk that down to 4.5 percent recently? I know --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: They might even be slightly under four after that data we got Thursday, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, right.</p><p>FREEMAN: But still very optimistic and, you know, more good news, this rising household formation. That was kind of a story of the Obama years was kids living in parents' basements waiting for the opportunity to move out so that that surge I think is very hopeful sign that we turn the corner and maybe some of those millennials who everyone says, believe in socialism will now see some of the benefits of free markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think, Morgan?</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think certainly, anyone running us, a Democratic socialist, this number today is not going to help the cause, you know, which is a good thing. We can just look as far as south as Venezuela to see what socialism does in our hemisphere. So, it's going to be a good number today and it's going to help the White House continue to focus on jobs.</p><p>And the people that elected Donald Trump, that care about getting their jobs back, they care about economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we're going to get the White House reaction firsthand. I'm here in Washington this morning for an exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence that will air this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES,\" on Fox News at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. We will have -- plus more of that interview of my sit down on Monday morning right here on \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\" beginning 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Don't miss my interview with the Vice President, coming out. Coming up on the program. We have this breaking news, we want to get out right now. Exxon earnings are out. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with the details. And Nick, ExxonMobil shares were down going into the quarter.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes. And you know what, it's now the third quarter of weakness for Exxon. A big miss on earnings per share, Maria. You could see it's now down 1.8 percent, 92 cents versus a buck 27. Revenue did come in and beat 73.5 versus 72.5. The CEOs saying second quarter results were primarily impacted by significantly scheduled maintenance undertaken to support operational integrity.</p><p>But the big picture here is that it's a miss, again. Last quarter the profit missed on the estimates on refining and chemical woes. So again, another miss for Exxon, Dow component too. So we'll watch for that. But for the most part, we've seen a lot of beats, 72 percent have beaten on revenue and 84 percent have beaten on earnings per share thus far. That being said, let's also take a look at Twitter which this morning you noted, the active users fell by a million.</p><p>So that really surprised Wall Street because they were expecting a million gain in users. So, with that move to the downside, the stock has been down about 16 percent. And take a look at Facebook which had the biggest fall ever since its 2012 IPO. It's the biggest loss ever for a company over 100 billion lost in one day. Zuckerberg losses 16 billion of his own money and so you can see the stock is coming back by one percent.</p><p>But we have a discussion about this yesterday, some people want to consider buying this back and others don't want to touch it concerned about management and the company overall, Maria. And I will leave with you this, Jeffrey Frankel just came over from Stuart Frankel. You know him well and basically continues to say, there is no better place to buy them in the U.S., and he reiterated equity is the place to go.</p><p>The volatility has been wild, what an exciting week it has been and the value players have been picking them and liquidating in them throughout the day. We had a wild close yesterday too on some very heavy volume. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I'm just scratching my head, how do you have a miss when oil prices are where they are. We're going to take a look at that, Nic. Thank you so much as you see, that stock is lower. The GDP report less than 30 minutes away. That will likely set the tone for markets but because of the ExxonMobil numbers, things have come in a bit for futures. We're expecting a higher opening but not where we were earlier.</p><p>President Trump touted the strength of the economy and alluded to the strong GDP number yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We've never seen anything like going on right now. We're going to have very big numbers announced tomorrow. I don't know what they are but a lot of big predictions, I think they're going to be to be terrific. You know, we took over, it was really low and it was heading lower, a lot lower and was going to be there fast and great things have happened.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now to talk more about that, Fox News contributor, former senior adviser for President George W. Bush, Karl Rove. Karl, good to see you, my friend.</p><p>KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning. And look, I want to get started on a positive note. I'm willing to contribute $5.00 to the Zuckerberg relief fund. Make sure the lad gets a nice lunch today. So, five bucks, count me in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ohm goodness. Listen, he is still a multibillionaire, Karl, so let's not go crazy on this upset for Facebook stock, but what's your take in -- I want to ask you about that because the -- your reaction to what we're seeing in terms of the censoring of conservative ideas on Twitter, on Facebook and this backlash that these companies are now facing.</p><p>ROVE: Well, I think that's a part of the story. The bigger part of the story is the vulnerability of our tech companies. These tech companies have grown so fast, the expectations are so high, they've got so many things that they have to deal with, whether it's like concerns on Twitter about Conservatives being sort of dislodged and pushed to the side or Facebook where the question is your privacy rights.</p><p>So, all of these, many issues that they face I think demonstrated the vulnerability of this once thought invulnerable big tech companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And we'll see if there's a heavier government hand in terms of regulation as a result of some of this. They're going to be going testifying in front of the Senate, Sheryl Sandberg and others, so we'll watch that. But let me ask you about the GDP and the economy, Karl because when President comments on economic data, before it's actually released, it's usually an indicator of the strong report. What are you expecting?</p><p>ROVE: Well, he doesn't know what the number is. When he talked yesterday in Granite City, I want to be clear, he had not yet been informed, he was probably informed maybe sometime this morning, maybe sometime late last night. But Presidents are not supposed to talk about that number publicly once they're given it. So my suspicion is he was looking at the same day that we've all been looking at.</p><p>April, May and June, capital investment, investment in capital goods excluding aircraft up dramatically, April, May, June, retail numbers up significantly. So this is going to be the first GDP number that's going to be actually have all of the regulatory reform baked in and see the beginning of the impact of the tax reform measure. So, we've seen estimates from three to five, the consensus appears to be just around four, just slightly north of four.</p><p>And it's going to be a very good number. Ironically, I will tell you politically this is a -- you can't just bask in the glory of the moment. I've been through a couple of these moments in the White House myself and there's an ironic thing, is when the economy is really going good, they pay momentary attention to good news like this and then they sort of say, well, the economy is doing good. I'm on the other things.</p><p>So the administration needs to not only sort of say, well, look at the good results of our policies, but all incidentally, here are some additional things we want to do to keep our economy going strong because there is a -- there is a -- real -- you know, temptation by ordinary people to say, I'm banking that the economy is good, now I'm looking on other things that concern me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, yes. But that's the thing, I mean, we talk about this every morning and that is trade. And we are wondering if these tariffs and trade are going to have an impact on this number, Karl.</p><p>ROVE: Well, about in fact, the people over the American Action Network say one thing might be baked into these numbers is people -- companies were afraid of the impact of tariffs so they forward ordered, they said, OK, I'm going to need more steel and aluminum, so before that tariff gets put in on steel and aluminum, I'm going to preorder it. There are things that might be coming from China.</p><p>Where I want to get ahead of the tariffs so that I get these -- so there may be some and we'll see that in the inventory numbers but, yes, there are some instability there. The president this week with the E.U., they already change (INAUDIBLE) foe, now we're going to be allies together in reducing tariffs and tariffs barriers, non-tariff barriers and we're going to be also I thought largely passed over in public comment but really important.</p><p>The E.U. and the United States are going to be working together at the two in order to rein in China's trade abuses. So good news on that front but you're right, this number, the last quarter, there have been, you know, this was the quarter of talk about tariff wars and trade wars and that's going to be reflected maybe to the good in people pre-ordering but also reflected in the ongoing with people being concerned about what the economy is going to look like in the months ahead.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But, look, Dagen has pointed this out correctly, like the Wall Street Journal editorial board, like 24 lawmakers who are up in arms and have been yesterday that these trade -- these tariffs are cutting into growth. Correct, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: They are. Karl, when you have the President on the -- essentially at a campaign rally as he was yesterday bragging about the steel industry coming back. I can't help but think what about all the industries that will be hurt by the higher price of steel, small businesses far and wide, people who's costs have gone up, their supply chains have been disrupted whether they make kegs of beer or nails or even school lockers.</p><p>And then you've seen in these earnings reports this week but Ford and General Motors came out and talked about how much that they have been hurt by the higher costs.</p><p>ROVE: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Each day and the commodity prices have shaved $300 million from their second quarter results. Even Coca-Cola is raising prices. So politically, you need to be careful about -- crone about one industry and then basically ignoring all the ones that are -- basically not your favorite business.</p><p>ROVE: Yes. Well, look, I couldn't agree more. If somebody has to pay that tariff, the tariff is not being paid by the people abroad, it's being paid by us here, largely in the form of higher costs and missed opportunities and lost jobs. If you're going to raise the price or something by 25 percent which is what has happened with steel, there are going to be some victims of it. Same with A.G. products.</p><p>The President talked yesterday about how the E.U. is going to buy a bunch of soybeans. Well, the markets have not yet reflected that, because the cost for soybeans is down. Since the Chinese canceled the contracts, soybean prices have plummeted, so have pork prices which when the Chinese retaliated on us by placing tariffs on pork. So I'm with you, that's why - - maybe I'm hanging on the good news more than I should.</p><p>But the President has finally revealed he had three choices, he sounded sometimes like a mercantilist, there's no good trade deal unless you buy more from us than we buy from you. Sometimes he sounded like a rules based trader, you know, everybody ought to abide by the rules but this week he sounded like a free trader and we got a -- all tariffs and obstacles to trade to zero and frankly, I like that and it's going to be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see if it's fixed. We'll see if it's fixed, Karl.</p><p>ROVE: -- in a trade deficit today with Nicaragua.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see you, sir. Thank you so much.</p><p>ROVE: Why? Because they grow bananas and we don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will see if it's fixed. Stay with us. We'll brining you the first reading of the second quarter GDP in under 20 minutes. 15 minutes form now. Back in a minute.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH MARIA. I'm Gerri Willis with your headlines. Wildfires raging through Northern California turning deadly. The fire near Redding, California killing a bulldozer operator as he fought to combat the blaze. Officials say the man was quickly surrounded by flames and unable to escape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRETT GOUVEA, CAL FIRE INCIDENT COMMANDER CHIEF: we mourn the loss, we also battle the fire that is moving extremely quickly and erratically into Western Redding.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: Sad story. At least three firefighters and several residents have also been injured in the fire which started on Monday and it since tripled in size. Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in Redding and surrounding Shasta County. And earnings a big story today. Results from Dow component, ExxonMobil coming in just minutes ago. The company reporting a big miss on earnings per share.</p><p>Mainly due to what Exxon is calling significant rescheduled maintenance. Revenue top expectations. ExxonMobil stock under pressure in the premarket, Merck though, another Dow component is out with better-than- expected earnings. Sales of the company's cancer drug, you've heard of it, Keytruda nearly doubling. Merck also raised its profit outlook for the full year, even so the stock slightly lower in the premarket.</p><p>But it is a different story for Colgate-Palmolive. The company's latest quarterly sales missed the street forecast. The sales in Latin America falling seven percent from a year ago. Colgate shares are sharply lower ahead of the opening bell.</p><p>Here's my favorite story today. Krispy Kreme donuts marking 81st birthday with a special deal for today only. Krispy Kreme is selling a dozen glazed donuts for a dollar. That's my favorite kind. The offer is available at all Krispy Kreme locations in the U.S. and Canada, also going on sales today are Krispy Kreme's limited edition, confetti donuts. It's birthday cake-flavored dough mixed with confetti sprinkles.</p><p>Covered in the company's classic glaze before being topped off with even more sprinkles because you can't have enough. Dagen, here is my dollar, I got to get going and get over there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Get over there. Thank you so much, Gerri.</p><p>WILLIS: You're welcome.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to wish the most special woman in my life a very happy birthday. My mama. There she is with my dad, her partner in crime since she was like 13 years of age. My mother turned 80 today. She will kill me for that. But this woman is the embodiment of grace and strength, wisdom, devotion and in the last four years since she's been battling stage four lung cancer, she is the epitome of courage.</p><p>She is an icon to me and so many people. I love with you all my heart, mama. That fellow, my daddy turns 82 on Sunday. So they look pretty good for 80 and 82. Go McDowells. And by the way, here's a lot of love to anybody battling cancer today. I think about, you know, say prayers for you every single day, them and their families.</p><p>Coming up. We are awaiting the first reading of second quarter GDP due out in 10 minutes exactly. Economist expecting growth, north of four percent, 4.1 percent? Will we see a five? You have to. Stay with us to find out. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Protecting America's vote. President Trump gearing up for a meeting today of the National Security Council on election security. A session that could include a discussion of possible Russian interference in November's midterm elections. Joining us right now is the former deputy national security adviser under George W. Bush and former National Security Council senior director for Near East and North African Affairs, Elliott Abrams.</p><p>Elliot, good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ELLIOT ABRAMS, FORMER SENIOR DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Glad to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You watched this for a long time, Elliot. So, I want to get your take first on how long we have been watching Russia undermine the west?</p><p>ABRAMS: You know, it isn't really that long that we've watched them under the line elections. Obviously go back to the Cold War, they were the main enemy in Cold War. Really since World War II. What we used to think of election security as, you know, fraud. People in the cemeteries, voting. This is new. This notion that voting is part of the critical infrastructure like the banks and the power plants subject to hacking by an enemy government abroad.</p><p>That's new and that really is only since 2016.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. So Russian hackers already attempted to interfere in the 2018 midterms targeting vulnerable Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill. The Daily Beast is reporting on this attempted August 2017 hack with Senator McCaskill issuing a statement and here's what she said yesterday. Russia continues to engage in cyberwarfare against our democracy. While this attack was not successful it is outrageous that they think they can get away with this.</p><p>I will not be intimidated, I've said it before and I will say it again, Putin is a thug and is a bully. So do politicians need to make election security a higher priority for their staff in terms of training going into the midterms?</p><p>ABRAMS: They do. They really do. You know, the problem is we don't have one election, we have 50-state elections that we have in this country, more than 3,000 counties. So election security is really hard to do and hard to coordinate. And we are not making the Russians pay a price for this. You know, now we know about the Claire McCaskill hack by Russia, so what happens? Are there sanctions? Is there a punishment or you know they try again?</p><p>Until we impose some costs, we just have to assume the Russians will keep trying it every level of government.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So that's what we need to do. Come back with some kind of punishment because is there anything we can do to actually stop it before they start?</p><p>ABRAMS: Yes. There are ways. I mean, the -- there needs to be are better coordination between CIA, FBI, Homeland Security and the people who are actually administering elections, you know, the state election boards are not Federal. There's 50 of them, and they're the ones that really need to have the improved security and many of them are not yet up to the about task.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Makes sense. All right. We'll keep watching that. Thanks very much for weighing in on this important issue.</p><p>ABRAMS: You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Elliot Abrams joining us. Coming up. We are waiting the first reading of second quarter GDO. The number out in three minutes' time right after this break. Catch it right here. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. I'm Maria Bartiromo come to you live from Washington, D.C. this morning where I will interview Vice President Mike Pence later today. You'll see that exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on the Fox News Channel this Sunday and right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA on Monday. Join me for the White House reaction to the GDP number.</p><p>We are getting a first look at the second quarter GDP out any second in about 10 seconds time. We will have the number. The expectations call for growth of 4.1 percent. Let's take a look at futures right before this number hits the tape. It's about to hit and as we see, markets right now are lover with Dow industrials down seven points and the S&amp;P down a fraction but the NASDAQ has reversed and it is actually up.</p><p>J.P. Morgan managing director and chief economist Anthony Chan will join us right now to talk more about it. 4.1 percent is the number, Anthony, right in line with expectations. Good to see you this morning, your reaction to the GDP, 4.1 percent growth.</p><p>ANTHONY CHAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CHIEF ECONOMIST, J.P. MORGAN: I think that's a great number, it really shows that consumers are getting energized, getting a little bit more consumer confidence. We'll have to look at the details. Obviously, the net exports are going to be strong, a lot of countries trying to sort of get a jump-start ahead of the tariffs so that was boosted a little bit there, then we'll have to look at the inventory to see what happens to the next quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you want to look at inventories. What about business spending? Is that a component that you are focused on in terms of giving us a window of where we head next? As you see, markets have turned around and now we're looking at a gain on the -- well, it's back-and-forth so it's unchanged right now. But tell us what's most important about this number right now, Anthony?</p><p>CHAN: I think the important thing is to look at these things, not only just in a given quarter but certainly over multiple quarters. I think that certainly the instant expensing of business investment will boost capital spending, and that will in turn boost productivity growth as you know, Maria, that has been one of the things that has held down economic growth, and now giving a shot in the arm to encourage businesses investment, will definitely give a shot in the arm to productivity, and I think that will help elevate the growth rates for real GDP moving forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Dagen, you've got details now as we're looking and zeroing in on this number, what strikes you about this 4.1 percent report?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, one thing that we should note is the fact that the estimates by a lot of economists after the durable goods report yesterday started coming down. That Atlanta Fed number that we watch so closely had been lowered to 3.8 percent, so this number does come in higher than that. And we had other economists that were projecting close to five percent, they had lowered it to about 4-1/2 percent, but again, this is still such a solid number. This is the first time that we've gotten growth for any quarter before four percent since the third-quarter of 2014. So, nearly four years. It's been that long since we've seen a four in front of quarterly growth. That's a very -- that's something very important to note.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I just want to also point out that the first-quarter GDP is being revised upward, it was two percent, now it's 2.2 percent, a revision on the first-quarter GDP, Anthony Chan, we were looking at a good quarter as it was but now they're saying first-quarter GDP revised upward.</p><p>CHAN: That certainly helps the yearly numbers, as you know, Maria. This was a report that was going to revise all the way going backwards. So, it's not just one calendar quarter but it's a multiple number of quarters that are going to be revised, that gives you a very good idea of where the economy is going to go because the first quarter had been originally revised down now it's coming back. That will give you a little bit of a boost. It looks like this year we're going to come really, really close to about a three percent growth when all is said and done if this trend continues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's going to be the first time in a long time, James Freeman, for three percent.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, kaboom, this is huge news. This is now kind of officially the end of the new normal two percent sluggish growth era. This is 12 months of better than three percent growth, this is what the White House was hoping for, what everyone was hoping for, and we -- you know, we talked about these numbers, this is more jobs, more opportunity for people in this country, and millions of people who look for work within the last few years, but maybe weren't looking this year, we know they could rejoin the labor force, maybe they will now. It's just fantastic news to see that we've turned a corner.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well -- yes, go ahead, Anthony.</p><p>CHAN: And one thing, Maria, that's really important about this number is that it's real in the sense that consumer spending coming in so strong, giving you a four percent number, you can look at all the components and quibble about them, but when you see consumer spending this strong, that's impressive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's a really important point, because the consumer has been debatable, right? I mean, earlier in the year, we were looking at a consumer that perhaps was saving more money than they were actually spending. Are you saying that's changed?</p><p>CHAN: I think it has in the sense that in the first quarter, you got only about a half a percent growth in consumer spending, that's two-thirds of the overall economy. Remember that confidence on the part of the consumers is what drives this economic growth. And then, when businesses see the consumers are excited, guess what, they're even more encouraged to spend more and that in turn boosts productivity and boost the underlying growth trend of the overall economy. So, I always look to see what consumers are doing because that drives the future path of real GDP.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course, two-thirds of economic growth consumer activity. Dagen, how do you see it?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Trade played a big part of this second-quarter number, net exports added more than one percentage point to the 4.1 percent GDP growth that we got, 1.06 percentage points there. Some of that would have been buying by overseas of trading partners of soybeans ahead of these tariffs, these retaliatory tariffs that went into effect in the beginning of July. That was after the end of the second quarter. So, we're going to have to wait for the third-quarter GDP to really find out the impact of the -- this trade fight as it picked up steam moving into the month of July. So again, it was maybe buying that was pulled forward into the second quarter, and then that will be buying that isn't present in the third. I would just leave it at that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. The important point, Morgan Ortagus, the president likes to say economic security is national security and vice versa.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Yes, absolutely, I mean, this is exactly what he ran on, this is what he pledged to the American people that if you don't elect a politician, if you elect someone from the business community, Maria, that we're going to get exceptional growth. And this is what Republicans said, you know, over the past eight years, sure, the economy grew, but very marginally. We did got out of the great recession. But when you unleash the powers of the business community, it's not just about tax reform, it's also about -- and you've talked so much on your show, Maria, about the expansive regulatory reform that's gone on. And so, businesses feel on fire again. I think that this number -- it's important for the economy, it's a huge blow to Democrat socialists, but I think more importantly, putting the politics aside, it's good for America, it's good for mom and pop shops, it's good for corporations. This is a great day for the Trump presidency.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you look for next, Anthony Chan, in terms of another window into where we're going? The administration is talking about Tax Plan 2.0, it's questionable whether or not that passes in the Senate right before the election, the midterm election, of course, but do you see more stimulus coming? What are you going to be focused on post this GDP number?</p><p>CHAN: Well, one of the things that many people are not talking about is that when you look at employment, for example, you've been seeing more and more people coming from out of the labor force into the labor force. So, a lot of the new jobs that are being created, not so much from people that are unemployed because that pool is so small, but people that are being pulled out of an area that was people that were not in the labor force. So, I look for that to continue to move forward and I look for confidence to continue to support the overall economy. So, those things, I think, are in themselves quite good in this form of stimulus. And then, I'm hopeful that we'll get some more positive progress on the trade front. We've got some good news yesterday from Europe, maybe that will spread into other parts of the world, and that will even give more business confidence, so that this growth and momentum continues a bit further.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Was this all priced in, guys? Anybody surprised that we're not seeing much of a market reaction, in fact, the Dow Industrials down now 28 points?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, look, I think people were expecting a blowout quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: The President's remarks, yes, he was talking about private estimates, but you've heard the President and others. I think he even mentioned who knows we may be get close to five. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- people were expecting this one would be great. I think now obviously, it'd be hard to repeat this next time, but I think there's a reason to think, we've talked about these are really systemic changes in terms of tax and regulation that are not one-quarter stories, I think there's reason to think this growth continues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, because there's that runway. Dagen, yes?</p><p>MCDOWELL: In optimism, we're looking at the 10-year yield, it is below three percent. There was actually a worry that you would see that 10-year yield go back above three percent. So again, that's taken -- this is just -- it's just hot enough to keep people from really dumping their treasuries here, worried about much faster growth, and a couple of things to note about the Dow that Intel and ExxonMobil are going to shave about 40 points off the Dow Jones Industrial Average. So, that's really just a reaction particularly to Exxon's earnings which were a miss, rather than a reaction to this extremely healthy growth number on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's a great point, absolutely. Anthony, there is a narrative going on that the consumer slows down quite a bit, going into 2019, going into 2020 as a result of a number of things, not to, you know, at least of which is the Federal Reserve. The Feds raising interest rates, that may very well cut into -- cut into growth. Your thoughts on where this economy heads after '18, and this robust performance.</p><p>CHAN: Well, I think at some point, the economy has to rest if it doesn't get re-energized, just from quarter to quarter, it's simply. Like for example, this quarter, one of the things that held up growth even though it's an impressive 4.1 percent was the change in inventories, it subtracted basically one percent off economic growth. That's not bad news, Maria, because that means that next quarter, if this momentum continues, you've got to build those inventories, so will add to economic growth. So, even though we came in a little bit weaker than some people may have thought, maybe a little bit over 4.2 or 4.3, but you basically are taking some -- you're going to give some back next quarter.</p><p>But in terms of what moves us forward, I think that we need to see a business sentiment picking up. And to the extent that we're making some progress on international trade issues, that will be, I think, the catalyst to give us that extra boost over the next couple of calendar quarters. But, Maria, the bottom line is this economic expansion now is the second longest basically in the history of the United States. So, at some point, it will have to rest. The question is, is it going to be a soft landing or is it going to be a hard landing, but there are going to be some slowdown at some point, and we think 2020 is a possibility.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, the Fed has pencilled in two more rate hikes this year, three rate hikes in 2019, this report basically gives you a shoo-in that the Fed continues raising rates, right?</p><p>CHAN: There is no doubt that the Fed will continue to raise rates, but remember, the Fed is not tone deaf, if they see any sort of a slowdown, they're not going to exacerbate it, they will in fact try to pause. So, I'm confident that the Fed will do the right thing, and in fact, they've gotten some encouragement from comments made by the President to do the right thing and be a bit more cautious.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Guys, what do you think about the trade number playing a big role in the second-quarter's growth? Dagen, you mentioned exports adding 1.06 percentage points to the quarter's 4.1 percent GDP growth rate, exports up as well, strong.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Indeed, a lot of that was the Commerce Department reported that soybean exports did surge in the second quarter, again, ahead of those tariffs going on those retaliatory tariffs from China, and then our tariffs on imported -- with 34 billion in imported Chinese good that first week in the month of July, that will be -- that will be critical. How do we offset any drop in our exports in the current quarter? But again, to just focus on the health of the U.S. economy, this is -- we're looking at soybeans. Soybeans are actually up a little bit today. But if you look at the broad economy, I think that the tariff truce, the de-escalation of tensions that we found out from -- with Europe this week is really helping, it comes at a critical time that if you could actually pick up exports into Europe in the month of August and September, that will be much-needed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And how about the personal savings rate -- it's now at 6.8 percent, Anthony, that's in the second quarter, it's down from 7.2 percent in the first quarter, so just what we were just talking about, where consumers were saving a lot of their tax gains in the first quarter, they spent that money in this quarter.</p><p>CHAN: Maria, that's again, another sign of confidence. Remember, the 6.8 percent number is still high, I think it could go a little bit lower, I would not be uncomfortable if it moves a little bit lower and that means the consumer spending, but that can only happen when consumers feel a little bit more confident about the future. And we have an opportunity for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, big news. Anthony, great to see you, thank so much for weighing in this morning.</p><p>CHAN: Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Anthony Chan, J.P. Morgan. Remember to stay tuned for my exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence. It will air this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox News at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. We will have more of that sit-down on Monday morning right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, beginning at 6:00 a.m. Eastern. Join me for the White House's reaction when I sit down with Vice President Mike Pence.</p><p>First though, coming up, Stuart Varney is weighing in on the first reading of the second-quarter GDP. We'll get Stuart's thoughts, coming up. And then big oil reporting quarterly results below estimates, Chevron and Exxon under pressure this morning. Take a look, Exxon is down four percent, Chevron is down almost three percent. These are Dow components, that's the problem in the Dow, as you just heard. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We're watching oil prices this morning. We just got the GDP number out. It is 4.1 percent, pretty much in line with lowered expectations. We're also watching the price of oil here, down a fraction, back below $70.00 a barrel.</p><p>Phil Flynn is joining us right now to talk more about that. He's from The PRICE of Futures Group, Phil, good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning, Maria. It's great to be here, but not a big day for oil today. It's kind of a small day, at least, for ExxonMobil.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, we're looking at oil at $70.00 a barrel, pretty much. And you got ExxonMobil reporting a miss in its earnings, explain?</p><p>FLYNN: It really is -- and years ago, ExxonMobil cut back capital spending probably way too much. And that they made some very bad decisions when it came on that. Their actual production was the lowest level expense since 2008, and that isn't good when oil prices are going back up.</p><p>Now, they have increased their capital spending by a dramatic amount, but it might be too little too late in the short term to take advantage of these high prices. I think ExxonMobil made some bad decisions and that's what it's showing up on the earnings.</p><p>Now, they have made some big investments in the Permian Basin and some other areas, to get that production up. But, it's not going to show up in the earnings for a period of time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, do you think this is the right reaction? ExxonMobil shares down almost five percent this morning. That's one of the issues holding back the Dow Industrials.</p><p>FLYNN: I think, initially, based off this shock value, it is, but ExxonMobil is a great stock. I own it in my own portfolios. I would use this as a long term buying opportunity, because, the bottom line is, is that U.S. energy is going to come back in a big way. This is going to be a major factor in this country. I think ExxonMobil is starting to get their act together.</p><p>They're going to be focusing more on production, more on the refining end, and I think that's why they are going to do so good. Chevron, on the other hand, they did a little better because they have been focusing on the refining that did much, much better, a lot smarter, made some better decisions.</p><p>And that is why they're doing a little bit better. So, maybe, hopefully, Chevron can lead back ExxonMobil today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And yet, that stock is also down about two percent on Chevron. Look, we heard a lot about the boom in U.S. energy capacity, this week. President Trump's agreement with Jean-Claude Juncker of the European Commission, promising to boost liquid natural gas exports to Europe. Here's what Energy Secretary Rick Perry told me about that yesterday on this program.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICK PERRY, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF ENERGY: They know that we have this extraordinary supply of what's happened in the energy sector is phenomenal from the standpoint of production of liquefied natural gas.</p><p>And it has multiple impacts, obviously, for National Security, in America, the idea that we're being able to supply our own gas and oil supply. But, also, to go to our allies, and that was the message the President had for the E.U.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, Flynn, your reaction?</p><p>FLYNN: Finally, an energy secretary that gets it, and big energy. And I was amazed to see after your interview yesterday, all the people that were kind of downplaying President Trump and Rick Perry's movement to Europe with L&amp;G, because, really, that is our future.</p><p>L&amp;G is going to make the U.S. an economic and energy powerhouse in the future. Europe is starting to get that right now. Europe's actual production of natural gas is plunging. They're going to become more reliant and other people to provide their natural gas and that U.S. should be first in line.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Phil, good to see you this morning, thanks very much, Phil Flynn. We'll be right back, a lot more to come.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The first read on second quarter GDP is out. It is in line with the economists' expectations, 4.1 percent growth is what we saw in the second quarter. Markets this morning have been back-and-forth.</p><p>Not a major reaction, but certainly, back-and-forth negative, positive territory. We're looking at the Dow up seven points, the NASDAQ up 22-1/2.</p><p>We have breaking news right now, President Trump will speak about the economy, this morning, at 9:30 a.m. Eastern, of course, Fox Business Network will have full coverage. And we will take you to the White House, live, when the President makes those comments and gives his reaction to this GDP number.</p><p>Look, we've got to talk earnings, team. So, the GDP number, obviously, very strong, on a consumer level, on a business spending level, but then there's Twitter, there's ExxonMobil, there's Facebook. What's your takeaway?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's talk about Amazon, since that's some of the good news this morning. As you pointed out Exxon's profit misses pulling the Dow down a little bit or holding it back with this great reading on the economy, best in almost four years.</p><p>But Amazon reported a profit. This used to be a company, just a couple years ago, that would lose money. But because of these additional businesses like the Whole Foods acquisition, because of its growth, in cloud computing, which you talked to Satya Nadella about, in Microsoft, a competitor of Amazon, the stock's up four percent in premarket trading.</p><p>Amazon made more than $2-1/2 billion in the most recent quarter. So this is a -- this is a standout report from Amazon. And one worth noting particularly with what happened with its operating margin is at 5.6 percent. That's the highest rate in over a decade for Amazon.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and it's certainly a standout when you look at the Twitter report, and when you look at Facebook, Twitter shares this morning, was sliding. Revenue beat expectations, but the company's monthly users declined. James, take a look at this reaction, down better than 11 percent, as people get out of Twitter this morning.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. You wonder why people are a little less eager to use these services. Maybe it's political concern, maybe they don't want their data being abused, we'll see. It's a first time, really. It's the first quarter that these concerns are showing up in the numbers, as our colleague, Dagen, predicted they would.</p><p>But, overall, this is a greet earning season and I think some of these problems, Exxon, Facebook, et cetera, are specific to those companies. This is a fantastic economic report, as well.</p><p>We were talking about the investment, wasn't as great as the first quarter, but 7.3 percent growth in non-residential fixed investments, spending by businesses, the tax cuts on corporate income is working exactly as planned.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is big. That is a big number. And you got to also point to the rollback in regulations for that. Let's look at a quick break, everybody, and then we'll have some final thoughts. Don't forget to stay tuned for my exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence, airing this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox News at 10:00 a.m. Eastern, Sunday.</p><p>We'll have more of my sit-down on Monday morning right here, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, beginning at 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern, back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great show today, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. James Freeman, Dagen McDowell, Morgan Ortagus, great to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Love you.</p><p>FREEMAN: Good to be here.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will see you soon. Have a great weekend, everybody, thanks for joining us. That will do it for us. Join me on Sunday for Vice President Mike Pence. Here's Stuart Varney in Varney &amp; Company. Stuart, take it away.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018072703cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SWT-RMT1-DXH2-600C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7648\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 27, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002C1P</classCode><className>EXXON MOBIL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS324110 PETROLEUM REFINERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS211130 NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS211120 CRUDE PETROLEUM EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>XOM (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>New York Stock Exchange</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>American Action Network</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ford</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>General Motors</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Merck</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Keytruda</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Krispy Kreme</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>National Security Council</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Near East and North African Affairs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>GDP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ExxonMobil</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chevron</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Permian Basin</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Microsoft</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Amazon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Twitter</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Energy &amp;

Good Friday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   Happy Friday, and coming to you live this morning from nation's capital,  where I will sit down for an exclusive interview with Vice President Mike  Pence.  You will see that on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox News Channel  this Sunday and here on \"MORNINGS WITH MARIA\" on Monday morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Happy Friday.  It is Friday, July 27th.  And your top stories right now  8:00 a.m. one the East Coast.  The economy firing on all cylinders.  The  first look at the second quarter GDP, it's out in less than 30 minutes.  It  is expected to show growth in the economy of 4.1 percent.  President Trump  sounding of speaking in Iowa yesterday.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  The predictions from 3.8 to  5.3, right?  I have been saying we're going to do all pretty well but  nobody thought we were going to be this big.  When I took over, those  numbers were bad and they were heading in the wrong direction.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ahead of the report, futures are mixed.  Take a look, Dow  Industrials up 10 points, S&amp;P 500 lower by half a point and the NASDAQ is  up 3-3/4 points.  Fractional moves across the board.  Mixed performance  yesterday on Wall Street.  The Dow was up but others down, the Dow posting  a triple digit gain while the NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 were in the red.  In  Europe this morning, gains across the board.</p><p>Take a look, money moving into equities in a big way, DAX Index up a half  of a percent as is the FT-100 in London.  In Asia overnight, markets were  mostly higher with the exception of China, Shanghai Composite down a third  of a percent.  Investors are also watching earnings, Twitter earnings out  last hour, decline in monthly users, taking the stock down this morning.   It is down 16 percent on Twitter as investors are rethinking what the  growth numbers are.</p><p>Really, for social media companies.  We are waiting on ExxonMobil this  morning.  The first of the oil giants to report their second quarter this  morning.  We'll get the highlights from the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange coming up with Exxon shares down almost one percent going into the  numbers.  Then there's this, finally coming home.  North Korea handing over  the remains of some U.S. soldiers killed in the line of duty during the  Korean War.</p><p>We have the details as one of President Trump's promises becomes reality.   The wildfire in Northern California turns deadly.  The flames tearing  through small towns, forcing thousands to flee their homes.  The very  latest developments coming up this morning straight ahead.  All those  stories coming up this morning and joining me to break it all down in New  York, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.</p><p>The Wall Street Journals' assistant editorial page editor, James Freeman,  and national security analyst Morgan Ortagus.  A lot happening this  morning, guys.  Good morning to you.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria  Bartiromo.  I can't wait for that number of (INAUDIBLE) find out how fast  this economy is growing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it was Atlanta Fed, James Freeman, who predicted 4.8  percent.  But did they walk that down to 4.5 percent recently?  I know --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  They might even be slightly under four after that data we got  Thursday, but -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, right.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But still very optimistic and, you know, more good news, this  rising household formation.  That was kind of a story of the Obama years  was kids living in parents' basements waiting for the opportunity to move  out so that that surge I think is very hopeful sign that we turn the corner  and maybe some of those millennials who everyone says, believe in socialism  will now see some of the benefits of free markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think, Morgan?</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think certainly, anyone running  us, a Democratic socialist, this number today is not going to help the  cause, you know, which is a good thing.  We can just look as far as south  as Venezuela to see what socialism does in our hemisphere.  So, it's going  to be a good number today and it's going to help the White House continue  to focus on jobs.</p><p>And the people that elected Donald Trump, that care about getting their  jobs back, they care about economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we're going to get the White House reaction firsthand.  I'm  here in Washington this morning for an exclusive interview with Vice  President Mike Pence that will air this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES,\" on Fox News at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  We will have -- plus more of  that interview of my sit down on Monday morning right here on \"MORNINGS  WITH MARIA\" beginning 6:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Don't miss my interview with the Vice President, coming out.  Coming up on  the program.  We have this breaking news, we want to get out right now.   Exxon earnings are out.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York  Stock Exchange with the details.  And Nick, ExxonMobil shares were down  going into the quarter.  </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  And you know what,  it's now the third quarter of weakness for Exxon.  A big miss on earnings  per share, Maria.  You could see it's now down 1.8 percent, 92 cents versus  a buck 27.  Revenue did come in and beat 73.5 versus 72.5.  The CEOs saying  second quarter results were primarily impacted by significantly scheduled  maintenance undertaken to support operational integrity.</p><p>But the big picture here is that it's a miss, again.  Last quarter the  profit missed on the estimates on refining and chemical woes.  So again,  another miss for Exxon, Dow component too.  So we'll watch for that.  But  for the most part, we've seen a lot of beats, 72 percent have beaten on  revenue and 84 percent have beaten on earnings per share thus far.  That  being said, let's also take a look at Twitter which this morning you noted,  the active users fell by a million.</p><p>So that really surprised Wall Street because they were expecting a million  gain in users.  So, with that move to the downside, the stock has been down  about 16 percent.  And take a look at Facebook which had the biggest fall  ever since its 2012 IPO.  It's the biggest loss ever for a company over 100  billion lost in one day.  Zuckerberg losses 16 billion of his own money and  so you can see the stock is coming back by one percent.</p><p>But we have a discussion about this yesterday, some people want to consider  buying this back and others don't want to touch it concerned about  management and the company overall, Maria.  And I will leave with you this,  Jeffrey Frankel just came over from Stuart Frankel.  You know him well and  basically continues to say, there is no better place to buy them in the  U.S., and he reiterated equity is the place to go.</p><p>The volatility has been wild, what an exciting week it has been and the  value players have been picking them and liquidating in them throughout the  day.  We had a wild close yesterday too on some very heavy volume.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I'm just scratching my head, how do you have a miss when  oil prices are where they are.  We're going to take a look at that, Nic.   Thank you so much as you see, that stock is lower.  The GDP report less  than 30 minutes away.  That will likely set the tone for markets but  because of the ExxonMobil numbers, things have come in a bit for futures.   We're expecting a higher opening but not where we were earlier.</p><p>President Trump touted the strength of the economy and alluded to the  strong GDP number yesterday. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  We've never seen anything like going on right now.  We're going to  have very big numbers announced tomorrow.  I don't know what they are but a  lot of big predictions, I think they're going to be to be terrific.  You  know, we took over, it was really low and it was heading lower, a lot lower  and was going to be there fast and great things have happened.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now to talk more about that, Fox News  contributor, former senior adviser for President George W. Bush, Karl Rove.   Karl, good to see you, my friend.</p><p>KARL ROVE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  And look, I want to get  started on a positive note.  I'm willing to contribute $5.00 to the  Zuckerberg relief fund.  Make sure the lad gets a nice lunch today.  So,  five bucks, count me in.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ohm goodness.  Listen, he is still a multibillionaire, Karl, so  let's not go crazy on this upset for Facebook stock, but what's your take  in -- I want to ask you about that because the -- your reaction to what  we're seeing in terms of the censoring of conservative ideas on Twitter, on  Facebook and this backlash that these companies are now facing.  </p><p>ROVE:  Well, I think that's a part of the story.  The bigger part of the  story is the vulnerability of our tech companies.  These tech companies  have grown so fast, the expectations are so high, they've got so many  things that they have to deal with, whether it's like concerns on Twitter  about Conservatives being sort of dislodged and pushed to the side or  Facebook where the question is your privacy rights.</p><p>So, all of these, many issues that they face I think demonstrated the  vulnerability of this once thought invulnerable big tech companies. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And we'll see if there's a heavier government hand in  terms of regulation as a result of some of this.  They're going to be going  testifying in front of the Senate, Sheryl Sandberg and others, so we'll  watch that.  But let me ask you about the GDP and the economy, Karl because  when President comments on economic data, before it's actually released,  it's usually an indicator of the strong report.  What are you expecting?  </p><p>ROVE:  Well, he doesn't know what the number is.  When he talked yesterday  in Granite City, I want to be clear, he had not yet been informed, he was  probably informed maybe sometime this morning, maybe sometime late last  night.  But Presidents are not supposed to talk about that number publicly  once they're given it.  So my suspicion is he was looking at the same day  that we've all been looking at.</p><p>April, May and June, capital investment, investment in capital goods  excluding aircraft up dramatically, April, May, June, retail numbers up  significantly.  So this is going to be the first GDP number that's going to  be actually have all of the regulatory reform baked in and see the  beginning of the impact of the tax reform measure.  So, we've seen  estimates from three to five, the consensus appears to be just around four,  just slightly north of four.</p><p>And it's going to be a very good number.  Ironically, I will tell you  politically this is a -- you can't just bask in the glory of the moment.   I've been through a couple of these moments in the White House myself and  there's an ironic thing, is when the economy is really going good, they pay  momentary attention to good news like this and then they sort of say, well,  the economy is doing good.  I'm on the other things.</p><p>So the administration needs to not only sort of say, well, look at the good  results of our policies, but all incidentally, here are some additional  things we want to do to keep our economy going strong because there is a --  there is a -- real -- you know, temptation by ordinary people to say, I'm  banking that the economy is good, now I'm looking on other things that  concern me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  But that's the thing, I mean, we talk about this  every morning and that is trade. And we are wondering if these tariffs and  trade are going to have an impact on this number, Karl. </p><p>ROVE:  Well, about in fact, the people over the American Action Network say  one thing might be baked into these numbers is people -- companies were  afraid of the impact of tariffs so they forward ordered, they said, OK, I'm  going to need more steel and aluminum, so before that tariff gets put in on  steel and aluminum, I'm going to preorder it.  There are things that might  be coming from China.</p><p>Where I want to get ahead of the tariffs so that I get these -- so there  may be some and we'll see that in the inventory numbers but, yes, there are  some instability there.  The president this week with the E.U., they  already change (INAUDIBLE) foe, now we're going to be allies together in  reducing tariffs and tariffs barriers, non-tariff barriers and we're going  to be also I thought largely passed over in public comment but really  important.</p><p>The E.U. and the United States are going to be working together at the two  in order to rein in China's trade abuses.  So good news on that front but  you're right, this number, the last quarter, there have been, you know,  this was the quarter of talk about tariff wars and trade wars and that's  going to be reflected maybe to the good in people pre-ordering but also  reflected in the ongoing with people being concerned about what the economy  is going to look like in the months ahead. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes. But, look, Dagen has pointed this out correctly, like the  Wall Street Journal editorial board, like 24 lawmakers who are up in arms  and have been yesterday that these trade -- these tariffs are cutting into  growth.  Correct, Dagen? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They are.  Karl, when you have the President on the --  essentially at a campaign rally as he was yesterday bragging about the  steel industry coming back.  I can't help but think what about all the  industries that will be hurt by the higher price of steel, small businesses  far and wide, people who's costs have gone up, their supply chains have  been disrupted whether they make kegs of beer or nails or even school  lockers.</p><p>And then you've seen in these earnings reports this week but Ford and  General Motors came out and talked about how much that they have been hurt  by the higher costs.</p><p>ROVE:  Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Each day and the commodity prices have shaved $300 million from  their second quarter results.  Even Coca-Cola is raising prices.  So  politically, you need to be careful about -- crone about one industry and  then basically ignoring all the ones that are -- basically not your  favorite business. </p><p>ROVE:  Yes.  Well, look, I couldn't agree more.  If somebody has to pay  that tariff, the tariff is not being paid by the people abroad, it's being  paid by us here, largely in the form of higher costs and missed  opportunities and lost jobs.  If you're going to raise the price or  something by 25 percent which is what has happened with steel, there are  going to be some victims of it.  Same with A.G. products.</p><p>The President talked yesterday about how the E.U. is going to buy a bunch  of soybeans.  Well, the markets have not yet reflected that, because the  cost for soybeans is down.  Since the Chinese canceled the contracts,  soybean prices have plummeted, so have pork prices which when the Chinese  retaliated on us by placing tariffs on pork.  So I'm with you, that's why - - maybe I'm hanging on the good news more than I should.</p><p>But the President has finally revealed he had three choices, he sounded  sometimes like a mercantilist, there's no good trade deal unless you buy  more from us than we buy from you.  Sometimes he sounded like a rules based  trader, you know, everybody ought to abide by the rules but this week he  sounded like a free trader and we got a -- all tariffs and obstacles to  trade to zero and frankly, I like that and it's going to be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see if it's fixed.  We'll see if it's fixed, Karl.</p><p>ROVE:  -- in a trade deficit today with Nicaragua. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, sir.  Thank you so much.</p><p>ROVE:  Why?  Because they grow bananas and we don't.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will see if it's fixed.  Stay with us.  We'll brining you  the first reading of the second quarter GDP in under 20 minutes.  15  minutes form now.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back to MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.  I'm Gerri Willis with your headlines.  Wildfires raging through  Northern California turning deadly.  The fire near Redding, California  killing a bulldozer operator as he fought to combat the blaze.  Officials  say the man was quickly surrounded by flames and unable to escape. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BRETT GOUVEA, CAL FIRE INCIDENT COMMANDER CHIEF:  we mourn the loss, we  also battle the fire that is moving extremely quickly and erratically into  Western Redding.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>WILLIS:  Sad story.  At least three firefighters and several residents have  also been injured in the fire which started on Monday and it since tripled  in size.  Governor Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in Redding  and surrounding Shasta County.  And earnings a big story today. Results  from Dow component, ExxonMobil coming in just minutes ago.  The company  reporting a big miss on earnings per share.  </p><p>Mainly due to what Exxon is calling significant rescheduled maintenance.   Revenue top expectations.  ExxonMobil stock under pressure in the  premarket, Merck though, another Dow component is out with better-than- expected earnings.  Sales of the company's cancer drug, you've heard of it,  Keytruda nearly doubling.  Merck also raised its profit outlook for the  full year, even so the stock slightly lower in the premarket.</p><p>But it is a different story for Colgate-Palmolive.  The company's latest  quarterly sales missed the street forecast.  The sales in Latin America  falling seven percent from a year ago.  Colgate shares are sharply lower  ahead of the opening bell.</p><p>Here's my favorite story today.  Krispy Kreme donuts marking 81st birthday  with a special deal for today only.  Krispy Kreme is selling a dozen glazed  donuts for a dollar.  That's my favorite kind.  The offer is available at  all Krispy Kreme locations in the U.S. and Canada, also going on sales  today are Krispy Kreme's limited edition, confetti donuts.  It's birthday  cake-flavored dough mixed with confetti sprinkles.</p><p>Covered in the company's classic glaze before being topped off with even  more sprinkles because you can't have enough.  Dagen, here is my dollar, I  got to get going and get over there. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Get over there.  Thank you so much, Gerri.</p><p>WILLIS:  You're welcome.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to wish the most special woman in my life a very happy  birthday. My mama.  There she is with my dad, her partner in crime since  she was like 13 years of age.  My mother turned 80 today.  She will kill me  for that.  But this woman is the embodiment of grace and strength, wisdom,  devotion and in the last four years since she's been battling stage four  lung cancer, she is the epitome of courage.</p><p>She is an icon to me and so many people.  I love with you all my heart,  mama.  That fellow, my daddy turns 82 on Sunday.  So they look pretty good  for 80 and 82.  Go McDowells.  And by the way, here's a lot of love to  anybody battling cancer today.  I think about, you know, say prayers for  you every single day, them and their families.</p><p>Coming up.  We are awaiting the first reading of second quarter GDP due out  in 10 minutes exactly.  Economist expecting growth, north of four percent,  4.1 percent?  Will we see a five?  You have to.  Stay with us to find out.   We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Protecting America's vote.  President Trump  gearing up for a meeting today of the National Security Council on election  security.  A session that could include a discussion of possible Russian  interference in November's midterm elections.  Joining us right now is the  former deputy national security adviser under George W. Bush and former  National Security Council senior director for Near East and North African  Affairs, Elliott Abrams.</p><p>Elliot, good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us. </p><p>ELLIOT ABRAMS, FORMER SENIOR DIRECTOR, NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  Glad to  be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You watched this for a long time, Elliot.  So, I want to get  your take first on how long we have been watching Russia undermine the  west? </p><p>ABRAMS:  You know, it isn't really that long that we've watched them under  the line elections.  Obviously go back to the Cold War, they were the main  enemy in Cold War.  Really since World War II.  What we used to think of  election security as, you know, fraud.  People in the cemeteries, voting.   This is new.  This notion that voting is part of the critical  infrastructure like the banks and the power plants subject to hacking by an  enemy government abroad.</p><p>That's new and that really is only since 2016. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  So Russian hackers already attempted to interfere in the  2018 midterms targeting vulnerable Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill.   The Daily Beast is reporting on this attempted August 2017 hack with  Senator McCaskill issuing a statement and here's what she said yesterday.   Russia continues to engage in cyberwarfare against our democracy.  While  this attack was not successful it is outrageous that they think they can  get away with this.</p><p>I will not be intimidated, I've said it before and I will say it again,  Putin is a thug and is a bully.  So do politicians need to make election  security a higher priority for their staff in terms of training going into  the midterms? </p><p>ABRAMS:  They do.  They really do.  You know, the problem is we don't have  one election, we have 50-state elections that we have in this country, more  than 3,000 counties.  So election security is really hard to do and hard to  coordinate.  And we are not making the Russians pay a price for this.  You  know, now we know about the Claire McCaskill hack by Russia, so what  happens?  Are there sanctions?  Is there a punishment or you know they try  again?</p><p>Until we impose some costs, we just have to assume the Russians will keep  trying it every level of government. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So that's what we need to do.  Come back with some kind of  punishment because is there anything we can do to actually stop it before  they start?</p><p>ABRAMS:  Yes.  There are ways.  I mean, the -- there needs to be are better  coordination between CIA, FBI, Homeland Security and the people who are  actually administering elections, you know, the state election boards are  not Federal.  There's 50 of them, and they're the ones that really need to  have the improved security and many of them are not yet up to the about  task. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Makes sense.  All right.  We'll keep watching that.   Thanks very much for weighing in on this important issue. </p><p>ABRAMS:  You're welcome. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Elliot Abrams joining us.  Coming up.  We are waiting the first  reading of second quarter GDO.  The number out in three minutes' time right  after this break.  Catch it right here.  Back in a minute. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  I'm Maria Bartiromo come to you live from  Washington, D.C. this morning where I will interview Vice President Mike  Pence later today.  You'll see that exclusive interview on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\" on the Fox News Channel this Sunday and right here on MORNINGS  WITH MARIA on Monday.  Join me for the White House reaction to the GDP  number.</p><p>We are getting a first look at the second quarter GDP out any second in  about 10 seconds time.  We will have the number.  The expectations call for  growth of 4.1 percent.  Let's take a look at futures right before this  number hits the tape.  It's about to hit and as we see, markets right now  are lover with Dow industrials down seven points and the S&amp;P down a  fraction but the NASDAQ has reversed and it is actually up.</p><p>J.P. Morgan managing director and chief economist Anthony Chan will join us  right now to talk more about it.  4.1 percent is the number, Anthony, right  in line with expectations.  Good to see you this morning, your reaction to  the GDP, 4.1 percent growth.</p><p>ANTHONY CHAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CHIEF ECONOMIST, J.P. MORGAN:  I think  that's a great number, it really shows that consumers are getting  energized, getting a little bit more consumer confidence.  We'll have to  look at the details.  Obviously, the net exports are going to be strong, a  lot of countries trying to sort of get a jump-start ahead of the tariffs so  that was boosted a little bit there, then we'll have to look at the  inventory to see what happens to the next quarter. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you want to look at inventories.  What about business  spending?  Is that a component that you are focused on in terms of giving  us a window of where we head next?  As you see, markets have turned around  and now we're looking at a gain on the -- well, it's back-and-forth so it's  unchanged right now.  But tell us what's most important about this number  right now, Anthony?</p><p>CHAN:  I think the important thing is to look at these things, not only  just in a given quarter but certainly over multiple quarters.  I think that  certainly the instant expensing of business investment will boost capital  spending, and that will in turn boost productivity growth as you know,  Maria, that has been one of the things that has held down economic growth,  and now giving a shot in the arm to encourage businesses investment, will  definitely give a shot in the arm to productivity, and I think that will  help elevate the growth rates for real GDP moving forward. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Dagen, you've got details now as we're looking and zeroing  in on this number, what strikes you about this 4.1 percent report?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, one thing that we should note is the fact that the  estimates by a lot of economists after the durable goods report yesterday  started coming down.  That Atlanta Fed number that we watch so closely had  been lowered to 3.8 percent, so this number does come in higher than that.   And we had other economists that were projecting close to five percent,  they had lowered it to about 4-1/2 percent, but again, this is still such a  solid number.  This is the first time that we've gotten growth for any  quarter before four percent since the third-quarter of 2014.  So, nearly  four years.  It's been that long since we've seen a four in front of  quarterly growth.  That's a very -- that's something very important to  note.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I just want to also point out that the first-quarter GDP is  being revised upward, it was two percent, now it's 2.2 percent, a revision  on the first-quarter GDP, Anthony Chan, we were looking at a good quarter  as it was but now they're saying first-quarter GDP revised upward.</p><p>CHAN:  That certainly helps the yearly numbers, as you know, Maria.  This  was a report that was going to revise all the way going backwards.  So,  it's not just one calendar quarter but it's a multiple number of quarters  that are going to be revised, that gives you a very good idea of where the  economy is going to go because the first quarter had been originally  revised down now it's coming back.  That will give you a little bit of a  boost.  It looks like this year we're going to come really, really close to  about a three percent growth when all is said and done if this trend  continues. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's going to be the first time in a long time, James  Freeman, for three percent.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, kaboom, this is huge news.  This is now kind of officially  the end of the new normal two percent sluggish growth era.  This is 12  months of better than three percent growth, this is what the White House  was hoping for, what everyone was hoping for, and we -- you know, we talked  about these numbers, this is more jobs, more opportunity for people in this  country, and millions of people who look for work within the last few  years, but maybe weren't looking this year, we know they could rejoin the  labor force, maybe they will now.  It's just fantastic news to see that  we've turned a corner.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well -- yes, go ahead, Anthony.</p><p>CHAN:  And one thing, Maria, that's really important about this number is  that it's real in the sense that consumer spending coming in so strong,  giving you a four percent number, you can look at all the components and  quibble about them, but when you see consumer spending this strong, that's  impressive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a really important point, because the consumer has  been debatable, right?  I mean, earlier in the year, we were looking at a  consumer that perhaps was saving more money than they were actually  spending.  Are you saying that's changed?</p><p>CHAN:  I think it has in the sense that in the first quarter, you got only  about a half a percent growth in consumer spending, that's two-thirds of  the overall economy.  Remember that confidence on the part of the consumers  is what drives this economic growth.  And then, when businesses see the  consumers are excited, guess what, they're even more encouraged to spend  more and that in turn boosts productivity and boost the underlying growth  trend of the overall economy.  So, I always look to see what consumers are  doing because that drives the future path of real GDP.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course, two-thirds of economic growth consumer activity.   Dagen, how do you see it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Trade played a big part of this second-quarter number, net  exports added more than one percentage point to the 4.1 percent GDP growth  that we got, 1.06 percentage points there.  Some of that would have been  buying by overseas of trading partners of soybeans ahead of these tariffs,  these retaliatory tariffs that went into effect in the beginning of July.   That was after the end of the second quarter.  So, we're going to have to  wait for the third-quarter GDP to really find out the impact of the -- this  trade fight as it picked up steam moving into the month of July.  So again,  it was maybe buying that was pulled forward into the second quarter, and  then that will be buying that isn't present in the third.  I would just  leave it at that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The important point, Morgan Ortagus, the president likes  to say economic security is national security and vice versa.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes, absolutely, I mean, this is exactly what he ran on, this is  what he pledged to the American people that if you don't elect a  politician, if you elect someone from the business community, Maria, that  we're going to get exceptional growth.  And this is what Republicans said,  you know, over the past eight years, sure, the economy grew, but very  marginally.  We did got out of the great recession.  But when you unleash  the powers of the business community, it's not just about tax reform, it's  also about -- and you've talked so much on your show, Maria, about the  expansive regulatory reform that's gone on.  And so, businesses feel on  fire again.  I think that this number -- it's important for the economy,  it's a huge blow to Democrat socialists, but I think more importantly,  putting the politics aside, it's good for America, it's good for mom and  pop shops, it's good for corporations.  This is a great day for the Trump  presidency. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you look for next, Anthony Chan, in terms of another  window into where we're going?  The administration is talking about Tax  Plan 2.0, it's questionable whether or not that passes in the Senate right  before the election, the midterm election, of course, but do you see more  stimulus coming?  What are you going to be focused on post this GDP number?</p><p>CHAN:  Well, one of the things that many people are not talking about is  that when you look at employment, for example, you've been seeing more and  more people coming from out of the labor force into the labor force.  So, a  lot of the new jobs that are being created, not so much from people that  are unemployed because that pool is so small, but people that are being  pulled out of an area that was people that were not in the labor force.   So, I look for that to continue to move forward and I look for confidence  to continue to support the overall economy.  So, those things, I think, are  in themselves quite good in this form of stimulus.  And then, I'm hopeful  that we'll get some more positive progress on the trade front.  We've got  some good news yesterday from Europe, maybe that will spread into other  parts of the world, and that will even give more business confidence, so  that this growth and momentum continues a bit further.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was this all priced in, guys?  Anybody surprised that we're not  seeing much of a market reaction, in fact, the Dow Industrials down now 28  points?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, look, I think people were expecting a blowout quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  The President's remarks, yes, he was talking about private  estimates, but you've heard the President and others.  I think he even  mentioned who knows we may be get close to five.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- people were expecting this one would be great.  I think now  obviously, it'd be hard to repeat this next time, but I think there's a  reason to think, we've talked about these are really systemic changes in  terms of tax and regulation that are not one-quarter stories, I think  there's reason to think this growth continues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because there's that runway.  Dagen, yes? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  In optimism, we're looking at the 10-year yield, it is below  three percent.  There was actually a worry that you would see that 10-year  yield go back above three percent.  So again, that's taken -- this is just  -- it's just hot enough to keep people from really dumping their treasuries  here, worried about much faster growth, and a couple of things to note  about the Dow that Intel and ExxonMobil are going to shave about 40 points  off the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  So, that's really just a reaction  particularly to Exxon's earnings which were a miss, rather than a reaction  to this extremely healthy growth number on the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a great point, absolutely.  Anthony, there is a  narrative going on that the consumer slows down quite a bit, going into  2019, going into 2020 as a result of a number of things, not to, you know,  at least of which is the Federal Reserve.  The Feds raising interest rates,  that may very well cut into -- cut into growth.  Your thoughts on where  this economy heads after '18, and this robust performance.</p><p>CHAN:  Well, I think at some point, the economy has to rest if it doesn't  get re-energized, just from quarter to quarter, it's simply.  Like for  example, this quarter, one of the things that held up growth even though  it's an impressive 4.1 percent was the change in inventories, it subtracted  basically one percent off economic growth.  That's not bad news, Maria,  because that means that next quarter, if this momentum continues, you've  got to build those inventories, so will add to economic growth.  So, even  though we came in a little bit weaker than some people may have thought,  maybe a little bit over 4.2 or 4.3, but you basically are taking some --  you're going to give some back next quarter.  </p><p>But in terms of what moves us forward, I think that we need to see a  business sentiment picking up.  And to the extent that we're making some  progress on international trade issues, that will be, I think, the catalyst  to give us that extra boost over the next couple of calendar quarters.   But, Maria, the bottom line is this economic expansion now is the second  longest basically in the history of the United States.  So, at some point,  it will have to rest.  The question is, is it going to be a soft landing or  is it going to be a hard landing, but there are going to be some slowdown  at some point, and we think 2020 is a possibility.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the Fed has pencilled in two more rate hikes this year,  three rate hikes in 2019, this report basically gives you a shoo-in that  the Fed continues raising rates, right?</p><p>CHAN:  There is no doubt that the Fed will continue to raise rates, but  remember, the Fed is not tone deaf, if they see any sort of a slowdown,  they're not going to exacerbate it, they will in fact try to pause.  So,  I'm confident that the Fed will do the right thing, and in fact, they've  gotten some encouragement from comments made by the President to do the  right thing and be a bit more cautious. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Guys, what do you think about the trade number playing a  big role in the second-quarter's growth?  Dagen, you mentioned exports  adding 1.06 percentage points to the quarter's 4.1 percent GDP growth rate,  exports up as well, strong.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Indeed, a lot of that was the Commerce Department reported that  soybean exports did surge in the second quarter, again, ahead of those  tariffs going on those retaliatory tariffs from China, and then our tariffs  on imported -- with 34 billion in imported Chinese good that first week in  the month of July, that will be -- that will be critical.  How do we offset  any drop in our exports in the current quarter?  But again, to just focus  on the health of the U.S. economy, this is -- we're looking at soybeans.   Soybeans are actually up a little bit today.  But if you look at the broad  economy, I think that the tariff truce, the de-escalation of tensions that  we found out from -- with Europe this week is really helping, it comes at a  critical time that if you could actually pick up exports into Europe in the  month of August and September, that will be much-needed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And how about the personal savings rate -- it's now at  6.8 percent, Anthony, that's in the second quarter, it's down from 7.2  percent in the first quarter, so just what we were just talking about,  where consumers were saving a lot of their tax gains in the first quarter,  they spent that money in this quarter.</p><p>CHAN:  Maria, that's again, another sign of confidence.  Remember, the 6.8  percent number is still high, I think it could go a little bit lower, I  would not be uncomfortable if it moves a little bit lower and that means  the consumer spending, but that can only happen when consumers feel a  little bit more confident about the future.  And we have an opportunity for  that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, big news.  Anthony, great to see you, thank so much  for weighing in this morning.</p><p>CHAN:  Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Anthony Chan, J.P. Morgan.  Remember to stay tuned for my  exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence.  It will air this  weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox News at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  We  will have more of that sit-down on Monday morning right here on MORNINGS  WITH MARIA, beginning at 6:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join me for the White House's  reaction when I sit down with Vice President Mike Pence.  </p><p>First though, coming up, Stuart Varney is weighing in on the first reading  of the second-quarter GDP.  We'll get Stuart's thoughts, coming up.  And  then big oil reporting quarterly results below estimates, Chevron and Exxon  under pressure this morning.  Take a look, Exxon is down four percent,  Chevron is down almost three percent.  These are Dow components, that's the  problem in the Dow, as you just heard.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're watching oil prices this morning.  We just  got the GDP number out.  It is 4.1 percent, pretty much in line with  lowered expectations.  We're also watching the price of oil here, down a  fraction, back below $70.00 a barrel.  </p><p>Phil Flynn is joining us right now to talk more about that.  He's from The  PRICE of Futures Group, Phil, good to see you this morning.</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning, Maria.  It's  great to be here, but not a big day for oil today.  It's kind of a small  day, at least, for ExxonMobil.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, we're looking at oil at $70.00 a barrel, pretty  much.  And you got ExxonMobil reporting a miss in its earnings, explain?</p><p>FLYNN:  It really is -- and years ago, ExxonMobil cut back capital spending  probably way too much.  And that they made some very bad decisions when it  came on that.  Their actual production was the lowest level expense since  2008, and that isn't good when oil prices are going back up.</p><p>Now, they have increased their capital spending by a dramatic amount, but  it might be too little too late in the short term to take advantage of  these high prices.  I think ExxonMobil made some bad decisions and that's  what it's showing up on the earnings.</p><p>Now, they have made some big investments in the Permian Basin and some  other areas, to get that production up.  But, it's not going to show up in  the earnings for a period of time.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you think this is the right reaction?  ExxonMobil shares  down almost five percent this morning.  That's one of the issues holding  back the Dow Industrials.</p><p>FLYNN:  I think, initially, based off this shock value, it is, but  ExxonMobil is a great stock.  I own it in my own portfolios.  I would use  this as a long term buying opportunity, because, the bottom line is, is  that U.S. energy is going to come back in a big way.  This is going to be a  major factor in this country.  I think ExxonMobil is starting to get their  act together.</p><p>They're going to be focusing more on production, more on the refining end,  and I think that's why they are going to do so good.  Chevron, on the other  hand, they did a little better because they have been focusing on the  refining that did much, much better, a lot smarter, made some better  decisions.  </p><p>And that is why they're doing a little bit better.  So, maybe, hopefully,  Chevron can lead back ExxonMobil today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And yet, that stock is also down about two percent on Chevron.   Look, we heard a lot about the boom in U.S. energy capacity, this week.   President Trump's agreement with Jean-Claude Juncker of the European  Commission, promising to boost liquid natural gas exports to Europe.   Here's what Energy Secretary Rick Perry told me about that yesterday on  this program.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RICK PERRY, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF ENERGY:  They know that we have this  extraordinary supply of what's happened in the energy sector is phenomenal  from the standpoint of production of liquefied natural gas.  </p><p>And it has multiple impacts, obviously, for National Security, in America,  the idea that we're being able to supply our own gas and oil supply.  But,  also, to go to our allies, and that was the message the President had for  the E.U.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Flynn, your reaction?</p><p>FLYNN:  Finally, an energy secretary that gets it, and big energy.  And I  was amazed to see after your interview yesterday, all the people that were  kind of downplaying President Trump and Rick Perry's movement to Europe  with L&amp;G, because, really, that is our future.  </p><p>L&amp;G is going to make the U.S. an economic and energy powerhouse in the  future.  Europe is starting to get that right now.  Europe's actual  production of natural gas is plunging.  They're going to become more  reliant and other people to provide their natural gas and that U.S. should  be first in line.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Phil, good to see you this morning, thanks very  much, Phil Flynn.  We'll be right back, a lot more to come.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The first read on second quarter GDP is out.  It  is in line with the economists' expectations, 4.1 percent growth is what we  saw in the second quarter.  Markets this morning have been back-and-forth.  </p><p>Not a major reaction, but certainly, back-and-forth negative, positive  territory.  We're looking at the Dow up seven points, the NASDAQ up 22-1/2.  </p><p>We have breaking news right now, President Trump will speak about the  economy, this morning, at 9:30 a.m. Eastern, of course, Fox Business  Network will have full coverage.  And we will take you to the White House,  live, when the President makes those comments and gives his reaction to  this GDP number.</p><p>Look, we've got to talk earnings, team.  So, the GDP number, obviously,  very strong, on a consumer level, on a business spending level, but then  there's Twitter, there's ExxonMobil, there's Facebook.  What's your  takeaway?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's talk about Amazon, since that's some of the good news this  morning.  As you pointed out Exxon's profit misses pulling the Dow down a  little bit or holding it back with this great reading on the economy, best  in almost four years.  </p><p>But Amazon reported a profit.  This used to be a company, just a couple  years ago, that would lose money.  But because of these additional  businesses like the Whole Foods acquisition, because of its growth, in  cloud computing, which you talked to Satya Nadella about, in Microsoft, a  competitor of Amazon, the stock's up four percent in premarket trading.  </p><p>Amazon made more than $2-1/2 billion in the most recent quarter.  So this  is a -- this is a standout report from Amazon.  And one worth noting  particularly with what happened with its operating margin is at 5.6  percent.  That's the highest rate in over a decade for Amazon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and it's certainly a standout when you look at the Twitter  report, and when you look at Facebook, Twitter shares this morning, was  sliding.  Revenue beat expectations, but the company's monthly users  declined.  James, take a look at this reaction, down better than 11  percent, as people get out of Twitter this morning.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  You wonder why people are a little less eager to use these  services.  Maybe it's political concern, maybe they don't want their data  being abused, we'll see.  It's a first time, really.  It's the first  quarter that these concerns are showing up in the numbers, as our  colleague, Dagen, predicted they would.  </p><p>But, overall, this is a greet earning season and I think some of these  problems, Exxon, Facebook, et cetera, are specific to those companies.   This is a fantastic economic report, as well.  </p><p>We were talking about the investment, wasn't as great as the first quarter,  but 7.3 percent growth in non-residential fixed investments, spending by  businesses, the tax cuts on corporate income is working exactly as planned.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is big.  That is a big number.  And you got to also point  to the rollback in regulations for that.  Let's look at a quick break,  everybody, and then we'll have some final thoughts.  Don't forget to stay  tuned for my exclusive interview with Vice President Mike Pence, airing  this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" on Fox News at 10:00 a.m. Eastern,  Sunday.  </p><p>We'll have more of my sit-down on Monday morning right here, MORNINGS WITH  MARIA, beginning at 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. Eastern, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show today, everybody, thanks so much for joining us.   James Freeman, Dagen McDowell, Morgan Ortagus, great to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Love you.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Good to be here.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Thank you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will see you soon.  Have a great weekend,  everybody, thanks for joining us.  That will do it for us.  Join me on  Sunday for Vice President Mike Pence.  Here's Stuart Varney in Varney &amp;  Company.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon may be worth much more than $1 trillion </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The e-commerce giant yesterday briefly became the second U.S. company to reach a market value of $1 trillion. (Apple was the first, just over a month ago.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Not everyone is convinced that's warranted. Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion argues that the valuation rests in part on businesses like digital ads and health care that don't exist yet. ''The mirage of a much more profitable, even more sprawling and powerful Amazon may be real eventually, but it isn't today,'' she writes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon's market capitalization has risen 74 percent this year, compared with a 26 percent increase for Apple, according to data from Capital IQ. As the WSJ points out, at that rate, the iPhone maker's days as the world's most valuable company (at yesterday's close, it was worth $1.1 billion) may be numbered. Morgan Stanley says that an Amazon market cap of $1.2 trillion is reasonable.</p><p>  Jeff Bezos, Amazon's C.E.O., is looking even higher. In an interview with Forbes, he said that for all practical purposes for Amazon ''the market size is unconstrained.''</p><p>  More on $1 trillion: How Amazon and Apple reflect the rise of powerful megacompanies. And how Amazon's valuation will bring it greater scrutiny.</p><p>  Exclusive: John Studzinski heads to Pimco</p><p>  He has been a consigliere to C.E.O.s around the world and helped guide A.I.G. through the global financial crisis. Now Mr. Studzinski will take his bulging Rolodex to Pimco, the investment management giant, where he will advise top clients like pension funds, governments and sovereign wealth funds.</p><p>  Over three decades, Mr. Studzinski -- Studs, to his friends -- struck deals at Morgan Stanley, at HSBC and then at the Blackstone Group. At Blackstone, which he left last month, his most recent role was essentially working with sovereign wealth funds and giant family offices.</p><p>  Emmanuel Roman, Pimco's C.E.O., told DealBook: ''I tried to attract him to Pimco basically since I arrived. I thought he'd be a perfect fit. It took a little bit of time and finally, we got there.''</p><p>  Big Tech's big day in Washington</p><p>  This morning, Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee on social media's role in meddling by foreign powers. (Notably absent: Google, which rejected the committee's request for someone higher-ranking than its top lawyer.) In the afternoon, Mr. Dorsey will also testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on policing what users tweet. Here's how to watch the hearings.</p><p>  Lawmakers will ask about a host of issues, including political bias, fake news and the use of algorithms. (Fun aside: Can you spot the deceptive Facebook posts in this quiz?) Expect Mr. Dorsey and Ms. Sandberg to provide a simple message: We're trying. To that point, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook has written an op-ed for the WaPo on how protecting democracy is ''an arms race'' that Facebook can and is willing to help solve.</p><p>  Behind all this is the threat of a political clampdown on Big Tech. Kara Swisher of the NYT points out why that needs to be done with care:</p><p>America needs a clear explanation of what its social media giants expect to become, before legislation forces all manner of regulations on them. Some of these will be decent, like forcing better privacy rules, but others could hinder innovation and growth in what is arguably the United States' greatest industry.</p><p>  More: Ms. Sandberg is trying to fix Facebook's reputation, but also her own. The F.C.C.'s chairman says that Big Tech may be forced to become more transparent. Social media's ad-based model may be breaking society.</p><p>  Theranos is finally, officially dead</p><p>  The blood-testing start-up has said it will officially dissolve itself. Theranos, which went from being a Silicon Valley darling to a cautionary tale, told shareholders that it was in talks to sell its patents to its most recent lender, Fortress Investment Group, after breaching a loan covenant in a way that allows Fortress to foreclose on the company's assets. Remaining cash, about $5 million, will go to the company's other creditors.</p><p>  The move isn't surprising. Theranos had laid off most of its staff and its founder, Elizabeth Holmes, has been indicted on fraud charges. But the collapse means that the company's star-studded list of investors -- Rupert Murdoch, the Walton family of Walmart fame, and others -- has now collectively lost $1 billion.</p><p>  An ''administrative coup d'\u00e9tat'' at the White House</p><p>  Bob Woodward's forthcoming book on the Trump presidency was bound to stir controversy. But excerpts from the book, called ''Fear,'' dropped bombshells. Notably, they claim that administration aides have taken extraordinary measures to prevent the president from embarking on more trade wars or ordering assassinations.</p><p>  Some of the most surreal actions were taken by Gary Cohn, the former national economic adviser, according to the WaPo:</p><p>  According to Woodward, Cohn ''stole a letter off Trump's desk'' that the president was intending to sign to formally withdraw the United States from a trade agreement with South Korea. Cohn later told an associate that he removed the letter to protect national security and that Trump did not notice that it was missing.</p><p>  The book claims that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis once called out the president as having the understanding of a fifth- or sixth-grader. (Mr. Mattis denies the book's reporting.)</p><p>  But the White House's response to the book, according to Axios, tacitly confirms that some incidents described did happen.</p><p>Nike bets on Colin Kaepernick for the long term</p><p>  Making the former N.F.L. quarterback the centerpiece of the latest ''Just Do It'' campaign was always going to be contentious, given he became the face of player protests two years ago. Shares in Nike fell 3 percent yesterday as #BoycottNike trended on social media. (Though Adidas was down too.)</p><p>  Analysts -- those willing to speak, anyway -- largely considered it a shrewd move. Younger consumers tend to want brands to take political stands, Matt Powell of NPD told the NYT, and ''this is an opportunity for Nike to do just that.''</p><p>  With Nike buffeted by slowing sales and accusations of systemic bias against women, changing its story line might be a good idea. As Mary Scott of the marketing agency UEG told the NYT: ''When's the last time we talked about a Nike campaign?''</p><p>  The jury is out on emerging-market contagion</p><p>South Africa slid into recession yesterday. Turkey's lira continues to fall. So does the Argentine peso. And Indonesia's rupiah sank to its lowest level in two decades.</p><p>  Fears have begun to creep from currencies into stocks, with Asian indexes swooning. But whether a full-blown financial crisis is in the works remains to be seen. More from Robert Burgess of Bloomberg Opinion:</p><p>  If you're old-school and contagion means something that spreads into a global crisis that threatens the economy and financial system by catching a few key hedge funds napping, then you can relax. That can be seen in the interbank-funding markets. In a true crisis, demand for dollar funding among financial institutions would skyrocket if they thought that one -- or more -- of their own was in trouble.</p><p>  That hasn't happened.

But critics say the incentives set a worrying precedent: Bryce Covert writes in an NYT Op-Ed that other companies will now <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/opinion/amazon-hq2-winner.html?dlbk\">expect similarly extravagant windfalls</url> in exchange for offices.

But Stephen Castle of the NYT points out how pivotal today\u2019s meeting is:</p><p>If the deal is rejected today, Mrs. May\u2019s leadership could hang in the balance.

Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The cost of landing Amazon's new offices: $2 billion </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amazon confirmed yesterday that it had picked New York City and Northern Virginia for its new hubs. (Nashville will get a logistics facility as a consolation prize.) But skeptics are asking whether the price tag -- a combined total of $2 billion in tax credits, rebates and other incentives -- was worth it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Here's what each location promised:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New York offered Amazon more than $1.2 billion in incentives, and a pledge that Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor <person><nameText>Bill de Blasio </nameText></person>would stop bickering long enough to see the project through. The city also agreed to a helipad for Jeff Bezos.</p><p>Virginia promised about $800 million in incentives (and the all-important helipad, too). It also rebranded the neighborhoods that will host Amazon's office as ''National Landing.''</p><p>  Officials from each location said that Amazon's offices would create at least 25,000 jobs. But critics say the incentives set a worrying precedent: Bryce Covert writes in an NYT Op-Ed that other companies will now expect similarly extravagant windfalls in exchange for offices. And some local politicians have already publicly opposed the plan.</p><p>  Meanwhile, Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion thinks Amazon may have outsmarted itself: ''The year of hoopla during a period of deepening anxiety about powerful technology companies means there will be more attention on whether Amazon is a good corporate citizen.''</p><p>  More tech job news: Amazon and Googleare in a race to hire software developers.</p><p><person><nameText>Theresa May's </nameText></person>make-or-break moment</p><p>  British and European Union officials reached a long-awaited draft agreement yesterday over Britain's withdrawal from the bloc. Now comes the hard part.</p><p>  At 2 p.m. today (9 a.m. Eastern), Prime Minister <person><nameText>Theresa May </nameText></person>of Britain will meet with senior cabinet ministers to assess the plans. They reviewed the draft text overnight, though the details haven't been made public.</p><p>  Getting to this point has not been easy, and it involved months of labored discussions -- particularly about contentious issues like the Irish border. But Stephen Castle of the NYT points out how pivotal today's meeting is:</p><p>  The presentation of the draft agreement is a moment of truth for Mrs. May, who is desperate to avoid a chaotic and disorderly ''no-deal'' Brexit. But she cannot be assured of support from hard-line Brexiteers in her cabinet, whom she may need to face down.</p><p>  If the deal is rejected today, Mrs. May's leadership could hang in the balance. If it passes, it still requires approval by E.U. officials at a meeting in Brussels later this month -- and would then be subject to a highly unpredictable Parliament vote.</p><p>  Follow how events play out today in the NYT's live briefing.</p><p>  More Brexit news: The departure could leave wedding bouquets stuck at the British border. But the supercar manufacturer McLaren is, unusually, increasing production capacity in Britain.</p><p>  Oil's plunge may roil the markets</p><p>  The price of oil continued to slide this morning, with Brent crude hitting $65 a barrel in London after falling 6.6 percent yesterday.</p><p>  There may be some technical trading issues at work here. But fundamentally, the markets worry that there's too much oil. ''When you put all these ingredients together, you have a recipe that's not really conducive to an $85 market environment,'' Michael Cohen, an oil analyst at Barclays, told the FT.</p><p>  Oil's drop has already had an effect on the stock markets, with energy stocks dragging down the S&amp;P 500 yesterday, and that could worsen today. But there's one potential upside for investors: Falling oil prices and a strengthening U.S. dollar may convince the Fed to pause its interest rate increases.</p><p>  Coming up</p><p>  Jay Powell discusses the U.S. and the global economy. A Q. and A. with the Fed chairman, organized by the Dallas Fed (watch it here at 6 p.m. Eastern), could provide hints about the central bank's future monetary policy.</p><p>  The Labor Department publishes October consumer price data. The Consumer Price Index rose by just 0.1 percent in September, suggesting that inflation was being kept in check. Analysts anticipate a 0.3 percent rise for October.</p><p>SoftBank gives WeWork a huge cash boost</p><p>  The Japanese conglomerate will invest $3 billion in WeWork, giving the co-working start-up more money to expand -- even as its losses continue to grow.</p><p>SoftBank's new cash solidifies its status as WeWork's single biggest financial backer, and gives the eight-year-old start-up a valuation of at least $42 billion. More important, it will help the company offer more desks for rent around the world.</p><p>  The cash comes at a crucial time: WeWork disclosed that it had lost $1.22 billion so far this year. The company says it still needs to spend on growth, but it could eventually focus on turning a profit. If, or when, it decides to go public, that could become vital.</p><p>CNN sues the White House for banning its reporter</p><p>CNN filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration yesterday, arguing that its withholding of press credentials for the correspondent Jim Acosta violated the Constitution. More from Mike Grynbaum of the NYT:</p><p>  ''While the suit is specific to CNN and Acosta, this could have happened to anyone,'' CNN said in a statement. ''If left unchallenged, the actions of the White House would create a dangerous chilling effect for any journalist who covers our elected officials.''</p><p>  The Trump administration plans to fight back. But Floyd Abrams, a First Amendment lawyer who represented the NYT during the Pentagon Papers case, told Politico, ''I can't think of anything that is likely to lead to a victory for the White House.''</p><p>  Yet Noah Feldman of Bloomberg Opinion says that, politically, Mr. Trump has already won by undercutting the news media.</p><p>  Innovation may be needed to maintain America's national security</p><p>  The National Defense Strategy Commission said in a report published yesterday that the ''security and well-being of the United States are at greater risk than at any time in decades.'' The panel urged Congress to act:</p><p>  Rivals and adversaries are challenging the United States on many fronts and in many domains. America's ability to defend its allies, its partners, and its own vital interests is increasingly in doubt. If the nation does not act promptly to remedy these circumstances, the consequences will be grave and lasting.</p><p>  The commission noted that authoritarian nations like China and Russia were seeking ''the means to project power globally,'' and added that ''the proliferation of advanced technology is allowing more actors to contest U.S. military power in more threatening ways.''</p><p>  Its report suggested a number of priorities for Congress. Its conclusion: ''Innovations in operational concepts and leap-ahead technologies are vital to sustaining U.S. military advantages'' in the long term.</p><p>  More security news: Another report, by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, warned that China's tech industry also threatens U.S. national security.</p><p>  Revolving door</p><p>  Binny Bansal stepped down as the C.E.O. of Flipkart after an investigation into an allegation of personal misconduct.</p><p>  The English Premier League hired Susanna Dinnage from Discovery Communications as the soccer league's first new C.E.O. in two decades.</p><p>  Gavin Darby will step down as C.E.O. of Premier Foods amid pressure from the activist investor Oasis Management.</p><p>Starbucks will lay off 5 percent of its corporate work force.</p><p>  The meal-kit company Blue Apron plans to lay off 4 percent of its employees.</p><p>  The speed read</p><p>  Deals</p><p>   G.E. will sell part of its stake in the oil field services company Baker Hughes for about $4 billion.

Breaking: The owner of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">offered to buy the London Stock Exchange</url> for nearly $37 billion. (Was this email forwarded to you?       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">Sign up here</url>.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apple shows it\u2019s serious about online video</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The tech giant is known for orchestrating its product announcements around coordinated surprise, but a genuine stunner came Tuesday when it revealed the price for its new Apple TV Plus streaming service: $5 a month, our colleague Ed Lee reports for us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It surely grabbed the attention of Netflix and Disney, since the price undercuts their offerings, and their investors. Shares in both companies fell more than 2 percent after the announcement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many had speculated that Apple wasn\u2019t serious about media, and that the billions it was spending on content was really just marketing. The thinking was that the streaming service would be made free to anyone with an Apple device, as a way to stoke iPhone sales. (As it turns out, you\u2019ll get one free year if you buy a new laptop or iPhone.)</p><p>But a $5 price tag means Apple is serious about making streaming a real business. (Perhaps the enticement of a year\u2019s worth of free access with the purchase of a new device shows that Apple wants it both ways.)</p><p>Other streaming services look like the cable guys now:</p><p>Netflix, which became the king of streaming because of its low-cost plans, now charges $13 a month for its standard offering.</p><p>Hulu\u2019s commercial-free product costs $12 a month, while its ad-supported one costs $6.</p><p> AT&amp;amp;T is in a bind when it comes to pricing its HBO Max service, because of existing pricing agreements with pay-TV providers.</p><p>Disney\u2019s offering will cost $7 a month, or slightly less if you buy a year\u2019s worth in advance.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">Here\u2019s what else</url>Apple introduced yesterday:</p><p> Three new iPhones, including two \u201cPro\u201d models with three upgraded cameras</p><p> A new Apple Watch with an always-on screen</p><p> A new iPad that will cost $329</p><p> A new gaming streaming service that will cost $5 a month</p><p>____________________________</p><p>Today\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Lindsey Underwood in London.</p><p>____________________________</p><p>Europe\u2019s top antitrust cop is getting a bigger job</p><p>As the E.U.\u2019s competition commissioner for the past five years, Margrethe Vestager was a major scourge of Silicon Valley. Now she is poised to gain even more power by essentially <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">becoming Europe\u2019s digital czar</url>, Matina Stevis-Gridneff of the NYT writes.</p><p>Ms. Vestager\u2019s new role combines digital regulation and antitrust enforcement.

It\u2019s a huge move that could reshape the modern work force \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">and will affect gig-economy companies in particular</url>, according to Kate Conger and Noam Scheiber of the NYT.</p><p>Treating them as employees could raise costs by up to 30 percent over all, companies have estimated.</p><p>Uber and Lyft have warned that they will have to start scheduling drivers if they\u2019re employees. That would reduce drivers\u2019 ability to work when and where they want \u2014 though experts say that nothing in California\u2019s bill requires set shifts.</p><p>In practice, the companies might limit how many drivers can work during slow periods or in less-busy markets. That could mean needing fewer drivers.</p><p>But they might be better off continuing to rely on incentives like bonus pay to ensure that enough drivers are on the road to meet customer demand more nimbly than if they relied on scheduled shifts, according to Veena Dubal, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law.</p><p> And the fight against the new rules isn\u2019t over. Uber, Lyft and DoorDash have pledged to spend $90 million on a ballot initiative that would basically exempt them from the legislation.</p><p>WeWork may change its structure to save its I.P.O.</p><p>The co-working company is reportedly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">considering changes to its corporate governance</url> to make itself more attractive to potential investors in its I.P.O., after it faced a cool reception to the stock sale, Bloomberg reports, citing unnamed sources.</p><p>It isn\u2019t clear what those might be. Many investors worry about the huge amount of control that Adam Neumann, WeWork\u2019s co-founder, wields: He\u2019s chairman and C.E.O., and he controls the company by owning special classes of stock. (The company has already added a woman to its board and made Mr. Neumann refund the company a payment for a trademark.)</p><p>And it isn\u2019t certain that such changes would be enough to prop up the deal. Investor response has been largely cool to the proposed I.P.O. because of concerns about valuation and corporate governance, forcing WeWork\u2019s bankers to suggest cutting the company\u2019s valuation to as low as $15 billion, from $47 billion in January.</p><p>That uncertainty has shown up in WeWork\u2019s bonds, whose prices <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">dropped as much as 3 cents on the dollar</url> yesterday after reports that a major investor in the company, SoftBank, has been urging a delay for the I.P.O.</p><p>WeWork may proceed with a road show for investors as early as next week, with an aim to have its shares trading on a public stock market by Sept. 27, before Rosh Hashana. (Mr. Neumann reportedly wants to observe the holiday in compliance with Jewish orthodoxy, according to Bloomberg.)</p><p>More: WeWork\u2019s latest potential headache is that landlords are trying to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">copy its business</url>.</p><p>Lending practices in New York\u2019s taxi industry are under scrutiny</p><p>Federal prosecutors have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">opened an investigation</url> into possible lending fraud in the New York City taxi industry, Brian Rosenthal of the NYT writes, citing unnamed sources.</p><p> \u201cIn the past month, agents have interviewed cabdrivers who said they were encouraged to take on massive debt under exploitative terms in order to buy a taxi medallion, the city permit that allowed them to own their own cab.\u201d</p><p> The investigation \u201cappears to be looking at possible crimes including bank, wire or mail fraud,\u201d and could have far-reaching consequences for the city\u2019s taxi industry, \u201cwhich has been engulfed in a financial crisis and rocked by a string of suicides among cabdrivers.\u201d</p><p> \u201cMore than 950 drivers have filed for bankruptcy, and many more are still buried in overwhelming debt today.\u201d</p><p>The federal investigation follows <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">Mr. Rosenthal\u2019s reporting</url> on the taxi medallion industry.</p><p>Jamie Dimon is preparing for a world of 0% interest</p><p>As the Fed appears prepared to cut interest rates again, the C.E.O. of JPMorgan Chase is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">getting ready for something that was unthinkable</url> only a few years ago: interest rates in the U.S. dropping to zero.</p><p>Mr. Dimon doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily likely, David Benoit of the WSJ writes. Although the Fed is expected to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point this month, that would take the rate down to 1.75 percent. It would take a lot to get to nil.</p><p>A rate of zero might mean that JPMorgan would introduce more fees and charges to make up for the lost interest on loans. Banks like his would also have to grapple with whether to charge customers for deposits, something the U.S. hasn\u2019t had to deal with in recent memory.</p><p>European banks <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">have already struggled</url> with this problem, since rates in countries like Germany and France dropped below zero. C.E.O.s there have complained about that for some time: \u201cThe interest-rate policy is an enormous burden,\u201d Christian Sewing of Deutsche Bank said last month.</p><p>Their woes may deepen. The European Central Bank begins two days of policy meetings today, and as it weighs more economic stimulus measures, it\u2019s unlikely to raise its deposit rate above minus 0.4 percent.</p><p>Revolving door</p><p>Credit Suisse has hired Kinner Lakhani from Deutsche Bank as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">its head of group strategy and development</url>.</p><p>Eric Vallat is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">stepping down</url> as the head of fashion and accessories at Richemont, the Swiss luxury conglomerate, after a little more than a year in the role.</p><p>The research analysts Rich Greenfield, Walt Piecyk and Brandon Ross have left the brokerage BTIG to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">start their own research firm</url>, LightShed Partners.</p><p>Charles Schwab reportedly plans to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">lay off about 600 people</url>, mainly from its retail division, as early as next week.</p><p>Uber has cut <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">435 members of its product and engineering teams</url> to eliminate costs and streamline its operations.</p><p>The speed read</p><p>Deals</p><p>Elliott Management\u2019s criticisms of AT&amp;amp;T <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/london-stock-exchange-hong-kong.html\">raise questions</url> about the telecom giant\u2019s plan to become a media empire.

Stocks leapt yesterday, with the S&amp;amp;P 500 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/business/sp-3000.html\">briefly trading above 3,000</url> for the first time. The index is up nearly 20 percent this year and is enjoying one of the longest bull markets on record.</p><p>\u201cThat the Fed is considering a rate cut at a moment when the United States economy is strong and job market gains are solid underscores Mr. Powell and his colleagues\u2019 concern about the future of a record economic expansion,\u201d Ms. Smialek and Mr. Phillips write.</p><p>Can\u2019t square a looming recession with surging stock prices? Let Mr. Phillips explain:</p><p> Rate cuts \u201clower the returns on new investments in bonds, the main alternative to stocks for many investors. That makes stocks look more attractive to investors.\u201d</p><p> \u201cA rate cut also makes it cheaper for consumers and companies to borrow, and that can buck up economic activity and help corporate profits.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s one big uncertainty: how far cuts may have to go. Mr. Powell is \u201cknee-deep into the relatively uncharted waters of easing monetary policy to nip possible economic damage in the bud rather than to tackle an actual slump,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e69f980-a364-11e9-974c-ad1c6ab5efd1?dlbk\">James Politi and Colby Smith of the FT write</url>. \u201cSo the central bank risks a big backlash if it does not deliver the rate cuts that are baked into expectations.\u201d</p><p>More: Mr. Powell said that he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/10/fed-chief-powell-says-he-would-not-resign-if-asked-by-president-trump.html?dlbk\">would not resign</url> if asked to do so by President Trump; explained why a return to the gold standard could       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/10/feds-powell-explains-why-a-return-to-the-gold-standard-would-be-so-damaging-to-the-economy.html?dlbk\">damage the economy</url>; and said he had \u201c      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/technology/fed-chair-facebook-cryptocurrency-libra.html\">serious concerns</url>\u201d about Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency project. </p><p>Jeffrey Epstein probably isn\u2019t a billionaire</p><p>Prosecutors and news accounts have described the financier as a man with \u201cnearly infinite means.\u201d But Mr. Epstein\u2019s wealth was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/business/jeffrey-epstein-net-worth.html?dlbk\">not nearly that vast</url>, according to the NYT.</p><p>Sure, Mr. Epstein was undoubtedly rich. His Manhattan townhouse is one of New York City\u2019s most expensive homes; he owns a sprawling estate in Palm Beach, Fla., and a private island (with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffrey-epstein-private-island-temple-2019-7?dlbk\">a mysterious temple-like structure</url>).

That could help delay new tariffs, and give more time to find common ground.</p><p> Somewhere in the middle is Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump\u2019s top economic adviser. He said yesterday that \u201cthere\u2019s a good possibility that we can make a deal\u201d and added that Mr. Trump is \u201copen to it.\u201d But he also called Beijing \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/larry-kudlow-voices-skepticism-over-trump-xi-trade-meeting-1543342604\">resistant to change</url>,\u201d and said it was up to Mr. Xi to \u201cstep up and come up with new ideas.\u201d</p><p>Why G.M. might not let Trump steer</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1067494680416407552?dlbk\">President Trump tweeted yesterday</url> that he may end government subsidies to the carmaker after it decided to idle five North American factories, laying off thousands of workers, while continuing to manufacture in Mexico and China.</p><p>Mr. Trump promised to fight for U.S. auto jobs. So he\u2019s considering cutting government credits that help G.M. develop electric vehicles, in the hope that it convinces the company to keep its plants in Ohio and Michigan.</p><p>But that\u2019s much less scary to G.M. than the forces behind its decision, which include <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e2f81ca-f1ed-11e8-ae55-df4bf40f9d0d?dlbk\">tumbling passenger-car sales and the president\u2019s own metals tariffs</url>.

Some highlights:</p><p> \u201cWe have damaged public trust through some of the actions we\u2019ve taken,\u201d Mr. Allan said. He repeated variations of the apology several times.</p><p> Damian Collins, a British lawmaker investigating Facebook over fake news, said he had reviewed an email in a cache of seized documents that suggested a company engineer had highlighted suspicious Russian-linked data harvesting on its platform in 2014, two years before the interference around the last presidential election.</p><p>Facebook responded that \u201cthe engineer who had flagged those initial concerns subsequently looked into this further and found no evidence of specific Russian activity.\u201d</p><p> Mr. Collins said he hoped to release the internal Facebook documents within the \u201cnext week or so,\u201d after they have been vetted.</p><p>More Facebook news: An ex-employee says it has a \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/27/tech/facebook-mark-luckie/index.html\">black people problem</url>.\u201d</p><p>Coming up: All eyes on the Fed</p><p>Later today, the Fed will issue its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-reserve-to-begin-publishing-financial-stability-report-1541799312\">first financial stability report</url>, an assessment of the country\u2019s potential \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d based on indicators like bank loans and household borrowing. It will also publish minutes from its meeting last month. (The Fed\u2019s vice chairman, Richard Clarida, said yesterday that the central bank plans to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-vice-chairman-richard-clarida-says-inflation-appears-contained-despite-robust-economic-growth-1543325696\">keep raising short-term rates gradually</url>, which implies a December move. But Nick Timiraos of the WSJ suggests       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wide-open-outlook-for-fed-rate-policy-in-2019-1543314600?mod=hp_lead_pos3\">the era of steady raises will end soon</url>.)</p><p>But the day\u2019s most tantalizing event will be a speech by the Fed\u2019s chairman, Jay Powell, at the Economic Club of New York. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.tv/l/PrHL/2018/11/27/fed-chair-jerome-powell-speaks-at-economic-club-of-new-york\">Watch it here</url> at noon Eastern.) Yesterday, President Trump continued attacking the central bank in public,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-slams-fed-chair-questions-climate-change-and-threatens-to-cancel-putin-meeting-in-wide-ranging-interview-with-the-post/2018/11/27/4362fae8-f26c-11e8-aeea-b85fd44449f5_story.html?dlbk\">telling the WaPo</url>, \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the Fed. So far, I\u2019m not even a little bit happy with my selection of Jay.\u201d How will Mr. Powell react?</p><p>Microsoft\u2019s revival is making it more valuable than Apple</p><p>For the second day in a row, Microsoft briefly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-closes-in-on-apple-as-worlds-most-valuable-company-1543355346?dlbk\">overtook Apple</url> to become world\u2019s most valuable company \u2014 a spot it last held over a decade ago. The back-and-forth highlights how much Microsoft has recovered after years of stagnation, and how rocky Apple\u2019s future looks.</p><p>Under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/619d0834-f1ed-11e8-ae55-df4bf40f9d0d?dlbk\">prospered by focusing on cloud computing</url>, which appears poised to overtake smartphones as tech\u2019s most important growth area. It\u2019s a sector that Goldman Sachs says could be worth $650 billion, and where Microsoft is second only to Amazon. The main worry is potential regulation, given the two companies control about 70 percent of the cloud infrastructure market.</p><p>Meanwhile, Apple\u2019s shares <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/business/dealbook/apple-microsoft-stock.html?dlbk\">have fallen 20 percent</url> over the past month. Investors have worried about weak demand for the latest iPhones, and President Trump hasn\u2019t helped by talking about tariffs on Apple\u2019s imports from China. It\u2019s unclear how the company\u2019s outlook will improve in the short term, and that may cost it stock-market bragging rights.</p><p>M.&amp;amp;A. may not be so bad after all</p><p>Big takeovers helped companies outperform the MSCI World stock index over the past decade, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.willistowerswatson.com/en/press/2018/11/deal-makers-beat-the-market-over-the-last-ten-years-underlining-mna-success-as-a-growth-strategy?dlbk\">a new study</url> by the consultancy Willis Towers Watson and Cass Business School. That contradicts a longstanding consensus that M.&amp;amp;A. destroys value for shareholders. But, as the study shows, some deals are better than others:</p><p> Those over $10 billion were the best performers, outpacing the MSCI index by 4.3 percentage points. Transactions between $100 million and $1 billion barely beat the index.</p><p> Tech and telecom deals performed worst, with acquirers lagging by up to 1.5 percentage points. Companies in the materials and consumer staples market did the best, coming in up to 5.6 percentage points over the index.</p><p> Asian deal-makers beat their regional index the most, by 8.3 percentage points. American acquirers did so by just 1.5 percentage points.</p><p>Betting on a climate crisis</p><p>Late last week, the Trump administration issued a report with a stark warning: Left unchecked, climate change could erase 10 percent off the size of the American economy by 2100.</p><p>Investments could reduce that hit. The economic impact of climate change drops by up to 70 percent if greenhouse-gas emissions peak before the middle of the century and then fall. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/business/dealbook/climate-change-investment-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\">Breakingviews calculates</url> that \u201cfully decarbonizing the world\u2019s cement, steel, plastics, trucking, shipping and aviation sectors by 2050 could require investing some 0.5 percent of global G.D.P. a year,\u201d but adds that \u201cit would bring efficiencies, employment and advances in technology that could more than offset the costs.\u201d</p><p>Some politicians are seizing the opportunity. Today, the E.U. will <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1323840-f253-11e8-ae55-df4bf40f9d0d\">publish a road map</url> for tackling climate change. It will show that cutting carbon emissions to zero in Europe by 2050 could require annual investments of as much as \u20ac290 billion, or about $330 billion. \u201cWe are an early mover, showing the rest of the world how this can be done,\u201d said Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the E.U.\u2019s commissioner for climate action and energy.</p><p>President Trump is not.

It's Anyone's Guess</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good Wednesday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mixed trade messages from the White House </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Right now, it is anyone's guess what might happen when <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>President Xi Jinping </nameText></person>of China talk at the Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires this weekend:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">   On the one hand, Mr. Trump has said it's ''highly unlikely'' that he would delay or suspend his plan to raise his tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, currently 10 percent, to 25 percent next year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">   On the other, unidentified American officials told the NYT that Mr. Trump is increasingly worried about how a prolonged trade war would affect the financial markets and the broader economy. That could help delay new tariffs, and give more time to find common ground.</p><p>   Somewhere in the middle is Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump's top economic adviser. He said yesterday that ''there's a good possibility that we can make a deal'' and added that Mr. Trump is ''open to it.'' But he also called Beijing ''resistant to change,'' and said it was up to Mr. Xi to ''step up and come up with new ideas.''</p><p>  Why G.M. might not let Trump steer</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>tweeted yesterday that he may end government subsidies to the carmaker after it decided to idle five North American factories, laying off thousands of workers, while continuing to manufacture in Mexico and China.</p><p>  Mr. Trump promised to fight for U.S. auto jobs. So he's considering cutting government credits that help G.M. develop electric vehicles, in the hope that it convinces the company to keep its plants in Ohio and Michigan.</p><p>  But that's much less scary to G.M. than the forces behind its decision, which include tumbling passenger-car sales and the president's own metals tariffs. And who'd quit China when it's the world's biggest car market?</p><p>  The WSJ editorial board warned the president to tread carefully: ''If he intervenes to make G.M. less competitive, Mr. Trump will merely hurt more workers.''</p><p>  And there's something else that might get the factories back open: G.M.'s looking to negotiate wage cuts with the United Auto Workers union.</p><p>  Mark Zuckerberg was a no-show for lawmakers in London</p><p>  Politicians from nine countries sat down in London yesterday to examine Facebook's business practices, leaving an empty chair for Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>  Instead, lawmakers from Britain, Canada, France, Belgium and beyond grilled Richard Allan, Facebook's vice president for policy solutions. Some highlights:</p><p>   ''We have damaged public trust through some of the actions we've taken,'' Mr. Allan said. He repeated variations of the apology several times.</p><p>   Damian Collins, a British lawmaker investigating Facebook over fake news, said he had reviewed an email in a cache of seized documents that suggested a company engineer had highlighted suspicious Russian-linked data harvesting on its platform in 2014, two years before the interference around the last presidential election.</p><p>Facebook responded that ''the engineer who had flagged those initial concerns subsequently looked into this further and found no evidence of specific Russian activity.''</p><p>   Mr. Collins said he hoped to release the internal Facebook documents within the ''next week or so,'' after they have been vetted.</p><p>  More Facebook news: An ex-employee says it has a ''black people problem.''</p><p>  Coming up: All eyes on the Fed</p><p>  Later today, the Fed will issue its first financial stability report, an assessment of the country's potential ''vulnerabilities'' based on indicators like bank loans and household borrowing. It will also publish minutes from its meeting last month. (The Fed's vice chairman, Richard Clarida, said yesterday that the central bank plans to keep raising short-term rates gradually, which implies a December move. But Nick Timiraos of the WSJ suggests the era of steady raises will end soon.)</p><p>  But the day's most tantalizing event will be a speech by the Fed's chairman, Jay Powell, at the Economic Club of New York. (Watch it here at noon Eastern.) Yesterday, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>continued attacking the central bank in public, telling the WaPo, ''I'm not happy with the Fed. So far, I'm not even a little bit happy with my selection of Jay.'' How will Mr. Powell react?</p><p>Microsoft's revival is making it more valuable than Apple</p><p>  For the second day in a row, Microsoft briefly overtook Apple to become world's most valuable company -- a spot it last held over a decade ago. The back-and-forth highlights how much Microsoft has recovered after years of stagnation, and how rocky Apple's future looks.</p><p>  Under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has prospered by focusing on cloud computing, which appears poised to overtake smartphones as tech's most important growth area. It's a sector that Goldman Sachs says could be worth $650 billion, and where Microsoft is second only to Amazon. The main worry is potential regulation, given the two companies control about 70 percent of the cloud infrastructure market.</p><p>  Meanwhile, Apple's shares have fallen 20 percent over the past month. Investors have worried about weak demand for the latest iPhones, and <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>hasn't helped by talking about tariffs on Apple's imports from China. It's unclear how the company's outlook will improve in the short term, and that may cost it stock-market bragging rights.</p><p>  M.&amp;A. may not be so bad after all</p><p>  Big takeovers helped companies outperform the MSCI World stock index over the past decade, according to a new study by the consultancy Willis Towers Watson and Cass Business School. That contradicts a longstanding consensus that M.&amp;A. destroys value for shareholders. But, as the study shows, some deals are better than others:</p><p>   Those over $10 billion were the best performers, outpacing the MSCI index by 4.3 percentage points. Transactions between $100 million and $1 billion barely beat the index.</p><p>   Tech and telecom deals performed worst, with acquirers lagging by up to 1.5 percentage points. Companies in the materials and consumer staples market did the best, coming in up to 5.6 percentage points over the index.</p><p>   Asian deal-makers beat their regional index the most, by 8.3 percentage points. American acquirers did so by just 1.5 percentage points.</p><p>  Betting on a climate crisis</p><p>  Late last week, the Trump administration issued a report with a stark warning: Left unchecked, climate change could erase 10 percent off the size of the American economy by 2100.</p><p>  Investments could reduce that hit. The economic impact of climate change drops by up to 70 percent if greenhouse-gas emissions peak before the middle of the century and then fall. Breakingviews calculates that ''fully decarbonizing the world's cement, steel, plastics, trucking, shipping and aviation sectors by 2050 could require investing some 0.5 percent of global G.D.P. a year,'' but adds that ''it would bring efficiencies, employment and advances in technology that could more than offset the costs.''</p><p>  Some politicians are seizing the opportunity. Today, the E.U. will publish a road map for tackling climate change. It will show that cutting carbon emissions to zero in Europe by 2050 could require annual investments of as much as ?290 billion, or about $330 billion. ''We are an early mover, showing the rest of the world how this can be done,'' said Miguel Arias Ca\u00f1ete, the E.U.'s commissioner for climate action and energy.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is not. His response to his own administration's report: ''I don't believe it.''</p><p>  The U.S. busted a global ad fraud ring</p><p>  The Justice Department indicted eight men yesterday for running a fraud scheme that it says posed a huge risk to the entire digital ad industry. F.B.I. agents investigated the operation, code-named ''3ve,'' after being tipped off by Google and the bot-detection consultancy White Ops.</p><p>  More from Craig Silverman of BuzzFeed News on the scale of the fraud:</p><p>  At its peak, 3ve involved about 1.7 million PCs infected with malware, an array of servers that could generate mountains of fake traffic with bots, roughly 5,000 counterfeit websites created to impersonate legitimate web publishers, and over 60,000 accounts with digital advertising companies to help fraudsters receive ad placements and get paid. The indictment also alleges the fraudsters created their own advertising networks to help facilitate the fraud.</p><p>  This complex infrastructure served one goal: steal as much money as possible from the $250 billion global digital ad industry while avoiding detection.</p><p>  Revolving door</p><p>  Robert Sauerberg will step down as Cond\u00e9 Nast's C.E.O. as the publisher merges its U.S. and international arms.</p><p>  Mark Clouse, a former C.E.O. of Pinnacle Foods, is reportedly the top choice to lead Campbell Soup.</p><p>  Sylvie Matherat, Deutsche Bank's chief regulatory officer, and Tom Patrick, its Americas C.E.O., may depart.</p><p>  The stock-trading platform Robinhood hired Jason Warnick from Amazon as its first C.F.O.</p><p>Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company spun out from Google, hired Amee Chande, a former Alibaba executive, as its chief commercial officer, and Deborah Hersman, once head of the National Transportation Safety Board, as chief safety officer.</p><p>  The speed read</p><p>  Deals</p><p>   Nelson Peltz's Trian investment firm has reportedly decided not to bid for Papa John's.

Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google faced questions about their market power, perceived bias as gatekeepers of communication and, in Facebook\u2019s case, plans to reshape the financial industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Perhaps the most revealing hearing was before the House Judiciary Committee, where a subcommittee on antitrust gave the best look yet at how lawmakers are thinking about capping Big Tech\u2019s market power, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/technology/big-tech-antitrust-hearing.html\">Steve Lohr, Mike Isaac and Nathaniel Popper of the NYT write</url>. Most of the questions were for Amazon and Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Representative David Cicilline, the Democratic head of the subcommittee, pushed them on whether tech companies\u2019 marketplaces \u2014 for goods, software apps and online ads \u2014 give them an unfair advantage over rivals who rely on those marketplaces to distribute their own products or services.</p><p> Representative Joe Neguse, Democrat of Colorado, zeroed in on their M.&amp;amp;A. He pointed out that Facebook owns four of the world\u2019s six largest social networks (itself, along with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp). \u201cWe have a word for that,\u201d Mr. Neguse said. \u201cIt is called monopoly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hearing performances were a telling moment, showing the rising force of the backlash against the tech giants,\u201d Mr. Lohr, Mr. Isaac and Mr. Popper write. \u201cNot long ago revered as treasures of American capitalism, they are now targets of political attacks from both parties, growing public criticism and regulatory scrutiny.\u201d</p><p>More: Google said it had officially scrapped its China search engine project, code-named Dragonfly. And the E.U. is reportedly set to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1388c544-a812-11e9-984c-fac8325aaa04\">begin a formal antitrust investigation</url> into Amazon\u2019s dual role as seller and market platform. </p><p>Facebook\u2019s biggest problem with Libra? Itself</p><p>Lawmakers made one thing clear at a Senate Banking Committee hearing yesterday: The largest roadblock to Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency plans is the company\u2019s reputation, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/technology/facebook-libra-congress.html\">Mike Isaac and Nathaniel Popper of the NYT write</url>.</p><p>The hearing began with a stinging critique by Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio:</p><p>\u201cLike a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the house over and over, and called every arson a learning experience. We would be crazy to give them a chance to experiment with people\u2019s bank accounts, and to use powerful tools they don\u2019t understand, like monetary policy.\u201d</p><p>Things didn\u2019t get much better as David Marcus, who leads Facebook\u2019s cryptocurrency initiative, was questioned for more than two hours. Lawmakers brought up many of Facebook\u2019s missteps \u2014 including data privacy and Russian interference \u2014 to highlight concerns about the company\u2019s entry into finance.</p><p>Libra critics are now lining up. In the last week alone, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, President Trump and the Fed chairman, Jay Powell, have all raised concerns about the project.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Mr. Marcus struck a conciliatory tone. \u201cWe\u2019ve made mistakes in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been working, and are working hard to get better.\u201d</p><p> But when asked by Mr. Brown whether lawmakers could persuade Facebook to scrap Libra, Mr. Marcus said only that the company wouldn\u2019t move ahead until regulators\u2019 concerns were addressed.</p><p>Libra faces another grilling today as Facebook officials appear before the House Financial Services Committee <url normalizedValue=\"https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=404001\">at 10 a.m. Eastern</url>.</p><p>More: Facebook is said to have briefed government agencies on its Libra plans last month, but the meeting reportedly only amplified concerns that the company wasn\u2019t more prepared to address major issues.</p><p>Trump\u2019s unintended power over the Fed</p><p>President Trump has repeatedly and publicly tried to jawbone the Fed into lowering interest rates. But he may have found a better way to make that happen, Jeanna Smialek of the NYT writes: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/business/federal-reserve-trump.html?dlbk\">his own policies</url>.</p><p>It\u2019s an odd time for the Fed to cut rates, given <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-retail-sales-rose-solidly-in-june-11563280383?dlbk\">signs of strength in the U.S. economy</url>. Retail sales in June were strong, and manufacturing activity has picked up.</p><p>But Mr. Trump\u2019s trade wars have undermined the global economy, which is now struggling with China\u2019s slowdown and a drop-off in manufacturing.</p><p>Economic uncertainties \u201chave increased,\u201d especially around trade, Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, said at a conference in Paris yesterday. He said the central bank would \u201cact as appropriate to sustain the expansion.\u201d</p><p>So that, rather than Mr. Trump\u2019s badgering, could force the Fed\u2019s hand to cut rates, Ms. Smialek writes. Investors certainly seem to think the central bank will act that way, if pricing in federal funds futures markets is anything to go by. (The central bank\u2019s pre-meeting quiet period starts Saturday, so its chances to change that perception are increasingly limited.)</p><p>Three takeaways from bank earnings season</p><p>Many of Wall Street\u2019s top banks have reported their second-quarter results this week, and the news has been largely positive. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned so far.</p><p>Trading is mostly in a funk. Both <url normalizedValue=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/citibank-reports-q2-earnings-after-warning-on-trading-revenue-120144917.html?dlbk\">Citigroup</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-chase-reports-rising-profit-11563274861?dlbk\">JPMorgan Chase</url> reported disappointing trading revenue, reflecting a prolonged slump in what had been Wall Street\u2019s most profitable business.

That\u2019s enough for scientific research or medical applications.\u201d</p><p> \u201cThe company is hoping to begin working with human subjects as soon as the second quarter of next year.\u201d</p><p> The company said it could \u201chelp humans with an array of ailments, like helping amputees regain mobility or helping people hear, speak and see.\u201d</p><p> One of Neuralink\u2019s biggest challenges will be living up to Mr. Musk\u2019s grand vision. \u201cIndependent scientists cautioned that results from laboratory animals might not translate into human success and that human trials would be required to determine the technology\u2019s promise,\u201d Mr. Markoff notes.</p><p>Why midsize cities can\u2019t catch up with mega-rivals</p><p>Winston-Salem, N.C., has ambitions to become a center of biotech research. But so far that dream hasn\u2019t been realized \u2014 and it raises questions about whether midsize cities can <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/business/economy/winston-salem-convergence.html?dlbk\">ever grow into thriving metropolises</url>, Eduardo Porter of the NYT writes.</p><p>The post-World War II model is broken. Before, smaller cities were able to catch up by becoming manufacturing centers. But in the age of tech, it\u2019s harder to keep up with Silicon Valley and New York.</p><p>Blame a variety of factors. Today\u2019s economy doesn\u2019t really value the kind of cheaper labor that such cities traditionally boasted of. Employers are instead setting up in centers with highly educated workers, and that kick-starts a virtuous circle of more amenities and funding, and then more workers. It\u2019s harder for midsize cities to compete.</p><p>Winston-Salem\u2019s failed bid for Amazon\u2019s HQ2 is a case study of how that looks in practice. \u201cIf you go down the Amazon checklist, it requires all the things that we don\u2019t have,\u201d Koleman Strumpf, an economics professor at Wake Forest University, which is in Winston-Salem, told Mr. Porter. \u201cWe don\u2019t have mass transit. No Amtrak. No good airports. It\u2019s not a walkable city. It doesn\u2019t have great amenities.\u201d</p><p>How North Korea gets its luxury cars</p><p>Kim Jong-un, the country\u2019s leader, has some serious wheels: top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benzes and Rolls Royces.

''It's just any excuse is an excuse to sell.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  And there's a long list of excuses to pick from. Here are several worth singling out: New U.S.-China tensions after a fresh batch of hacking indictments (more on that below); a malaise over the Fed's rate increases; technology stocks falling out of favor; the threat of a government shutdown; and the persistent slump in oil prices.</p><p>  This upheaval is ''of a magnitude on par with the two biggest market crashes of the past four decades,'' according to Bloomberg. Nearly two-fifths of equities on the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange are at 52-week lows, it reports. The proportion was higher only during the Black Monday crash of 1987 and in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>  There's little hope in sight. Asian markets followed U.S. markets down in trading today, and futures markets suggest Wall Street could open lower again.</p><p>   U.S. accuses China of cyberespionage</p><p>  The Justice Department has accused two Chinese citizens with ties to the Ministry of State Security in Beijing of infiltrating huge corporate and government computer systems in the U.S., write David E. Sanger and Katie Benner of the NYT.</p><p>  While officials haven't identified the companies compromised, unidentified sources tell Reuters and the WSJ that IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are among them. The government said that aviation, telecommunications, pharmaceutical and satellite companies had been affected, as well as government agencies including the Navy and NASA. China denies involvement.</p><p>  The charges are about China advancing its power. ''The indictment unsealed on Thursday describes the broad outlines of what it calls a yearslong campaign by China to steal American technological secrets in a range of industries to allow Beijing's companies to undercut international competitors and help its military erode the United States' defensive edge,'' Mr. Sanger and Ms. Benner write.</p><p>  The indictment will most likely ratchet up tensions. It comes on the back of the U.S. helping to coordinate the arrest of Huawei's C.F.O., and amid a tense trade dispute with China. Part of America's wishlist in trade negotiations is to end intellectual property theft, but it's unclear how these charges might affect negotiations.</p><p>  Carlos Ghosn won't be leaving jail just yet</p><p>  The former Nissan Motor chairman was arrested again by the Japanese authorities today, this time on suspicion that he shifted to the automaker more than $16 million in personal losses incurred a decade ago, writes Motoko Rich of the NYT:</p><p>   ''The authorities rearrested Mr. Ghosn on suspicion of breach of trust related to a financial investment that tumbled in value during the 2008 global financial crisis, according to the Japanese public broadcaster NHK.''</p><p>   ''The authorities said he had transferred the investment, a derivative contract, to Nissan from his personal asset management company.''</p><p>   ''The rearrest of Mr. Ghosn dealt a setback to his hopes for getting released from the Tokyo jail where he has been held for more than a month on different charges.''</p><p>   ''It also adds to the legal problems of an executive who once oversaw a sprawling automotive global empire that sold more than 10 million cars last year.''</p><p>  Europe suspects major banks of bond-rigging</p><p>  The European Commission suspects several major banks -- including Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole -- of price-rigging in the U.S. government-backed bond market, the WSJ reports.</p><p>  The ''preliminary view'' of regulators is that the banks ''exchanged commercially sensitive information and coordinated on prices'' in supranational, sub-sovereign and agency debt markets from 2009 to 2015, the FT writes. That breaches the E.U.'s antitrust rules.</p><p>  If they're found guilty, the banks could be fined as much as 10 percent of their annual global revenue. The FT notes that Deutsche Bank doesn't expect a fine, suggesting that it acted as a whistle-blower. The banks will now lay out their defenses.</p><p>  This isn't the first inquiry into the rigging of these markets,''the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority having also initiated investigations,'' writes the FT.</p><p>Apple's iPhone patent infringement woes worsen</p><p>  The latest development in the continuing legal battle between Apple and Qualcomm resulted in the iPhone maker taking the drastic step of removing devices from sale in some stores.</p><p>  A court in Germany has ruled that Apple infringed a Qualcomm patent and must stop selling the iPhone 7, 8 and X in that country. Apple said it would stop selling those devices in its German stores (third parties will still sell them), but that it plans to appeal the ruling.</p><p>  This is the second time in two weeks that a court has judged Apple to have infringed Qualcomm's patents. An injunction in China also calls for some older iPhones not to be sold in the country, although Apple has yet to withdraw the devices from the retail market and has instead released a software update to address concerns.</p><p>  And Apple is hurting. The company's stock is down more than 30 percent since the beginning of October after falling 2.5 percent yesterday on the news out of Germany. With its suppliers issuing profit warnings and President Trump warning that iPhones could be affected in a next round of tariffs, Apple is struggling to catch a break.</p><p>   Campaign seeks to stop Amazon from winning a $10 billion cloud contract</p><p>  Big Tech companies have been eyeing a juicy government contract for months now: The Pentagon wants to migrate its systems to the cloud, and it is prepared to pay one company $10 billion to make it happen. Amazon is the favorite to win the contract, but IBM, Microsoft and Oracle would all like a piece of the action. Now Bloomberg reports that a mystery client has created a dossier intended to change the course of the decision:</p><p>   ''One version of the dossier, which was obtained by Bloomberg, suggests that corporate executives, including one at Amazon, engaged in improper personal relationships and that Defense Department officials participated in shady activities, all of which gave Amazon an edge.''</p><p>   ''The document was shopped around by RosettiStarr, a Bethesda, Maryland-based private-investigations company, according to Nextgov, a government information-technology website owned by Atlantic Media Co. An article posted on the Nextgov website in August said RosettiStarr declined to reveal who paid for the dossier's compilation.''</p><p>   ''The document relies on photos, charts and public records in an attempt to portray a web of conflicts to cast doubt on the integrity of the cloud procurement. It does contain certain accurate information regarding connections between industry executives and Defense Department officials, but offers no real proof that those relationships corrupted the process.''</p><p>  How to cause holiday travel havoc? Launch a drone.</p><p>  Gatwick Airport, one of Britain's busiest transport hubs, was brought to a standstill for more than 32 hours by humble drones, write Benjamin Mueller and Amie Tsang of the NYT.</p><p>  ''At least 800 flights were canceled, disrupting traffic throughout Europe and affecting upward of 100,000 passengers. Arriving flights carrying 10,000 passengers were diverted, with some travelers forced to land at airports as far away as Paris,'' they write.</p><p>  Officials called it a ''deliberate act,'' and the airport finally reopened around 6 a.m. local time today. But the episode highlights how vulnerable airports across the world are to drones, and how hard it is to protect against the malicious use of new technologies.</p><p>  Could something similar happen in the U.S.? ''Yes, absolutely,'' Luke Fox, the founder and chief executive of WhiteFox, a drone airspace security company, told the NYT. ''People will unfortunately see this and recognize there's a vulnerability here.''</p><p>  Revolving door</p><p>Campbell Soup named Mark Clouse, the former head of Pinnacle Foods, as its new C.E.O.

Exhibit A: Nearly 200 corporate leaders \u2014 including Tim Cook of Apple, Ginny Rometty of IBM and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase \u2014 declared yesterday that companies shouldn\u2019t make shareholders their sole focus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For half a century, companies were mostly run for all stakeholders, Andrew notes. (That\u2019s how they\u2019re still run in much of Europe.) The economist Milton Friedman helped change that by declaring that businesses should focus solely on profits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cLayoffs increased, research and development budgets were cut, and pension programs were traded for 401(k)s\u201d as a result, Andrew adds. \u201cThere was a rush of mergers driven by \u2018cost savings\u2019 that grabbed headlines while profits soared and dividends increased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmericans mistrust companies,\u201d writes Andrew, \u201cto such an extent that the very idea of capitalism is now being debated on the political stage.\u201d And populism has been embraced by both ends of the political spectrum, from President Trump to Senator Bernie Sanders.</p><p>Now, companies <url normalizedValue=\"https://opportunity.businessroundtable.org/ourcommitment/\">should think beyond shareholders</url>, the Business Roundtable said yesterday, adding that they should also invest in their employees, protect the environment and deal fairly with suppliers. \u201cWe share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders,\u201d the group, which represents many of America\u2019s biggest companies, said. \u201cWe commit to deliver value to all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shift comes at a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/business/business-roundtable-ceos-corporations.html\">moment of increasing distress</url> in corporate America, as big companies face mounting global discontent over income inequality, harmful products and poor working conditions,\u201d David Gelles and David Yaffe-Bellany of the NYT write.</p><p>And there\u2019s reason to be skeptical. Not every member of the Business Roundtable signed on: Blackstone and G.E. were among the notable holdouts. And the WSJ editorial board <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-stakeholder-ceos-11566248641\">dismissed the move</url> as political spin that is unlikely to shield C.E.O.s from populist attacks.</p><p>The White House is worried about a recession</p><p>President Trump continues to boast that the U.S. economy is \u201cdoing tremendously.\u201d But in private, his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/business/trump-economy.html\">economic advisers are preparing options</url> to help prevent it from falling into a recession, Maggie Haberman, Jim Tankersley and Annie Karni of the NYT report.</p><p>Administration officials have explored cutting payroll taxes, which would immediately increase workers\u2019 paychecks, and lowering capital gains taxes. They\u2019ve also considered potentially reversing some of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs.</p><p>White House officials <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-19/white-house-dismisses-payroll-tax-cuts-as-slowdown-prevention\">dismissed a payroll tax cut</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-19/white-house-dismisses-payroll-tax-cuts-as-slowdown-prevention\"/>\u2014 for the moment. \u201cCutting payroll taxes is not something that is under consideration at this time,\u201d one told the NYT.</p><p>It\u2019s also unclear if such cuts would get political traction in Congress, since the Democratic-led House would be unlikely to agree to the idea in an election year.</p><p>But \u201cthat the White House is even discussing ways to stimulate an economy that Mr. Trump on Monday called \u2018very strong\u2019 underscores a growing concern in the administration about slowing economic growth,\u201d the NYT reports.</p><p>And Mr. Trump clearly worries about the economy, despite bragging about its current strength. <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1163472273388576768\">He tweeted yesterday</url> that the Fed should cut interest rates by at least one percentage point, \u201cwith perhaps some quantitative easing as well.\u201d</p><p>States are going after Big Tech, too</p><p>Attorneys general in more than a dozen states are preparing to begin an antitrust investigation into the tech giants, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/technology/state-ag-tech-investigations.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\">Steve Lohr of the NYT reports</url>, citing unnamed sources.</p><p> \u201cThe bipartisan group of attorneys general has not yet issued civilian subpoenas \u2014 known as civil investigative demands \u2014 to the companies. But state investigators plan to do so soon, though the precise timing is not yet set.\u201d</p><p> \u201cThe states can play a key role, often in concert with federal regulators and Congress, in building evidence and public support for major investigations.\u201d</p><p>They would join high-profile investigations by the Justice Department, the F.T.C. and Congress that are focused on potential antitrust violations by big tech companies.</p><p>But don\u2019t get carried away over how fast and fruitful these investigations might be.</p><p> \u201cMajor antitrust investigations can take years, whether they result in legal action or not,\u201d Mr. Lohr notes.</p><p> And Joseph Simons, the chairman of the F.T.C., <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/64e887f6-c2b8-11e9-a8e9-296ca66511c9\">warned the FT</url> that breaking up the big tech companies from companies they\u2019ve acquired could be difficult if \u201cthey\u2019re completely enmeshed.\u201d</p><p>Huawei gets another reprieve</p><p>The U.S. will allow American companies to continue doing business with the Chinese tech giant for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/us/politics/huawei-trump.html\">an additional 90 days</url>, Alan Rappeport of the NYT reports.</p><p> This is an extension of a three-month reprieve that was granted in May. American companies had complained that what amounted to a ban on buying goods from Huawei would be hard to comply with.</p><p> The move is meant to give rural U.S. telecom companies more time to wean themselves off Huawei hardware.</p><p> But the Commerce Department also said that it would add 46 Huawei affiliates to its roster of blacklisted companies \u2014 a sign that the Trump administration isn\u2019t completely easing pressure on the Chinese company.</p><p>Huawei called the latest blacklisting \u201cpolitically motivated,\u201d adding that the \u201cactions violate the basic principles of free market competition.\u201d But it also said that the decision \u201cwon\u2019t have a substantial impact\u201d on its business.</p><p>Facebook and Twitter fight Hong Kong disinformation</p><p>The social media companies said that they had identified and removed Chinese accounts from their platforms that were sowing divisive messages about the Hong Kong protests, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/technology/hong-kong-protests-china-disinformation-facebook-twitter.html\">Kate Conger of the NYT reports</url>.</p><p> The accounts \u201cacted in a coordinated fashion to amplify messages and images that portrayed Hong Kong\u2019s protesters as violent and extreme.\u201d</p><p> \u201cFacebook said it eliminated seven pages, three Facebook Groups and five accounts,\u201d while \u201cTwitter deleted 936 accounts and said it would ban state-backed media from promoting tweets.\u201d</p><p> It is \u201cthe first time that the social media companies have had to take down accounts linked to disinformation in China.\u201d</p><p>This signals \u201can escalation in the global disinformation wars,\u201d Ms. Conger writes. China\u2019s Communist Party hasn\u2019t interacted much with Western social media because it tightly controls what its citizens see inside its so-called Great Firewall. But the Hong Kong situation shows that it is ready and willing to use Facebook and Twitter if necessary.</p><p>More: Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, said that the territory\u2019s economy \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/20/hong-kong-protests-carrie-lam-speaks-about-economic-impact-shenzhen.html\">is facing the risk of downturn</url>.\u201d </p><p>The Fed chips away at banks\u2019 meltdown defenses</p><p>The central bank is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/business/bank-regulation-federal-reserve.html\">making changes to rules</url> that it put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. It says they are meant to bring more efficiency \u2014 but critics say they could lead to disaster, according to Jeanna Smialek, Peter Eavis and Emily Flitter of the NYT.</p><p> \u201cFed officials and others who support the changes, including big banks, say the Fed is engaging in what they call \u2018tailoring\u2019 \u2014 a regulatory correction that will bring greater efficiency to standards written in the heat of a meltdown.\u201d</p><p> \u201cThe changes, some put into place and others still under consideration, range from making it easier for big banks to pass the Fed\u2019s annual \u2018stress test\u2019 of their financial health to allowing some to borrow more.\u201d</p><p> \u201cThe tinkering is being driven by Randal K. Quarles, the Fed\u2019s vice chair for supervision, whom President Trump nominated in 2017.\u201d</p><p> \u201cBut some current and former Fed officials worry that the central bank and its fellow regulators are giving large banks, which are making big profits, an unnecessary gift that could leave the economy exposed in the next downturn.\u201d</p><p>Apple opens its wallet to compete in streaming</p><p>The tech giant is reportedly prepared to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f7f4326-c2bf-11e9-a8e9-296ca66511c9\">spend more than $6 billion</url> on original content for its coming streaming service, the FT reports. It\u2019s the price of admission in the contest for online video services.</p><p>The Apple TV Plus team was originally given $1 billion for content in its first year, the FT reports. That has ballooned as the company faces stiff competition.</p><p>Commissioned programs include \u201cThe Morning Show,\u201d featuring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon \u2014 which reportedly costs more per episode than \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d \u2014 and \u201cSee,\u201d which features the action star Jason Momoa.</p><p>Apple is also paying creators earlier in the production process, the FT reports.

That\u2019s the lowest it has been since modern record-keeping began in 1992, and at the bottom end of government forecasts. (It may also be worse: Economists widely doubt the truthfulness of Beijing\u2019s numbers.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It shows the limits of Beijing\u2019s ability to juice its economy, some experts say. China had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-economy-is-growing-at-its-slowest-pace-since-at-least-1992-11563162170?dlbk\">sought to spur growth</url> by spending more on infrastructure projects and cutting taxes, which led to a surge of economic activity in April. Then things slowed after trade talks with the U.S. broke down in mid-May.</p><p>Blame trade \u2014 but not just with the U.S. Exports fell 1.3 percent in June from the same time a year ago, while imports slid 7.3 percent. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/14/business/china-economy-growth-gdp-trade-war.html?dlbk\">Keith Bradsher of the NYT notes</url>, \u201cWhile the trade war has hurt American purchases from China, economic weakness in Europe and many Asian countries has caused overseas demand to weaken far more broadly.\u201d</p><p>Expect Beijing to try more economic stimulus. Analysts say the government will <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19545788-a6b7-11e9-984c-fac8325aaa04?dlbk\">probably lower interest rates and increase infrastructure spending</url> (again), though it\u2019s unclear whether that will help much in the long term.</p><p>And to pile on debt. The country\u2019s debt reached 247 percent of its $13 trillion economy by the end of March, up five percentage points from the end of 2018, according to Macquarie. Some Chinese bankers worry that they will be asked to extend more loans to businesses that will go bust as the economy continues to weaken.</p><p>More: U.S. manufacturers are continuing to move production of goods out of China. And a new report by McKinsey &amp;amp; Company shows that the world is becoming more exposed to China \u2014 while the country is becoming more economically reliant on its own consumers.</p><p>____________________________</p><p>Today\u2019s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Jamie Condliffe in London.</p><p>____________________________</p><p>Is a $5 billion fine for Facebook tough enough?</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission approved a roughly $5 billion fine against Facebook for mishandling users\u2019 personal information, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/technology/facebook-ftc-fine.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\">Cecilia Kang of the NYT reports</url>. Plenty of people think it should have been more.</p><p> The penalty is the result of an investigation into the way Facebook shared data with Cambridge Analytica.</p><p> The settlement still needs final approval from the Justice Department, though such agreements are rarely rejected.</p><p> If approved, it would be the biggest-ever federal fine against a tech company, eclipsing the $22 million imposed on Google in 2012.</p><p> The penalty underscores rising frustration in Washington with Silicon Valley\u2019s practices, and is one of the most aggressive regulatory actions by the Trump administration.</p><p>But Facebook\u2019s shares rose on the news, to $205.27, in after-hours trading on Friday. That\u2019s the stock\u2019s highest price in the past 12 months, and shows that investors had been expecting worse. (One mind-boggling way to think about it: The punishment for Facebook\u2019s biggest scandal yet increased Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s net worth.) For context, the company generated $15 billion in revenue last quarter alone, and $22 billion in profit last year.</p><p>Some lawmakers now want a harsher punishment. \u201cIt is clear that fundamental structural reforms are required,\u201d Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, said in a statement. \u201cWith the F.T.C. either unable or unwilling to put in place reasonable guardrails to ensure that user privacy and data are protected, it\u2019s time for Congress to act.\u201d</p><p>More: Congress is scheduled to grill Big Tech executives this week over their market dominance.</p><p>How the rich welcomed Jeffrey Epstein after jail</p><p>The financier spent 13 months in jail from 2008 and 2009, after securing a plea deal that helped him avoid charges of sexually abusing minors. When he emerged, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/nyregion/jeffrey-epstein-new-york-elite.html?dlbk\">high society embraced him</url>, the NYT reports.</p><p> Thanks to contacts like the publicist Peggy Siegal, he attended film screenings and secured high-profile guests for his dinner parties, including Prince Andrew of Britain and the journalists George Stephanopoulos and Katie Couric.</p><p> His money was welcomed for philanthropic donations, including to Harvard.</p><p> And he befriended socialites like Dr. Eva Andersson-Dubin, a champion of women\u2019s health whose friendship renewed his credibility.</p><p>\u201cThe lenient agreement he reached with prosecutors \u2014 his plea involved one girl and the crime was prostitution, which made it look like the teenager was in part to blame \u2014 gave others a reason to dismiss his wrongdoing, decide he had already paid his penalty or not question what had happened,\u201d the NYT reports.</p><p>But the scandal finally cost the labor secretary his job. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/12/us/politics/acosta-resigns-trump.html?dlbk\">Alexander Acosta announced his resignation on Friday</url>, saying questions about the 2008 plea deal he brokered for Mr. Epstein as a federal prosecutor were a distraction.</p><p>Mr. Epstein\u2019s network of recruiters are also under scrutiny in a new AP report that explains how they sought out poor young girls to work as \u201cmasseuses\u201d for Mr. Epstein.</p><p>More: Hedge fund managers have been curious about how Mr. Epstein <url normalizedValue=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/hedge-funders-have-some-thoughts-on-what-epstein-was-doing.html?dlbk\">operated his business</url>. And prosecutors accused the financier of trying to influence potential witnesses in late 2018 by paying them $350,000.</p><p>Huawei may lay off hundreds in the U.S.</p><p>The Chinese tech giant is reportedly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/huawei-plans-extensive-layoffs-in-the-u-s-11563071144?dlbk\">planning steep job cuts in its American operations</url> even after President Trump granted it some relief from a U.S. blacklisting, Dan Strumpf of the WSJ reports.</p><p>The layoffs would be at Huawei\u2019s U.S.-based R.&amp;amp;D. unit, Futurewei Technologies, Mr. Strumpf reports. It employs 850 people in states like Texas, California and Washington. Some employees have already been notified, and further cuts are expected to be announced soon.</p><p>The cuts come after the Trump administration blocked businesses from supplying U.S.-sourced products and services to Huawei, Mr. Strumpf writes.

Last month, UnitedHealth bought the health care start-up PatientsLikeMe after American national security regulators worried about the company\u2019s then-owner, a Chinese business.</p><p>But it\u2019s also hurting industries and states. The real estate sector has tumbled as Chinese buyers evaporated. And states like Michigan that have wooed Chinese investment to create new factories and jobs are feeling pinched.</p><p>Many in Washington \u201cview the decoupling of the two economies as inevitable,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/20/us/politics/china-red-scare-washington.html?dlbk\">Ana Swanson of the NYT writes</url>. Among them: the former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who helped revive the Committee on the Present Danger to warn about risks posed by China.</p><p>Others worry that a new red scare could go too far. \u201cWe\u2019ve made this mistake once before, during the Cold War,\u201d Susan Shirk, the chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California at San Diego, told Ms. Swanson. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should make it again.\u201d</p><p>More: The White House is reportedly meeting with technology executives today to discuss its recent reprieve for Huawei.</p><p>Equifax\u2019s huge hack will cost it $650 million</p><p>The credit bureau Equifax is expected to pay around $650 million to settle federal and state investigations and consumer claims relating to a data breach that exposed sensitive information belonging to 145 million people, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/19/business/equifax-data-breach-settlement.html?dlbk\">Stacy Cowley and Peter Eavis of the NYT report</url>.</p><p> Most of the roughly $650 million would go toward compensating consumers for costs associated with the breach.</p><p> The breach, which was revealed in September 2017, included Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license information. It was one of the worst exposures of Americans\u2019 personal data.</p><p> It\u2019s still unclear who orchestrated the hacks.</p><p>The figure is in line with what Equifax expected. \u201cIn a recent financial filing, Equifax said it had set aside $690 million to cover the anticipated legal costs of the hacking,\u201d Ms. Cowley and Mr. Eavis write. \u201cIt has also spent hundreds of millions of dollars on improving its technology systems and on free credit report monitoring services for those affected by the breach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEquifax is facing a lighter financial penalty than some other corporate transgressors, like Wells Fargo, which paid $1 billion last year to settle charges from federal regulators for forcing unnecessary products and fees on unwilling customer,\u201d Ms. Cowley and Mr. Eavis write. The F.T.C., the main federal regulator for data security, has a limited ability to impose fines.</p><p>More details are set to be announced today by federal and state agencies.</p><p>\u2026 but Google\u2019s Wi-Fi spying will cost it just $13 million</p><p>Cast your mind back almost a decade, and you might remember Google\u2019s becoming embroiled in a scandal in which its Street View mapping vehicles sucked up email addresses, passwords and more by connecting to unencrypted household Wi-Fi networks around the world. Now it is settling a lawsuit over the matter for very little, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-21/google-finds-cheap-way-out-of-multibillion-dollar-wi-spy-suit?srnd=technology-vp\">Bloomberg reports</url>.</p><p>Google is expected to pay just $13 million to settle the 2010 privacy lawsuit.</p><p> \u201cOwners of the Wi-Fi networks whose information was captured by Google won\u2019t get individual payouts, except for about 20 plaintiffs who filed the complaint as a class action,\u201d Bloomberg reports.</p><p> What\u2019s left will \u201cbe distributed to a handful of consumer privacy advocacy groups.\u201d</p><p>Google will also \u201cdestroy all the data it still possesses and commit to teaching people how to protect their privacy on the internet.\u201d</p><p>This is a small price to pay. It\u2019s less than one-sixth the net income that Google generates on average in a single day, according to Bloomberg. But it\u2019s in the ballpark for settlements that internet companies have paid over the last decade, before animosity toward Big Tech reached its current level.</p><p>More: Google also agreed to pay $11 million to settle a lawsuit accusing it of discriminating against older job applicants.</p><p>How America\u2019s tax bill plummeted, for some companies</p><p>U.S. companies\u2019 overall tax rate <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/after-u-s-tax-overhaul-corporate-rates-fall-but-unevenly-11563701403?dlbk\">has fallen</url> since President Trump\u2019s tax overhaul in late 2017. But the benefits of the new law didn\u2019t fall evenly, Theo Francis and Richard Rubin of the WSJ report.</p><p> The 2017 law lowered the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent to help American companies compete in foreign markets.</p><p> The median effective tax rate for S&amp;amp;P 500 companies fell to 19.8 percent in the first quarter of the year, down from 25.5 percent two years earlier, according to the WSJ.</p><p> Just 28 companies reported a global tax rate above 32 percent in the quarter, down from 143 before the new law.</p><p> But about a quarter of the S&amp;amp;P 500 reported little change in tax rates, and 17 percent disclosed rate increases of five percentage points or more.</p><p>China\u2019s answer to the Nasdaq goes live</p><p>A new stock board for homegrown Chinese tech companies opened this morning, and some traders appear to have become a little overexcited, pushing some shares up by as much as 520 percent, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/22/china-star-market-shanghai-kicks-off-new-nasdaq-style-tech-board.html\">CNBC reports</url>.</p><p> The new STAR Market, operated by the Shanghai Stock Market and aimed at domestic investors, kicked off with 25 companies staging their I.P.O.s.</p><p> The board is meant to be an experiment, with more relaxed conditions for tech companies looking to go public.</p><p> All 25 companies more than doubled their I.P.O. price. One, the semiconductor component maker Anji Microelectronics, had its buying halted briefly as its stock soared, but its shares still posted gains of as much as 520 percent.</p><p>\u201cThe price gains are crazier than we expected,\u201d Stephen Huang, vice president of Shanghai See Truth Investment Management, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-markets-star/circuit-breakers-trip-shares-soar-as-chinas-nasdaq-style-bourse-debuts-idUSKCN1UH03G?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews\">told Reuters</url>. \u201cThese are good companies, but valuations are too high. Buying them now makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>Remembering Robert Morgenthau, New York\u2019s longtime prosecutor</p><p>Mr. Morgenthau, Manhattan\u2019s longest-serving district attorney, known for focusing on white-collar crime, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/21/nyregion/robert-morgenthau-dead.html?dlbk\">died yesterday</url>, Robert McFadden of the NYT reports. He was 99.</p><p> \u201cMr. Morgenthau was the face of justice in Manhattan, a liberal Democrat elected nine times in succession, usually by landslides and with the endorsement of virtually all the political parties,\u201d Mr. McFadden writes.</p><p> \u201cWhile he rarely went to court himself, Mr. Morgenthau, by his own count, supervised a total of 3.5 million cases over the years.\u201d</p><p> \u201cMr. Morgenthau was probably the most innovative prosecutor in the city\u2019s history. To pursue financial crimes, he hired scores of accountants and detectives with financial expertise.\u201d</p><p> His victories included prosecuting Dennis Kozlowski \u2014 the C.E.O. of Tyco International who was known for buying $6,000 shower curtains \u2014 of looting $100 million from the company.</p><p> Mr. Morgenthau also spent years working with federal prosecutors investigating the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which was accused of handling money for drug cartels and terrorists. The case uncovered a $15 billion fraud, and the bank was forced to close.</p><p>A day in the life of a DoorDash rider</p><p>What happened when Andy Newman of the NYT <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/21/nyregion/doordash-ubereats-food-app-delivery-bike.html?dlbk\">spent 27 hours delivering food for apps</url> like DoorDash, Uber Eats and Postmates? This:</p><p> \u201cI tasted the thrill of a decent tip and the agony of accepting a blind order that took me 40 blocks uptown to deliver two bagels.\u201d</p><p> \u201cIn fancy new apartment buildings and airy open-plan offices, young professional-looking people opened their doors just long enough to grab the food and mouth thanks.\u201d</p><p> \u201cTips have a way of vanishing: One app subtracts the amount the customer tips from the amount it pays the courier \u2014 effectively pocketing the tip.\u201d</p><p> \u201cThe riders I talked to average hourly wages in the midteens with tips, though I met a couple of Jedi Masters who cleared over $20.

We've heard plenty about Russian attempts to sway <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>users who were on the political right, led by the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg. But the effort directed at black Americans was actually larger.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Twitter were just the tip of the iceberg. Russian operatives on Instagram may have been as effective, or more effective, than on <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>They were also on Reddit, Google+, Vine, Gab, Meetup, Pinterest, Tumblr and even SoundCloud.</p><p>  Tech companies did not fully cooperate with Senate investigations. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>withheld its users' responses to Russian-generated content; Twitter provided only scattered details about Russian-controlled accounts; and Google gave data in hard-to-analyze formats.</p><p>  The disinformation campaign didn't end with the election. <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>ad volume from the Internet Research Agency peaked in April 2017; misleading Russian posts on Instagram in 2017 were double what they were in 2016. Ren\u00e9e DiResta, New Knowledge's director of research, writes that interference is ''a chronic, widespread and identifiable condition that we must now aggressively manage.''</p><p><person><nameText>Robert Mueller </nameText></person>is now a popular theme. ''The Russian operatives unloaded on Mueller through fake accounts on <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Twitter and beyond, falsely claiming that the former F.B.I. director was corrupt and that the allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election were crackpot conspiracies,'' writes the WaPo.</p><p>  Big Tech should expect more questions. ''The platforms may have misrepresented or evaded in some of their statements to Congress,'' the New Knowledge report says. ''It is unclear whether these answers were the result of faulty or lacking analysis, or a more deliberate evasion.''</p><p>  Bonus: See the Russians' most popular posts and memes.</p><p>  The markets hit a low for 2018</p><p>  The S&amp;P 500 fell 2 percent on Monday, reaching its lowest point since October 2017 as concerns about growth and interest rates continued to rattle investors.</p><p>  How bad is it? The sell-off, which began in early October, has now wiped out nearly 50 percent of the index's gains since President Trump was elected in November 2016. The S&amp;P 500 is on pace for its worst annual performance since the financial crisis, and its worst December in 80 years.</p><p>  Some perspective, from Matt Phillips of the NYT: ''This year's sell-off is nothing like the collapse of stocks a decade ago, when the S&amp;P fell more than 38 percent. But in its own way, 2018 is emerging as a remarkable year for financial markets, with almost every type of investment and asset class -- stocks, bonds, commodities, even supersafe Treasurys -- posting negative or minuscule returns.''</p><p>  And some consolation for wounded investors, from Bloomberg: ''Not even hindsight could have helped you make money this year.''</p><p>  What's behind the plunge? Several indicators have hinted that the economy may be slowing, and investors are particularly worried that the Fed will raise interest rates tomorrow (see below). Global markets have followed Wall Street's lead, and futures tracking U.S. stocks certainly don't indicate a sudden recovery.</p><p>  More on the markets: Until recently, health care shares were outperforming the wider market. Not now. Small-cap stocks fell into bear market territory. U.S. credit markets have dried up. Still, some investors see an opportunity. </p><p>CBS isn't giving Les Moonves $120 million</p><p>  The company said yesterday that after reviewing information gathered by outside lawyers about allegations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Moonves, its former chief executive, he won't receive his severance package. But that's not the end of the story.</p><p>  What CBS said: ''We have determined that there are grounds to terminate for cause, including his willful and material misfeasance, violation of company policies and breach of his employment contract, as well as his willful failure to cooperate fully with the company's investigation.''</p><p>  What Mr. Moonves can do. ''He could still contest the CBS board's ruling and fight for his severance through arbitration,'' write Edmund Lee and Rachel Abrams of the NYT. ''He could argue the company violated the confidentiality terms of his exit agreement when the internal investigation became public.''</p><p>  And CBS isn't done cleaning up the mess. ''It shouldn't have taken a media spotlight to remove a leader who had so grossly abused his power for years,'' writes Tara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Opinion. ''As CBS tries to repair its own culture and image, it has the power to influence society for the better.''</p><p>Goldman's 1MDB troubles are getting deeper</p><p>Goldman Sachs's efforts to build a reputation for scrupulous ethics are  being undone by  1MDB scandal, write Matthew Goldstein and Alexandra Stevenson of the NYT.</p><p>Malaysia hit the bank with criminal charges yesterday. The government accused Goldman of defrauding investors by raising more than $6 billion for the 1MDB fund, which was supposed to benefit the country's residents but wound up enriching the company and others instead.</p><p>  That could just be the start. ''The biggest threat to Goldman comes from the United States,'' Mr. Goldstein and Ms. Stevenson write. ''Goldman recently received subpoenas from New York regulators, held talks with federal prosecutors and is likely to incur billions of dollars in penalties. It is one of the most serious crises in the bank's 149-year history.''</p><p>  Investors are watching. ''The bank's shares fell 2.7 percent on Monday, after news of the charges broke. Its shares are down by more than one-third since last year, reflecting both its troubles and the overall souring sentiment on Wall Street.''</p><p>  Xi Jinping addresses two crowds</p><p>  The Chinese president gave a well-rehearsed speech this morning to mark the 40th anniversary of some major economic reforms. It showed just how delicate a diplomatic position he's in.</p><p>  For a domestic audience, he talked tough: ''No one is in a position to dictate to the Chinese people what should or should not be done. We must resolutely reform what should and can be changed, we must resolutely not reform what shouldn't and can't be changed.''</p><p>  But while he's seeking a U.S. trade deal, not too tough: ''China's development does not pose a threat to any country. No matter how far China develops, it will never seek hegemony.''</p><p>  And he wasn't committing himself on details. ''There will be a sense of disappointment, among both local and international investors, that Xi did not give clearer signals about the direction of future economic reform at a time when the Chinese government's commitment to market liberalization is seen to have waned,'' Tom Rafferty from the Economist Intelligence Unit told the Guardian.</p><p>  Trump isn't the only one scared of rate rises</p><p>  The Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates at the conclusion of a meeting of its policy-setting committee this week, despite resistance that is no longer confined to the White House.</p><p>  The president's take: ''It is incredible,'' Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet yesterday, that ''the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike'' with ''the outside world blowing up around us.''</p><p>  An economist's take: ''I do think that there are more risks of overtightening than there are of undertightening right now,'' Lawrence Summers, who served as President Barack Obama's chief economic adviser, told Fox Business Network yesterday.</p><p>  The big fear: ''As the Fed drives up borrowing costs, there is increasing concern that the central bank is risking a return to recession, and may be preventing workers from claiming a larger share of the American pie,'' writes Binyamin Appelbaum of the NYT.</p><p>  Meanwhile, the Fed is looking ahead. It's wrestling with how to say that future rate rises aren't guaranteed, the WSJ notes, without implying that they're done.</p><p>  Theresa May bought herself time for Brexit</p><p>  But the reprieve might not be that useful.</p><p>  Mrs. May gave herself four weeks to save her Brexit deal. She rescheduled a parliamentary vote on her proposal, originally planned on Dec. 11, for the week of Jan. 14. That gives her time to seek help from E.U. leaders, in the hope of swaying lawmakers at home.</p><p>  The E.U. may not play along. ''No further meetings with the U.K. are foreseen,'' Margaritis Schinas, a European Commission spokesman said, told reporters on Monday. ''On the E.U. side, we have started the process of ratification.'' That's one reason preparations for a so-called no-deal exit are reportedly being increased.</p><p>  Revolving door</p><p>  Channing Dungey, who left ABC as head of entertainment, will join Netflix as a vice president of original content.</p><p>Whirlpool's C.E.O., Marc Bitzer, will also be its chairman.</p><p>  The London Stock Exchange Group also named a new chairman: Don Robert  of Experian.</p><p>  Andreas Goss, the head of Thyssenkrupp's steel division, will be the C.E.O. of a new joint venture with Tata Steel.</p><p>Barclays named 85 new managing directors.</p><p>  The speed read</p><p>  Deals</p><p>   Hitachi officially agreed to acquire a power-grid unit from the Swiss engineering company ABB for $6.4 billion.

(Want this by email? Sign up here.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Founders may think twice about selling to <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Selling your start-up to <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>will make you rich, but it might not make you happy. <person><nameText>Kevin Systrom </nameText></person>and Mike Krieger, who sold Instagram to the social networking giant for about $715 million, resigned earlier this week, reportedly over tensions with <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>about growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Brian Acton, one of the co-founders who sold WhatsApp to <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>for $22 billion, went further. In a dishy interview with Forbes, he spoke of similar tensions with Mr. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg. </nameText></person>(<person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>wanted ads; he didn't.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  ''They are businesspeople, they are good businesspeople,'' Mr. Acton said. ''They just represent a set of business practices, principles and ethics, and policies that I don't necessarily agree with.''</p><p>  A senior <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>executive, David Marcus, pushed back against Mr. Acton, writing in a post that ''attacking the people and company that made you a billionaire'' is ''a whole new standard of low-class.''</p><p>  Yes, founders take their money and make a choice. But <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>acquisition strategy appears to be stuttering, and its newer products may head in unexpected directions with their founders out of the picture. That's a problem: <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>acquisitions have been oases of calm and growth compared to its main business.</p><p>SoftBank's founder has the biggest dreams in tech</p><p>  Masa Son has raised nearly $100 billion for his company's Vision Fund to invest in tech companies, on what he says is a 300-year strategy. But in a Bloomberg Businessweek profile, he says that's only the start: He wants to raise another $100 billion every two or three years, and expand the Vision Fund's team of deal makers to 300. Counting him, it's currently ten.</p><p>  That's an incredible amount of money, and competing investment firms are (understandably) frightened. It's very different at start-ups, Businessweek points out:</p><p>SoftBank has given them the equivalent of an all-you-can-eat buffet of foreign investment dollars. ''You think they can't eat any more,'' says Jules Maltz, a partner with IVP, a Sand Hill Road firm. The entrepreneurs ''cram it in, put it in their pockets, take doggy bags, whatever.''</p><p>  The bigger worry might be to SoftBank's investors: The Vision Fund will need a lot of home-run investments to cover bets that huge.</p><p>  Silicon Valley tells lawmakers to go easy on regulation</p><p>  Executives from Google, Apple, AT&amp;T and more appeared before the Senate Commerce Committee yesterday to answer privacy questions. ''We have arrived at a moment where, I believe, there is a strong desire by both Republicans and Democrats, and by both industry and public interest groups, to work in good faith to reach a consensus on a national consumer data privacy law,'' Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the committee's chairman, said in an opening statement.</p><p>  But a clear message emerged from the tech giants: Don't go too far.</p><p>Amazon's associate general counsel, Andrew DeVore, asked lawmakers to ''ensure that additional overhead and administration demands any legislation might require actually produce commensurate privacy benefits.''</p><p>   Keith Enright, Google's new chief privacy officer, told them to ''take into consideration the impacts on service functionality, the consumer benefits of free and low-cost products, the future of the open web and app ecosystem.''</p><p>  Nothing will happen quickly. ''I think we might have a pretty good idea what a draft would look like,'' Mr. Thune concluded. ''But I suspect we probably wouldn't get it acted on until next year.''</p><p>  Read more: It's Google's turn in the Washington hot seat. And many big tech companies have agreed to an E.U. code of practice on misinformation.</p><p>  Coming up today</p><p>  The Senate Judiciary Committee will hear from Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford. Dr. Blasey, who accused the Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault, will testify first, starting at 10 a.m. Eastern. Judge Kavanaugh is also expected to be questioned about accusations from other women, including one who came forward yesterday.</p><p>  Steven Mnuchin might talk trade. The Treasury secretary, who has kept a low profile recently, is scheduled to speak at a Washington event sponsored by The Hill.</p><p>  The Commerce Department will release second-quarter G.D.P. data. Analysts expect a 4.2 percent annualized growth rate.</p><p>  The Census Bureau will publish durable goods order numbers for August. They are forecast to have risen by 1.2 percent, having fallen 1.7 percent in July because of shrinking demand for transportation equipment.</p><p>  Fox admits defeat over Sky</p><p>  Twenty-First Century Fox agreed yesterday to sell its 39 percent stake in the British broadcaster to Comcast for $15 billion. It's the end of a monthslong battle, and of a yearslong quest by Rupert Murdoch to regain control of a company he created decades ago.</p><p>  Fox is selling at the behest of Walt Disney, which struck a deal over the summer to buy most of Mr. Murdoch's media empire.</p><p>  Elizabeth Winkler of Heard on the Street says it's $15 billion for Disney to spend on its fight with Netflix. But for Comcast shareholders, it's another $15 billion spent on an asset that many didn't want in the first place.</p><p>  The Fed stands up to Trump</p><p>  It raised interest rates as expected yesterday, to between 2 and 2.25 percent, citing a ''particularly bright moment'' for the U.S. economy. President Trump said he was ''not happy.''</p><p>  So he shows no sign of returning to the tradition of presidential silence on fiscal policy. But the Fed still plans another increase before the end of the year, and some of its officials reckon avoiding inflation will require raising rates to the point of restricting the economy.</p><p>  For his part, Jerome Powell, the Fed's chief, said yesterday: ''We don't consider political factors.''</p><p>  For Nike, Kaepernick is an existential choice</p><p>  The sportswear company's decision to feature Colin Kaepernick in its latest ads has been celebrated as shrewd marketing. But Nike nearly dropped the former N.F.L. quarterback after he became the face of player protests.</p><p>  Then its communications chief, Nigel Powell,  intervened, report Julie Creswell, Kevin Draper and Sapna Maheshwari in the NYT:</p><p>  Powell argued that Nike would face backlash from the media and consumers if it was seen as siding with the N.F.L. rather than Kaepernick. And Nike, along with most apparel companies, is desperate to attract urban youth who increasingly look up to Kaepernick; the largely white, older N.F.L. fans angry at the league over the protests are not a priority for those companies, analysts say.</p><p>  Another factor: Under Nike's latest deal with the N.F.L., it can't sell league-branded merchandise after 2020. That helped it choose to put Mr. Kaepernick front and center. So far, the wager is paying off.</p><p>  Could Treasuries end the bull market?</p><p>  The stock market may face a new threat: increasingly attractive returns on government bonds. More from Peter Eavis of DealBook:</p><p>  Buying a 10-year Treasury today would provide its holders with 3 percent a year for a decade with virtually no risk of losing any money in the process. Such a return might seem particularly attractive to investors who believe the stock market is expensive and is vulnerable to a sell-off.</p><p>  And:</p><p>  If companies' profits continue to grow strongly, the earnings yield will rise and stocks will look more attractive compared with government bonds. But corporate earnings growth is expected to slow next year. And the trade war may cause corporate profits to moderate even more. In that case, the difference between the 10-year yield and the earnings yield would shrink even more. Investors may be more tempted then to shed stocks and put more money into bonds.</p><p>  Revolving door</p><p>Merck's board changed its retirement age, meaning Kenneth Frazier will stay on as C.E.O.</p><p>UBS's investment bankers reportedly fear for their futures once their boss, Andrea Orcel, leaves to lead Banco Santander.</p><p>  Banks may need to thin their trading desks.</p><p>  The speed read</p><p>  Deals</p><p>   DealBook exclusive:  The Infatuation, a restaurant reviews site, raised $30 million from Jeffrey Katzenberg's WndrCo.

Want this in your inbox every morning? Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wall Street and Big Tech: Watch out for <person><nameText>Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  I interviewed the Massachusetts senator last night in Washington for a TimesTalk on the 10th anniversary of the global financial crisis. On her mind was reining in two of America's most powerful industries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  On wanting to break up the big banks, she said: ''Oh yeah. Give me a chance.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  She also said that the government needed tougher rules to counteract the size and scale of tech giants like Amazon. ''If you're getting a huge competitive advantage from being a platform provider because of all this information you've been scraping, then we no longer have competition going on,'' she told me.</p><p>  Other tidbits from our conversation:</p><p>   Ms. Warren suggested that Gary Cohn, <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>former top economic adviser, had been ''pre-bribed'' by his former employer, Goldman Sachs, which made him more likely to push for a tax overhaul that benefits the company.</p><p>   She wouldn't push to impeach Mr. Trump right now, having rebuffed such a campaign led by the outspoken Democratic <person><nameText>donor Tom Steyer. </nameText></person>Instead, she wants to wait for an investigation.</p><p>   She is concerned about protections for Robert Mueller, the special counsel. She told me: ''Every time <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>starts tweeting again or attacks someone else in government, I get very worried.''</p><p>  Bonus: The economists Carmen Reinhart and Vincent Reinhart argue that lawmakers and central bankers have grown complacent about the risks that could lead to the next financial crisis.</p><p>  -- Andrew Ross Sorkin</p><p>Goldman puts the bankers back on top</p><p>  Preparing to take the reins at Goldman Sachs, David Solomon has named his deputies -- and put bankers, not traders, in charge of the Wall Street firm.</p><p>  John Waldron, who will become C.O.O., is one of the firm's top deal makers. (His clients include Rupert Murdoch and Blackstone.) And Stephen Scherr, who will become C.F.O., currently runs the consumer arm and previously served as C.O.O. of the investment bank</p><p>  The promotions reflect how the pendulum has swung at Goldman, where bankers and traders tend to take turns running the firm. Its current C.E.O., Lloyd Blankfein, was a metals trader who took over as the firm's trading arm became a moneymaking machine.</p><p>  But Goldman's traders have struggled since the end of the financial crisis, and the bankers are now doing well.</p><p>  More Goldman news: A new book reports that Gary Cohn pushed the firm to do business with 1MDB, the Malaysian investment fund now embroiled in scandal. And the bank settled a dispute with a whistle-blower fired over misconduct.</p><p>  Tax cut might cost $3.8 trillion</p><p>  Republican lawmakers are pushing to make permanent many of the individual and estate tax cuts enacted last year. (They're set to expire in 2025.) But the price could be very high, according to the Tax Policy Center, a centrist think tank.</p><p>  More from Jeff Stein of the WaPo:</p><p>  The second round of cuts would cost $631 billion before 2028 and an additional $3.15 trillion in the decade after that, according to the Tax Policy Center. The finding was somewhat larger than the $2.4 trillion cost over 10 years projected by the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank.</p><p>  The House is set to vote on the package this month, but the Senate won't look at it this year. If Republicans retain control of Congress, it could form the basis of the G.O.P.'s economic blueprint.</p><p>  Jeff Bezos's new $2 billion charitable fund</p><p>  The Amazon C.E.O. has announced a $2 billion fund to start preschools and help homeless families. More details from Karen Weise of the NYT:</p><p>  The money, put into what he called the Day 1 Fund, is by far the largest philanthropic donation by Mr. Bezos, the world's richest person. It will support organizations that provide shelter and food for homeless families, and will start a network of nonprofit Montessori-inspired preschools for underserved communities.</p><p>  Mr. Bezos has come under pressure in recent years for his lack of philanthropy, compared to peers like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. But with Mr. Bezos's estimated net worth standing at $164 billion, is $2 billion a good-enough start?</p><p>  Bonus: Mr. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, said that it was ''dangerous'' for <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>to demonize the media.</p><p>Facebook sees stopping election meddling as everyone's job</p><p>  Mark Zuckerberg published a 3,300-word opus on Wednesday cataloging all the steps the company has taken to fight election interference. He wrote that Facebook was better prepared, but added that the tech giant needed ''to constantly improve and stay one step ahead.''</p><p>  On cue, the company announced plans yesterday to start fact-checking photos and videos on its site, in addition to rooting out false articles and links. That will be done with both technology and human labor.</p><p>  But Mr. Zuckerberg would like everyone to know that this is not just a job for Facebook:</p><p>  ''The definition of success is that we stop cyberattacks and coordinated information operations before they can cause harm. While I'd always rather Facebook identified abuse first, that won't always be possible. We will all need to continue improving and working together to stay ahead and protect our democracy,''</p><p>  More Facebook news: Cameroon has asked for the company's help to fight fake news. And the social network is automating the process of fixing software bugs.</p><p>  A huge I.P.O. gives the Chinese tech industry hope</p><p>  The Chinese food delivery company Meituan Dianping priced its public market debut at 69 Hong Kong dollars (about $8.80), in the upper end of its expected range, valuing the business at $53 billion.</p><p>  Is peers have faced a run of bad news in recent months, including tighter government regulation and a weakening domestic economy. Tencent shares remain depressed amid a government crackdown on gaming. The Tesla competitor Nio raised just half the amount from its I.P.O. that it had expected. And the smartphone maker Xiaomi failed to impress in its share offering this summer.</p><p>  The strong showing by Meituan gives investors and executives some hope about the future of the Chinese tech sector. But it will take more than one I.P.O. to prove that the industry has turned a corner.</p><p>  SpaceX says it has its first space tourist</p><p>  Elon Musk's company has announced its first booking from a private passenger who wants to fly around the moon. The company called it ''an important step toward enabling access for everyday people who dream of traveling to space.'' We'll learn who the passenger is on Monday.</p><p>  But there are plenty of questions. SpaceX has given no indication of when the flight might happen. The rocket that the passenger would take, known as the BFR, isn't yet built -- and it's not clear when it would be, or how the company will pay for it.</p><p>  Revolving door</p><p>  Nik Deogun, most recently the editor in chief of CNBC, joined the public relations firm Brunswick Group as C.E.O. of its Americas division.</p><p>Hyundai Motor Group named Euisun Chung, its heir apparent, as chief vice chairman.</p><p>  The speed read</p><p>  Deals</p><p>   Moderna Therapeutics, a biotech start-up currently valued at $7.5 billion, is reportedly preparing to go public.

In it: several past discussions with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, and a meeting this year that convinced him the Saudis would back a bid to delist Tesla.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Except, according to the NYT, the Saudi fund never did anything to prepare for a deal like that.

Some of the questions that remain:</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 How would Mr. Musk handle a national security review of a Saudi deal?</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 What will the S.E.C. do about his tweet now?</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 Mr. Musk's blog post declares that he was tweeting only on his own behalf, as a potential bidder for Tesla. Is that enough to shield the company from legal trouble?</p><p>  Mr. Musk says he's moving forward, and has named Goldman Sachs and the investment firm Silver Lake as advisers. Whether shareholders remain interested is another matter: Shares in Tesla closed up only slightly after the frenetic disclosures.</p><p>  Plus:  Andrew's column this morning asks the question: ''Is Twitter the right forum for public company executives to disseminate market-moving information in the first place?'' He posits that the S.E.C. and boards shouldn't let C.E.O.s tweet out corporate news.</p><p>Turkey takes a breath. Should you?</p><p>  The Turkish lira rose around 5 percent overnight, after authorities unveiled measures to halt its slide. Opinion is split on how big an impact Turkey's troubles will have on the rest of the world.</p><p>  Tensions between Turkey and the U.S. look likely to keep rising. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u00c4\u0178an of Turkey has responded to President Trump's sanctions move last week with a promise to boycott American electronics. Given his country's shrinking purchasing power, the direct impact of that might not be great, but the symbolism is striking.</p><p>  The FT's Colby Smith argues that fears of contagion may be overblown. Turkey is too small a part of the global economy to have much of an effect, he says, except perhaps on a few European banks.</p><p>  The WaPo's David J. Lynch and Kareem Fahim disagree, on the grounds that Turkey is just one of several countries with a common problem: They borrowed heavily when the dollar was cheap. Now that it's strengthened, they ''face soaring debt payments they may no longer be able to make.''</p><p>  Virtual currencies are crashing, too</p><p>  The cryptocurrency Ether tumbled by as much as 17 percent on Monday, to as low as $285, the first time it's been below $300 since November. Bitcoin fell 6.2 percent, to just under $5,900. Bloomberg notes that the problem is widespread:</p><p>  All but one of the 100 biggest cryptocurrencies tracked by Coinmarketcap.com recorded declines over the past 24 hours. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies dropped to $190 billion, from a peak of around $835 billion in January.</p><p>  What happened? For once, it looks like a problem with Ether, not Bitcoin. Many start-ups pursuing I.C.O.'s used Ether, which inflated its value. Now, Bloomberg notes, many of those start-ups are cashing out -- which has the opposite effect.</p><p>  Crypto bonus: A rap on the subject from the billionaire and Bitcoin lover Tim Draper.</p><p>  Icahn drops a deal fight</p><p>  It's rare for Carl Icahn to back down from a shareholder activism campaign. But that's what he's done over Cigna's $52 billion deal to buy Express Scripts.</p><p>  What stopped him, he said in a short statement, was that two influential proxy advisers backed the deal, making investor support for his side hard to gather.</p><p>  The WSJ also points out that Mr. Icahn may have moved too late. By the time he made his campaign public, investors were blocked from buying Cigna stocks to join him.</p><p>  Shareholders are set to vote on the union on Aug. 24, and one big hurdle remains: approval from antitrust regulators.</p><p>  Why women call the shots in Malaysian banking</p><p>  In most countries, men dominate finance. An exception is Malaysia, where women run several homegrown investment banks.</p><p>  One reason? Government support. From Bloomberg's interview with Kong Sooi Lin of the Malaysian bank CIMB:</p><p>  They have been rooting for women to come into the workforce, targeting 30 percent representation on corporate boards. So we are lucky in a sense that we are in Malaysia. When your country has this view on gender, your bosses also support women. And we've come up with policies that encourage women to stay in the workforce. For our new building, we made sure every floor had a nursing room.</p><p>  Trump bans Chinese hardware for government use</p><p>  The president has signed a law banning his government or its contractors from using many devices that rely on technology from the Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE.</p><p>  Huwaei has called the ban ''ineffective, misguided and unconstitutional,'' but it's less severe than some lawmakers had demanded: Components from the companies can be used if they don't transmit or view data. It comes in the wake of Mr. Trump lifting a ban on U.S. companies selling to ZTE.</p><p>  Revolving door</p><p>  David Wells is stepping down as Netflix's C.F.O.</p><p>  Jud Linville is stepping down as the head of Citigroup's credit card unit.</p><p>  Jonathan Piazza, a senior health care banker, is leaving Barclays for Goldman Sachs.</p><p>  The speed read</p><p>  Deals</p><p>  \u00e2\u2013\u00a0 The VF Corporation will spin out its denim brands, including Wrangler and Lee.
