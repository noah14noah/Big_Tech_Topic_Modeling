It highlights some of the most important data points available on the performance of the sector comparable to other markets, as well as the performance and perception of firms within the industry. New trends and innovations are also noted, as are the implications of COVID-19 for the sector.    Growth in the US retail banking sector has been strong over the past decade despite the significant impact of the global financial crisis. COVID-19 will significantly alter trajectories and forecasts in 2020, and mixed responses to the pandemic have led to a delay in the expected recovery. A V-shaped recovery is hoped for, although the likelihood of growth post-COVID-19 following similar trends and rates to those pre-COVID-19 is becoming less likely. Until 2020, economic growth in the US had been strong following pro-business tax cuts and a more favourable regulatory environment, despite the ongoing trade war with China and internal political tension. However, many of the benefits of such growth have failed to trickle down effectively, and infrastructure and investment plans have not been met.   Scope   The top five providers of credit cards saw their share of the US market grow by only 1 percentage point (pp) over the review period, suggesting the entry of digital-only providers and fintech platforms has halted the progress and gains of the most dominant firms. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo have invested heavily in digital infrastructure, and consequently they tend to rank lowest with regards to user dissatisfaction on mobile channels. Compared to other advanced economies and the global average, US consumers are less open to offerings by digital-only providers, but are more inclined towards offerings by big tech companies.

At the same time, the social media behemoth has been beset by scandal after scandal, accused of violating users' privacy and misusing their data. Facebook was recently slapped with a $5 billion fine by the Federal Trade Commission for those violations - the largest fine ever handed down by that agency to a tech firm.</p><p>Google's dominance of the search sector and its alleged ability to swing elections have been the subject of Senate hearings, and several employee whistleblowers have come forward with what appears to be proof that the company manipulates search results for political ends.

That investigation is expected to include over 40 attorneys general and will concentrate on the intersection of privacy and antitrust, according to another source.</p><p>In recent years Facebook has greatly expanded its business ventures, acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp Messenger - which, unlike their parent company, are growing fast. At the same time, the social media behemoth has been beset by scandal after scandal, accused of violating users' privacy and misusing their data. Facebook was recently slapped with a $5 billion fine by the Federal Trade Commission for those violations - the largest fine ever handed down by that agency to a tech firm.</p><p>Google's dominance of the search sector and its alleged ability to swing elections have been the subject of Senate hearings, and several employee whistleblowers have come forward with what appears to be proof that the company manipulates search results for political ends. Additionally, Google has been accused of directing search users to its own products at the cost of competitors.</p><p>In July, the Justice Department (DoJ) launched a probe into whether the big tech firms are complying with antitrust laws. The officials did not explicitly call out Facebook or Google but hinted that they would be going after the major players, with Apple and Amazon also falling within the domain of search, social media, and some retail services online.</p><p>Congress also started an investigation into the Big Tech giants. The House Judiciary Committee head, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), voiced concern that a handful of companies have taken control over the vast sectors of online commerce and communications. The issue has even come up in the 2020 presidential race, with Democratic nomination hopefuls including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders arguing that Facebook is too powerful and needs to be broken up.</p><p>Facebook, of course, denies it violated any antitrust rules, and announced it is eager to work with lawmakers to come up with regulations to protect users.</p><p>Google, too, looks forward to answer[ing] questions about our business and the dynamic technology sector, a spokesperson said in an email. - FNA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2287042682</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFJ-JPY1-JBHT-D0M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"498\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service Group Sep 9, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 9, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.''</p><p>If they want to get into the financial business, Facebook and its dozens of partner companies in the venture will have to accept the kind of tight regulation that banks are under, the president said.</p><p>The Treasury chief's comments went further, though, tying Libra directly to concerns over potential use for money laundering, drug and human trafficking, tax evasion and other crimes.</p><p>Facebook has \"a lot of work to do before we get to the point where we're comfortable with it,'' Mnuchin said.</p><p>On Tuesday, Congress begins two days of hearings on Facebook's Libra plan. The head of the Federal Reserve also raised an alarm about the plan last week.</p><p>Facebook's plan \"raises a lot of serious concerns, and those would include around privacy, money laundering, consumer protection, financial stability,'' Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in congressional testimony. \"Those are going to need to be thoroughly and publicly assessed and evaluated before this proceeds.''</p><p>Unlike Mnuchin, Powell - as head of the central bank - is an independent regulator who is separate from the administration and political influence.</p><p>Already under intense scrutiny from regulators and Congress over privacy and market dominance, Facebook stirred anger on Capitol Hill last month with the unveiling of its plan to create a new financial ecosystem based on a digital currency. Senate and House hearings went on the calendar, and the Democratic head of the House Financial Services Committee called on Facebook to suspend the plan until Congress and regulators can review it.</p><p>Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said that Facebook, with some 2 billion users around the world, \"is continuing its unchecked expansion and extending its reach into the lives of its users.'' She called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system'' that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, says in his testimony prepared for Tuesday's hearing by the Financial Services panel that Libra \"is about developing a safe, secure and low-cost way for people to move money efficiently around the world. We believe that Libra can make real progress toward building a more inclusive financial infrastructure.''</p><p>Facebook agrees with Powell's view that the government's review of Libra must be \"patient and thorough, rather than a sprint to implementation,'' Marcus' statement says. \"The time between now and launch is designed to be an open process and subject to regulatory oversight and review. In fact, I expect that this will be the broadest, most extensive and most careful pre-launch oversight by regulators and central banks in FinTech's history. We know we need to take the time to get this right.''</p><p>The planned digital currency is billed as a \"stablecoin'' backed by deposits in sovereign currencies such as the dollar, euro and Japanese yen - unlike bitcoin, ether or other digital currencies. Promising low fees, it could open online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts and make it cheaper to send money across borders. But it also raises concerns over the privacy of users' data and the potential for criminals to use it for money laundering and fraud.</p><p>To address privacy concerns, Facebook created a nonprofit oversight association, with dozens of partners including PayPal, Uber, Spotify, Visa and MasterCard to govern Libra. As one among many in the association, Facebook says it won't have any special rights or privileges. It also created a \"digital wallet'' subsidiary, Calibra, to work on the technology, separately from its main social media business. While Facebook owns and controls Calibra, it won't see financial data from Calibra, the company says. - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THANWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THANWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKG-XB11-DXMS-83X6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404625</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"787\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Thai News Service All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Thai News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The one area that Gates didn't dominate: the World Wide Web. And how he tried to conquer that newfangled internet led to an epic court battle that continues to shape how the world sees the five-headed beast that Big Tech has become.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Microsoft famously missed the rise of the web in the early '90s, with Gates dedicating only a fraction of his mid-'90s tome <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Road Ahead</emphasis> to the internet. Meanwhile, Netscape introduced millions to the pleasures of browsing and surfing, forcing Microsoft to do one of its notorious \"fast follows\" (i.e., rapid copycat product launches). The company introduced Internet Explorer in 1995 and wasted no time in browbeating and cajoling companies the world over into making it the default web browser on their systems.</p><p>Word of Microsoft's depredations reached the US Department of Justice, which in 1998 sued the company for violating the Sherman Act, a vague and archaic law that regulates the ability of conglomerates to assemble monopolies and stifle competition. What's more, the government's lawyers wouldn't just move to penalize Microsoft with fines-they'd seek to break it into smaller companies.</p><p>The case would last more than five years, and the trial had its share of Perry Mason moments, as the wily lead litigator, David Boies, arguing on behalf of the DOJ, dueled in cross-examinations with Microsoft witnesses. The most damning evidence submitted at trial, however, was a videotaped deposition of Gates. Unlike robber barons of yore, he wasn't a portly, cigar-smoking chieftain. He was a rumpled geek who testified about Microsoft's past practices with an amnesiac level of vagueness and a truly Napoleonic persona. This wasn't save-the-world techno-optimism. It was sharp-elbowed libertarianism, and the press coverage of his performance introduced audiences at home to a new character of the digital age: the ruthless tech tycoon. From Gates it was a short jump to Steve Jobs, infamous distorter of reality fields; Jeff Bezos, slayer of publishing's \"sickly gazelles\"; and so many other dark lords with world-warping visions.</p><p>Microsoft lost the first round in 2001, with the presiding judge ordering the company's breakup. This \"structural solution\" (to use antitrust lingo) was later overturned on appeal, largely because under US law being a monopoly per se isn't illegal. It's typically only when a company abuses that dominance through coercion and collusion (among other anticompetitive tactics that raise prices and hurt consumers) that drastic remedies must be taken, and the appeals court wasn't convinced that the judge in the first trial applied the correct standards to order a breakup. Microsoft and the government decided to cut their losses and reach a settlement, with the company agreeing to a series of \"behavioral remedies\" that dampened its ability to strong-arm others. Microsoft as Gates built it would survive, but the message from the government was clear: No one company could dictate the tech industry's playbook.</p><p>Now, as Gates is off trying to cure malaria, and the chorus of complaint against Big Tech reaches a crescendo, could Bezos and his fellow giants end up in the government's crosshairs? It's unlikely, mostly because the tech world is fundamentally different today than it was in 1998 while US antitrust laws are essentially the same. To use a geopolitical analogy, technology was then a unipolar world and Microsoft its lone superpower. The tech world has since become multipolar: Facebook, Amazon, Google, Apple, and (a reduced) Microsoft are near-absolute monarchs of their respective domains. No single giant can dominate any other, and one company can coerce another only with great difficulty, if at all. The prospect of Facebook twisting Apple's arm to ship a new iPhone without any social media apps except for Facebook's-which is more or less what Microsoft supposedly did to Apple with Explorer-is unthinkable.</p><p>Today's titans tower over their kingdoms, secure behind their walls of user data and benefiting from extreme network effects that make serious competition from startups nearly impossible. US antitrust laws, written in the industrial age, don't capture many of the new realities and potential dangers of these vast data empires. Maybe they should.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">By</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">(@antoniogm), who is the author of</emphasis> Chaos Monkeys.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WIRED-10591028_WI_0218_10</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WIRED2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RGB-H521-F13F-10YT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338905</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"747\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Conde Nast Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Wired</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59741\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 1059-1028</issn><volume>Vol. 26</volume><issueNumber>No. 2</issueNumber><publicationDate month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>MAGAZINE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

He frequently berates news outlets for what he perceives as unfair coverage.</p><p>Google denied any political bias, saying in a statement that its search engine is \"not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology.\"</p><p>Trump said in several tweets on Tuesday that Google search results for \"Trump News\" were \"rigged\" against him because they showed only coverage from outlets like CNN and not conservative publications, suggesting the practice was illegal.</p><p>\"I think Google is really taking advantage of our people,\" Trump said on Tuesday in the Oval Office. \"Google, and Twitter and Facebook, they are really treading on very, very troubled territory, and they have to be careful. It's not fair to large portions of the population.\"</p><p>Facebook declined to comment. Twitter did not comment when asked for a response. In congressional testimony, both companies have denied engaging in partisan censorship.</p><p>Neither Trump nor the White House detailed how or under what legal justification they would use to probe Google.</p><p>Trump's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, later told reporters that the White House was \"taking a look\" at Google, saying the administration would do \"some investigation and some analysis,\" without providing further details.</p><p>Earlier this summer, the new Republican chair of the Federal Trade Commission, Joseph Simons, said the agency would keep a close eye on big tech companies that dominate the internet. In a previous investigation, the FTC decided that Google was likely justified in developing a search function that harmed other companies.</p><p>Congressional sources cautioned that it may be difficult for Trump to find a way to probe Google about news search results, and that Congress is unlikely to pass any applicable laws. The Federal Communications Commission ceded jurisdiction over regulating online communications when it repealed its net neutrality rules.</p><p>U.S. member of Congress Ted Lieu, a Democrat, said in a tweet directed at Trump that such restrictions on Google would violate the U.S. Constitution:</p><p>\"If government tried to dictate the free speech algorithms of private companies, courts would strike it down in a nanosecond.\"</p><p>Shares of Alphabet fell 0.8 percent to $1,245.86.</p><p>Trump's criticism of media</p><p>While the exact science behind Google searches on the internet is kept secret, its basic principles are widely known to be generated with a variety of factors measured by the company's algorithms.</p><p>The factors Google uses to determine which websites appear first in search results include how often that page is linked to on other sites, the use of keywords, the popularity and respectability of the news site, and personal browsing history of the person conducting the search.</p><p>Highly trafficked and cited websites like CNN.com and NYTimes.com, two of the most Trump's most frequent targets, often appear first in search results.</p><p>Trump's accusation of bias on the part of Google comes as social media companies have suspended accounts, banned certain users and removed content as they face pressure from the U.S.</p><p>Congress to police foreign propaganda and fake accounts aimed at disrupting American politics, including operations tied to Iran and Russia.</p><p>Companies such as Facebook and Twitter have also been pressed to remove conspiracy driven content and hate speech.</p><p>Tech companies have said they do not remove content for political reasons.</p><p>Some Republican U.S. lawmakers have also raised concerns about social media companies removing content from some conservatives, and have called Twitter's chief executive to testify before a House of Representatives panel on Sept. 5.</p><p>Earlier this month, Alphabet's YouTube joined Apple and Facebook in removing some content from Infowars, a website run by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Jones was also temporarily suspended on Twitter. - VOA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANM-2096029152</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFS-0H71-DY0W-43M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470423</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"738\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Thai News Service Group</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 30, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Sounds like good news, right? But then again you probably think STEM means: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. </p><p>That would be wrong[1].ICYMI: The federal government needs to get out of the business of paying people to not work.[2] You see universities are changing what makes up STEM programs. They are doing this in an attempt to get around immigration law. Here's how the game works. Immigration regulations have a provision for students with STEM majors. They can stay in America two years longer than students with humanities majors. So, what universities are doing is to include journalism, classics, drama therapy etc., as STEM offerings. Many universities are exploiting this U.S. immigration policy loophole. Normally immigrant students must leave the country a year after finishing their studies. But, regulations permit those who study STEM disciplines to stay and work for an additional two years. The policy is part of the DHS's Optional Practical Training[3] (OPT) program. It aims to shore up the United States' supply of engineers and tech workers. We don't actually have a shortage, oh by the way. Big tech just likes to pay less for its employees and immigrants will work for less. The result has been a dramatic increase in the number of foreign students seeking the STEM exemption. Imagine that. It ballooned from just over 2,000 in 2008 to nearly 70,000 in 2018.Who is playing the game?The UC, Berkeley, BU, CSU, etc. are classifying journalism, media studies, and digital media arts as STEM. Many schools are classifying subjects like economics and business as STEM. So the fraud is wide and deep, excuse me, loophole exploitation. The introduction of foreign workers into the U.S. labor market comes at the expense of American workers. The DHS program increases competition for domestic jobs. It depresses American wages. When employers hire internationals they are exempt from paying Medicare and Social Security taxes for them. That alone saves 12.4% of gross wages. When an American student and a foreign student have the exact same grades. If they go to an employer, the employer has a financial incentive to hire the foreigner over the Americans. At the same time, people getting to the Social Security and Medicare age are going to be at a disadvantage. The employer doesn't pay contributions into the entitlement system. The benefits under these programs are not being funded per design. The result[4] is fewer jobs, lower-paying jobs, and not paying their fair share into our entitlement system. It's a sweet system design, right? Thank your Democrat lawmaker. Do it at the polls. On paper, DHS is supposed to regularly monitor American universities. However, such audits rarely occur. The department responsible for enforcing the provisions claims to be underfunded. It also faces deterrence from the potential public relations fallout a crackdown would draw. An ombudsman report for the USCIS found the program is 'vulnerable to fraud' due to understaffing. The report also found that the program exhibits 'significant vulnerabilities.' The vulnerabilities allow the program to act as a conduit for Chinese espionage. Chinese students are the top beneficiaries of the OPT program. They represent more than one in three international students studying in the United States.The road to hell is paved with good intentionsThe creation of OPT was to offer the opportunity to gain work experience in their area of study. Currently, it is in use by government actors as a means of conducting espionage. Worse yet, it is a means of facilitating technology transfer. In anticipation of legal consequences for exploiting the OPT loophole. Schools provide a template letter[5] to international students to submit to federal authorities. To avoid any confusion by USCIS, you understand. Face it, universities have incentives to play 'fast and loose with visa rules.' They can boost international student admissions, get full tuition, and claim diversity gains. The only loser is America, American workers, and funding for entitlement programs. For universities, it is a win-win-win. '#8216;STEM' means whatever it takes to keep high paying international students pouring in. The effort by universities to expansively define STEM demonstrates their legal and linguistic talent. Universities regularly engage in this fraud to pad their bottom lines.

To address this question, the George J. Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business spearheaded a yearlong multidisciplinary research effort and now is presenting the final results.</p><p>The Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms Final Report and Policy Brief, released today, identifies the trouble with America's largest technology companies in four areas--market structure, consumer privacy and data protection, media, and political systems. It then delivers policy recommendations to rein in Big Tech, including creating a new Digital Authority.</p><p>\"We want to reduce the harmful effects of digital platforms without reducing the enormous benefits they bring,\" says Luigi Zingales, faculty director of the Stigler Center and a finance professor at Chicago Booth. \"Taken together, the recommendations are aimed at maintaining the benefits of digital platforms while promoting competition, protecting consumers and defending democracies.\"</p><p>The policy brief and the accompanying 330-page report are the result of 12 months of research and debate among more than 30 scholars and policymakers convened by the Stigler Center at its annual antitrust and competition conference in Chicago.</p><p>The recommendations come at a time when the U.S. government is increasing its own scrutiny of digital platforms. State attorney generals from across the country announced last week a sweeping investigation into the market power of big technology companies including Google and Facebook. The Justice Department said in July that it would start an antitrust review into Google and Apple, while the Federal Trade Commission fined Facebook a record $5 billion as part of a settlement related to violating consumers' privacy rights.</p><p>The Stigler report cites \"the lack of meaningful competition in many key digital markets\" and adds that \"the concentration of economic, media, data and persuasion, and political power is incredibly dangerous for our democracies.\"</p><p>A significant problem with scholarship around policymaking in many areas, but particularly around digital platforms, is the influence or even the perceived influence of corporate money and donations on think tanks, NGOs, and even universities, Zingales said. To preserve not only the independence but also the appearance of independence of the analysis, the center recruited scholars and experts who had not worked for, consulted with or acted as expert witness for or against Google or Facebook within the previous two years.</p><p>The policy recommendations from the Stigler Committee on Digital Platforms build on the solutions formed by four subcommittees, each writing a separate report on its findings. The four subcommittee reports are Market Structure and Antitrust, Privacy and Data Protection, Media and Politics.</p><p>The key policy recommendations are as follows:</p><p>- Force interoperability among social media, similar to how phone companies operate. Mandate an open and common application program interface that allows different messaging systems to connect to one another.</p><p>- Change the threshold for merger review, basing it on transaction value or other criteria that allow regulators to scrutinize transactions between digital platforms and startups.</p><p>- Create inside the FTC a Digital Authority, capable of overseeing all aspects of digital platforms. This DA would oversee how these companies collect data, set up rules allowing data portability among competing service providers and data sharing with third parties, promote open standards, and review mergers in parallel with the Justice Department.</p><p>- Extend campaign disclosure obligations to specifically target digital platforms, including relationships with politicians, academic funding, and the intentional promotion or demotion of content related to political figures.</p><p>- Adopt sticky pro-consumer default rules, forcing companies to actually explain data protection practices to consumers instead of just encouraging them to click \"I agree.\" Also discourage so-called dark patterns, or user interfaces that can confuse consumers or manipulate them.</p><p>- Remove the safe-harbor protections associated with Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act for content actively promoted and monetized by digital platforms.</p><p>- Promote investigative and democratic journalism by: (i) setting up pilot projects that instruct the development of alternative funding sources for local news media; and (ii) requiring antitrust authorities to consider media plurality when reviewing mergers between media companies.</p><p>- Impose an additional fiduciary duty on the boards of monopolies, specifically a fiduciary duty toward society.</p><p>Contact: Sandra Jones, senior associate director, 773/834-5828, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sandra.jones@ChicagoBooth.edu\">sandra.jones@ChicagoBooth.edu</email></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6864786 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6864786</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3K-0K61-JC11-12NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"898\"/><timeReceived>1:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 21, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Although the report makes a few fair points, it\u2019s a deeply biased and intellectually unsound research document overall. The paper misunderstands economic concepts, fails to examine the core value components of electric competition and cherry-picks the economic literature and contemporary developments. Each of the report\u2019s key points (below in bold) are swiftly refuted and, in many cases, the evidence points to the opposite conclusion:  </p><p><br/>1.\u201cPrice volatility and immediate rate increases have been an all-too-frequent outcome when restructuring has occurred.\u201d The data do not support claims that restructuring has increased retail price volatility. Regardless, price volatility alone is not a concern unless it exceeds the risk tolerance of market participants. When it does, retail choice allows customers to choose their electricity plan based on the premium they\u2019re willing to pay for rate stability. Monopoly utilities provide few retail options to customers, which tend to be less reflective of wholesale level conditions.  <br/>Prices in wholesale electricity markets are often very volatile because they accurately reflect the highly dynamic nature of real-time supply and demand (i.e., fluctuations in marginal cost). This provides a basis for efficient investment behavior from suppliers and for price-responsive demand. By comparison, the practices of monopoly utilities do not efficiently anticipate or respond to real-time supply and demand.  <br/>2.\u201cMarket restructuring has highlighted that the electricity industry\u2019s unique technical requirements should take precedence over political or economic theories.\u201d Electricity has unique technical characteristics, such as network externalities and the \u201ccommon good\u201d of resource adequacy, which require efficient policy interventions consistent with economic theories and empirical evidence. As such, a laissez-faire model does not work, but the \u201cvisible hand\u201d of market design has proven superior for letting the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d drive resource investment decisions. More on this later.  <br/>3.\u201cWhile numerous factors such as geography and fuel mix inform the average price of retail electricity, the region with the highest retail prices is New England, where five of the six states have restructured markets. The lowest rates are in regions where none of the states have restructured markets: the East South Central, West North Central, and Mountain regions.\u201d This is factually accurate but alone provides no information on the effect of restructuring on retail electricity prices. Many variables affect retail prices that are very statistically difficult to control for. The report\u2019s implied point comparing across regions is misleading. Consider that New England has higher fuel costs, land values, taxes, environmental compliance costs and labor costs, just to name some factors, than the monopoly regions mentioned. There\u2019s actually evidence that New England\u2019s retail prices would be higher \u2013 and thus the gap with other regions wider \u2013 if it wasn\u2019t mostly restructured.  <br/>Comparing within a region offers a perspective with less noise in these variables. The Midwest is the best regional mix of monopoly and restructured states. Illinois, Michigan and Ohio had the highest retail rates in the Midwest prior to restructuring. Now, Illinois and Ohio \u2013 the only two restructured Midwest states \u2013 have the lowest rates. Michigan remained higher than average.  <br/>It's important to remember states that restructured had higher rates in the first place, so it\u2019s better to compare retail price trends than absolute levels. The weighted-average retail price in monopoly states increased 15% from 2008 to 2016, while it decreased 8% in restructured states.  <br/>4. \u201cSignificant policy discussions at the federal level are currently focusing on what the future \u201cmix\u201d of baseload power should look like to maintain a reliable electric system. One critical question is how consumers will be protected from unanticipated price increases and variability that may arise out of a changing baseload portfolio.\u201d In making this point, the Georgia report cites a study with such profound flaws that the technical lead on the Energy Department\u2019s grid reliability study said it has \u201cso many factual, logical and methodological flaws that it is wholly unsuitable to inform serious public policy.\u201d  <br/>The baseload debate ended in 2017, with the conclusion that baseload retirements are generally a sign of healthy markets. First, baseload is a type of operational mode, not a reliability service. An R Street Institute report separates the political connotation of \u201cbaseload\u201d from the industry definition of the term (e.g., many coal plants no longer operate in a baseload role but retain the political label). Stressing the promotion or retention of baseload is not a relevant policy focus. This perspective is shared by the independent auditors of all competitive wholesale power markets, which view subsidies that prevent so-called \u201cbaseload\u201d retirements as their primary concern.  <br/>The baseload retirement scare has been a false narrative promoted by rent-seeking interests seeking subsidies for unprofitable power plants. The Department of Energy\u2019s 2017 grid reliability study that, if anything, held a bias toward concern over baseload retirements did not find reliability problems. The technical lead on the study said \u201cas a root cause of retirements, wholesale competition worked as intended, driving inefficient, high-cost generation out of the market.\u201d  <br/>5.\u201cElectricity, as an \u201cessential service,\u201d must continue to be provided in an affordable and reliable way that promotes public safety and bolsters resilience to natural disasters.\u201d The report goes on to claim that monopolies are better situated for resiliency and that restructuring could disrupt resiliency efforts by regulatory bodies and monopoly utilities. There\u2019s simply no evidence to back this up (more below). As the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission noted in January, there is no uniform definition for resilience, and the Energy Department highlighted in 2017 that grid operators define criteria for resilience and examine resilience impacts. In short, the concept, let alone metrics, for resiliency are so immature that no definitive conclusion can be reached about the resilient performance of any electric system. As far as reliability goes, competitive power markets have actually demonstrated increasing reliability metrics while lowering costs. The bottom line is the literature shows that competitive markets are capable of attracting sufficient investment for grid reliability, and that the relevant policy question is therefore about the relative economic efficiency of different investment paradigms.  <br/>The report also provides a \u201ccloser look at state-specific experiences.\u201d This cherry-picks four state developments, while ignoring the broader performance indicators of state electricity markets.    In Connecticut, the report notes recent penalties levied on an electricity retailer by state authorities for charging excessive rates. As with any market, predatory or fraudulent tactics can be a concern if consumers are uniformed. A far more robust report on electric retail choice found that smaller customers at the onset of restructuring were vulnerable to fraudulent business behavior because they lacked familiarity with electricity providers and contract terms, but this diminishes as customers become more alert to the possibilities of fraud. That\u2019s a decidedly different take then one cherry-picked example in the Georgia report. Plus, the digital age has unleashed platforms enabling customers to easily evaluate the validity, prices, and quality of services offered by electricity suppliers. Point being, electricity customers are more savvy than ever, which increases the value proposition of competitive markets.  The report cites a decision in 2013 by Maryland regulators to reject a grid resilience charge as evidence that restructured states lack mechanisms to address grid resiliency. This is ridiculous, as restructuring doesn\u2019t inhibit planning and funding mechanisms for transmission and distribution systems, which is where the bulk of resiliency risks exist. At the generation level, where restructuring created competitive markets, nothing prevents the administrators or regulators of these regional markets from pursuing resiliency initiatives. In fact, several are considering them now and have far more potential to achieve resiliency targets at lower cost than monopolies planning in a fragmented, uncoordinated fashion.  The report cites an Illinois law passed in 2016 to subsidize two nuclear power plants as necessary to avoid Illinois importing power from outside the state, to avoid exposure to market volatility and to avoid job losses at the power plants. Importing power is sensible if it\u2019s more affordable \u2013 it\u2019s why economists love free trade \u2013 while job losses are sometimes a necessary part of market evolution (labor transition is outside the scope of energy policy). Most importantly, numerous economists, including the independent auditor of the market these plants participate in, firmly noted that these plants were not needed for grid reliability and that new, lower-cost power plants were driving them out of the market. The subsidies contradicted the premise of restructuring to let markets signal resource entry and exit, while resulting in unnecessarily increasing costs to Illinoisans by over $200 million per year.  The report states that Ohio\u2019s \u201c[c]ompetitive wholesale markets have not developed as anticipated\u201d with studies showing rate increases resulting from restructuring and one of Ohio\u2019s utilities on the brink of bankruptcy. This is misleading and completely misses the mark on the problem. The problem in Ohio has not been underdeveloped wholesale markets but rather retail market intervention that has inhibited the formation of a robust retail market. As recent testimony from the R Street Institute and Ohio consumer groups note, Ohio has been the worst-performing restructured state precisely because they haven\u2019t let markets work. Most problematically, Ohio\u2019s Consumer Counsel has estimated subsidies exceeding $14 billion paid through mandatory charges on customer bills.<br/>Fascinatingly, the report poorly interpreted the results of a study by concluding that restructuring caused rate increases in Ohio. The study indeed found increased rates in most of Ohio after restructuring, but the authors believe this resulted from a \u201cperverse system by which commission intervention distorted true market-basis pricing. Rather than moving to a fully market-based pricing system, the restructuring design allowed all investor-owned utilities to retain protections through a hybridized tariff system133; by which substantial regulated costs are passed through to ratepayers.\u201d  <br/>In a presentation on related empirical analysis, the authors found savings from competitive wholesale markets that should have benefited customers, but instead Ohio implemented a cross-subsidization program that more than cancelled out the benefit of restructuring. They note that this problem could have been averted had restructuring been implemented as recommended by longstanding academic literature. Despite these flaws, another academic study found $15 billion in Ohio consumer savings from restructuring since 2011, but was conveniently excluded from mention in the Georgia paper.  <br/>Lastly, bankruptcy is a natural occurrence in competitive markets, but very rare in the regulated monopoly construct. In Ohio\u2019s case, the entity on the brink of bankruptcy put itself in that position by acquiring assets that couldn\u2019t compete in the age of inexpensive gas. Their folly will fall on shareholders, whereas monopolies that have made comparable decisions will pass the costs along to captive customers. That\u2019s the difference between socializing risk versus placing it on private investors.  <br/>Speaking of socialized risk, it\u2019s important to note the report excluded an examination of the central value components of restructuring in the literature. As noted by Paul Joskow, an economist that pioneered restructuring concepts, the \u201cmost important opportunities for cost savings are associated with long-run investments in generating capacity.\u201d The economic discipline imposed by restructuring drove investors to make more prudent decisions in response to shifts in natural gas prices, fluctuations in demand, environmental compliance, consumer preferences and new technological advances. This has saved tens of billions of dollars, at least, in generating capacity cost savings.  <br/>Meanwhile, monopoly utilities have continued the poor investment decisions of decades prior \u2013 the worst being the atrocious \u201cmega-project\u201d decisions in the region the study emphasizes \u2013 the Southeast. Just three monopoly power plants in the Southeast will cost consumers tens of billions in excess. For a study authored by Georgians, it\u2019s incredible that the billions in cost overruns at the Vogtle nuclear power plant \u2013 a direct result of the perverse incentive structure of the Georgia monopoly paradigm \u2013 received no mention in a paper on the regulated monopoly paradigm.  <br/>The report repeats the theme of the regulated monopoly model serving consumer\u2019s interests. In that case, surely sophisticated consumer groups would flock to the regulated monopoly model! But that\u2019s not the case. Customers are spearheading the rejuvenation of the electric competition movement, led by retailers, big tech companies and reinvigorated industrials. For example, Wal-Mart backed the Florida restructuring initiative because it estimated $15 million per year in savings at its Florida stores. Overall, the company has seen its costs decline in states with electric competition, which lowers costs to its retail consumers.  <br/>Altogether, the report\u2019s detachment from the economic literature and practitioners\u2019 experiences renders the key points and conclusions of the study highly suspect. The literature cited is very selective, and the report\u2019s interpretation of that literature is consistently one-sided and sometimes dead wrong. The report rehashes monopoly utilities\u2019 talking points that have been empirically debunked, calling into question why this reads like more of a PR document than academic piece. It should not form a basis for informing policy discussions. An accurate assessment of the issues raised in the report reaches the opposite conclusion \u2013 the value of competition has clearly exceeded the value of regulated monopolies.  <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN613564520180222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RPR-R0Y1-DXCW-D1FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2469\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 22, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Media reports indicated that TikTok plans to sue the Trump administration--as soon as this week--challenging his executive order banning the service from the U.S.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This could be a good deal for Microsoft, depending on the price that they pay and what they intend to do with it,\" said Tarek Sayed, a University of Miami alumnus and a business technology lecturer in the Miami Herbert Business School.</p><p>The names of other buyers have been circulated, but Microsoft is the leading contender for a host of reasons, not the least of which is that it appears to be the government's hand-picked favorite. Yet the sale--and its potentially colossal price tag--carries an abundance of risk.</p><p>\"I am not convinced that just because TikTok went viral, that any company should spend $50 billion on it. Why hand them the money?\" asked Sayed, who is also associate director of software architecture at the School of Law. \"It will be like many other apps that are forgotten after a time. But again, Microsoft has been looking for something sexy in the consumer space. This might be a way to attract youngsters and compete with Apple, Google, and Facebook, but at $50 billion?\"</p><p>The announcement of a possible ban of the app in the United States prompted an uproar amid the TikTok faithful--the company claims 30 million monthly active U.S. users who spend an average 46 minutes a day on the app. Forty-two percent are ages 18 to 24, and 27 percent are ages 13 to 17.</p><p>The U.S. government alleges that ByteDance shares information with the Chinese government--a allegation it has denied--and charged in early July that the company had violated its agreement to protect children's privacy. Media reports suggested that a ban of the immensely popular app could have repercussions politically.</p><p>The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an inter-agency body chaired by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, confirmed that it launched an investigation of ByteDance in November 2019 for possible violations. The agency, which includes representatives of 16 agencies--including Defense, State, and Homeland Security--reviews transactions for national security risk.</p><p>Established in 1975 amid fears that wealthy Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries companies would buy U.S. firms, CFIUS has seen its powers expanded over time. Legislation spurred by the current administration, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018, further broadened the agency's powers and those of the president to address security concerns, especially relating to Chinese firms investing in U.S. high-tech companies, as reported by the Congressional Research Service.</p><p>According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a U.S.-based think tank, CFIUS reviewed 552 transactions between 2015 and 2017 and more than 25 percent were China-based--the most by far of any country.</p><p>Joan Martinez-Evora, a lecturer in the Business Law Department, emphasized the ethical considerations of the unfolding scenario and drew attention to the two executive orders issued in early August that threaten to ban TikTok based on national security concerns relating to the International Emergency Powers Act and the National Emergencies Act.</p><p>\"On one hand, arguments have been made that TikTok data collection practices are standard in the industry and that it is really a security and privacy concern for the few in the greater pool of TikTok clients, such as U.S. government officials, political dissidents, and U.S. military personnel, but not so much for ordinary U.S. citizens and youth,\" Martinez-Evora pointed out.</p><p>Both in business and in law, Martinez-Evora has studied ethical considerations. He addressed the fact that business transactions--especially global ones of massive scale--often transcend the economic into the political arena.</p><p>\"We have to be careful with those 'greater good analysis in international business ethics' because then we are forgetting the justice element,\" he cautioned.</p><p>\"It's true that we are talking about millions of users of TikTok, and the monetary gains may be rewarding. But at what cost?\" Martinez-Evora asked. He referred specifically to the Chinese government's suppression of political dissidents in China and Hong Kong, the ethnic oppression of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, and the spreading of disinformation.</p><p>The ends do not justify the means, he noted.</p><p>\"Some principles are just universal--humans and businesses have virtues, values, and freedoms,\" said Martinez-Evora. \"When state-owned businesses like TikTok and Huawei [also accused by the U.S. of aiding Chinese government spying efforts] are used as means to achieve the wrong goals--to become the next global economic superpower--other businesses, the country, and the world is certainly not better off.\"</p><p>Sayed suggested that the threatened ban appears more a tactic than a potential reality.</p><p>\"The ban or executive order doesn't add much. It steps up the pressure on the company to finish the transaction, but there are consequential legal and constitutional issues that may arise,\" he said. \"The more likely scenario if negotiations fail is to add the company to the Commerce Department's Entity List and prevent U.S. companies from doing business with them, including Apple and Google.\"</p><p>The other major issue in the scenario pertains to data protection, Sayed stated.</p><p>\"If we're going to start down the road of data privacy, we will have to look at all the social media apps then,\" he said \"You can say that any device or app that is connected to the Internet is a national security threat. And, you can even extend that argument to some U.S. companies if they happen to share data access with employees who are foreign nationals working in an International subsidiary.\"</p><p>By and large, data privacy has been left to the consumer--at least up until now.</p><p>\"The U.S. doesn't have an overarching privacy framework,\" Sayed pointed out. \"We put responsibility on the consumer instead of restricting or regulating businesses, with the exception of a few sectors--health, banking, and education. The idea is, let's not over-regulate, so we don't choke industries and innovations.\"</p><p>He also referred to the recent hearings where the big tech companies--Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google--were grilled by members of both parties of the House antitrust subcommittee regarding their market powers.</p><p>\"Competition practices is one of the issues that Microsoft is going to have to worry about in this acquisition,\" he said. \"But they have stayed clear of any of those issues in recent times. They are probably the only company who could get in and make an offer on TikTok nicely and cleanly.''</p><p>ByteDance spent $1 billion in November 2017 to acquire the Chinese-headquartered and U.S.-based social video app \"Musical.ly.\" The company merged the platform with TikTok in August 2018 to create the world's largest short-video app.</p><p>TikTok stands to be a big winner if the sale progresses, Sayed suggested.</p><p>\"This is a great opportunity for TikTok,\" Sayed remarked. \"Who gets a price like this and says no? Unless the Chinese government has other views, and we don't know that yet.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7207970 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7207970</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KH-KGY1-JC11-11DJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1304\"/><timeReceived>2:17 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 14, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

He addressed the fact that business transactions--especially global ones of massive scale--often transcend the economic into the political arena.</p><p>\"We have to be careful with those 'greater good analysis in international business ethics' because then we are forgetting the justice element,\" he cautioned.</p><p>\"It's true that we are talking about millions of users of TikTok, and the monetary gains may be rewarding. But at what cost?\" Martinez-Evora asked. He referred specifically to the Chinese government's suppression of political dissidents in China and Hong Kong, the ethnic oppression of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, and the spreading of disinformation.</p><p>The ends do not justify the means, he noted.</p><p>\"Some principles are just universal--humans and businesses have virtues, values, and freedoms,\" said Martinez-Evora. \"When state-owned businesses like TikTok and Huawei [also accused by the U.S. of aiding Chinese government spying efforts] are used as means to achieve the wrong goals--to become the next global economic superpower--other businesses, the country, and the world is certainly not better off.\"</p><p>Sayed suggested that the threatened ban appears more a tactic than a potential reality.</p><p>\"The ban or executive order doesn't add much. It steps up the pressure on the company to finish the transaction, but there are consequential legal and constitutional issues that may arise,\" he said. \"The more likely scenario if negotiations fail is to add the company to the Commerce Department's Entity List and prevent U.S. companies from doing business with them, including Apple and Google.\"</p><p>The other major issue in the scenario pertains to data protection, Sayed stated.</p><p>\"If we're going to start down the road of data privacy, we will have to look at all the social media apps then,\" he said \"You can say that any device or app that is connected to the Internet is a national security threat. And, you can even extend that argument to some U.S. companies if they happen to share data access with employees who are foreign nationals working in an International subsidiary.\"</p><p>By and large, data privacy has been left to the consumer--at least up until now.</p><p>\"The U.S. doesn't have an overarching privacy framework,\" Sayed pointed out. \"We put responsibility on the consumer instead of restricting or regulating businesses, with the exception of a few sectors--health, banking, and education. The idea is, let's not over-regulate, so we don't choke industries and innovations.\"</p><p>He also referred to the recent hearings where the big tech companies--Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google--were grilled by members of both parties of the House antitrust subcommittee regarding their market powers.</p><p>\"Competition practices is one of the issues that Microsoft is going to have to worry about in this acquisition,\" he said. \"But they have stayed clear of any of those issues in recent times. They are probably the only company who could get in and make an offer on TikTok nicely and cleanly.''</p><p>ByteDance spent $1 billion in November 2017 to acquire the Chinese-headquartered and U.S.-based social video app \"Musical.ly.\" The company merged the platform with TikTok in August 2018 to create the world's largest short-video app.</p><p>TikTok stands to be a big winner if the sale progresses, Sayed suggested.</p><p>\"This is a great opportunity for TikTok,\" Sayed remarked. \"Who gets a price like this and says no? Unless the Chinese government has other views, and we don't know that yet.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7206004 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7206004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K6-H2T1-DYG2-R3RT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1297\"/><timeReceived>7:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The panel brought together a global group of business leaders, advisers and researchers, including:</p><p>Professor Frederik Anseel, Associate Dean Research, UNSW Business School;</p><p>David Gram, innovation thought leader and co-founder of Diplomatic Rebels based in Denmark;</p><p>Rainbow Cheung, Sustainability Lead at SalesForce Asia Pacific, Singapore; and</p><p>Gordon Renouf, CEO of Good On You.</p><p>Despite technology being the root of many environmental and social problems, it is also key to addressing environmental degradation, climate change, food scarcity, waste management, and other pressing global challenges, Dr Fitzgerald said.</p><p>For innovation to happen, Prof. Anseel encouraged bridging the gap between academics and the industry to exchange information and perspectives. He envisioned an open platform - a community environment enabling a fruitful exchange of ideas to tackle current issues.</p><p>David Gram saw \"the biggest challenge with business model innovation as the existing business model itself\".</p><p>\"Innovation is required to constantly adapt to change, whether it's caused by disruptions such as climate risk, consumer behaviour, new regulations or a pandemic,\" he said.</p><p>What are the key requirements for digital innovation?</p><p>Mr Gram observed that coming up with ideas is the easy part of the process.</p><p>\"The biggest challenge lies in commercialising the idea - how to launch and scale an idea that is entirely new without using your existing business model.</p><p>\"And this is where you need to think in a different way because to work in a different way, you need to structure your organisation in a different way.\"</p><p>Mr Gram advised businesses looking to innovate to switch to an ambidextrous organisation and leadership style.</p><p>That could mean working at different levels of innovation: from keeping with the existing model while innovating, to using technology to digitise business processes to adopting completely new models that will transform the business.</p><p>\"Only the fewest companies are able to achieve [the latter] level. We have seen big tech companies really driving this type of change,\" Mr Gram said.</p><p>Google is the perfect example of an ambidextrous organisation. By creating Alphabet as an umbrella organisation, Google was able to run things more independently and expand into domains outside of internet search.</p><p>\"In my experience, there needs to be a separate organisation co-existing alongside the mothership to be innovative. If not, the immune system of that existing business will try to kill off the new business,\" Mr Gram said.</p><p>How can innovation and technology drive sustainability?</p><p>The panel provided examples of businesses doing just this. Gordon Renouf discussed Good On You, a mission-driven-for-profit company that has been successful in encouraging fashion brands worldwide to innovate in sustainable ways.</p><p>The Good On You app and website (<url normalizedValue=\"https://goodonyou.eco/\">https://goodonyou.eco/</url>) use technology to enable consumers to \"wear the change they want to see\". By rating more than 2,500 fashion brands on their ethical and sustainability practices, Good On You enables consumers to choose responsible fashion brands and make a more informed purchase decision.</p><p>Rainbow Cheung also spoke about the global sustainability strategy and initiatives at Salesforce - the world's largest CRM company. Salesforce sees the environment as a key stakeholder and has made the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) a goal of their own through their sustainability initiatives.</p><p>Ms Cheung described COVID-19 as bringing us all face-to-face with three major crises: climate, economic and health crises. Salesforce's goal is to bring together all three issues and serve both internal and external clients and our shared environment. Their 'sustainability cloud' product is a carbon accounting solution that aims to provide an efficient and accessible means of measuring complex variables that is available to their partners and stakeholders.</p><p>Ms Cheung also shared how Salesforce used technology to rapidly and flexibly respond to the pandemic. They recognised the need to be transparent with their employees and the need to be innovative with their software to provide a package that emergency healthcare response teams could use to triage problems as they arose.</p><p>Salesforce has since joined a World Economic Forum initiative called Uplink which shares information and strategies to solve global problems, with partnering institutions.</p><p>Advice for business leaders to better manage climate risk</p><p>Dr Fitzgerald advised certain actions would be required by all sectors of the economy to fully address climate risk.</p><p>\"Investing in environmentally friendly technologies, supporting industry to innovate, rolling up cleaner, cheaper and healthier forms of private and public transport, decarbonising the energy sector and ensuring more efficient working with international partners will be required to improve global environmental standards,\" she said.</p><p>Mr Gram recommended diversifying one's portfolio to include climate change as a future investment.</p><p>\"The world will probably go greener, so you need to start investing into this future to be part of it. That's the model I would advise companies and leaders to adopt when looking at climate risk,\" Mr Gram said.</p><p>As to how to motivate businesses to stand up for climate change action, Prof. Anseel said businesses need to be convinced that sustainability is a viable and profitable investment.</p><p>\"Business leaders will change their practices as soon as they are aware that sustainability is a sensible investment and there's a whole economy behind it. To get businesses onboard, we need to learn how to frame the whole climate change debate in those terms,\" Prof. Anseel said.</p><p>How can business schools help in addressing climate risk?</p><p>While there is a certain degree of risk when an organisation tries to innovate, Prof. Anseel said it is worth a try as the Business School is ready for change. The new challenge for business schools around the world is how to harness our best ideas to tackle pressing issues such as climate change.</p><p>\"At UNSW Business School, we have many brilliant researchers interested in working on issues like the economics of climate change or the psychology of climate change. My idea is to build knowledge hubs within the Business School and across faculties that are completely dedicated to challenges such as climate change.</p><p>\"Within these hubs, the best knowledge and research come together with the best ideas and insights from business and the result is a fruitful exchange of ideas to tackle the serious problems we face.\"</p><p>Responsible business research and education has a role to play in motivating businesses to stand up for climate action.</p><p>\"There's a movement called responsible research happening in various business schools worldwide. Under this new agenda, we will be able to gather all our investments, efforts and research to meet our sustainable development goals,\" Prof. Anseel said.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7174961 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7174961</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C3-N451-DYG2-R05N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1275\"/><timeReceived>9:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 15, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

With jobs ranging from environmental policy to criminal justice reform to antitrust enforcement, 168 students will receive a historically high $710,351 in grants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The student-administered Public Interest Law Association summer fellowship program provides grants to law students who accept low-paying or unpaid public service internships. Fellowships are funded by voluntary contributions and the Law School Foundation, and are disbursed by the Law School's Mortimer Caplin Public Service Center.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Our combined experiences make us stronger, and these grants provide ways for students to grow and experience unique career paths with the support of the UVA Law community behind them,\" PILA President Sara Wendel '21 said. \"Spending my 1L summer interning in New York City for a juvenile public defender was one of the most memorable and influential experiences of my life.\"</p><p>The grants will benefit 133 first-year students, who will each receive $3,750 in funding, and 35 second-year students, who receive $6,500. With many employers' operations affected by COVID-19 closures, most students will be working remotely.</p><p>\"This year, more than ever, I'm grateful that we're able to provide guaranteed funding to all our students interested in both public service and judicial internships,\" said Annie Kim '99, assistant dean for public service and director of the Mortimer Caplin Public Service Center. \"PILA grants have been an important tradition at UVA Law for decades. I still remember opening my grant check as a 1L intern at the Fairfax Public Defender's Office, back when PILA was called 'Student Funded Fellowships' and grants weren't guaranteed.\"</p><p>Student recipients are required to apply and qualify for the funding by volunteering their time for pro bono work -- 40 hours for first-year students and 80 hours for second-year students. Grantees must also have secured a public service position and agree to donate hours back to PILA, which founded the grant program. Here's a look at what four of the fellows have planned.

I hope to work in their criminal justice practice, supporting ongoing litigation and policy campaigns with legal research and writing.</p><p>Goals: I'm focused on criminal justice reform, so I'm looking forward to getting into the nitty gritty of how an organization can tackle systemic change through strategic litigation and policy advocacy. I hope to come away with a better sense of how local projects are conceived and organized to aid national reform. And of course, I'm looking to connect with and learn from people who are using their power and training to work toward a more just, more equitable society.</p><p>Austin Hetrick '21</p><p>Hometown: Fort Wayne, Indiana</p><p>College/education: University of Wisconsin, Madison, B.A. in English; University of Virginia, Ph.D. in English</p><p>Summer job: Natural Resources Defense Council, New York</p><p>What he'll be doing: I'll be supporting the staff at NRDC New York in one of several divisions: Energy &amp; Transportation, Environmental Justice, Litigation, New York, Oceans, or Water. I'm hoping for Litigation, but wherever I end up, I'm looking forward to conducting legal research and writing in support of clean air, clean water and healthy communities.</p><p>Goals: NRDC brings together a diverse set of experts, and I'm excited to learn from all of them. I'm especially looking forward to learning how NRDC's skilled attorneys prepare for complex litigation, but I'm also hoping to learn more about how the organization leverages partnerships, community advocacy and scientific expertise to advance its mission.</p><p>Donna Faye Imadi '22</p><p>Hometown: Alexandria, Virginia</p><p>College/education: George Mason University, B.A. in global affairs, B.A. in international conflict analysis and resolution</p><p>Summer job: Federal Trade Commission, Bureau of Competition, Technology Enforcement Division, Washington, D.C.</p><p>What she'll be doing: The Bureau of Competition is critical to the enforcement of U.S. antitrust laws that form the foundation of our nation's free-market economy, prohibiting monopolistic conduct and conspiracies in restraint of trade. At the newly designated Technology Enforcement Division, I will be working with attorneys in examining technology in markets (such as Facebook, Google and Amazon), monitoring competition, examining industry practices and conducting investigations. The Technology Enforcement Division also conducts prospective merger reviews in the tech sector. Especially pertinent will be issues in big tech.</p><p>Goals: In light of the shock to the global supply chain per COVID-19's impact, I'll pursue engaging on how our nation's antitrust law enforcement will influence the economy's ability to bounce back and provide sustenance for consumers in the marketplace. Further, I look forward to specifically contributing to cutting-edge work on technology enforcement (such as with Google, Amazon and Facebook) as it becomes increasingly significant in the lives of average Americans, reinvigorating a critical debate in the antitrust and policy realm about antitrust in the digital economy. My goals are to gain skills in analyzing how our regulatory laws will be molded in the new wave of 21st-century tech, in addition to working with attorneys on rapid development of how businesses can best coordinate in service to the American people amidst the global crisis.</p><p>Sydney Phipps '22</p><p>Hometown: Dallas</p><p>College/education: Penn State University, B.S. in marketing</p><p>Summer job: Dallas County District Attorney's Office</p><p>What she'll be doing: As an intern, I will assist the prosecutors and investigators with legal research and briefing, investigation of cases, preparation for trial, taking notes in the courtroom and helping wherever else is needed during trial.

And, in doing so, move beyond the traditional, but many would argue outdated, focus on the standard strategy fare of financial and market competition oriented metrics.</p><p>It might be to fulfil a corporate duty to make a positive impact on society, as with benefit corporations in the US, for example. Or that executive decision makers believe the effects of emerging technologies on society so profound that it is the 'right' thing to do, part of new social contract that gives organisations license to operate.</p><p>Another possible impetus is the commercial considerations associated with consumer demands for greater ethical and social responsibility from product and service providers. At its most basic, given the additional burdens imposed by the introduction of data protection regulations following widespread, digitally-enabled, commoditisation of data and pillaging of privacy, it might simply be for risk mitigation purposes.</p><p>It is not indifference that prevents action, either. Our research indicates that executives are concerned about the effects of emerging technologies on society. Instead, the issue for many organisations is a glaring gap in their strategy toolkit, limiting their ability to make social impact evaluation a proactive part of operations, and the creation and development of products and services.</p><p>As a result, and with so many companies heavily investing in AI technologies and adapting business models accordingly, we have created the Social Impact Strategy Analysis (SISA) strategy tool. It was developed based on our experience of more than 30 one or two-day workshops, involving more than 500 internal and external stakeholders, at a Fortune 50 multinational technology corporation headquartered in Silicon Valley, California.</p><p>The SISA methodology can be used to evaluate plausible systemic risks and benefits associated with AI technologies (or other emerging technologies) and related products and services, across a range of social factors such as environment, energy and 'society' (ethics, economics, gender, culture and language). It is a flexible tool that can be used by emerging technology innovators and users, as an individual or group process, to investigate social impact at a number of levels, from individual communities to society more broadly.</p><p>Importantly, the SISA approach is an open and participative process designed to incorporate a range of stakeholder perspectives, including those of affected communities and citizens, before any deployment of an innovative technology enabled product or service.</p><p>Once the technology associated challenge or opportunity has been established, the SISA strategy exercise follows a number of distinct steps. These can be loosely divided into three stages: the initial setup; understanding the value ecosystem; and the social impact factor analysis.</p><p>The four steps in the initial set-up - participation, prioritisation, use case and content - cover the selection of participants, deciding on and prioritising the social factors to be analysed, clarifying and describing the use case, and gathering factor and use case related information to be used during the second and third stage.</p><p>Our methodology is designed to accommodate the analysis of up to eight factors relevant to the use case. It is important to select social factors that allow for a discussion about the dynamic interaction and interplay between the technology and factors (rather than just the one-way impact of technology on the factors).</p><p>The second stage establishes the context for the proposed use case using three separate questions: 'Where are we?' maps out the existing platform ecosystem landscape for the specific technology; 'where might we go?' explores the likely evolutions of that landscape; while 'why should we go there?' identifies potential benefits and opportunities available in that future landscape.</p><p>How to use the Social Impact Strategy Analysis tool</p><p>For autonomous vehicles (AVs), for example, the platform landscape might include elements such as safety and security, autonomy, intelligent manufacturing and on-board sensors. In turn the onboard sensors layer would contain sub-categories, such as location, vision/camera, and LIDAR and RADAR navigation systems.</p><p>Exploring the evolution of the landscape using two dimensions - the nature of the passenger-vehicle contract and type of driving control (for exmaple, human or autonomous system) - might suggest that a shift from ownership and human control to ride-sharing and autonomous systems is highly likely. Lastly, in terms of the potential opportunity, further analysis could outline the predicted economic impact of AVs (some $7 trillion in relation to consumer and business products and services).</p><p>Having established the platform landscape and the organisation's position within it, present and future, the next stage is to analyse the interaction between technology and selected social factors. For AVs, that might include energy and environment, with risk-benefit analysis considering the impact on emissions, the energy consumption of different AV technologies, and the energy and environmental effects of battery manufacture and disposal.</p><p>Analysis of an economics factor, might weigh potential benefits arising from reduced healthcare costs due to lower accident frequency alongside issues such as predicted job losses.</p><p>The final step is to summarise the aggregate results of the SISA exercise. A simple way of doing this would be using a risks/benefits scorecard covering all of the factors.</p><p>Adopting an open, design thinking approach to strategy development is a fundamental part of the SISA methodology. Rather than having small group, closed, top-down decision-making, the aim is to design an open middle-out, bottom-up process.</p><p>A range of stakeholders from the technology's ecosystem should be included, from frontline and mid-level staff outside the relevant business unit, but still inside the organisation, to suppliers, customers, regulators and government agencies.</p><p>One of the main benefits to this approach, besides accessing specialist knowledge and insight, is the potential for creating buy-in for a proposed strategy while, at the same time, identifying blindspots, pitfalls and maximising risk mitigation.</p><p>It is unlikely that any single tool will deliver solutions for all of the strategy challenges an organisation faces. However, adopting an open, participative, design thinking perspective alongside the SISA tool, should at least improve the overall quality of strategy development.</p><p>It provides organisations with a means of evaluating, representing and sharing the potential impact of interactions between technology enabled use cases and relevant social factors. All stakeholders in a platform ecosystem with access to this information can use the analysis to game a range of scenarios and inform relevant decision-making processes.</p><p>In a broader context, there is an ongoing debate about the evolution of capitalism, prompted by criticism concerning the fairness of capitalism in its traditional and dominant form.</p><p>If the status quo persists, the effects of introducing emerging technologies into almost every aspect of our lives may only serve to accentuate and exacerbate any problems with the current system.</p><p>Conversely, providing the people affected by these technologies with an opportunity to influence their development and use through open strategy tools such as SISA is likely to benefit creators, consumers and society more generally.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7202367 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7202367</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60J0-TP31-JC11-10WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1404\"/><timeReceived>8:20 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 7, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It's developing into a serious area of study in lots of different areas.</p><p>'There's more to them than first meets the eye.'</p><p>Dr Seargeant said psychologists now study emojis, communications academics look at the symbols, and marketing students. </p><p>They can teach us about the future of language and also affect identity and politics.</p><p>And the symbols are now being used for more serious forms of communication.</p><p>Dr Seargeant said: 'When you have public mourning over tragedies, a lot of people will use emojis to express their feelings.</p><p>'Politicians are using them for specific things. When Robert Mugabe died, his son just posted an emoji.</p><p>                     Are emojis ruining the English language?                   </p><p>Emojis may be a fun form of communication but they are destroying the English language, a recent study by Google has revealed.</p><p>Smiley faces, love hearts, thumbs up and other cartoon icons - rather than words - are the preferred method of communication by teenagers, who are considered the worst offenders regarding the decline in grammar and punctuation.</p><p>More than a third of British adults believe emojis are the reason for the deterioration in proper language usage, according to the study commissioned by the Google-owned site YouTube.</p><p>Of the two thousand adults, aged 16 to 65, who were asked their views, 94 per cent reckoned English was in a state of decline, with 80 per cent citing youngsters as the worst offenders.</p><p>The most common errors made by Brits are spelling mistakes (21 per cent), followed closely by apostrophe placement (16 per cent) and the misuse of a comma (16 per cent).</p><p>More than half of British adults are not confident with their command of spelling and grammar, the study also found.</p><p>Furthermore, around three-quarters of adults rely on emoji to communicate, in addition to a dependence on predictive text and spell checking.</p><p>The use of emojis has seeped into our culture to such an extent that the Oxford Dictionary's 'Word of the Year' in 2015 wasn't actually a word at all - it was the Face With Tears emoji, which shows just how influential the little graphic images have become.</p><p>They were first used by Japanese mobile phone companies in the late 1990s to express an emotion, concept or message in a simple, graphic way.</p><p>'They are a way of expressing emotions in online written language. This is so important in modern politics.'</p><p>Dr Seargeant said political parties are likely to use more emojis than ever before in the December election.</p><p>The Conservatives have been using the tick symbol to highlight their proposed policies.</p><p>Boris Johnson posted about Brexit, more police officers and more money for the NHS each with an emoji in front of the topic.</p><p>Labour have been using emojis to encourage people to register to vote, and repost the party's campaign images.</p><p>Dr Seargeant said: 'Emojis are now not just part of written campaign literature, but also used with visual messages.</p><p>'A lot of candidates are doing videos from the campaign trail, and emojis are being used to add messages to that.</p><p>'Along with memes and Instagram stories, we are definitely seeing a move in this election to a more visual shorthand way of communicating.</p><p>'People are now far more literate with them.'</p><p>Emojis have existed for 20 years but for more than a decade they were only used in Japan.</p><p>There are currently 3,178 official emojis, but in 2010, there were just 625.</p><p>They are strictly regulated by the big tech companies and released in annual batches.</p><p>The latest release, last month, included non-binary versions of most human emojis.</p><p>'Emojis, unlike any other form of language, is controlled by a little group of corporations.

The nonprofit organization NOYB -- short for ''none of your business'' -- claimed that Googleand Facebook, along with two of Facebook's subsidiaries, WhatsApp and Instagram, failed to give European users specific control over the use of their data, in violation of the new rules.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The complaints, which were filed in France, Belgium, Germany and Austria, ask regulators to impose fines of as much as $4.3 billion on Google's parent company, Alphabet, and $1.5 billion each on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp -- roughly 4 percent of each company's 2017 revenue, the maximum penalty allowed under the G.D.P.R.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Even for cash-flush tech giants, those would be painful checks to write.</p><p>  The architect of NOYB's campaign is Max Schrems, 30, an Austrian lawyer who has made a career of hounding American tech giants over their data-collection practices. Several years ago, when he was still in law school, Mr. Schrems took on Facebookwith a series of legal complaints, claiming the social network was violating European data protection laws.</p><p>  Later, Mr. Schrems successfully challenged the ''Safe Harbor'' policies that let tech companies store data about Europeans in the United States. That case sent shock waves through the tech industry, and made him a hero among digital privacy hawks. Edward Snowden, the whistle-blower and activist, declared that Mr. Schrems had ''changed the world for the better.''</p><p>  I spoke with Mr. Schrems on Monday, several days after the start of his new privacy crusade. He said that while the timing of his latest volley was mainly symbolic -- the organization had been preparing complaints against Facebookand Googlefor months -- its substance was very real.</p><p>  ''It was important to point that out the first day, that this is not compliant,'' Mr. Schrems told me. Facebookand Google, he said, have ''fundamentally tried to ignore or redefine'' the new European laws by forcing users to consent to wide-ranging data collection, without telling them exactly how their data would be used.</p><p>  ''All of these cases should be absolutely won,'' he added.</p><p>  Tech companies never thought that Europe's data collection rules would be painless. But they may not have anticipated the chaos that unfurled last week, as lawyers rushed to tease apart the law's complications and companies barraged people with messages about their new, G.D.P.R.-compliant privacy policies.</p><p>  As other countries also look to establish their own European-style privacy regulations, the potential impact of the G.D.P.R. across the globe has turned a feeding frenzy of ambitious lawyers, lobbyists and activists into a kind of crowdsourced rule-making process that will ultimately determine how the new rules are enforced.</p><p>  There has already been fallout from the G.D.P.R. in the digital media and advertising industries, where the new rules caused several American publications to shut themselves off to European users and the market for certain invasive types of digital advertising dried up. Faced with the prospect of stiff penalties, a few smaller American tech companies threw up their hands and stopped serving Europe altogether.</p><p>  As global companies, Facebookand Googledon't have the option of cutting off the Continent. In statements, both companies defended their data collection practices, saying they fully complied with the new European regulations.</p><p>  ''We have prepared for the past 18 months to ensure we meet the requirements of the G.D.P.R.,'' Erin Egan, Facebook's chief privacy officer, said in a statement. ''We have made our policies clearer, our privacy settings easier to find, and introduced better tools for people to access, download and delete their information.''</p><p>  A Google spokesman, Al Verney, said, ''We build privacy and security into our products from the very earliest stages and are committed to complying with the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation.''</p><p>  At the core of Mr. Schrems's complaints is the question of whether tech companies are giving people realistic choices about how their data is collected and used.</p><p>  Like many companies, Facebookand Google, which developed the Android mobile operating system, prompted users last week to accept new terms of service that explained their data collection particulars. Facebookmembers who declined to accept the new terms were unable to log into their accounts. Android users who didn't agree to the new terms were, in effect, locked out of their phones.</p><p>  Mr. Schrems said these all-or-nothing privacy policies violated the G.D.P.R.'s requirement that consent be particularized and ''freely given.'' To comply with the law, he said, large tech platforms need to give privacy-conscious users the option of sharing certain types of data but not others.</p><p>  Realistically, Mr. Schrems said, ''you're not going to walk away from all your friends on Facebook.''</p><p>  Opponents of the G.D.P.R. have said the law could end up backfiring by making it harder for smaller companies, which don't tend to have huge teams of European legal experts at their disposal, to compete with the American tech giants. It could mean that European users are required to pay more for certain internet services, to offset reduced advertising revenue. (The Washington Post is already offering an ad- and tracking-free ''premium E.U. subscription'' that costs 50 percent more than a regular subscription.) In a worst-case scenario, it could turn Europe into a kind of technological dead zone, a place where influential American tech companies simply refuse to tread.</p><p>  Mr. Schrems shrugged off these concerns. The European market is too lucrative for companies like Googleand Facebookto abandon, he said. And he doesn't believe that social networks and search engines would suffer unduly if they were forced to be more judicious about how they collected fine-grain data about people for the purposes of selling more ads.</p><p>  ''You can still make a lot of money without microtargeting,'' he said.</p><p>  Mr. Schrems's quest is far from finished. Regulators could decide not to pursue investigations, expensive litigation could drag on for years, and Silicon Valley companies are furiously adding lobbyists to try to influence the nascent rule-making process.</p><p>  But if these types of complaints succeed -- and it's not entirely crazy to think that they could, given the current antipathy toward American tech giants and the satisfaction that European officials might take in kneecapping a few of them -- it could be a watershed moment for large tech companies.</p><p>  ''Massive fines in this case would have pretty significant repercussions,'' said Courtney M. Bowman, a lawyer at the firm Proskauer Rose who specializes in international privacy law. ''It would be a strong signal from the E.U. authorities that this isn't just a law that's on the books that isn't going to be enforced,'' she said.</p><p>  Whether or not Facebookand Googleend up paying billion-dollar fines, it's clear that the G.D.P.R. has already introduced a new, scary variable into Silicon Valley's privacy calculations. If tech giants know that privacy wonks like Mr. Schrems are watching their moves carefully, probing for openings to file complaints against them -- and now, they undoubtedly do -- they will need to think twice before adding new, privacy-invading features.</p><p>  ''It's about who has control over information in an information age,'' Mr. Schrems said. ''Who has power over all this stuff?''</p><p>  Email Kevin Roose at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kevin.roose@nytimes.com\">kevin.roose@nytimes.com</email>, or follow him on Facebookat facebook.com/kevinroose and on Twitter: @kevinroose.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Litigation led by the privacy activist Max Schrems accuses Facebook, Google, Instagram and WhatsApp of failing to comply with Europe's new privacy rules.

For many of us, our digital lives are as important as our physical lives. Digital infrastructure adds a new foundation that complements physical infrastructure in addressing India's economic and social development needs - and it can do so faster, better, cheaper and at population scale. Today, with digital platforms, technology infrastructure can be shared by both government and private sector entities, which can leverage it to create new solutions and enhance citizens' experience. </p><p><br/> The National Digital Health Mission announced by the Prime Minister envisions an open digital ecosystem for healthcare. Telemedicine, e-pharmacy and hospital services can be delivered with an inter-operable tech platform using personal health records and health facilities information. <br/> The Open Digital Ecosytems (ODE) framework is an approach to designing digital infrastructure to realise the full potential of the infrastructure while minimising risks and possible harms. The framework has three layers, and they are analogous to how we think about physical infrastructure too. The first is the tech layer or the actual infrastructure itself. In digital infrastructure, our 'highways' are the tech platforms. In India, we are now coalescing around the shared understanding that tech platforms need to be modular, open API, open source and interoperable.<br/> The second layer is governance: the \"rules of the game\" and the institutions that uphold them. Here too the issues are similar to physical infrastructure. Who is responsible for creating and maintaining infrastructure - government, private sector or PPP mechanisms? Who should own it? Who pays for the services - governments or users? Do we need a regulator? What is the recourse in case of harms? Like we have speed limits for road safety, and aviation security norms, issues related to data privacy and security in the digital world need addressing.<br/> The third layer is community engagement. Community refers to entrepreneurs and other builders who ensure that the infrastructure actually gets used and solutions are built on top. It also refers to tech developers and civil society organisations who engage to ensure continuous improvements and hold government to account. We saw the crucial role civil society and the media played in Aadhaar. The healthy debates of democracy led to a fundamental right to privacy enshrined in the Constitution, and legal guardrails on where and how Aadhaar may be used.<br/> India has been a pioneer in the first layer - digital infrastructure. Aadhaar and the India Stack are powerful examples of 'digital highways' with a vision to enable traffic of all kinds of services that can ride atop. We were one of the first developing countries to have a population scale digital identity, and have built a low cost digital payments infrastructure. <br/> The Covid pandemic has made us more dependent than ever before on this digital infrastructure and the services and applications on top. And during this pandemic, the government was able to transfer \u20b937,000 crore directly to the bank accounts of 16 crore citizens using India's digital infrastructure.<br/> Initial phase  India is in the initial phase of the journey on the governance and community layers. But they are as important as the tech layer. The pandemic has starkly revealed the limitations of digital platforms, with many sections of the population excluded. <br/> The world has also realised the potential harms of concentration of data, and hence, power, in 'Big Tech' platforms. Critical issues like privacy and individual's control over their personal data, as well as the security and sovereignty of data are being hotly debated both globally and in India.<br/> Such issues are even more critical for state owned digital platforms, since many more people are depend on them for basic services. For example, a registry of digital health records for every individual can be a powerful tool for accessing the right healthcare. However, without stringent measures to protect individual agency over use of these records, they can also be exploited. Decentralised architecture for data registries is an important mitigation measure.

For many of us, our digital lives are as important as our physical lives. Digital infrastructure adds a new foundation that complements physical infrastructure in addressing India's economic and social development needs \u2014 and it can do so faster, better, cheaper and at population scale. </p><p>Today, with digital platforms, technology infrastructure can be shared by both government and private sector entities, which can leverage it to create new solutions and enhance citizens' experience.The National Digital Health Mission announced by the Prime Minister envisions an open digital ecosystem for healthcare. Telemedicine, e-pharmacy and hospital services can be delivered with an inter-operable tech platform using personal health records and health facilities information.The Open Digital Ecosytems (ODE) framework is an approach to designing digital infrastructure to realise the full potential of the infrastructure while minimising risks and possible harms. The framework has three layers, and they are analogous to how we think about physical infrastructure too. The first is the tech layer or the actual infrastructure itself. In digital infrastructure, our 'highways' are the tech platforms. In India, we are now coalescing around the shared understanding that tech platforms need to be modular, open API, open source and interoperable.The second layer is governance: the 'rules of the game' and the institutions that uphold them. Here too the issues are similar to physical infrastructure. Who is responsible for creating and maintaining infrastructure \u2014 government, private sector or PPP mechanisms? Who should own it? Who pays for the services \u2014 governments or users? Do we need a regulator? What is the recourse in case of harms? Like we have speed limits for road safety, and aviation security norms, issues related to data privacy and security in the digital world need addressing.The third layer is community engagement. Community refers to entrepreneurs and other builders who ensure that the infrastructure actually gets used and solutions are built on top. It also refers to tech developers and civil society organisations who engage to ensure continuous improvements and hold government to account. We saw the crucial role civil society and the media played in Aadhaar. The healthy debates of democracy led to a fundamental right to privacy enshrined in the Constitution, and legal guardrails on where and how Aadhaar may be used.India has been a pioneer in the first layer \u2014 digital infrastructure. Aadhaar and the India Stack are powerful examples of 'digital highways' with a vision to enable traffic of all kinds of services that can ride atop. We were one of the first developing countries to have a population scale digital identity, and have built a low cost digital payments infrastructure.The Covid pandemic has made us more dependent than ever before on this digital infrastructure and the services and applications on top. And during this pandemic, the government was able to transfer Rs. 37,000 crore directly to the bank accounts of 16 crore citizens using India's digital infrastructure.Initial phaseIndia is in the initial phase of the journey on the governance and community layers. But they are as important as the tech layer. The pandemic has starkly revealed the limitations of digital platforms, with many sections of the population excluded.The world has also realised the potential harms of concentration of data, and hence, power, in 'Big Tech' platforms. Critical issues like privacy and individual's control over their personal data, as well as the security and sovereignty of data are being hotly debated both globally and in India.Such issues are even more critical for state owned digital platforms, since many more people are depend on them for basic services. For example, a registry of digital health records for every individual can be a powerful tool for accessing the right healthcare. However, without stringent measures to protect individual agency over use of these records, they can also be exploited. Decentralised architecture for data registries is an important mitigation measure. Privacy and security measures like purpose limitation, tokenisation, encryption, and transparency to protect users can help build trust in the digital ecosystem.We estimate that by 2030, 10 high potential national ODEs in sectors like health, agriculture, justice, etc., can collectively create new value of around $500 billion ( Rs. 35 lakh crore) or about 5.5 per cent of GDP, and savings of around $200 billion ( Rs. 15 lakh crore).With Covid-19, the ODE approach becomes even more relevant, not just in healthcare but also in areas such as employment, education, and social protection.The writer is Managing Director, Omidyar Network India. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-HIN10425616009024165542587610000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HIN-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60X5-WMG1-F03R-N326-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"837\"/><timeReceived>11:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Hindu Business Line</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 23, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>OPINION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp;

However, analyses of foreign stocks for Korean investors was previously provided by domestic securities firms' home trading systems, their research centers and foreign mobile apps, such as Investing.com.Naver's latest enhancement of its services has coincided with the growing popularity of investing in stocks - including foreign offerings - after the market became volatile in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.'We will offer in-depth analyses of foreign stocks, in addition to their price information, so that we become a valuable investment guide for our customers,' a Naver official said.Through its Naver Pay mobile payment service, the tech firm has allowed its users to check brokerage accounts they hold, if they have registered their accredited certificates on the Naver website. The users can also categorize their assets according to their accounts and stocks.In addition, Naver's mobile app notifies its users when their stocks reach target prices they have set - if they want to trade them, they can directly connect to brokerage firms' mobile trading systems they use through the Naver app.Industry officials regard Naver's recent moves as part of its attempts to become the leading fintech company in the securities sector without acquiring a brokerage license. In contrast to Naver, its rival Kakao received a brokerage license to launch Kakao Pay Securities.After launching Naver Pay in 2015, Naver spun it off as Naver Financial in November last year. Since then, Naver has carried out various brokerage-related businesses in collaboration with Mirae Asset which acquired a 30 percent stake in Naver Financial through an 800 billion won ($675 million) investment.Although Mirae Asset said it would focus on creating synergy effects through its collaboration with Naver, small- and medium-sized brokerages have been concerned about being left behind by the tech giant.'Domestic securities firms may compete with each other to be chosen as Naver's partner,' a local brokerage firm official said on condition of anonymity.Amid growing concerns, the financial authorities decided to organize a consultative body on the coexistence of big tech, fintech and conventional financial firms.'Between late August and early September, we will form an organization comprised of representatives from financial firms, fintech firms, financial regulators and academia,' Financial Services Commission Chairman Eun Sung-soo said, Aug. 12.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60SB-GBG1-DYTP-W36D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"584\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001976</classCode><className>SECURITIES &amp;

That might change soon.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://berlinpolicyjournal.com/IP/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/BPJO_Scally_FacebookCUT.jpg\">https://berlinpolicyjournal.com/IP/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/BPJO_Scally_FacebookCUT.jpg</url>REUTERS/Stephen LamExpectations were low when Germany's new federal justice minister hauled in Facebook executives to explain their latest data scandal. But even by those standards, it was clear the social media giant had under-delivered when Katarina Barley went before the press after the March 26 meeting in Berlin. 'Facebook admitted abuses and excesses in the past, and gave assurances that measures taken since will prevent them from happening again,' she said. 'But promises aren't enough. In the future we will have to regulate companies like Facebook much more strictly.' But Facebook isn't the only one making empty promises. Politicians across Europe have been astir with indignation, muttering empty threats since Cambridge Analytica admitted that information it bought on Facebook users was used to influence the 2016 US presidential election. The company bought the data\u2014illegally\u2014from the developers of a personality app that quizzed users to determine their personalities, political leanings, and more. Until 2014, Facebook's default settings allowed any app installed by one Facebook user to scrape data off all of a user's friends, too\u2014without informing them or asking for explicit permission. Cambridge Analytica has been bragging about its coup since Donald Trump was elected, but it took a company whistleblower to make clear the extent of the manipulation. Now that the consequences of the data-trading have become clear, Facebook claims to be shocked\u2014shocked!\u2014by what happened. Caught In reality, Facebook is shocked because it was caught. It walked into this with its eyes open, allowing problematic data-collection via third-party apps. And it earned money in the process from data-collecting app developers it knew it couldn't control. They got away with it because, well, they can. Under current EU law, Germany's federal justice minister can investigate consumer law breaches involving Facebook. But it has no ability to police Facebook data breaches\u2014even if they happen in Germany or, as Barley said after their meeting, affect 130,000 European Facebook users. Because Facebook and other tech giants have their international headquarters in Ireland, front-line responsibility for policing them falls to the Irish data protection regulator (DPC). And for years, the DPC has faced accusations from German and other authorities of sitting on its hands. It is a heated, polarized argument that has much to do with interpretation of laws dating back to before Facebook was even invented. But just as crucial are cultural norms\u2014and misunderstandings. Germany's robust data protection rules and privacy culture are a product of bitter experience of surveillance, under first the Gestapo and then the Stasi. Ireland has a much looser attitude to privacy and data protection, more similar to British and US perspectives, and the Irish DPC is a reflection of this. But the status quo of EU data regulation means the Irish philosophy has prevailed. Since 2011 Ireland's regulator has been investigating Facebook's operations in Europe following a complaint filed by Austrian privacy campaigner Max Schrems that the company was operating outside EU law. He took his case to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg and won, forcing the EU to close down problematic transatlantic data transfer channels. But in his 2011 complaint to the Irish DPC, Schrems also flagged as illegal Facebook apps' practice of pulling in the data of both users and their Facebook friends. While Facebook maintains contracts with developers forbidding the onward sale or disclosure of data to third parties without user consent, he dismissed these as worthless. 'No one knew for sure who was behind these apps and no one knew what happened to the data collected,' said Schrems. 'It could disappear into another country or end up being used\u2014as Cambridge Analytica shows\u2014in an election campaign.' Asking Questions Asked about Schrems's concerns, Facebook claimed back in 2011 that its users had agreed to share their data with apps in friends' profiles through the concept of 'third party consent.' The Irish regulator flagged this as problematic, and ordered changes back in 2011 and 2012; but we still don't know if the DPC viewed the practice as illegal. Indeed, it was a whole three years after the first complaint that Facebook restricted its 'third party consent' sharing of data, and then only because the social network updated its platform. Ask the Irish DPC what took so long and you hear a lot about consensual audits and how effective data protection regulation requires an 'iterative approach.' This is the kind of talk that drives German data regulators to distraction\u2014they prefer to stop problematic practices first and ask questions later. Years of pan-EU frustrations could come to an end in May, when new EU data protection rules come into force. The Irish regulator will remain the frontline regulator for Facebook, Twitter, and Google, all based in Dublin. But the new rule book, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), foresees greater leeway to act\u2014and huge fines for regulation breaches. German Green MEP Jan Philipp Albrecht, who pushed GDPR through the European Parliament, says the new rules will increase pressure on the Irish DPC to explain to partner agencies in other EU member states how it is regulating\u2014or not regulating\u2014big tech companies in its territory. Should it fail to make a convincing case, Albrecht says, 'it will lead quickly to outside control of the Irish regulator.' For Albrecht, a data protection veteran, the EU regime will do more to rein in Facebook data breaches than any national politician or regulatory body. Albrecht added: 'I for one am happy that the Irish regulator will, through GDPR, be expected to apply common rules more quickly and consequentially.' </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DGAP130015152275990407425176900179</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DGAP-130015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S19-2WF1-JCMN-Y068-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1041\"/><timeReceived>12:51 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Berlin Policy Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 3, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Hail our people! Hail Victory!\" and members of the audience gave him a Nazi salute.</p><p>But, it is the First Amendment that inspires Spencer now. He also was a speaker at the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville.</p><p>In the wake of the violence that occurred there, the Daily Stormer - an online neo-Nazi publication - was blocked by a series of major tech companies. Its domain name was taken away by GoDaddy. Google stopped linking to it. Facebook took down links to any article it published. And it can't use PayPal anymore.</p><p>\"Getting kicked off Facebook or YouTube or PayPal or whatever, this is effectively losing the ability to speak,\" Spencer says. \"It is actually a more powerful form of censorship than were a government to censor.\"</p><p>Companies like Google and Facebook are not covered by the First Amendment, which applies only to the federal government. But Spencer feels these companies are so large that the government needs to step in - just as it did with broadcasting.

All Americans should, across the political spectrum.\"</p><p>Right now, Google has more than 80 percent of the online search market, according to Net Market Share. Google and Facebook combined have 77 percent of the online ad market, and 79 percent of Americans on the Internet have a Facebook account, according to Pew Research.</p><p>\"The research shows that if Facebook or Google changes the algorithm just slightly and puts a different type of story in there, it affects the way people think about the world,\" McChesney says. \"Their internal research demonstrates this.\"</p><p>Because these are private companies, they don't have to reveal their algorithms or what changes they make to them.</p><p>Currently, many Americans may agree with the choice to censor the Richard Spencers of the world, but McChesney says it might not always affect groups people don't like.</p><p>\"What's to stop them from turning around and saying, 'Well, we don't like these people who are advocating gay rights. We don't like these people who are advocating workers' rights,' \" he says.</p><p>That's the question leading both alt-right leader Spencer and left-leaning professor McChesney to call for the government to step in.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRTEC-545320833</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRTEC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P9P-8XV1-JDH3-S2T0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438427</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"626\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 National Public Radio \u00ae All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Tech Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>August 23, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009LLQ</classCode><className>GO DADDY GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>GDDY (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkU5NzdDMzI5QTcxNDQ5QTg3NDAwNjNGM0MwMTgxNEI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Scope</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkFFNzEwMUYzNEU3NDdGRTg4RUM2OUM0ODI1ODg2QjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjZGN0QzQTdGN0I3NEMyRDhFMDJFODZDNDA2MDgwNjE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLVG</classCode><className>WHITE NATIONALISTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DA0C</classCode><className>RACISM &amp;

It said about 87 per cent of ads appearing on the Unlockd app come from AdMob, while all the 120,000 activations of the Unlockd Flybuys app in Australia have been downloaded from the Play Store.</p><p> Anti-competitive conduct </p><p>In a statement to be issued to investors and staff, Unlockd said that despite \"significant judgements\" showing there was a serious issue to be tried, Google's actions had had serious ramifications on the businesses' valuation and left it unable to secure the capital it had expected to replace the lost IPO funds.</p><p>It described Google's actions as a \"further example\" of its anti-competitive conduct toward innovative start-ups, which may pose a future threat to its position in the market.</p><p>\"Unlockd launched in 2016 with a clear vision to change the way people use and pay with their digital devices ... it is a revolutionary platform that is fundamentally changing the way that people interact with the world of advertising, by returning value to users in exchange for their attention in a way that Google and other big tech companies do not,\" Unlockd's statement said.</p><p>\"Until wide reaching change is brought about to prevent companies like Google from abusing their dominant market positions, consumers and innovation will continue to suffer.\"</p><p>The dispute between Google and Unlockd, was the kind of issue that was feared ahead of the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/business/media-and-marketing/advertising/accc-starts-inquiry-into-technology-giants-google-and-facebook-20171203-gzxzja\">launch of the ACCC's digital platforms inquiry last December</url>.</p><p> ACCC investigates </p><p>The inquiry is being closely watched by regulators around the world and will assess whether technology giants are exercising market power in commercial dealings to the detriment of consumers, media and advertisers.</p><p>Aside from Mr Murdoch, other big name backers of Unlockd have included Peter Gammell, Margaret Jackson, Citibank Australia chairman Sam Mostyn and Catch of the Day founders Hezi and Gabby Leibovich.</p><p>Earlier this year, co-founder Matt Berriman had stood aside as chief executive, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/technology/agonising-decision-as-unlockd-founder-matt-berriman-steps-down-as-ceo-to-address-bipolar-disorder-20180213-h0w20y\">revealing he needed to devote more time to treatment of bipolar disorder</url>. He told The Australian Financial Review, the decision to take Unlockd into voluntary administration was very difficult, and would result in some staff losing their jobs.</p><p>\"I founded this business with a global vision that was shared by an incredible team of staff, shareholders and partners and the market valuing the business at $170 million plus,\" Mr Berriman said. </p><p>\"It is a very sad day to see that vision in jeopardy, due to a series of threats and subsequent actions from a dominant company looking to stamp out any competition. As any founder will attest too, it's more than just a business to us.\"</p><p>Mr Berriman said that there was currently no plans to change the legal proceedings against Google, but that Unlockd would now also consider its options in relation to damages against Google. </p><p>Despite Unlockd appearing to be one of the most promising stars in a rapidly growing Australian technology startup sector, the company's troubles will highlight just how difficult it can be to establish a disruptive new global company.</p><p>When news of Google's move against Unlockd was first revealed, one of Australia's most successful tech venture capitalists, Craig Blair of Airtree Ventures warned that local startups were putting their survival at risk if they relied too heavily on the ecosystems of existing global tech giants like Google, Apple, Facebook or Amazon.</p><p>\"Great companies figure out how to use the platforms as growth enhancers while at their core, building a strong native business that connects directly with consumers,\" Mr Blair said.</p><p>\"Others get hooked on the addictive and alluring promise of platform-driven growth only to suffer painful withdrawal symptoms when the rules change.

So any Australian fines in the hundreds of millions range would not touch the sides, and would just be seen as a cost of doing business.\"</p><p>The ACCC report said it was concerned the likes of Google and Facebook were misusing market power within advertising and other markets, citing Unlockd and a range of cases where they made it unreasonably difficult for potential rivals to do business on platforms they controlled.</p><p>This included Australian company Dialogue Consulting commencing legal proceedings against Facebook in April, after its services for scheduling Instagram and Facebook posts were banned by Facebook in ways it said contravened Australian consumer law.</p><p>\"These allegations concerning local and/or overseas conduct go beyond the advertising markets examined in this inquiry and illustrate the potential for other markets to be affected,\" the ACCC report said. \"Google and Facebook also have a strong history of expanding into related markets. For example, Instagram's recent entry into online shopping (whereby Instagram directly facilitates the purchase of certain brands), Facebook's entry into jobs and dating services, and Google's entry into flights and hotels. As a result, it is likely the risk of digital platforms leveraging market power from one market to another will increase in the future.\"</p><p>The report listed examples of Facebook favouring commercial partners in enforcing access to consumer data, and of Google seemingly hampering the technical performance of rival operators.</p><p>Mr Berriman said he and other start-up founders had learnt the hard way it was impossible to trust big platforms like Google and Facebook to be consistent and transparent about how they enforce the rules that they write themselves, but expected reports like the ACCC's would help educate consumers about thinking twice when believing what they are told about data use.</p><p>He said the tech companies were streets ahead of regulators in understanding how the digital world works, and his role in investigations around the world was largely based around helping them catch up.</p><p>\"It's bigger than Unlockd, the whole media and ecosystem and consumer data are critical, and no offence to the regulators and government, but it would be like asking me to be a politician, it's not my field of expertise so education is critical,\" Mr Berriman said. \"One minister I've met I had to relate it in terms of electricity and utilities and then they got it - these platforms are utilities, wrapped up as tech platforms.

This standoff between Apple and the government continues to escalate, and it's happening very publicly. Here now to discuss why tensions are running so high is NPR tech reporter Aarti Shahani. She's at a big tech conference in Barcelona right now, and she's on the line. Aarti, good morning. </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:  Good morning. </p><p>DAVID GREENE:  So public opinion, as we have reported, is so divided on this case. But it does not sound like <person><nameText>Tim Cook </nameText></person>is giving any ground at all here. </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:  No, not at all. And it's really breathtaking to watch the responses inside the industry. You know, as you mentioned, right now I'm in Barcelona at this huge tech conference. And people are super divided on Cook's stance. For some, he's a hero. And for other, he's just an American businessman who doesn't want to be subject to regulation. And, you know, I remember back in San Francisco earlier this month, I was at a smaller cybersecurity gathering organized by Google. And people there were saying that they think the FBI is going to stop banging the drum on backdoors. You know, then the FBI went after Apple. </p><p>DAVID GREENE:  But what the FBI is doing, Aarti, I mean, is talking about one phone, right? So, I mean, can you explain why <person><nameText>Tim Cook </nameText></person>is using such dramatic language and talking about how unlocking this one phone will make all Apple customers this vulnerable? </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:  Yeah, let's take an analogy that's been floating around. Say the iPhone is a safe in a bank. </p><p>DAVID GREENE:  OK. </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:  So, you know, police want to get into the safe - see if there's drugs there or something. So they ask the bank to help crack the combo lock or, you know, give them unlimited time to crack it themselves. Well, here's where that analogy falls apart. In the physical world, you're just cracking the combo for a specific safe in a specific bank. When that safe is digital, when it's software inside an iPhone, it's code that's shared by every single safe - every iPhone. So when you figure out how to crack that code, you've created a master key. And yeah, you know, you can say we're just going to use it this one time. But you can't control if that really happens or if it falls into the wrong hands. </p><p>DAVID GREENE:  <person><nameText>Tim Cook </nameText></person>basically saying, you create this master key, and you can say all you want that you're going to be able to hide it, but someone might get their hands on it. </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:  Right, exactly. </p><p>DAVID GREENE:  Sound like a legitimate argument. But what's the other side say? </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:  You know, he's right about the way encryption works. That's just factually correct. But when he says that there is no precedent, you know, that's not really true. Cook wrote in that letter to customers that day the California court decision came out, he said, quote, \"we can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack.\" You know, well, back in the 1990s, the company Microsoft wanted to use a certain kind of strong encryption. But U.S. regulators said no; if you want to sell overseas, we think your software is so strong it's basically a weapon, and we're going to ban you from exporting that weapon. So Microsoft had to basically weaken its product so they could enter into foreign markets. So that definitely impacted privacy and exposed customers to greater risk. </p><p>DAVID GREENE:  OK, so debate for precedent there is one part of this. How does this get resolved? You have this deadline looming tomorrow for Apple to respond to this court order. </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI:  That's right. They have to respond by tomorrow. And, you know, they'll make their legal case. But Cook also suggested last night that maybe there's another way to address the situation. </p><p>(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)</p><p><person><nameText>TIM COOK</nameText></person>:  This is not what should be happening in America. If there should be a law that compels us to do it, it should be passed out in the open, and the people of America should get a voice in that. The right place for that debate to occur is in Congress. </p><p>DAVID GREENE:  OK, so he basically wants a different branch of government to handle this. He wants this decided in Congress, where he and FBI Director James Comey are both scheduled to testify next week.

The bombshell op-ed, landing the same week as excerpts from Bob Woodward's new book, has reportedly heightened the already sky-high level of paranoia at the White House. Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy discusses the op-ed and Judge Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing. A CNN reality check takes a look at the history of the 25th amendment of the Constitution after an unnamed senior Trump administration official claimed in a \"New York Times\" op-ed that there were whispers within President Trump's Cabinet to invoke the amendment to remove him from office. Big Tech executives came to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to testify about election meddling. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss actions their companies have taken to thwart foreign influence campaigns targeting the 2018 midterm elections.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[07:30:00] SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT), MEMBER, FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE: Well, what I'm saying is that if you are knowingly operating inside this White House --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: That's everybody who works in this administration. Everyone who works in this administration is knowingly worked there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MURPHY: Oh, no.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BERMAN: Knowingly working there. There's no one who said --</p><p>MURPHY: No, no, no. If you -- no, no, no. Well, let me finish my sentence.</p><p>If you are working in the administration with knowledge of the moral damage that you're doing to the nation, then I don't think history is going to judge your decision to stay there rather than come to the outside and try to put a -- put a check on this administration kindly.</p><p>Now, I don't think everybody inside the administration feels the way this person does. But for those that do, I think you're better off on the outside trying to make sure that Democrats win control of Congress and this president only gets one term.</p><p>BERMAN: Very quickly, you're not trying to compare this administration in any way to Nazi Germany by saying this is not Vichy France, are you?</p><p>MURPHY: No. I just think you need to understand that history doesn't judge kindly people that try to rationalize to themselves staying on the inside of a reckless regime to make it more palatable.</p><p>BERMAN: We often hear -- and I hear it from Republicans officials and Democratic officials -- thank goodness Defense Sec. James Mattis is there, just to throw out one name.</p><p>Are you glad that James Mattis is secretary of Defense? If he is -- and I don't know that he's one of these people. If you read the Woodward book this depicts Sec. Mattis standing up to the president on certain things and as Woodward and other sources would say, somehow protecting the country from the president. Are you reassured that people like James Mattis are there?</p><p>MURPHY: So listen, of course, I'm glad that he has competent people inside the administration. And, Sec. Mattis says, himself, that he doesn't feel the things that this person feels.</p><p>And so, listen, we all have mixed feelings, right --</p><p>BERMAN: Right.</p><p>MURPHY: -- about good people going inside this administration. I just doubt whether the way in which this individual is expressing himself or herself is actually making the situation better.</p><p>BERMAN: And just to reiterate that last point, you do want what you consider to be competent people working for this president even if you disagree with him.</p><p>MURPHY: That's true and that's why I have voted in favor of a lot of decent people who have gone to work for this administration even though I may deeply disagree with their positions on matters of policy.</p><p>Again, the question is how you try to effectuate a policy agenda. I don't think that placing an anonymous article in \"The New York Times\" is the best way --</p><p>BERMAN: OK.</p><p>MURPHY: -- to try to advance your cause.</p><p>BERMAN: Very quickly. You're not on the Judiciary Committee but I'm sure you've been watching the Brett Kavanaugh hearings.</p><p>Do you think this testimony has changed any minds in the Senate?</p><p>MURPHY: I mean, I hope that some of my Republican colleagues are concerned about Judge Kavanaugh's refusal to engage in any hypotheticals about potential abuse of power cases coming before the Supreme Court.</p><p>I don't think it would have been hard for Kavanaugh to weigh in and say that he believes the president isn't above the law. That a president can't pardon himself. That he has to answer a subpoena.</p><p>Those aren't specific hypotheticals, those are broad, important hypotheticals.</p><p>Is it changing anybody's mind? Listen, I don't know. Obviously, we expected him to dodge and weave. He has largely dodged and weaved.</p><p>But we've got more to go and so let's wait until the whole thing is done.</p><p>BERMAN: Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, we've got to let you go. We know you have a busy day ahead. Thanks so much for joining us. MURPHY: Thanks.</p><p>BERMAN: Alisyn --</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: OK.</p><p>So, John, there are so many burning questions this morning. Who is this resistor? What did they want out of this? Why are they still working for President Trump's administration?</p><p>The former director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, joins us next with his thoughts.</p><p>[07:37:19] CAMEROTA: Whoever wrote that startling \"New York Times\" op-ed had a goal of getting information out to the public. Supporters or President Trump are casting the person as a traitor and as dangerous.</p><p>Just a short time ago, President Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani tweeted his reaction.</p><p>He said, \"If it could be any\" -- sorry -- \"If it could be anyone at such a high level he probably has top security clearances and a history of leaking. He's been elected to nothing but at any time he could substitute his judgment for our elected politically accountable president. Very dangerous person.\"</p><p>Here with us now is former director of National Intelligence, James Clapper. He is a CNN national security analyst. Director Clapper, good morning.</p><p>JAMES CLAPPER, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, FORMER DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY: Good morning, Alisyn.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Do you think that this person who took to the \"New York Times\" for this op-ed is dangerous?</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, this is a classic case in Washington of one man's whistleblower is another man's swamp dweller. And it depends on where sit about whether you feel this is dangerous.</p><p>I think people who are critics of the president will find reinforcement in this and also reassurance that there are people in the government who care more about the country and the Constitution rather than personal loyalty.</p><p>On the other hand, of course, this will feed the deep-state bonfire -- add fuel to that. So this is a classic where you stand, where you sit.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Well, the person who wrote it knew that there would be questions about the deep state and addressed that in the op-ed.</p><p>I'll read a portion of it for you. \"This is not the work of the so- called deep state. It's the work of the steady state.\"</p><p>Your reaction?</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, again, Trump opponents will find this reassuring it is a steady state and there's steady hands trying to navigate the ship of state so to speak. But at the same time, those who don't agree will find this just another example of the so-called deep state. So --</p><p>CAMEROTA: But I mean, from where you sit as somebody in the national security space, do you give any credence to what Rudy Giuliani just tweeted?</p><p>And I think that this is instructive -- what he just tweeted -- because it will tell us what the talking points out of the White House will be today, which is this is a leaker. It's probably somebody from the national security space. This is a dangerous person. They should somehow be outed.</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, I don't know about -- I don't agree that this person is dangerous -- air quotes. This -- I mean, obviously, the White House and the Trump camp are deeply offended by this because it really -- what it suggests is disloyalty to the president personally.</p><p>[07:40:04] But -- and I think Giuliani jumping to the conclusion -- well, this person has a clearance and -- which probably he or she probably does. But as previously leaked classified information, that's a big leap and there's no basis for that assertion at all.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Well, here's what Sec. Mike Pompeo, who is overseas right now -- when he got word of this op-ed here's how he responded this morning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: It is sad that you have someone who would make that choice. I come from a place where if you're not in a position to execute the commander's intent, you have a singular option and it's to leave. And this person said, according to \"The New York Times\" -- chose not only to stay but to undermine what President Trump and this administration are trying to do.</p><p>And I have to tell you, I just -- I find -- I find the media's efforts in this regard to undermine this administration incredibly disturbing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Next question.</p><p>POMPEO: And I'll answer your other question directly because I know someone will say gosh, he didn't answer the question. It's not mine.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMEROTA: I mean look, it's interesting to hear how he's framing it. I think that the person who wrote this op-ed has more than just a single option to leave. Obviously, the whole case that the person is making is that this person has chosen to stay to try to work within the administration to stop some of the president's impulsivity. CLAPPER: Yes. And in the op-ed, the writer acknowledges policy successes and things that -- policy issues with which he or she agrees. It has more to do with the president's personal characteristics, his behavior, and his impulsiveness.</p><p>And so, on the one hand, people will say it's a good thing we have people like that. And on the other hand, as reflected in Sec. Pompeo's statement, that the only option is to resign.</p><p>I have to think that this person has -- is prepared to resign because I don't think it's going to take as long as it did to find out who deep throat was to find out who the writer of this -- or writers if there was more than one person involved.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Look, I hear what you're saying that it depends on where you sit if this person is a traitor or a hero. But from where you sit, what do you want to say to this person this morning?</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, I think -- I took the -- I took the op-ed at face value and what struck me was that this person seemed to attach a higher priority to the safety and security of the country and adherence to the Constitution rather than personal loyalty.</p><p>And, you know, that's the way it struck me. And again, I took it at face value. I'm sure it was something of a cathartic for whom -- whoever wrote it.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yes. We have no way of knowing if that person feels sort of unburdened this morning or petrified.</p><p>CLAPPER: That's right -- that's right.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yes.</p><p>Do you -- very quickly, do you worry what the president will do next in response?</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, this will -- you know, on top of the Woodward book, on top of Omarosa's book, on top of the Michael Wolff book, this just heightens, I'm sure, the paranoia and the siege mentality and the president's tendency to lash out to -- against anybody who criticizes him.</p><p>And so I think this will further consume him which, in my mind, is bad because it detracts from the focus on the real -- the real critical issues and that's really what's at -- what's at stake here. So this, in that sense, is just going to heighten that paranoia.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Director James Clapper, thanks so much for sharing your thoughts with us.</p><p>CLAPPER: Thanks, Alisyn.</p><p>CAMEROTA: John --</p><p>BERMAN: All right. Can you count to 25? This stunning op-ed suggests there were whispers in the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove the president from office. So how could that be used?</p><p>We'll get a reality check, next.</p><p>[07:48:04] BERMAN: It's time for a CNN \"Reality Check\".</p><p>In this new op-ed, an unnamed senior administration official claims there were whispers within President Trump's cabinet about invoking the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. So how does that work?</p><p>CNN senior political analyst John Avlon explains -- John.</p><p>JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: That's right. In an opinion piece loaded with high-impact news nuggets there is a particularly interesting detail hiding near the bottom.</p><p>Quote, \"Given the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment, which would start a complex process for removing the president.\"</p><p>The 25th Amendment -- so what is it, can it do what the author says, and better yet, should it?</p><p>Now, you might think the 25th Amendment, which spells out presidential succession, is an old concept but it's not.</p><p>The text is relatively recent, born right after John F. Kennedy died, thought up by members of his administration, including his brother, Bobby, who shuddered to think what might have happened had the president been only incapacitated in Dallas.</p><p>In fact, as recently as 1965, this nation had no real plan for what to do if a president couldn't discharge his duties.</p><p>The issue first came up way back in 1841 when William Henry Harrison died just a month after taking office. No one really knew what to call Vice President John Tyler. Critics simply called him \"Your Accidency.\"</p><p>Four decades later, President James Garfield was shot and lingered incapacitated for more than two months. Afraid of causing a constitutional crisis, Vice President Chester A. Arthur -- of the really great sideburns -- avoided doing any presidential and the government ground to a halt.</p><p>In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson had a stroke and his second wife, Edith, essentially ran the country for 18 months.</p><p>By that point, the 25th Amendment was long overdue but it took the Kennedy assassination to get it written and it didn't get used by a president for another two decades when President Reagan had a 1985 surgery. [07:50:00] But it got its first real test two years later. That's when incoming Reagan chief of staff Howard Baker was urged to consider it after reports that Reagan was in mental decline. Baker agreed to observe the president for deficiencies and when he didn't find any the 25th Amendment was never mentioned again in the Reagan White House.</p><p>It's been invoked just twice more, both by George W. Bush for colonoscopies, and that's really been it.</p><p>So the question we're confronting today is whether the 25th Amendment could be used to remove a president who some feel, as the unnamed White House writer puts it, is quote \"detrimental to the health of our republic.\"</p><p>The short answer is not easily. Remember, the amendment was written primarily to address physical incapacity. But it does include a section never used on removing a president deemed unfit and that section reads like a Rube Goldberg machine.</p><p>Basically, it goes like this.</p><p>The vice president, along with a majority of the cabinet, can send a letter to the president pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House declaring that the president -- as former Sen. Birch Bayh colorfully put it is nutty as a fruitcake.</p><p>And then as soon as that letter is received, bam, the president is out. The vice president becomes the acting president.</p><p>But not so fast. The president can then write his own letter and send it back to Congress saying he's feeling perfectly fine.</p><p>After which the vice president and a majority of the cabinet still want him gone, they have to send another letter. Now once that happens, within three weeks, two-thirds of Congress must vote to declare the president unfit. Otherwise, he becomes president again and the V.P. goes back to his old job but presumably, not for long.</p><p>The odds of that happening -- that the president's V.P., the bulk of his cabinet, and two-thirds of both Houses of Congress would turn on him are incredibly long.</p><p>So while the 25th Amendment makes for some interesting history, the chances it gets written into President Trump's history are slim, to say the least.</p><p>And that's your \"Reality Check.\"</p><p>CAMEROTA: But yes, very interesting history, John. Thank you.</p><p>BERMAN: Indeed.</p><p>CAMEROTA: All right.</p><p>So, two of the biggest names in tech testifying before Congress. How will Wall Street respond today? That's next.</p><p>[07:56:18] CAMEROTA: OK, it's time for \"CNN Money Now.\"</p><p>Big tech suffering some big losses on Wall Street with two big-name executives testifying on Capitol Hill.</p><p>CNN's Alison Kosik joins us now. Hi, Al.</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Alisyn.</p><p>Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey facing off with lawmakers. Google decided not to send a top executive and there was an empty seat there for them and was blasted for that choice during the hearing.</p><p>But, Sandberg and Dorsey outlined the steps their companies are taking to tackle disinformation and how to make political advertising more transparent.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, FACEBOOK: When bad actors try to use our site we will block them. When content violates our policies we will take it down. And when our opponents use new techniques we will share them so we can strengthen our collective efforts.</p><p>JACK DORSEY, CO-FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, TWITTER: We don't believe that we can create a digital public square for people if they don't feel safe to participate in the first place. And that is our number one and singular objective as a company is to increase the health of this public space.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KOSIK: Now, as investors go, they're concerned that the government may slap new regulations on the social networks.</p><p>Facebook shed more than two percent and Twitter tumbled six percent at Wednesday's close.

I've dealt with some of these complaints in earlier columns, arguing that data is not the new oil, not a digital infrastructure, and not a barrier to entry.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But something funny happened on the way to the antitrust courts - advocates realized that applying traditional antitrust remedies against tech companies would do more harm than good.</p><p>Breaking the companies into smaller parts, as some explicitly advocate, would just sacrifice the efficiencies that make tech products and services so valuable. Utility-style price and entry regulation threatens to slow innovation and seem pointless when many of the tech services are free to consumers. Also, nondiscrimination requirements would undermine a tech company's ability to restrict harmful material on its own system.</p><p>So, advocates are turning to regulatory proposals relating to free expression, privacy, and access to information. But the urge to do something should never be stronger than the urge to do something intelligent. Bad regulatory proposals cannot be salvaged by re-describing them as antitrust remedies.</p><p>Here's an example: in seeking ways to \"tame tech,\" The Economist almost off-handedly says, \"Immunity to content liability must go, too.\"</p><p>It is hard to see what this has to do with generating tech industry competition. Content liability just imposes regulatory burdens that make it hard or impossible for anyone to function in the market. Indeed, the burden would fall overwhelmingly on smaller players and increase barriers to entry for new players. So as opposed to \"taming tech,\" it would effectively lock-in the current market leaders.</p><p>How platform distributors of news and information should be regulated is a serious and profound question. As a new report from the New America Foundation and the Shorenstein Center points out, hate speech, extremist content and disinformation campaigns on social media platforms threaten the foundations of democratic discourse and call for fresh thinking to assess a range of new policy options.</p><p>But imposing on social media platforms the same content liability that print magazines face is foolish. Individuals who are completely independent of platforms use them every hour of every day to further their business and creative interests and to share and seek the information they need to be informed citizens. If the platforms had to exercise the same level of care as the editor of The New York Times before users could post anything, they would not function as effective distributors of content at all.</p><p>Policymakers have to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. As Harvard Law School professor Cass Sunstein says, on balance, social media platforms are not merely good for democracy, they are \"terrific\" because they make it vastly easier for citizens to get the information they need to govern themselves.\u00a0</p><p>Most importantly, counterproductive new content regulations should not be disguised as antitrust remedies against big tech.</p><p>Here's another example. To fix competitive problems in the tech industry, The Economist and others urge regulators to give people \"more control over their information.\"</p><p>In fact, this has been an objective of data protection policy on both sides of the Atlantic for over a generation. The EU just finished a far-reaching update of its privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, which is set to go into effect in May 2018. This is the most sweeping reform of data protection laws in history. To comply, technology companies and other affected businesses will be updating their systems for years to come.</p><p>What the Economist seems to mean, however, is not that we should protect user privacy, but that we should use privacy law to dry up the supply of data to tech companies. It is hard to see how this furthers competition. Instead, the lack of data would hurt everyone in the market.</p><p>The Economist suggests a further, and contradictory, data reform - user data should be turned over to anyone willing to pay a compulsory license fee. As the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust noted recently, this forced sharing of a company's critical asset would tend to dry up the incentive to invest in innovation. And there is no need for this step. As I pointed out in an earlier column, competition authorities have repeatedly found that data needed for competitors to challenge incumbents is in plentiful supply. Moreover, compulsory data sharing is hard to reconcile with the privacy rights of data subjects, since information that a user shares with one company would then be automatically available to the entire marketplace.\u00a0</p><p>Public policy proposals can serve multiple purposes. There's nothing wrong with a measure that by luck or intent protects privacy or free speech and also promotes competition. But these unnecessary and counterproductive proposals serve no legitimate government purposes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CIOMAG-3253116</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CIOMAG2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RKF-DKP1-DY58-D14H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">258373</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"830\"/><timeReceived>08:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 IDG Communications, Inc.

Mr Murdoch and News Corp CEO Robert Thomson have both been critical of Google and Facebook's practises.</p><p>It also has been made public just days after US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a candidate for the Democrats in the 2020 presidential elections, announced her own plans for big tech companies to be broken up on competition grounds.</p><p>Following a 12-month inquiry, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) last year declared that Google and Facebook's market power was adversely impacting traditional publishing companies.</p><p>The ACCC announced a string of measures to resolve this situation, including establishing a new ombudsman to monitor consumer complaints, and another new body to oversee the algorithms that power Google's search engine and Facebook's news feed, as well as the tech giants' conduct in the advertising market.</p><p>In its submission, News Corp argues the ACCC should be given these powers, rather than new agencies.</p><p>Google has an advertising partnership with The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. News Corp publishes a number of competing titles such as The Australian. It is also the majority owner of pay TV company Foxtel.</p><p>News Corp's provocative suggestion to break up Google was contained in a \"remedies paper\" attached to its latest submission.

We've got all the highlights from the big night at the Olympics  last night.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Wednesday morning and joining me to talk  all about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell.  The Rosecliff CEO,  Managing Partner, Mike Murphy.  And Benchmark Managing Partner, Kevin  Kelly.  Great to see you.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF:  Good morning Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, we got an action pack lead to with the Federal Reserve notes  coming out later.  So we're going to have to get a read through on that.   It's going to be -- that's going to move markets because we've seen yields  are blowing out.</p><p>They're -- I mean, the two-year treasury is actually its highest points  since the Lehman crashed at 2.26 percent.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Yes, that is --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And this is the minutes from the January meeting.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, correct.  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A lot of speeches but also that -- those yields on the two-year  being as high as they've been since 2008, that's -- that was in the auction  yesterday.  Some of the treasury auctions two -- about a quarter of $1  trillion in treasury debt being auctioned this week.  So, again, it's the  demand there for the supply or the demand's always there it's just what  yield if the government have to pay.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  What investors are going to pay for this, right?  And that's  when the market turned yesterday.  So actually, when the auction happen,  that's when the market actually went negative.  And when we saw names like  Home Depot which was positive on the day because (INAUDIBLE) they were  doing very well actually closed negative on the day.</p><p>MURPHY:  But I think that's what you want to look for.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what, since -- we were open on Monday.  Some people --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You would have known about that about 6:00 on a Monday morning,  when you're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, you mentioned this right away yesterday as well and  you talked about how there was so much supply and you questioned it.  In  fact, when I got home and I saw that was happening I said, \"Oh, Dagen  mentioned that right off the bat this morning.\"</p><p>MURPHY:  Well there are quality names though like Kevin mentioned Home  Depot.  If companies are performing, that's what we want to look for in  selloffs like we got yesterday because that creates opportunity in my  opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we're going to talk more about that opportunity.  Coming  up joining the conversation, Republican National Committee Chairman, Ronna  McDaniel.  Department of Treasury, the Undersecretary for International  Affairs, pardon me, David Malpass is here.  FOX News Senior Judicial  Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano is here.  And Dr. Mikhail Varshashki, AKA  Dr. Mike is here as well.</p><p>Big show ahead, don't miss moments of it and we kick it off right here with  this top story, unpatriotic, that's what house Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi  is now calling the historic GOP tax overhaul.  Speaking at a DNC sponsored  town hall last night in Phoenix, the democratic leader slam the new tax law  and she's faced immediate backlash, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PELOSI:  If what you're doing is cutting the tax at the high end and  therefore not being allowed to invest in the future, you're doing a great  disserve to our country.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Unpatriotic.</p><p>PELOSI:  It's unpatriotic.  So most people have to struggle to make ends  meet. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (INAUDIBLE).  How much are you worth?  Hundreds of  millions of dollars.</p><p>PELOSI:  No, we're not talking about that.  So in any event --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were yelling at her, \"How much are you worth Nancy?\"  You  might also remember what she called the $1,000 tax cut bonuses last month,  watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PELOSI:  In terms of the bonus that corporate America received versus the  crumbs that they are giving to workers to kind of put the schmooze on is so  pathetic, it's so pathetic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Pelosi's latest comments come after \"Politico\" reported  that a major democratic super PAC issued a memo last week raising concerns  over the party's midterm strategy of opposing President Trump and the  republican tax plan.  And this is the issue Dagen, there's no message on  the left, it's just resist, resist, resist President Trump, I don't think  that's going to do it for them in November.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I agree.  I don't understand what -- one, I don't even  understand what she's talking about at this point that it's just --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't either by the way.  I don't either.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- to put it eloquently, it's gobbledygook.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, gobbledygook.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They -- number one -- but she seems so out of touch and when she  talks about companies putting the schmooze -- trying to put the schmooze on  these people, these are employers in this country, their health is  important to the financial health of the United States, the health of the  everyday worker.</p><p>I've made the joke before she must -- she thinks the Golden Corral is a  jewelry store chain in East Texas, she's out of touch with the American  worker.  And here is where her lingo, her language, and her talking points  won't fly and we talked about with Juan Williams yesterday, 90 percent of  workers in this country are getting bigger paychecks this month.  So people  are seeing it and people are feeling it.</p><p>And so the question that everybody has to ask themselves, who spends that  money better?  Does Nancy Pelosi?  Because, again, the democrats in the  last two terms, presidential terms doubled the national debt, did that make  my situation better?  Does she make better decisions than I do?  And I  think the answer time and again will be no regardless of your party  affiliation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And then --</p><p>KELLY:  Well there's -- well I think the point is -- someone came up and  heckled her, right?  And one of the reasons why is Americans want solution  so either you're part of the problem or you're part of the solution.</p><p>Now tax cuts already done over with, there's nothing the democrats can do  about it.  So why is she using government funded taxpayer money to fly  across the country and visit 100 cities to complain about something?  She  needs to come up with solutions for this country and you're seeing it play  out time and time again through the voters, they're going to come out in  2018 if the democrats keeps this up, you're seeing the polls go up for the  president.</p><p>And so the problem is that she's also attacking businesses here because  guess what, large corporations did well under her leadership and they had  lower tax rates, right?  So now, small businesses are competitive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's also trying to make this statement like when you lower --  she said something like when you lower taxes at the top and then you don't  invest in the future, what does that mean?  Invest -- that's --</p><p>MURPHY:  I think the best thing that -- remember, just a few months ago the  knock on this tax plan was that the money was only going to go to the  people at the top, to the CEOs, to the large corporations, and then the  people that the --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hedge funds, that's the talking point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MURPHY:  Right.  The people who got these crumbs, but people are going to  vote with their wallets in my opinion.  So people feel better whether  they're democrats or republicans, people feel better when their paycheck is  bigger.  So I think what -- the point that she's trying to get across or is  its sell to the American people isn't going to fly come election.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think they invest in the future means government spending and  this somehow because, again, if you give money -- more money back to the  people who actually earn it, then maybe the idea and the republicans who  haven't done this on the spending side which is a mistake but you starve  the government.</p><p>So you starve the lifelong lawmakers, you starve the bureaucrats, that's  where republicans have failed at this but they want -- let's be clear,  democrats think they make better decisions with your money that you do.   They want to confiscate it and they want to redistribute it and we saw what  happened in the last 10 years in terms of economic growth and putting  businesses in a situation where they were hand stung with regulations,  raising taxes on many Americans, on many businesses whether it was through  ObamaCare or rolling back the Bush tax cuts, so again, that's where it puts  you.  It puts you in an economy that can't even grow at three percent where  wages are stagnant. </p><p>KELLY:  That was the narrative, right?  I mean, you didn't build that,  right?  So this is a consistent talking point that's come out of the  democratic side and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Pay your fair share.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And not only that but it's not falling on -- it's not  resonating.  People are saying, \"Well look, what are you worth?\"  People  are saying, \"Well, you're going to have to explain for not voting for this  tax plan.\"  I think people are going to want answers why they didn't vote  for -- no democrat voted yes for the tax plan.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And one thing, when people hear -- and I've heard it so many  times and when they hear it over and over and over again as we move into  the year that republicans are raising taxes on individuals.  </p><p>They're referring to the expiration of the tax cuts, they're referring to  them expiring in less than a decade on the individual side and I pushback  on the democrats, if that was so important to you, why didn't one of you  step up and vote for it --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because tax cuts aren't important, because, again, they don't  want you to keep more of their own money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  No, absolutely.  We're also watching markets this morning,  Futures extending the losses this morning.  Investors are a bit weary of  higher inflation, of interest rates, we are going to get the Federal  Reserve minutes this week.</p><p>The Fed preparing to release the January minutes this afternoon.  Kevin,  why was that meeting so important?  What are we going to get from the Fed  this afternoon?  Is that going to be a market mover?</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  This is a significant event and one of the reasons why is  that in the January statement that came out, they had the word further in  there twice.  And so they didn't know if that was guidance but the Fed is  willing to raise rates more than three times this year.</p><p>If so, that's going to have significant effects because the market was only  anticipating three hikes.  So now the market -- you're seeing it on the Fed  fund future curve that there's over a third chance now that they could  raise it four times.  So someone's going to read through now on these --  with the statement coming out today.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mike does this for a living but I do want to point out the \"Wall  Street Journal\" has an article today that is getting a lot of attention,  spending bill and this is the republicans, this is the republicans $300  billion additional spending over two years has raised forecaster's  expectations that the Fed will indeed now hike four times this year, not  three.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Paul Ryan basically said, \"Look, we had to raise that -- we  have to spend that kind of money in order to get the money from the  military\" when he joined us a week ago.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, it was all about the military, right?  I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But I pushback on that.  They could have played -- they could  have held a tougher line, they could have played harder ball and they  didn't have to essentially give democrats everything.  Again, their -- it's  like $150 million over two years in abstinence education, really? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think Paul Ryan's point was these were one-time spending that  they gave up to get longer term spending in place, so we'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And he said you got to give to get is what he kept  saying.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But billions upon billions of dollars to community health  centers, to -- for additional childcare funding.  I mean, the child tax  credit was --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Already in the tax bill.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, was already in the tax bill.  So, again, as long as it's  somebody else's money and kind of shame on the republicans for doing that  quite frankly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, a lot of debate about that within the republican community  by the way.  All right.  We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back, breaking overnight, a police officer only on the job for  two years shot and killed in Alabama.  Terrible story, we've got the  details on the standoff that led to the suspected gunman's death.</p><p>And then Venezuela betting on crypto for its crisis, the South American  country launching its own digital coin to dig out from huge debt.  Back in  a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news, a police officer shot and killed  in Alabama.  Cheryl Casone with the details this morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  That's right Maria.  Officer Justin Billa was  shot and later died from those injuries.  He was responding to the home of  a suspect in Mobile.  This happened late last night.</p><p>That's when Robert Hollie opened fire, shooting BIlla.  The suspect then  barricaded himself inside a home for hours, he is now dead.  According to  the police chief, said Hollie was a person of interest in the death of his  ex-wife.  </p><p>Well, AT&amp;T has lost its bid to seek communications between the Justice  Department and the White House over its takeover of Time Warner.  AT&amp;T said  that it wanted the records of this communications to prove that the DOJ is  against the deal not because of antitrust concerns, but because the  President's dislike of CNN.  Well the judge ruling the AT&amp;T, did not show  enough evidence to prove its claim.  Shares of AT&amp;T and Time Warner are  both higher in the premarket.  </p><p>We are also watching very closely today shares of Wal-Mart.  The stock  plunged 10 percent yesterday.  Its biggest drop in 30 years after the  company said that its online growth slowed during the closely watched  holiday quarter that set back assigned of the challenges facing Wal-Mart's  online operation.  As it takes and tries to compete against Amazon.  Wal- Mart's shares trading slightly higher ahead of the opening built up, almost  a half of percent, Maria.  But certainly Wal-Mart was the big story  yesterday when the market took a big dip.</p><p>BAARTIROMO:  And \"The Journal\" writes at this morning that they basically  stumbled in a shift to the web.  And Dagen what's your take on this Wal- Mart's story?  The online inventory for the holidays was misjudged, it's  how \"The Journal\" addressed it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So it's the way that the CEO Doug McMillon explained it, that  they stocked so many large-size T.V.s and toys for the holidays that it  squeezed out, squeeze the room for everyday items.  Like, toilet paper and  that meant that Wal-Mart actually ran out of some basic items that people  regularly order and it hurt online sale.</p><p>KELLY:  There were couple other things that happened, too.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There were.  But that's where -- that's a misstep, as you make  this to the Wal-Mart.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well yes, but here's one of the biggest missteps, is that Jet.com  was that they acquired to reduce their online sales and in that platform  was selling items actually below its cost of acquisition, cost of goods,  right?  So they would actually couldn't even fulfill some of their stuff.   So that's why -- that's why Wal-Mart bought them because they thought: Hey,  we had the inventory.  But the problem is that Jet had their items priced  so low that actually Wal-Mart had to raise the prices of a lot of these  goods and people were just completely turned off by it during the holiday  season, so they didn't buy as much.</p><p>MURPHY:  I think, it's the look, what they were trying to frame this as was  a one-time misstep and I think at 15 percent haircut in the stock.  If you  believe that it's a one-time misstep as I do, it's a great buying  opportunity.</p><p>KELLY:  They had a giant run too, by the way.  So this is a huge compared  to the last 3 to 6 months.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Also interesting to know the other story Cheryl mentioned the  AT&amp;T is not entitled to the details of the government internal discussions  about Time Warner.  I wonder if they're going to get those details.   Basically the government saying no, but you're not going to see our  research and information around why we are blocking this deal.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I don't think they will and it's kind of bit the popular narrative  that this is President Trump having a personal vendetta against it.  But I  think ultimately this deal will get done but I don't believe AT&amp;T has any  right to the government stealings.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So you agree with that now.  We'll take a break  when we come back, disturbing new claims this morning of harassment, a  hostile work environment inside the Dallas Mavericks head office.  Details  on owner Mark Cuban's reaction.  The investigation after a new report  reveals complaints by more than a dozen current and former employees of the  Mavericks.  And then we are halfway through a short trading week.  We're  keeping an eye on markets this morning, earnings continuing this morning.   Dow Futures indicating a lower opening, down 50 points on the Dow  Industrials.  We'll be right back, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIALBREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back now a top story this morning.  Done reform  initiatives one week after the horrific high school shooting in Parkland,  Florida left 17 people dead more than a dozen others injured.  President  Trump will host individuals directly impacted by this horrors of the school  shootings for a listening session at the White House, to see what can be  done.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  As I said in my remarks the  day after the shooting, is that we cannot merely take actions that make us  feel like we are making a difference, we must actually make a difference.   We must move past cliches and tired debates and focus on evidence-based  solutions and security measures that actually work and that make it easier  for men and women of law enforcement to protect our children and to protect  our safety.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The President has signed a memorandum proposing a ban on bump  stock devices and imposing a stricter gun purchasing background checks  system.  Joining us right now is the Dailymail.com White House  Correspondent Francesca Chambers.  Francesca, good to see you.  Thanks for  joining the conversation this morning.  </p><p>FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, DAILYMAIL.COM: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on all of this?  Gun reform legislation, will  it pass?  Are these the right moves in your view that the President should  be focused on right now?</p><p>CHAMBERS:  Well Congress is out of session this week, Maria.  So we'll be  waiting to hear from lawmakers when they get back to Washington.  Like in  their absence the President in the White House yesterday made several moves  in the direction of additional gun control.  You've heard the President  there talking about bump stocks.  But at the White House press briefing  yesterday, Sarah Sanders the White House press secretary said they had not  closed the door to any specific gun control proposals and that's what this  listening sessions would be about.  That would include stricter background  checks and legislation in the Senate that the President has his eye on,  that could also include an assault weapons ban.  She was asked about that  as well.  And the White House press secretary also said the President was  directing his health and human services department to look at guidelines  and additional rules that it could put in place that would potentially do  with the mental health as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes the NRA has not commented any of this just yet.  They're  going to wait.</p><p>MURPHY:  They're waiting and there's a lot of talk about the amount of  money that is donated by the NRA for different political campaigns.  I  think that the big thing here is as I look at it is, I don't see what the  positive cases unless somebody should be able to go out and get second  amendment right to bear arms, but someone to go out and own a machine gun?   I think you look at --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have to stop you.  Machine guns are illegal in this country  and they have been since the 1930s.  Tommy guns were illegal.  We're  talking about the difference between automatic and semi-automatic.  It is  not illegal for the -- it is not legal for the average person in this  country to own an automatic weapon.  The only ones that are legal to -- the  only ones that are legal to exist were built before 1986.  You said machine  guns. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MURPHY:  I stand corrected.  I mean, nobody should be able to walk into a  school and shoot kids that are sitting there with an automatic gun.  That's  my point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not automatic.  It's semi-automatic.  And this is why --  this is why the language is important.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Anything that's in fire and ton of bullets.  Well, the language is  important but my point is nobody should be able to walk into a school and  shoot tons of people in a matter of seconds.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well nobody says that kid -- that murder is OK.  This is about  the second amendment.  Nobody thinks murdering children is OK.</p><p>MURPHY:  Whether you call that automatic or non-automatic.  It's about --  It's about -- my point was about the gun.  The type of gun that was used.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well I'm trying to correct because automatic weapons are not  legal in this country.  And they haven't been since the 1930s, number one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's important.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And number two, the Democrats, where were they in the first two  years of the Obama administration if they wanted to ban the assault weapons</p><p>MURPHY:  If I could just finish the point then, I don't think this is about  Republicans or Democrats.  It's not for me anyway.  It's about people being  safe in this country.  So, what if you stand on Republican this and  Democrats this, then I completely --.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well that's what it completely (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>MURPHY:  Well it doesn't for me.  So you can raise your voice to make your  Republican inverse Democrat.  I don't feel that way.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm trying to, listen, I have to hear -- listen, I have hear a  lot of language used when talking about these weapons and people don't know  what they're talking about.  This is a semi-automatic weapon and it is --  there was an assault weapons ban.  An assault by the way defined the  cosmetic features of the weapon.  Not the caliber of it.  It existed during  the Clinton administration and the Justice -- Department of Justice let the  assault weapon ban expire in 2004 because there was no hard-core evidence  that it prevented extra violence in this country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the issue.  And my point is, it's already illegal in this  country to get -- pass a background check if you are involuntarily  committed to a mental institution or have been adjudicated by a court of  law that you are mentally incompetent.  The issue is, which President Trump  is trying to fix and John Cornyn and Chris Murphy in Connecticut, is the  background check system fails time and again.  Failed in the Texas  shooting.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because the Air Force didn't report a domestic violence  conviction against the shooter in that incident.  In that -- where he  killed, I think it was 27 people.  So the background check system is broken  and bump stocks which do turned semi-automatic weapons into automatic  weapons.  Trump is trying to move to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  By banning bump stocks.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ban them.  This was something because a bump stock was used in  the shooting in Las Vegas.  And there's a lot of talk about banning them  and nobody moved to do anything.  Now President Trump is trying to step up  and make it happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you disagree with semi-automatics being available, that  legal?</p><p>MURPHY:  No, I'm not an expert.  I think whatever law can be passed to  prevent someone from walking in and firing off massive amounts of bullets  into a crowd anywhere, I'm for that.  I think its way past Republican this,  Democrat that, what do you call it?  Automatic, semi-automatic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think we all agree with that, by the way.</p><p>MURPHY:  The point is no one can walk into a school and shoot up --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course not.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But to Francesca's point.  Francesca, there are a lot of laws on  the books that are not being followed.  The failures in the background  check system that allowed like, the shooter in Virginia tech.  He should  never have been allowed to purchase a handgun that killed all those kids.   That's the point.  That's what I'm trying to say is, if we can fix the  existing laws in the systems, that would go a long way without having to  basically put in place a blanket then that would violate some individuals  constitutional right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead, Francesca.</p><p>CHAMBERS:  Into your point about the legislation that Senator Cornyn and  Chris Murphy of support, that is the legislation that the White House says  that the President would potentially be willing to support.  But they're  not giving it a blanket endorsement because as you have also noted on the  panel, the language is going to be important.  The White House wants to see  what the final language of that bill would be before they give that their  endorsement.  So that's one thing there, but I think we'll be keeping an  eye on.  It's not you know, it's not that the White House is fully  endorsing now.  And they haven't said, by the way, what they would be  willing to endorse when it comes to these background checks and making them  certain.  </p><p>BARTIROMO: Well I mean, Nikolas Cruz was a known threat.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes, he made a threat on YouTube, I mean that --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He was a threat.  So where was the background check?</p><p>MURPHY:  And he was identified to the FBI, And this goes back to the --  your NRA team earlier.  Last year the House passed a bill that was  supported by the NRA, President Trump and the police that would tighten the  restrictions on background checks.  And so the House already passed that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well this is what-- this is what John Cornyn and Chris Murphy  are trying to do, but there was inserted into that law, that bill in the  House.  That was -- they wanted to put in a provision that required the  reciprocity for owners of concealed firearm permit to carry them across  state lines, something that we've talked about here.  The Democrats opposed  the reciprocity provision.  So there was something else in that House bill.   It wasn't as clean and as the bill is in the senate.  Just to be clear  about that.  But Maria, you raise an interesting issue that he was -- Cruz  was a known threat.  He's been called, the parents called the cops to the  house, more than 20 times.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Even his aunt.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But again, it requires someone stepping up with a legal court  order, so that court order has been put into the background check system.   There are federal laws to prevent the mentally ill from getting guns, but  it requires -- this is what we're talking about, this gun violence  restraining order that would allow the parents, the guardians, or even the  police department or local law prosecutors to take a gun away from somebody  who might be a threat to someone else or even themselves.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's in the record?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But he -- but there was no -- but, if he had never been tried  and convicted, if he had never been found mentally incompetent by a court,  if he'd never been involuntarily committed to a mental institution, there's  no -- there's nothing that would be in the national background check system  for Nikolas Cruz.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're saying the background check has to change to include  some of the issues that were obvious about Nikolas Cruz, even though a  court did not deem him mentally challenged?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If the parents had stepped up and said, this child needs to be  involuntarily committed to a mental institution, he would not have been  allowed to buy a weapon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's up to the guardians and the local law enforcement to do  something about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Francesca, final word from you, do you think we're going to  learn something from these listening sessions today?</p><p>CHAMBERS:  I think that we will hear a lot from the students, but the  question for me is, will we learn more about more of the President's  position on these weapons, again, the White House, staying very quiet  yesterday, not really taking a strong position on any of these -- on any of  the legislation other than to say that they would support stricter  background checks, so, I think, a lot of us are really curious to hear the  President's thoughts on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds to me like the President is leaning toward making  some changes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Everybody wants some changes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everybody wants something.  Francesca Chambers, thank you.   We'll see you soon.  Fox Business is taking you, live, to the President's  listening session today, 4:15 Eastern today.  Join us on Fox Business.   We'll be right back, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so  much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday, February 21,  your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Let's check  Futures right now because we are looking at another doozy this morning.   Yesterday, a sharp selloff continues this morning, Dow Industrials down 50  points, NASDAQ, S&amp;P 500, fractionally lower, but nonetheless, in the  negative column.  </p><p>Investors are waiting on the Federal Reserve minutes due later this  afternoon.  That is going to tell us about the January meeting looking for  the Central Bank's take on inflation and the next interest rate hike.  By  the way, the next fed meeting is in March, so that could be, when we get  that interest rate hike that we're all worried about.  The selloff  yesterday was sharp, and it was deep and it, basically, snapped a six-day  winning streak, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500, ending down sharply, snapping that  winning streak.  </p><p>Stocks dragged down by Wal-Mart which, of course, we told you about earlier  in the day, right here, when we show -- when we showed you the earnings and  the same-store sales.  That was the worst day in the percentage basis for  Wal-Mart in 30 years, that's what the Dow Industrials down about one  percent and the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P 500 also under selling pressure as you  can see.  Check the European indices right now.  </p><p>Let's take a look at where we stand.  European indices down across the  board, edging lower, not major moves, but nonetheless, we got the FT down  14 and we got the DAX Index down 108 points, that's almost one percent this  morning, on the downside.  Check Asian markets, markets are higher across  the board.  China is closed up for the Lunar New year still, as you can see  there, but the best performer was Hong Kong, that was up almost two percent  on the session.  </p><p>President Trump unveils on Obamacare alternative, the administration's new  plan that could save consumers money.  We've got it for you.  And then the  new sexual misconduct allegations out this morning, this time, in the world  of sports, the Dallas Mavericks are the focus of a new shocking Sports  Illustrated report.  Now, owner, Mark Cuban, is taking action.  Let's see  here what he had to say about it.  </p><p>And then Louisville sex scandal, causing the team a championship, the NCW  vacating the team's 2013 win, plus, move over Bitcoin, Venezuela oil-backed  crypto currency has debuted.  The country's President says, pre-sales  raised nearly $1 billion, we'll tell you about Petro, coming up.</p><p>Then there's this, Lindsey Vonn slamming her critics in South Korea after  she failed to win the gold medal yesterday.  We've got all the highlights  from the race, coming up.  And one winner of the winter games that isn't  even there, why one band is seeing its streams jump, nearly 15 percent, all  that coming up this morning, but first, our top story this half an hour,  President Trump's take on Obamacare.  </p><p>The Trump administration is now moving to allow health insurers to sell  lower cost, less comprehensive medical plans, as an alternative to  Obamacare.  The new rules allow people to purchase short-term insurance for  up to 12 months, reversing an Obama administration decision which limited  the plans to three months.  Now, Democrats are fuming over this move,  Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, for example, is alleging the Trump administration  with promoting, quote, \"junk insurance\".  </p><p>Joining us right now to weigh in and she's brought some props with her,  Former Lieutenant Governor of New York State, now, Senior Fellow at the  London Center for Policy Research and the New York Post Columnist, Betsy  McCaughey, Betsy, good to see you.</p><p>BETSY MCCAUGHEY:  Well, thank you.  This is Obamacare or 2,572 pages.  I  couldn't carry in the 40,000 pages of regulations to go along with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I can't believe you brought that in.</p><p>MCCAUGHEY:  The key is that the new tax law zeroed out the penalty for  failing to have Obamacare a compliant insurance.  But, President Trump is  saying, well, let's get people something else to buy, something that's  affordable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is this junk insurance?</p><p>MCCAUGHEY:  This is not junk insurance.  And in fact, even before this  announcement, people were flocking to buy what they're called the short- term plans.  What are they?  Well, they allow insurance companies to  underwrite, so it's a much better value for young healthy people who have  been vastly overpaying under Obamacare because Obamacare forces healthy  people to pay the same premiums as very sick people to use 10 times as much  insurance, so also, it gives consumers the choice of what benefits they  want.  So, a woman with no children doesn't have to pay for Pediatric  Dental Care --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCCAUGHEY:  For example.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that was the issue, you had all the stuff in there that  you weren't using and you had to pay for it, under Obamacare.</p><p>MCCAUGHEY:  This is urgently needed relief for eight or nine million people  currently in the Obamacare market who don't get a subsidy to buy that very  pricy insurance.  They're seen their premiums more than double, they never  make it pass that huge deductible, so they don't get anything.  Now,  they're going to be able to buy, what are called, short-term plans and  probably renew them under this regulation.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  As a small business owner, isn't this -- isn't this a good  move, Mike Murphy?</p><p>MURPHY:  It seems like a good move because like you say, small businesses  were getting choked by Obamacare, by the requirement that's being --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>MURPHY:  Put on by --</p><p>MCCAUGHEY:  The one size fits all.</p><p>MURPHY:  Right.  This seems like -- and I'll still refer to as Ms.  McCaughey from my days as your doorman.  Is there --</p><p>MCCAUGHEY:  Such a polite young man.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I want to hear the story.  I forgot that.</p><p>MURPHY:  I was a -- I used to be a doorman and this was one of my tenants.</p><p>MCCAUGHEY:  That is so great.</p><p>MURPHY:  And she looks exactly the same.</p><p>MCCAUGHEY:  And look how he cleaned up so well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're going to make a point.</p><p>KELLY:  Oh, I was just going to say that, listen, this administration is  addressing needs of the American people and you can see it through the IRS  payrolls that, basically, you had seven million people, latest number we  know that actually opted to pay a fine to the IRS, than have the owners  mandates of Obamacare.  So this is </p><p>MCCAUGHEY:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, so there's junk insurance.  It's just -- it's sad to see that  it's still becoming politicized because we have Nancy Pelosi on a  (INAUDIBLE) talking about taxes -- exactly.  That's what I mean, so there's  no solution --</p><p>MCCAUGHEY:  Well, that's because Obama has tried to label it as junk when  he imposed all these new restrictions on consumers and limited what they  could buy.  Keep an eye also on what's happening in Idaho, because Idaho,  this week, announced that it is simply opening up the individual and small  group market, Blue Cross Blue Shield, the first insurer there that's going  to be offering plans that aren't short-term, aren't limited to 12 months,  but also, we'll have all of this flexibility in terms of benefits.  They  will have medical underwriting.  Their plans are going to cost you about 50  percent of what Obamacare costs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just real quickly, though, and I can't believe I'll agree with  Nancy Pelosi on this, that some of these insurers, though, they operate in  a sleazy way, and when they start selling these short-term plans to people,  they're not real up front about what people are buying, and I've witnessed  this first-hand for somebody buys a short-term plan and they didn't know it  was a short-term plan.  So that's up to the state insurance regulators.</p><p>MCCAUGHEY:  It's true, and also, look at the HHS regulations that are being  examined right now, because they do make it clear what insurance companies  have to very visibly disclose to consumers, but the assumption is here that  the American people are smarter than the bureaucrats in Washington who are  ramming this one size fits all, very expensive plan down their throat.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And now that I see what it looks like, I'm sure that they  didn't read it.</p><p>MCCAUGHEY:  Believe me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sure that they didn't read it.</p><p>MCCAUGHEY:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Betsy, great to see you.</p><p>MCCAUGHEY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Thanks for lugging that all over here too,  Betsy McCaughey joining us there.  Coming up, years of alleged harassment  and the views inside the Dallas Mavericks' front office apparently, now we  know.  Startling reports are revealed after a dozen current and former  employees come forward about working for the NBA team, reactions from the  team owner, Mark Cuban, and the fallout, coming up.  </p><p>And then ready for lift-off, the Vice President visits Kennedy Space  Center, and it's set to outline new plans to launch private ventures in  space, this comes as Elon Musk's SpaceX blasts off this morning for its  latest mission, we'll take you there, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Vice President Mike Pence was close to a meeting with North  Korean delegates during the Olympic games in South Korea, we now learned.   Cheryl Casone with the details now, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Exactly.  We're now learning about this, Maria, that's a great  point.  It was close but North Korea backed out at the last minute at this.   Aides to Pence say that North Korean officials called off the meeting  because they were unhappy with the vice president's tough message,  denouncing the country's human rights record and warning about more  sanctions.  The fact that the meeting was discussed signals the shift in  policy in the Trump administration which had ruled it out in the past.  </p><p>Meanwhile, later today, Vice President Pence is expected to announce  proposals to give a list to American companies doing businesses in space.   The Trump administration wants to promote private space ventures and is  considering ideas like easy launch roles and putting the Commerce  Department in charge of broader deregulations efforts.  Basically, the  government wants pay-forth for other companies.  </p><p>Meanwhile the private company leading the charge in the budding aerospace  industry is set for another launch today.  SpaceX is preparing to send its  reusable Falcon 9 rocket into orbit again.  This time, delivering three  satellites, two of the satellites are part of SpaceX's goal to bring  Internet access to rural areas.  Launch is set for 9:17 this morning from  Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.  </p><p>Well, this is interesting.  Venezuela's government is launching  cryptocurrency backed by the country's vast oil supply.  The country does  the pre-sale of the Petro, which runs until March 19th, it's already raised  $735 million.  $60.00 tokens were sold to investors.  Venezuela's hoping  that Petro will help rescue an economy that's been hit hard by soaring  inflation and U.S. sanctions.  All I can think about is, if I buy the  Petro, is the government going to take it away from me when they need the  money?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I think that's a good point.  Is that why  cryptocurrencies are doing well there.  Kevin, you're a crypto guy, you  like Bitcoin.  I know you love blockchain.  What do you think about this  Venezuelan cryptocurrency.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, I think it's pretty interesting.  Obviously, it's going to be  -- it's not an open ledger system if it's going to be controlled by  Venezuela.  I mean, Venezuela Bitcoin actually took hold, because people  could get their money out of there.  They weren't subject to government  mandates, and then they didn't have to worry about the rising cost of  inflation over there.  It could get their money out of this system.  So,  the details are pretty scant.  Everyone's been very skeptical about this  whole Petro cryptocurrency situation, and it's, you know -- I think it's  just headline news that he's just trying to get out there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, the government is not changing.  You're still talking  about corruption, why would Petro take it out of -- </p><p>KELLY:  No one is going to invest in a system -- I mean, oil investors have  been worried about the reserves, been worried about lending money to the  state.  And so, this was his solution to bring in money to get more of oil  revenues out.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Scam essentially. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sounds like.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's a scam.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Totally agree with Dagen.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>KELLY:  Well, we're not highlighting another scam that happened that I  don't think that was Kim Jong-un's sister, because I have eyesight and that  guys look -- Kim Jong-un looks like Harvey Weinstein and then she does not  look anything like him.  And I think it's pretty -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is his sister.  </p><p>KELLY:  Do we really know that, though, because when she came to power,  like, we have scant details on Kim Jong-un and then all of a sudden, his  sister comes out of the woodworks?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, she was supposed to meet with the vice president and the  whole delegation.  They did all this on the downlow quiet, they had a  meeting schedule.  And then two hours before the meeting, Ms. Cheryl told  us they pulled out.  I don't know why.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Crypto thing is not going to end well.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's Venezuela.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Kim Jong-un, I don't know.  Segue?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We agree, it's not going to end well anywhere, I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  Segue that it was a robot from crypto -- </p><p>KELLY:  I just think that I was looking at some of her body language, and  she's like I can't believe people actually think I'm his sister.  This is  crazy that we're getting away with this.  This is unbelievable.  I mean,  that's what I think the bigger scam is.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, my god.  All right, we'll have more on that, coming up.   But first, we'll take a break.  Then-Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn making  history with her latest medal win and she's slamming her critics says, she  has an incredible career, she says it will likely come to an end soon.   Plus, from Russia with love, why the American ban OAR, is feeling the love  from fans because of the Russian athletes at the Olympics.  Wait till you  hear this, back in a minute right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The new sexual harassment allegations rock the  NBA.  The Dallas Mavericks now the focus of a new report from Sports  Illustrated over the conduct over the team's former CEO and president.   Jared Max with the story now.  Jared, good morning.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria.   Sports Illustrated as published a scathing story about culture that existed  within the Dallas Mavericks organization under former team president and  CEO, Terdema Ussery, described as animal house like atmosphere.  The team  and Ussery accused of several incidents of inappropriate behavior toward  female employee.  Ussery was with the team for 15 years.  He departed three  years ago.  Dallas Mavericks under Mark Cuban says the team only learned of  these accusations days ago.  He told Sports Illustrated: \"It's wrong, it's  abhorrent, it's not a situation we condone.  I can't tell you how many  times particularly since all this #metoo stuff has been coming out  recently.  I asked our H.R. director, do we have a problem, do we have any  issues I have to be aware of?  And the answer was no.\"  The Mavericks are  inducting -- conducting an internal investigation.  </p><p>Punishment like never before in college basketball.  The result of sex  scandal within their basketball program, Louisville, yesterday had an NCAA  appeal denied and will have to forfeit their NCAA championship from 2013 --  never before had a men's NCAA basketball champ had its title revoked.  123  games that Louisville won between 2011 and 2015 vacated.  The school must  return millions of dollars it received as compensation for NCAA tournament  appearances.  Disgraced Former Louisville Coach, Rick Patino, now might  want to vacate this tattoo that honors that team.  </p><p>Monumental performance by 33-year-old American Skier, Lindsey Vonn.  She  became the oldest medalist in Alpine Skiing at the Winter Games.  She won a  bronze medal in downhill after Vonn told NBC, I wish I could keep going, I  wish this wasn't my last Olympics, but it is.  So, she doesn't think her  body can take another four years of ski racing and hope she made her  grandfather proud.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LINDSEY VONN, AMERICAN SKIER:  Our family never gives up, and I never gave  up.  I kept working hard and I am really proud of this medal, and I know he  is too.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX:  Lindsey Vonn also called Twitter trolls who attacked her for her  opposition to President Trump, \"savage abuse\".  She will ski tomorrow in  the Alpine Combine.  </p><p>No miracle on ice this year.  One night after on Herald that Americans kept  the dream alive by defeating Slovakia; the Americans went down in shoot-out  against the well-rested Czech Republic team.  Final score, 3-2.  Team USA  is eliminated.  </p><p>Women's U.S. hockey team plays for gold against the four-time defending  Olympic championship, Canada tonight, late 11:30 Eastern Time.  </p><p>The Olympic athletes from Russia, right, that's what we refer to Russian  Olympians punishment for their serial doping programs at the Sochi Games.   Olympic Athletes from Russia, OAR, also the name of alternative rock band,  that because of the sudden popularity of these three letters -- OAR -- at  the Olympics the ban has seen a 46 percent spike in streams on Spotify.   Google searches have more than doubled and perfect timing, the band is just  announcing they're going out on tour.  They're already close to selling out  some of their largest venues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they have absolutely nothing to do with -- </p><p>MAX:  Thanks to those dopers in Russia.</p><p>MURPHY:  People were streaming their music, were they thinking maybe that  was them on the ice.  </p><p>KELLY:  No, because you see OAR, and you're like, oh, my gosh, what was the  hit song again?  I totally forgot about it, and then they pull it up, they  stream it, and then Spotify sends them an e-mail: hey, you listen to OAR,  why don't you buy tickets for the show?  And you're like, why not?  I have  disposable income from the tax cuts.  That's clearly what happened.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MURPHY:  Sounds like it was a tough concert. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's hilarious.  Speaking of tax cuts and President Trump,  let's talk about Lindsey Vonn slamming the haters on her Twitter account.   What happened that the followers are so upset?  </p><p>MAX:  I think what happened is we just live in modern times.  God forbid,  you have a different political opinion than I do.  I guess you have a right  to just smash me.  And I think that's what happened, and you know, she went  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She has every right to keep our mouth shut too.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a break.

The big loser --  yesterday rather -- pardon me -- the big loser yesterday was Wal-Mart.</p><p>As we told you yesterday, the stock tumbled.

Boston Dynamics releases a scary  new video of humans trying to block the company's spot mini from opening  the door.  Watch this.  We've got a possible look into the future with spot  mini right there opening the door.  Will he be able to do it?  Yes.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning and joining me to break it all  down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; Rosecliff CEO and managing  partner Mike Murphy; and Benchmark managing partner Kevin Kelly.  Great to  see everybody.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO AND MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF:  So good to be here.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know if I'm looking forward to the spot minis of the  world in my life with machine learning.  I mean it looks great, but it can  do everything.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I agree.  It seems like I got the door, I can get it myself.   Like, I don't need this scary robot.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maybe those robots could teach some men in New York City a thing  or two about opening doors for people.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Interesting.  Interesting for sure.</p><p>KELLY:  You know what can teach men -- you know, what's important about  that?  Parenting should do that, right.  Parents should get out and teach  your children how to treat women correctly, open a door, common courtesy.   I don't think a robot revolution should be doing that.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I'll agree with that.  The robot ---it is something that, you  know, they've gotten so -- we've all seen the movies and they've gotten --  they've come so far, so fast.  You have to wonder what the future holds.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And it's a scary sight, actually.  We're going to talk  about that coming up.</p><p>But our top story right now, laying out an economic road map.  The Trump  administration will release its comprehensive report on the economy later  today.  It is expected to include analysis on both fiscal and monetary  policy as well as the potential impact of those policies on productivity,  on consumer spending, and on inflation.</p><p>The President's chairman of economic advisers, Kevin Hassett compiled a  report and he's scheduled to discuss it -- he's scheduled to discuss with  the President later this morning.</p><p>And joining me ahead of all of that is the Treasury Department's  undersecretary for international affairs, David Malpass.  David -- good to  see you.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.  </p><p>DAVID MALPASS, UNDERSECRETARY FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, TREASURY  DEPARTMENT:  Hello, Maria -- how are you? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good.  Let's talk about what's the most important from this  report.  What should we expect?  </p><p>MALPASS:  We'll it's packed with growth policies.  You know, I don't want  to get ahead of the President or Kevin, but it's the report that will go to  Congress and it lays out how you grow, how much you can grow.  It's got 700  pages.  It's been a tremendous piece of work.</p><p>It talks about small businesses and about the need for higher median  income.  You know, one of the things that hurt the U.S. over the last  several years, 10 years, was the decline in median income.  That means the  middle of the economy wasn't doing well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MALPASS:  And so one of the focus in the report is how do you get that  higher through better growth policies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I'm really glad you mentioned that because it is all  about growth -- David.  And I know that and I know that you've worked on  this for a long time.</p><p>But some of these expectations are a bit rosy.  I mean when you look at the  budget and even the spending plan, we had Paul Ryan on the show last week  and I asked him the same question.  In the budget there are expectations of  3 percent growth for 10 years out -- David.</p><p>I mean what if we have a recession?  What if we don't have 3 percent growth  every year?  Can you really count on growth eating into some of the  spending and the deficits that we're talking about when you've got lots of  rosy predictions in the report -- don't you?  </p><p>MALPASS:  You won't know every year ahead of time what the growth rate is  going to be.  But if you put in good policies -- and let's think through  what those are.  There's been tax reform.  There's regulatory reform.   There's energy reform.  These are really powerful.  And so they change the  structure of the economy.</p><p>The goal here is to have more people working in more businesses and that  creates the diversification that can give you a higher average growth rate.   Remember, we used to grow faster as a nation.</p><p>It's only this last decade where there's been this slow growth that's been  such a problem.  So if you can create better policies, you can get the  faster growth.  I don't think it's rosy to think about the U.S. doing well  finally again.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  I think it's wonderful to have expectations of growth.   I'm just wondering how realistic they are given the fact that the typical  recovery -- how long does the typical recovery last, David?  Eight years?   What are we in -- are we in year nine right now?  </p><p>MALPASS:  Yes.  But -- we are.  But it wasn't much of a recovery.  One of  the reasons this can go on is because the policies are improving.  That's  the key thing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  That I agree with.  The policies are definitely improving  when you look at tax reform and the rollback in regulation.  That's big.</p><p>And yet, the Democrats don't see it, right?  I mean they're attacking the  GOP tax code overhaul every day, despite the growing support of the new  law.</p><p>We just saw Americans -- a majority of Americans say yes, we like the tax  plan.  And then of course, there's House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.   Here's what she said about the bill just yesterday -- David.  Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PELOSI:  If what you're doing is cutting the taxes at the high end and,  therefore, not being allowed to invest in the future, you're doing a great  disservice to our country.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Unpatriotic.  </p><p>PELOSI:  Yes.  So when they say, why are we talking about this?  We're not  talking about this for political reasons.  I wish this weren't even  necessary.  I wish we would have come together to do a fair tax bill.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She's not talking about that to be political, David, she said.   She said it was crumbs, the bonuses are crumbs and now it's unpatriotic.   Your thoughts.  </p><p>MALPASS:  Well, she didn't say every Democrat voted against the bill.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  </p><p>MALPASS:  And so they've got a stake in that.  I think when she talked  about investment there, there was a mix-up because the investment that's  need in order to create jobs is in the private sector.  It sounded to me  like she was talking about bigger government as a way to get ahead.  And we  know from history that that's not the way forward.</p><p>The way forward is to allow businesses to keep some of their money and they  invest it in machines.  They hire workers and they go forward.  I think  that needs to be kind of the redirection that the nation needs.  And that  shows up both in the economic report of the President that will be coming  out, but also in the budget.</p><p>You know, a critical part of the budget for the next year is peace through  strength.  There had to be a way to reverse the weakness that had been in  national security.  And so that's a big part of what's going to draw  investment into the United States, help businesses invest in their own  future.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I understand.  But let's not forget that people are upset  about the spending.</p><p>Let's talk about the budge battle that's currently happening.  Earlier this  month lawmakers passed that stop gap bill to keep the lights on through  March 23rd.  Congress is still hammering out a deal though on full  appropriations for the remainder of the fiscal year.  Is your department  expecting another shutdown showdown next month?  </p><p>MALPASS:  I don't expect a shutdown but what we will see, I think, is  spending that goes -- that sprawls too broadly across the U.S. government.   And so I think there's a huge amount of work that needs to be done over the  next one, two, three, six years in order to try to get more balance in the  way that the U.S. budget operates.</p><p>Right now there's huge number of programs that simply aren't needed and  there has to be a way to allow them to reach a demise, to move on, to  better programs into the future.  But the budget I think at the highest  priority had to create security, national security for the economy and it  does that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a good point.  I know you're speaking later at the  Camp Forum on Global Economic Growth.  What are you expecting from that  event?  What are going to be the main points that you want to make in terms  of where that growth comes from -- David?  </p><p>MALPASS:  Recall that Jack Kemp was a great leader in trying to have  inclusive growth.  That means everyone, that means the median income going  up, that means growth for everyone and jobs for as many people as is  possible.  So, I'll be talking about how that can be done on an  international front.</p><p>Some of our policies -- you know, we have a lot of change in direction that  will make our nation stronger.  One of those is redirecting our policy  toward China where we had fallen into a pattern of weakness as a nation.</p><p>Another is in the western hemisphere.  We've laid out a set of 10  initiatives that will make our own hemisphere stronger and more growth- oriented.  The trade renegotiations of course, I'll talk some about we need  to make them work for American workers.</p><p>And so those are all initiatives under way that the Treasury Department is  involved in and leading on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  David -- what are your expectations for debt and deficits.  How  worried are you about the trillion-dollar deficits that are now front and  center for 10 years plus out?  </p><p>MALPASS:  It's a very challenging environment.  I think the debt is too  high now and it's going higher.  A lot of that comes from the weakness that  we had in previous years.</p><p>And so the trajectory for the U.S. economy had fallen lower and lower and  that became of course an issue in the campaign, that there needed to be a  change to make it begin to recover.  Once that happens, that's going to  help slow the growth in the debt.</p><p>But for now, we don't have a very good budget process to do that.  We have  to go with the priority of national security, peace through strength, and  that's going to be costly.</p><p>And so I'm troubled by the deficit.  I'm troubled by the national debt.   And I think we need a three-year program to grapple with it and starting  this month, next month, and on forward.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And in the meantime, we should expect growth -- that growth  generated as a result of the policies out of this administration to cut  into some of the -- some of the deficit numbers? </p><p>I mean are you counting on growth taking you out of this or at some point  are we going to see a program to rein in the entitlements which, of course,  we know is where all the spending is.  </p><p>MALPASS:  You know, at present I think you have to grapple with the budget  as it is.  That means making hard choices every day in the appropriations  process, in the authorization process and Congress needs to really try  harder on that.</p><p>You ran the Nancy Pelosi clip where she's talking about the need for -- to  take more money from the people so that the government can invest it for  them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MALPASS:  That's not the way forward.  So we have to find a way, I think  starting with discretionary spending, to show that there's responsibility  in Washington.  I don't think we're there yet.  What we're doing -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you're definitely not there yet -- David.  We know what  happened with the budget spending bill just two weeks ago.  You've got all  this spending -- $300 billion, that's the whole point of the conversation.  </p><p>MALPASS:  Right.  And where else do you find in the world some institution  that can spend $4.5 trillion and look for more?  That's got to be turned  around.</p><p>So I agree with your point and your thrust.  There needs to be a lot more  work done on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching your efforts -- David.  Great to  have you on the program this morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>MALPASS:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  David Malpass joining us there in Washington.  </p><p>Coming up, Jeff Bezos takes on time, literally.  The Amazon CEO's new $42  million project that aims to span centuries.  We will tell you about it.   Wait until you check out this clock.</p><p>Plus, good luck stopping Spot -- what happens when a Boston Dynamics  engineer tries to stop a dog-like robot from opening the door.  You'll see  this incredible video.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p>President Trump is holding a listening session today about gun violence at  the White House.  Cheryl Casone with the details now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right -- Maria.</p><p>President Trump is hosting parents, teachers and students for this  listening session this afternoon.  The White House says the attendees  include people affected by mass shootings in Parkland, Newtown, Connecticut  and Columbine.</p><p>This comes as the President moves to impose a regulation that would ban  bump stocks in the wake of the Parkland, Florida shooting.  The bump stock  was not used in that shooting but the device was used in the Las Vegas  massacre last year.</p><p>The President also tweeting last night, \"Whether we are Republican or  Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening background checks.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, three junior ROTC cadets who were killed in last week's shooting  had been honored by the U.S. Army.  Alaina Petty, Peter Wang and Martin  Duque each received heroism medals.  That is the highest honor for any  junior cadet.  According to students and teachers 15-year-old Wang died in  his uniform while he was helping others escape the shooting rampage.</p><p>Additionally, the military academy, West Point, is posthumously admitting  Wang, who dreamed to attending the prestigious academy.</p><p>Well, Americans setting a record for trying to bring guns on the plane.   The Transportation Security Administration says they found 104 guns in  carry-on bags between February 5th and February 11th.  TSA says that 87 of  those were loaded.  Agency rules require that weapons must be unloaded and  stored in checked baggage.  Word of the record-breaking week comes just  days after an armed teenager, again, killed 17 people in a school in  Florida.</p><p>And then finally, I'm going to leave you with this story.  Amazon's CEO,  Jeff Bezos, wasting no time on his new project.  Bezos tweeting out this  video.  He's investing -- get this -- $42 million into building a 10,000- year clock in Texas.  Bezos says the clock's going to be 500 feet tall, all  mechanical, powered by day and night thermal cycles and, get this,  synchronized at solar noon.</p><p>He writes that he wants this to serve as quote, a symbol for long-term  thinking -- Maria.  The big question is why, why is he doing this?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he does have, what, $120 billion or something.  </p><p>CASONE:  I mean a lot of money -- </p><p>KELLY:  I'll tell you what, that's three seconds in the market for him when  his stock goes up like, you know -- </p><p>MURPHY:  He's made probably $2 million this morning already.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I like it.  I like it.</p><p>All right.  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up -- how common is sexual assault in Hollywood?  The shocking  percentage of women in the entertainment industry that say they have, in  fact, experienced harassment or assault.</p><p>Then markets looking to rebound this morning a bit; we're well off of the  lows.  The Dow closed lower yesterday after Wal-Mart had its worst day  since 1988.  The stock this morning at $94.11 and the broader markets  fractionally lower.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Markets were off of the lows, take a look.  Futures now mixed, Dow  Industrials down 20 points but the S&amp;P 500 is down just a fraction, under a  point.  And the Nasdaq is actually up 14 point right now.  This, after a  pretty good selloff yesterday; the Dow and S&amp;P 500 snapping a six-session  winning streak yesterday.  The Dow was down better than 250 points.</p><p>Joining us right now to weigh in is Oppenheimer Funds chief investment  officer Krishna Memani.  Krishna -- good to see you.</p><p>KRISHNA MEMANI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER:  Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you expecting this year?  </p><p>MEMANI:  So, we still expect equities to do reasonably well.  Market had  grown up a lot, it kind of recalibrated itself.  But the overall economy on  a global basis is doing quite well. </p><p>Earnings are good.  Rates are still very low.  They may be higher than  where they were but they're still very low.  That's still a good  environment for equities to do well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you like stocks.  I mean you said earlier, we look at S&amp;P  500 earnings, Mike -- talking about 20 percent gains for 2018 in the S&amp;P  500.  </p><p>MURPHY:  You have huge earnings growth which I think is the underpinning to  the market.  But I think when people talk about volatility, Krishna, you  know, we talk for years about needing to spur GDP growth; needing better  growth in this economy in the U.S.</p><p>Well, now we're getting it but with that, almost by definition, comes some  sort of inflationary pressures.  I don't know how much they are right now  so when you see volatility, this year versus last year, last year  everything was going in one direction.  Everybody needed to throw some heat  on the fire to get the economy going.</p><p>Now we have the economy going and all of a sudden you're seeing some people  saying well, inflation is creeping up so pull out of the market.  As an  investor at home, how do you look at that and do you stay along the market  or do you rebalance?  What's the move?</p><p>MEMANI:  So, our recommendation would be still to stay long the market.   Inflationary pressures have picked up some but inflation is still quite  low.  And therefore, the likelihood that rates rise in a meaningful way, I  don't think that's in the cards.</p><p>As long as that is the case, as you said, earnings are good, growth  momentum is good, tax cuts, the deficit spending related to the budget --  all of that will get growth higher rather than lower and inflation  remaining relatively stable in our view.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have yields.  Go ahead -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  But it raises the supply of debt that will be issued by the  Treasury at a time that that kind of unnatural demand created by the  Federal Reserve and the expansion of the balance sheet since the financial  crisis.</p><p>That's disappearing more and more as we move into the New Year.  So there  is an unknown, almost an unanswerable question about how much higher  treasury yields could go here.  </p><p>MEMANI:  Absolutely.  So treasuries have gone up in yield because of that  pressure.  Having said that, I think if U.S. growth is substantially higher  than what the trend rate is, a lot of that will leak overseas.  Trade  deficit would widen and that in turn will finance a lot of the treasuries  that need to be sold.</p><p>So I think that's the thing to watch.  If that is not the case, that is the  trade deficit doesn't widen or the foreign central banks are not buying  treasury debt, then overall dollar would be far more volatile and that  would be a sign of trouble.  </p><p>KELLY:  I think we're tip-toeing around a big, important issue.  It's that,  what are the reasons why everybody is talking about buy stocks and this is  a good time to put money to work is because there's an underlying bid in  the marketplace and that's companies themselves.</p><p>We saw actually Home Depot come out with earnings yesterday, they talked  about fiscal 2017 -- $8 billion in buybacks.  How should investors look at  that when they're coming into how deploying capital in the market?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you said that first a couple of weeks ago -- </p><p>KELLY:  Yes, yes -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- you're saying look, as soon as these earnings period -- we  get beyond the earnings period, companies are going to be in the market  buying their stock.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  They were blacked out from doing it.  So when the volatility  thing -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  If you're a CFO, you're like great, I can buy my stock at the same  price it was a couple of months ago.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Doesn't this boost the market -- </p><p>MEMANI:  Oh, absolutely.  Buybacks have been one of the biggest supports in  the market for quite some time.  Effectively the more money has come into  the stock market in a perverse through buybacks than through people buying  actually equity funds.</p><p>So clearly that has been a big support.  The tax legislation effectively  gives corporations more money to do more buybacks, whether -- and I think  they're likely to do more of that than capital investment.  So that's  something that we need to think about as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we need to see capital investment.  They've been sitting  on cash for so long, unwilling to put any money to work.  I think we're  going to see some capital investment.  </p><p>MEMANI:  Sure.  The economy is doing well.  So we will soon see some  capital investment.  Whether a lot of the tax cut gets invested or not I  think is an open question still.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  So what do you tell clients now?  </p><p>MEMANI:  We tell clients, you know, don't get too bogged down with a short  span of volatility.  Stick to buying equities -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Like what?  What equities do you -- </p><p>MEMANI:  We like emerging markets equities the best because the valuations  there are probably the best.  And growth prospects are quite good and they  are less China dependent.  So I think that's a good circumstance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because this is the first time in a long time that we're  seeing synchronized global growth.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Absolutely.  You underweight bonds though.</p><p>MEMANI:  No, I think again, bonds have a role in your portfolio.  And for  individual investors especially, if the markets don't work out the way we  expect them, you need a part of the portfolio that acts as a ballast (ph)  and bonds are the only thing that can do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's a lot of commentary about emerging markets right now.   All of our guests keep saying that's where the valuation opportunity is.</p><p>KELLY:  Well, the dollar's been weaker.  Commodities have gone up which has  helped them so there's a couple of things going on in that regard.  </p><p>MURPHY:  I'll take the S&amp;P versus emerging markets.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You will?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Totally.  </p><p>MEMANI:  Well, you've been a winner for the last five years -- </p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you.</p><p>MEMANI:  -- whether that would be the case for the next five is an open  question.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Krishna -- great insights from you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>MEMANI:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Krishna Memani, Oppenheimer Funds there.  </p><p>Coming up, the dossier probe enters phase two as the House Intelligence  Committee chaired by Devin Nunes threatens to subpoena top former officials  including Jim Comey over the disputed dossier and using the dossier as a  reason to wiretap American citizens.</p><p>Then see spot fight back, watch what happens when the four legged robot  does battle with a Boston Dynamics engineer.

You can't just take the fifth  because you don't want to answer the question.</p><p>And the image of a public official or former public official, that's Jim  Comey, taking the fifth is politically disastrous.</p><p>But Congressman Nunes is -- in my view is understandably frustrated at  what's going on.</p><p>Where is that Democratic version of the -- of the Republican memo that --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good point.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- supposedly was going to contradict (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They don't want to --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- redact, they don't even --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- they never wanted it out.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- certainly that's -- that's below the radar screen.</p><p>But I have to tell you, it's very unusual for there to be -- and I'll use  Congressman Nunes' phrase, 'a clash between the Legislative Branch and the  Executive Branch,' when they're in the same party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know, this happened when Republicans when Congress and  Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch were in the DOJ but you have a -- obviously a  Republican administration, Republicans running the Justice Department and  tremendous resistance to Republicans in the House Intelligence Committee.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But is it the Republicans that are resisting or people  underneath the people who are running?</p><p>I mean you've got -- obviously got Jeff Sessions, the attorney general but  there are people who are career DOJ-ers --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- before him --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- they --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- who may be Democrats.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- -- they cannot resist a subpoena.</p><p>I mean if this gets back to the present frustration, if Jeff Sessions had  not recused himself, he would pick up the phone and say to these people,  'give Congressman Nunes whatever he's asking for, that the chips fall where  they may.'</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MICHAEL P. MURPHY, FOUNDER, CEO &amp; MANAGING DIRECTOR, ROSECLIFF VENTURE  PARTNERS.  When you hear from Congressman Nunes that nobody seems  interested in giving the information that he's asking for, the -- do you  think he's talking about both parties?</p><p>Do you think he's saying that both parties are looking to protect each  other or keep this information out of the public?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  You know, the problem with congressional investigations is  members of Congress really only have one goal and that's to get reelected  so it can be infused with politics.</p><p>This particular committee which used to operate with near unanimity, with  the goal being protecting the national security of the United States, now  is as politically divided as the rest of the Congress is.</p><p>So, I don't know the answer to your question, Mike.</p><p>I don't know if the Committee unanimously voted to subpoena Jim Comey or to  subpoena whoever in the Justice Department, knew about and utilized the  Steele dossier or if it was 13:9, which will be a party-line vote,  Republicans with the 13 and Democrats with the nine.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I will say this, I have more confidence in the attorney  general, Jeff Sessions, after speaking with him this Sunday, I really feel  that he was adamant about making sure justice is served and this is after I  spoke with chairman Nunes on SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES on FOX NEWS, he told me  one of the worst things that he's found are actual felonies that have not  been prosecuted yet.</p><p>Listen to this Judge?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  The big felony in all of this, that nobody talks about, from the  very beginning was the leak of highly classified information when they  leaked the phone call of the Russian ambassador talking to General Mike  Flynn right before the inauguration.</p><p>That was a felony.  Nothing's ever been done about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  However, on Sunday, attorney general, Jeff Sessions, told me  that will be investigated.</p><p>He said, \"they have 27 open investigations right now of classified leaks,  before he came into the job, there were three.\"</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well I fully -- again, I fully share Congressman Nunes'  frustration.</p><p>I mean this is the infamous revelation in \"The Washington Post\" of a  transcript of a conversation between General Flynn and ambassador Kislyak.</p><p>Somebody in the West Wing, we are now in the waning days of the Obama  administration, Donald Trump is within weeks of becoming president of the  United States, it's late December of '16, early January of '17, somebody in  the West Wing says, 'I need to unmask this conversation.'</p><p>They knew exactly who it was! </p><p>And once they unmasked it, mysteriously within 24 hours it shows up in the  -- in \"The Washington Post\".</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That's called -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- they over-reach --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- that's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- again.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- that's called espionage.</p><p>That's a felony!</p><p>And if Jeff Sessions is prosecuting that, my hat is off to him; he should  prosecute it.</p><p>Because these people took an oath to preserve national security secrets;  the use of national security secrets, the use of raw intelligence data for  political purposes, will undermine the freedoms of the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think they're -- they could be also looking at Adam  Schiff because Adam Schiff is a known leaker, a lot of people --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- say he's the one leaking everything.</p><p>I wonder if he's part of the investigation!</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I guess (ph) --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are they - would they investigate somebody who is on the  Committee, the Intel -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Committee?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- doubt --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- that they would, he's protected by the speech --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- and the big clause which allows him to say almost anything  he wants in furtherance of speech or debate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he is.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- he is.</p><p>Should we switch gears and --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- and talk about AT&amp;T --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes--</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- let's do that --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- please, I would love it(ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- AT&amp;T, a judge has rejected AT&amp;T's request to see the White  House communication records about the Time Warner deal.</p><p>Back in November the Justice Department challenged the mega merger citing  concerns over competition.  This case is expected to go to trial next  month, Judge, your take on this?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- This is where I think the Trump administration is dropping  the ball.</p><p>I don't know if this is political.</p><p>It does seem political, I mean they allowed NBC Universal to happen,  they've got a bunch of conditions there that was an --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that--</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- enormous --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  --was Obama's --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- Justice Department.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I realize it was a different Justice Department.</p><p>But you see when the Justice Department puts conditions on the merger,  those conditions remain forever.</p><p>If the Justice Department loses this lawsuit and AT&amp;T and Time Warner can  merge, there's no conditions and they'll be in far worse shape than they -  than they would've been.</p><p>So, in my opinion, I don't know if it's political, I don't know if it's  been done because the president has said he hates CNN --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  CNN, yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- if - but if either it is or it isn't, if they can show that  it is which is why they want one of those White House time logs, if they  can show that it is (a) it's a -- it's a 'black-eye' to the White House,  it's a 'black-eye' to the president and the merger will happen with no  conditions; they will lose the opportunity to remove anti-competitive  aspects from the merger.</p><p>KELLY:   Well and is the judge -- was this going back to the fact that they  actually wanted communications from the White House as opposed to the  Department of Justice, is that why the judge --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They actually -</p><p>KELLY:  -- denied them (ph)?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- Kevin, it's a great question.</p><p>This was a fishing expedition, so they wanted White House logs of everybody  that visited the Oval Office from one, time period to another because they  didn't know who did it.</p><p>There's really no other way to find out who it was but it was so intrusive,  the court said no.</p><p>The court did give them some materials.  The court did give them materials  of White House talking to the Justice Department on the phone and in emails  but not the people that visited the president personally.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hmm!</p><p>MURPHY:  And is there any legal precedent for them to get that information?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I know of no legal precedence to get all the White House logs  but there is legal precedence to get whatever they need to defend  themselves.</p><p>Remember the government is suing to prevent this merger.  The government  has the burden of proving its case.</p><p>AT&amp;T should have available to it all the tools that it can to defend  itself.</p><p>KELLY:  And it's a tall order.  It's a vertical integration, right so it's  the pipes and the content and so I mean, listen Wall Street is very against  what's - what's happening against AT&amp;T.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They want fair markets.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The issue though is the conditions put on the ComcastNBC  Universal deal and whether they are actually being enforced because again  you require these conditions to approve the merger (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well that's --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  -- that's the Justice Department's duty to monitor these  things after the two become one.</p><p>But there will be no such conditions here because the Justice Department  has lost its opportunity to impose them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it sounded like the government is OK'ing FOX- \"Disney\"?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.

We'll examine the findings.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now this question, 'is a glass of wine the ticket to a long  life?'</p><p>A new study claims that drinking alcohol is more important than exercise if  you live past 90-years-old.</p><p>Researchers found that those who drink two or more glasses of beer or wine  a day cut their chances of a premature death by 18 percent, a wider margin  than those who exercise.</p><p>Joining us right now is Dr. Mikhail Varshavski, a.k.a. \"Doctor Mike.\"</p><p>Good to see you, Doctor Mike?</p><p>Good to see you, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, your take on the survey?</p><p>DR. MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, DO, FAMILY MEDICINE PRACTICING FAMILY PRACTITIONER,  FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENT AT OVERLOOK MEDICAL CENTER IN SUMMIT, NEW JERSEY:   So, I feel it already, all the wine drinkers across the world are  celebrating.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Injuries</p><p>But - and I hate to be the 'bearer of bad news,' I like to bring everyone  back to earth, here's why.</p><p>This type of study asks a group of 90-year-olds, 90-plus, 1,700 of them,  and ask them their drinking habits and they followed them over six months,  constantly checking in on them and asking their drinking habits.</p><p>Now how well do you remember how many drinks you had last week, let alone  three decades ago.</p><p>So first of all, these types of studies which look back in the past and try  and tie lifestyle habits to long life aren't always perfect because we  don't remember things well, number one.</p><p>Number two, this is a study looking at correlation, not causation, meaning  that if you look at people who drink alcohol, they generally live longer,  yes.</p><p>But does that maybe mean, people who are healthier, with the ones drinking,  not the other way around?</p><p>Totally could be because there is no causation in --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  When (ph) --</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  -- this study.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- you just said, 'people who drink, live a longer life.'</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that, that obvious?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  -- you see -- you see two patterns occur in --</p><p>KELLY:  They're having a good time.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  -- this study.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  They're having a good time.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes, there having a good time.</p><p>Look if you have a diagnosis -- a serious diagnosis in your health right,  you have diabetes, you have cancer, whatever it may be that is going to  cause premature death.</p><p>You're likely going to stop drinking because drinking is associated with  health, you feel good when you're drinking so maybe those people who were  drinking a lot were drinking because they were healthy, not the other way  around, not that the alcohol is giving them health.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  So, I don't like to get too excited about this.</p><p>Here's my take away on this and I think it's a very simple take away.</p><p>You have a patient comes in and they are drinking in moderation, great,  'continue drinking,\"' it's probably going to do no harm and can maybe even  do something beneficial, but I will not make a universal recommendation 'to  start drinking,' to my patients.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well because you can't -- if you're going to drink a lot you're  not going to -- you may not get to 90.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Exactly.  I mean there's been so much stuff right now in media  talking about how women, if they are drinking more than one glass of wine  per day, per week, they actually increase their risk of having breast  cancer by five to 10 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow!  Is that, that high, five percent (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  And it's, dose-dependent so if there having two drinks a  night, like the study recommends, it will be even higher.</p><p>So, the study really didn't take into account male versus female, and  individual factors because men and women do process alcohol differently.</p><p>KELLY:  I sure would like to know (ph) --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  My Gran --</p><p>KELLY:  -- the exercise habits too (INAUDIBLE) (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- my great aunt Irene (ph) was told by her doctor and she lived  into her 90s, to have one drink every evening.</p><p>She had a bourbon, neat.</p><p>The only problem was, as she began to suffer from dementia, well one day my  grandmother comes home and finds her sister out on the floor, calls our  house and says, \"Oh my god, Rene (ph) is dead.\"</p><p>My father runs down to the house, turns her over, she wasn't dead but she'd  had several bourbons because she had forgotten she had the first one and  she'd --</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- forgotten she had the second and she was out like a frat boy  in the middle of the floor, she was --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Where is aunt -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- like (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- where is Rena (ph) now?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rene (ph), passed away --</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Oh, oh!</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- years ago but she was deep into her 90s --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- when she passed away.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>KELLY:  Well people still --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good genes.</p><p>KELLY:  -- you brought up the point you know, --</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  -- this isn't just about drinking.  I mean if you're going to live  past 90 or get to 90 if you live a healthy lifestyle right --</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.</p><p>KELLY:  -- which includes exercising.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  To the liquor store.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Exactly, to the liquor store.  I like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Take a jog down there.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Well look, the University of California did a good job looking  into these things because we need to know what ties (ph) exist so we can do  further research.</p><p>But the exercise component that they looked at to see the reduction in  risk, was 15 to 45 minutes of exercise a day.</p><p>Now if you're exercising 15 minutes a day, I don't think that's where the  health benefit lies; we recommend a hundred and fifty minutes per week, so  saying that someone exercise for 15 minutes a day isn't really exercise.</p><p>So, I'll take this study with a grain of salt for now (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you say the best thing to do is a one hundred and fifty  minutes a week.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  A week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  So, them saying that someone exercise for 15 minutes a day  counts as those who exercise, I don't think so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  I think -- I get your point.</p><p>Let's talk about the flu for second, this has been one of the most powerful  flu seasons and --</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- for those who have it, the -- one of the biggest questions  is, how long are you contagious?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  So, here's the surprising thing about the flu, you're actually  contagious one day prior to showing symptoms because what are symptoms?</p><p>The symptoms are as a result of your immune system fighting the virus.</p><p>So, what happens you get inflammation, you get coughing, you get a fever,  all of that is signs that your immune system is working but the virus has  already set in one day prior.</p><p>So, your contagious one day prior, you don't even know that you're sick and  up to seven days since having the flu.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Seven days!</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  So, I recommend to people stay home when you have the flu for  at least seven days so you don't get everyone else sick because this flu  season, whether we like it or not is probably going to continue into May,  is one of the longest -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's effect -- </p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  -- running flu seasons that (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some people don't know if it's the flu or a cold.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Well look --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's -- that's one issue.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  -- the big issue with flu and cold -- the big difference  between flu and cold is the flu is much more severe than the cold.  You're  going to have worse body aches, higher fever, and when you get that you  need --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  -- to really watch out.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Doctor Mike, thank you.</p><p>VARSHAVSKI:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.

Watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The question we're considering is simple, can we be  manipulated through social pressure to commit murder?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  More on the controversial new series coming up this morning.   And then Spotify tunes into hardware.  The music streaming service  reportedly looking to make its own speaker, the major impact that could  have on Apple and Amazon which have speakers.  All those stories coming out  this morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's  Dagen McDowell, Rosecliff CEO, managing partner, Mike Murphy and Benchmark  Managing Partner, Kevin Kelly.  Great to see you.  Great show so far.  </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, FBN CONTRUBTOR:  I'm loving this Spotify news.  We're going to  becoming public later this year, they're doing a direct listing, they're  not really doing an IPO process, so we're going to see.  So they're on --  they're actually in the forefront of innovation.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  -- kind of crowded though.</p><p>KELLY:  Well, yes.  But the problem is they have a bunch of people  streaming already and I pay for Spotify premium and so do 90 million other  households, right?  So, I think the interesting aspect is that we're seeing  this morning, I think the markets going to stay flat until we hear from two  members of the Federal Reserve, Philadelphia, Minnesota or Minneapolis to  see where they think the Fed is going to raise rates.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I like what Harper is doing in Philly by the way.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way also, the PMI, purchasing managers index is out  today in Europe.  </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  In Europe, it actually came below expectation, it's still an  expansion mode, so they've have had a 57 handle, it's below January, so 58,  so we'll see where we go from here but it's still expanded.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll talk about markets coming up and a lot more.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR:  And the Apple speaker, how red it is.  I'll  bring that up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You bought it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  It's better than Amazon and Google speaker a lot.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right.  We'll talk about that.  We are getting to  that this morning.  But, first, our top story, a solemn day in Washington  this morning.  President Trump will hold a \"listening session\" this  afternoon with the survivors of the tragic school shooting in Florida.   Blake Burman is at White House now, he has the details.  Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Maria, good morning to you.  As this   national conversation that is taking place all across the country moves  into White House later today about how to keep classrooms safe.  President  Trump announcing action as it relates to the Las Vegas massacre, you'll  remember from October 1st of last year when 58 people were killed, 850  others injured, after more than 1100 rounds were fired into a concert there  due to the use of a bump stock.  A bump stock allows for a gun to be  modified and fired at a rapid succession.  Well, now President Trump says,  he wants to see regulations on bump stocks that would amount to a ban.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I signed a memorandum  directing the Attorney General to propose regulation to ban all devices  that turn legal weapons into machine guns.  I expect that these critical  regulations will be finalized, Jeff, very soon.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  A White House source also tells Fox that President Trump is  considering advocating for raising the minimum age of gun ownership, though  it's unclear exactly what could be done at the Federal level considering  most of this is dealt with at the state level.  For now official White  House position though is that the President wants to see the national  background check system strengthened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SNADERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  I know background  checks are something that the President supportive of, making more  efficient and looking at better ways to improve that process.  And we're  going to continue to look at a number of other factors as well.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Will be at the forefront here at the White House later this  afternoon when the President hosts this listening session between students,  parents, and teachers.  The White House is not yet provided a list of who  will be in attendance, so it remains unclear if any students in Parkland  will be in attendance.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes, and, of course.  All right.  Thank you, Blake.  We'll  be watching that.  Blake Burman at the White House.  Joining me right now  is the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel.   Chairwoman, good to see you.</p><p>RONNA MCDANIEL, CHAIRWOMAN, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE:  Great to be  here.  Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  What are you  looking for out of the President today with his listening session?  Tell us  what you expect to take place.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, it's a time of national tragedy and during these times we  do need to come together and listen, and find ways to prevent these  tragedies from happening again and I think the President really is intent  to listen to these families.  Hearing their stories and saying how can we  come together to find solutions so we don't find ourselves in the same  situation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congress of course is out of session this week there in their  districts but what do you think comes out of all this?  I mean, the  President is trying to come up with something, pretty good op-ed in the --  in Journal today about this gun control debate taking front, center again.   Do you think -- do you expect anything more from the President other than  banning the bump stocks and perhaps looking once again at background  checks?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes.  Enhanced background checks.  And I think finding out how  these tips that came through the local FBI office didn't get elevated and  researched, you know, people did the right thing, they saw things on social  media they were concerned about this young man, it should have been  elevated, so we have to fix this system, and we have to understand the  underlying things that are happening with these young boys who are feeling  bullied or maybe like social outcasts that they're coming in and wanting to  do harm and how do we make sure that guns don't get in their hands?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You wonder if this is going to be enough to quiet the people  who are upset about guns but also keep the people in his base who want that  constitutional right happy, do you think this is enough? Redoing or  relooking at background checks and the bump stocks.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  I think everyone wants to look at whole picture and if you just  look at the gun portion of it, you're missing the underlying symptoms that  took this individual --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mental health.</p><p>MCDANIEL:  -- or place where he wanted to break every law, the most  important law which is taking human life.  So we have to figure out what's  going on with these individuals that they're getting missed and background  checks, nobody wants guns in their hands.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  And that's universal, that's not partisan, we do not want guns  in the hands of people who are going to go take human life.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All right.  We'll watch that today, 4:15, Fox Business is  taking our audience live there.  Then there's this, House Minority Leader  Nancy Pelosi once again out talking about the historic Republican tax  overhaul, negatively, now she -- not only is it crumbs but she said it's  unpatriotic.  Listen to what her comments were yesterday and the immediate  backlash that she faced over her own wealth.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PELOSI: If what you're doing is cutting the taxes at the high end, and,  therefore, not being allowed to invest in the future, you are doing a grave  disservice to our country.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Unpatriotic. </p><p>PELOSI:  Unpatriotic.  So -- most people have to struggle to make ends  meet.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  How much are you worth, Nancy?</p><p>PELOSI:  No, we're not talking about that.  So, in any event --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She said we're not talking that when she was asked, how much  are your worth.  Apparently, she's got -- she's worth $100 million we're  told.  But you remember what she said initially about the bonuses, about  the crumbs.  Listen to what she said last month.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PELOSI:  In terms of the bonus that Corporate America received versus the  crumbs that they are giving to workers to kind of put the schmooze on is so  pathetic so pathetic.  It's so pathetic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So PelosI's newest comments come after Politico reported major  Democratic super PAC issued a memo last week, they had concerns over the  Democratic Party's midterm strategy of just resist, resist, resist opposing  the President and the Republican tax plan.  Your reaction to all of this.</p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, it's just crazy to hear Nancy Pelosi say that giving a tax  break to the entire country, it was every tax bracket is unpatriotic and  then to see 4.2 million people now benefiting from bonuses or wage  increases or increased money into their 401(k), you know, she has to root  against it because no Democrat voted for it, so she's going to do  everything she can to say it's bad but the numbers speak for themselves,  our economy is doing well, wages are up, people are feeling better and I'll  tell you personally, when I was putting my husband through law school, and  I was making $30,000 a year, my boss brought me and he gave me $1,000  bonus, that was our rent, that's our groceries, it was huge for me at that  time in my life and my husband.  So to hear her say that, I think is  insulting to middle-class Americans.  I know she's a millionaire from San  Francisco but it is not crumbs to the average working family in this  country, $1,000,$ 2000, $3,000 means a lot.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It absolutely is not crumbs.  I have a friend who told me  yesterday, my husband wants you to know and he is construction worker, he's  got an $80.00 in his paycheck every week and he is happy as can be.  I  mean, people are feeling it and they're feeling good about it.  What does  this mean for November do you think?  Because I think that there is a  debate on what happens with the midterm elections.  We just saw another  victory on the Democratic side in Kentucky, does that worry you?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Well, the Kentucky one is an anomaly because you had a disgraced  senator and a lot of issues going on with that one, so -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  So you put Kentucky aside.</p><p>MCDANIEL:  Kentucky is an anomaly.  Listen, midterms are tough on the party  that holds the White House but the RNC has outraised the Democrats  significantly, we have 40 times more cash on hand because we know what  we're up against.  Democrats thought they were going to in the White House  in 2016, now they're energized, their abstract and resist message, I do not  thing will resonate because we are putting forward a message of vision, of  opportunity, of growth and it's helping the average American family.  And I  think that's going to win every time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know the Republicans are raising a lot of money, I see the  numbers, tens of millions of dollars, so that's great.  But on the local  level, individual giving money, the Democrats are out raising the  Republicans, right?  Because Obama put such a good solid online strategy in  place that people could just donate $5.00 or $10.00, the Dems are  outstripping the Republicans on that though, right?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes.  But it's really important that the national party strong  because we do the data, and the ground game that an individual candidate  can't do, it's hundreds of millions of dollars.  That's why the party  structure being strong is so beneficial, identifying most likely Republican  voters and turning them out and an -- and an individual candidate just  doesn't have bandwidth to do with the national party can do.  So that  differential between the RNC and the DNC is significant.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you make a really good point.  And I agree, I think  that -- come November people are going to want answers in terms of what is  your message other than just resist President Trump, but now people are  upset about the spending coming out of Republicans, I sat down exclusively  last week with Speaker Paul Ryan to get his take over this idea that the  Republicans have lost fiscal discipline.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PAUL RYAN, SPEAKER OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: So this  was a discretionary spending budget, this wasn't a full macro budget, this  is discretionary spending and for us, save the military, one time spending  for hurricanes disaster, get some spending cuts that will grow in the out- years, but we do have to go back and focus on entitlement spending.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You've got to focus on entitlement spending otherwise you're  talking about trillion-dollar deficits for as long as you can see.  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Yes.  I think long term we have to look at the spending, we have  to look at the deficit, obviously was a budget to fund our military, deal  with things that we dealt with as a country national issues --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not worried about?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  I'm not, I know long-term, we're going to be party that's  focused on fiscal discipline and the Democrats aren't.  And with the tax  cuts we're helping grow our economy, Obama was comfortable with two percent  growth every year.  We saw two quarter of three percent growth and  potentially four percent growth coming up this year, so that's very  helpful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, yes.  We're talking about -- we're talking about great  economic numbers.  Let's talk about your uncle, former Massachusetts  Governor, Mitt Romney has accepted President Trump's endorsement in his  campaign for the Utah Senate seat.  They had an up and down relationship.   Mitt Romney wasn't never Trumper at one point.  Is he no longer a never  Trumper?</p><p>MCDANIEL:  Mitt Romney is a -- I support our country, I support our  President.  Let's make sure we're doing good things for the American  people.  And I think every Republican is never-Schumer, never-Pelosi right  now.  We do not want to lose majorities in the Senate and the House.  We  know what that will mean for our country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what Uncle Mitt's priorities be from your standpoint?  </p><p>MCDANIEL:  It's a Utah-based campaign, and his acknowledgement of the  President's endorsement, he was thankful for his support but he said I'm  looking for the support of the people of Utah.  We're neutral at the RNC  but he is going to focus on the people of Utah.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good stuff.  Ronna, it's good to see you. </p><p>MCDANIEL:  Thank you.  Thanks for having me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much, Ronna McDaniel there.  We'll be right back.   Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Another police officer tragically killed in the  line of duty.  Cheryl Casone with the details now.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria.  A standoff in Mobile,  Alabama and it was both the suspect and the police officer dead.  It all  began when a woman was found dead in the middle of the road and police  identified her ex-husband Robert Hollie as a person of interest.  When  authorities went to his home, Hollie fatally shot Officer Justin Billa.   And hours after that standoff, Hollie's  body was also found inside that  home.  Not clear whether he died from a self-inflicted gunshot or the shots  that were fired by police.  </p><p>Well, some wild weather across the country today.  The east is going to see  record-high temperatures for February, 72 here in New York.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Yes, baby.</p><p>CASONE:  All right.  It's going to be almost 80 in Pittsburgh, this is  wild.  Meanwhile, there is a severe storm that's causing flooding in the  Midwest. More than five inches of rain has been reported in parts of  Indiana over the last 24 hours.  28 states from Oregon remain or under  winter weather alert.  But, you know, enjoy the weather here in New York.</p><p>All right.  Well, a candidate for the Texas State House has upset former  Star Trek actor William Shatner.   Brandi Chambers sent out a campaign newsletter nice featuring this photo of  herself with Shatner.  Now, remember, Chambers, she paid to take the photo  at a comic con event.  When the 86-year old actor found out about it, he  tweeted at her and said, hey, use the photo misleading suggested  endorsement on my part.  He then told her to remove it.  Chambers did  remove it and she has apologized.  And then finally this, Netflix unveiling  a controversial new British reality show.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And the question we're considering is simple.  Can we  be manipulated through social pleasure to commit murder?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  The show was called The Push.  It uses actors and elaborate  scenarios to test an unsuspecting contestant who they have no idea they're  being filmed.  The murder doesn't actually happen of course but apparently  the situation is so authentic that contestant believe this is all really  happening.  Someone is trying to convince him to kill somebody.  The show  is going to go online next Tuesday.  Here shares of Netflix higher in the  premarket up more than 1-1/4 percent.  They stirred in Britain a couple of  years ago already.  It's -- you don't -- you don't understand how he didn't  under -- he didn't believe that he wasn't being filmed but I digress.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't think it's right to be playing around with people's  minds, Dagen, knowing the issues around Alzheimer's, around autism and the  fact that we really don't understand the brain as much as we understand  other things to be pushing people around and playing with your brain to get  you to commit murder is just outrageous.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not something I would ever watch.  And I think that it might  show a little bit of desperation on Netflix's part in the grab for content  that they would pay for this quite frankly, we will see if people watch it.  </p><p>KELLY:  And with kids being --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  With kids, exactly.  </p><p>KELLY:  It's exactly what we don't need.  I get it free country and you can  put what you want out but, I mean, you have to have some sort of standards,  I think.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I agree.  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back.   A judge rejects AT&amp;T and its t request to see the White House communication  records about the Time Warner deal.  Department of Justice says no.  The  fight over the megamerger next.  And then Wal-Mart's Web site stumbles, why  the retail giant struggled with online sales during the holiday season and  why the stock fell out of bed yesterday 10 percent.  It is bouncing this  morning.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We want to bring this breaking news right now,  U.S. Christian Evangelist and former counselor to the president's Billy  Graham has died.  He was 99 years old.  Again, the former counselor to  president, Billy Graham dead at the age of 99 this morning. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  One of the greatest preachers in American history quite  frankly.  And certainly over the last century.  A great spiritual leader  for those who are famous just everyday folks, like my whole family quite  frankly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lived a long life, 99 years old, Billy Graham, condolences.  We  want to turn to the megamerger fight, a judge has blocked AT&amp;T's request to  see internal White House communications over the merger with Time Warner.   Gerri Willis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange this morning  with details there, looking at a mixed opening this morning.  Gerri, good  morning to you.  </p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FBN ANCHOR:  Yes, you're right, Maria.  So, U.S. district  court judge yesterday denying AT&amp;T's request that the Justice Department  identify communications between the White House , the Justice Department  antitrust division and A.G. Jeff Sessions over this at AT&amp;T merger which  was propose with Time Warner but would have been an $85-billion merger.   Judge said no way, they wanted logs cataloging this communication, big  setback for AT&amp;T , they had claimed that were receiving selective  enforcement of antitrust laws and that, you know, implying here that -- or  saying out right of Trump's hatred of CNN was behind the rejection of that  merger.  T shares were down about one percent to say.  </p><p>Also, you should know AT&amp;T mobile 5G network is going to be rolled out by  the end of the year.  And they're starting with three cities, Dallas,  Atlanta and Waco, where is New York, where is L.A., well, it's coming in  the next tranche to -- or nine more cities will be announced as well.  </p><p>And I want to talk a little bit about Wal-Mart here, you know, that stock  up dramatically about 10 percent yesterday.  And now, the shares up a  little bit this morning but people still concerned about this online sales  growth reducing in the fourth quarter down to 23 percent from 50 percent in  that third quarter.  Now we got Stifel, Raymond James, and Chelsea advisor  all cutting price targets on Wal-Mart.  So we could see that play out this  morning as we get under way.  But as you say, mixed opening and I just have  to say before you move on from Billy Graham, wow, it's from Charlotte,  North Carolina, that is a very big name to pass.  Our condolences to the  Graham family.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  99 years old, Gerri.  </p><p>WILLIS:  I know, I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  Gerri Willis on the floor of The New York Stock  Exchange.  We have this breaking news as well, Broadcom adjusting its offer  for Qualcomm to $79.00 a share.  The company also says that other terms of  the proposed merger remain unchanged, there is the stock this morning, they  have been pushing back, they don't want to do this deal.  Mike Murphy, what  are your thoughts?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  So, Kevin and I have been talking about this a lot.  I think  Broadcom had to do this because they drew a line in the sand for Qualcomm.   They said, if you can't go above 110 for your purchase of NXPI.  They did  yesterday Qualcomm announced that they were going to pay up to 127.  So  Broadcom -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Twenty-four billion. </p><p>MURPHY:  Broadcom had to respond that I think, but ultimately I believe  Qualcomm will get acquired because if you're on the board of Qualcomm right  now and I'm a big shareholder and you tell me the stock is 62, we have an  82, well, now $79.00 offer on the table, I'm rejecting it.  You better have  a plan to tell me why you're going to get me better than 79 quickly.  So I  think ultimately ISS, Institutional Shareholder Services is recommending  for a Broadcom's people, for the board we purchased Qualcomm yesterday and  I think we'll be buying more of it.  So I think ultimately it gets acquired  by Broadcom.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So and you think they get acquired at 79?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Or higher.  </p><p>KELLY:  Well, yes.  And in this press release, I'm looking at right now and  says basically if the NXPI deal doesn't go through they will adjust back  and give the $3.00 back to make it $82.00 a share.  But what's important to  note here is that this has been a line in the sand.  We don't know the  regulatory pressures and hurdles that will be met.  That's one of the  reason why Qualcomm said listen, we're rejecting this offer because you  haven't addressed those concerns.  So as a board director, you're saying,  listen, I'm not going to lead us into fight and try to get us to $79.00 or  $82.00 a share if there's going to be regulatory hurdles and this could  drag out longer and longer and longer than we anticipated diminishing  shareholder value.  So this is going to be interesting to see it play out,  there's been a lot of consolidation in the chip space, we don't know how  regulators would react to this and this is why Qualcomm share up, board of  directors are being very prudent about this.  Now Qualcomm also has a giant  fight with Apple happening right now over royalty payments.  So, there is a  lot going on when it comes to -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MURPHY:  And then $8 billion breakup fee.  So if the deal doesn't go  through, Broadcom has to hand Qualcomm $8 billion.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  Broadcom has the financing, as you had -- as you had  mentioned before.  So the financing is already in place.  And ready to  happen, this is a cash-and-stock deal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Looks like Broadcom is not  going away, any time soon, by the way.  We'll take a break.  As we take  break, take a look at futures this morning, big sell-off yesterday, in the  first trading day of the week ending a six-day winning streak.

Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're calling what we've been seeing a technically-driven  market correction.  Explain.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes, that's right.  So, the fundamentals, still look pretty  good.  The economy is not only solid but broadening.  We see good stimulus  on the way from tax and the potential to increase productivity which would  even drive further economic growth down the road.  That said, inflation  needs to come up a little bit in order to match where the economy is.  And  investors are trying to figure out exactly how much inflation that will be.   And so, it's a -- it's a sort of a sentiment-driven correction right now.   And where -- when markets get down to certain levels, then people will buy.   When with they get up to certain levels, there are some who are inclined to  sell there, and so, that level-driven selling is what we mean by  technicals, the fundamentals are still good.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, is that all -- yes.  Is that all it is right now, just  technical selling, Mike Murphy?  I mean, volatility is here to stay, you  said, right?</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  So, it could be, but I think the question I would have is  really about program trading or computing trading because those drops that  we saw in the market a few weeks ago, although I believe the market is --  has more upside from here, but when the computers are the algorithms all  started selling at once and we were dropping hundreds of points in what  seemed like minutes, that was reminiscent of the flash crash to me.  And I  hope that the market realizes how much of the selling -- or how much of the  volume on a daily basis is coming from those machines.  So, that we're in  position to have some sort of circuit breakers if needed.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You agree with that, Paul?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes, certainly.  When you -- when you get the selling  reaching a certain point, then the machines will come on in a very  noticeable way.  They may be operating on a day like yesterday when the  selling was there but not extreme, but in order to get to that level, you  first have to have other problems, people who are taking profits, short  volatility traders, people who are complacent about volatility and bought  products that bet on no volatility into the future.  Those people, they  took their losses first, then you saw profit-taking, and when you finally  get down to levels that are low enough, then the algorithms kick in and  again, in that noticeable way, and you see those sharper declines like we  saw on February the 5th.  That's not typical but, yes, that can happen if  you get them down to that level of uncertainty in the market.</p><p>KELLY:  Paul, when it comes down to technical, I think one of the technical  that people were looking at where it's actually the multiples on the  market, they weren't -- they weren't comfortable with the 20 P.E. on the  market given they don't know how the tax cuts are going to roll through in  the next quarter, and the quarter after that.  And so, then we saw it come  down to around 16.6.  Where do you see the market ending this year?  What's  an appropriate market multiple that investors should be paying right now?  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Well, there's that -- there's that historical median that you  mentioned, around 16.7.  But we think that by the end of the year, the  investors will be willing once again to pay a little bit more for stocks,  and it gets back to what I said at the outset about the tax reform bill --  the tax reform law now, giving in companies an incentive to add equipment  which should improve efficiencies of workers, raise wages, and earnings  going forward.  We think the earnings part of that virtuous cycle of  improvement will drive investors to pay a little bit more than that,  historical median.  We're looking for something closer to 8. -- 18.9 for  the S&amp;P by year-end.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a big number, 18.9 percent earnings growth, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  What if bonds wind up in a bear market?  Can -- I think  that that's the biggest concern.  And in terms of your fixed income  allocation, if you want a haven, if you want some ballast, where do you put  your money?  Because a lot people could be staring at capital losses even  in Treasuries depending on the maturities that they own.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes, it's a good point.  You put your finger right on the  main risk.  If the market -- if the stock market and the bond market come  to believe that inflation is really going to rise by a lot more than just  slightly over two percent, coming up to a more normal level, then the bonds  will rise, the Fed will have to hike more, and both of those will be  damaging to the stock market, not to mention the damaging impact of  inflation on future discounting of earnings.  So, yes, that would be the  main risk to the market.  </p><p>In that case, we would have to pull back on our stock view and really  expect it to go elsewhere, possibly overseas, and possibly into corporates  high-quality bonds, they would pull back less, we think, than the lower- quality bonds, so that would be the strategy in that particular case.  But  I want to emphasize that is not our base case.  We are expecting inflation  at a moderate level and we think interest rates have probably finished most  of their move higher for this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what areas would you put new money to work here then?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Well, we still -- again, we still like that economic outlook,  that positive outlook that virtual cycle of efficiencies and generating  more earnings, so we would be putting more money into those sectors that  would do the best under conditions of improving economic growth.  Consider  industrials, consumer discretionary, we also like financials as the yield  curve have steepened a bit and economic growth is better.  And as valuation  play, we have like health care, although that one is getting a little bit  richer going forward.  The ones we would stay away from would be the  interest rates sensitive sectors like utilities and consumer staples.  We  would also stay away from energy, because we think oil prices have probably  gone a little bit too high, need to consolidate back lower.</p><p>KELLY:  What about -- what about tech?  I mean, that was one name that you  -- or one sector that you completely left out but it's not interest-rate  sensitive because we look at all these companies, they have net cash on  their balance sheet.  Their enterprise value is worth less than their  market cap.  They're doing buybacks, they can do strategic M&amp;A.  It was the  leader last year.  What is your view on tech going forward because we see  it up in the premarket?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes, we like -- we like the -- we like the tech.  Thank you  for bringing that up.  We like the tech sector as a market way here, mainly  because we like the fundamentals, but think that the valuations are in the  middle of a range and we don't want to play that game of paying up for tech  stocks and then seeing a sharp correction in those later on.  So, market  weight on tech and take advantage of the opportunities in the industrials,  in the consumer discretionary, the growth-sensitive sectors.</p><p>MURPHY:  Paul, it's Mike Murphy.  On days like yesterday, you have a -- you  see a big sell-off in the Dow fueled by Wal-Mart, but when you look at the  NASDAQ, the big tech names, and we're basically flat on the day or down a  fraction.  So, I think that's really where people are still looking for  growth and, yes, there's big multiples there, but I think that's where  you're really seeing technology play a key and how it's changing our lives,  so you've really seen the growth there.  So, I think that theme will play  out for the rest of the year.  So, I think investors could probable even  look to be more aggressive in tech as that winning trade looks to continue.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yes, we don't disagree with the long-term story but we wonder  a little bit about whether there's been too much extrapolation about how  quickly, how much, and how soon tech will invade even further our lives,  and that's again why we like the fundamentals, but we're happy to have our  clients be market weight right now.  Take advantage but not be too exposed.   We have higher conviction on the cyclicals.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, are you saying, Paul, nothing has changed?  You're still  bullish on this market, you don't see a lot of things that have changed?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Yeah, you know, what's really changed, Maria, is the  perception that we can just keep grinding higher in a straight line.  And  we said this in our December report, the outlook for 2018, that we thought  the market would make new highs this year.  We still believe that will  happen even after January.  But it will be alongside of this, figuring out  how much inflation is going to increase, how much interest rates will rise,  and how much the Fed will hike, and that will create, we think, occasional  pockets of uncertainty and pullbacks in the market.  It's not going to be a  straight line, it's going to be a little bit bumpier this year.  It's going  to offer investors opportunities we think to buy in and put more cash to  work.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  We'll be watching, Paul.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Paul Chritopher of Wells Fargo there.  Breaking news, Priceline  has just announced it is changing its name to Booking Holdings  Incorporated.  It's going to change the ticker symbol as well to BKNG,  trading under the new name beginning February 27th.  That's just out.   Coming up, Spotify singing a new tune.  The company's reported strategy to  compete against Apple's HomePod and Amazon's Alexa, that's next.  And not  for the faint of heart, how Friday the 13th fans can now stay at the  original campgrounds featured in the first movie.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The world is mourning the death of evangelist  Billy Graham this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE:  That's right, Maria.  As we told you just a few minutes ago,  influential evangelist, the Reverend Billy Graham has died.  Graham was a  counselor to presidents, from Harry Truman to Barack Obama.  He preached at  more than 200 million people during his life and was a key figure in  reviving the evangelical movement in this country.  Fox News has learned  that Graham died from natural causes at his home in North Carolina where he  had retired to in 2005.  His son, Franklin, now leads his congregation.   And Franklin actually spoke at Donald Trump's inauguration last year.  The  Reverend Billy Graham dead at the age of 99.</p><p>Well, 3M has settled the largest environment lawsuit in Minnesota's  history.  The state accusing the giant consumer products company of  contaminating groundwater by disposing PFCs for decadse.  3M is going to  pay $850 million, but that's a fraction of the 5 billion that the state was  asking for.  The company settled without admitting it caused a public  health issue.  They still faced, though, at least two dozen similar  lawsuits around the company.  Shares of 3M are up nearly 30 percent over  the past year.</p><p>Well, you don't see this every day.  Queen Elizabeth II making a surprise  appearance at London Fashion Week.  The 91-year-old monarch watched Richard  Quinn show and sat in front row of course with Vogue's Editor-in-Chief Anna  Wintour.  She made quite the impression and she's even got Anna Wintour  smiling.  That's a big thing.  All right.  Queen Elizabeth making a  surprised appearance there.</p><p>Well, the perfect place for an overnight stay as long as you don't believe  that Jason is still out there, could be --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Never have opened this place again.  There's been too  much trouble here.  Did you know that a young boy drowned the year before  those two others were killed?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  That place is the campsite from the \"Friday the 13th\" movies.   It's up for auction if you want to have an overnight stay.  This is Camp  No-Be-Bo-Sco which is usually a Boy Scout camp and it's always closed to  visitors, but they're going to open it up for business.  Fans of the  slasher film series can bet on the VIP package until February 27th.   Special guest Adrienne King, who plays the lone survivor of the movie from,  yes, 1980 -- will attend tours of the campsite this year.  So, yes, if you  want to be scared, yes, go for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I don't -- I don't -- well --</p><p>CASONE:  But good luck with that.  Somebody have fun.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I don't think I -- yes, I wouldn't stay on that camp ground,  but why is everyone surprised the Queen was actually at Fashion Week.   She's got a royal wedding coming up.  She needs to get a nice dress.  I  mean --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think she looked better than Anna Wintour.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, she did.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good outfit.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  And a soul, too, right, compared to Anna Wintour.  Maybe  you could have some respect to the Queen and take your sunglasses off.</p><p>KELLY:  I was going to say that, why was she wearing sunglasses.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She always does.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's her shtick.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, maybe you could check your shtick at the door.  (INAUDIBLE)  next to the --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Check your shtick at the door.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Head of a royal house.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to take a break.  When we come back,  we're going to hear about Dagen's smart speaker, OK?  The smart speaker  battle is heating up, why Spotify could reportedly take on Apple's HomePod  and Amazon's Alexa.  It's going to be competitive.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Here comes Spotify.  Will Spotify jump from the  stream into the growing sea of smart speakers?  The online music giant  hiring for \"connected hardware\", the job listings sparking speculation that  the company wants in on the business, wants to take on the likes of Amazon  Echo and Apple's new HomePod.  So, is there a space, Kevin, for a Spotify  in the smart -- you said -- you said earlier it's getting a crowded market.</p><p>KELLY:  Yes, I don't think it's getting a crowded market.  There's  estimates -- there's going to be over 800 million virtual assistants in use  by the year 2020.  43 percent of all voice-activated computing happens in  the home; another 36 percent is actually in the car, or it's on cell  phones.  So, this is a big addressable market.  Spotify has -- if you look  last June, they said they have 140 million active users worldwide.  They  recently just did an equity swap with Tencent which is the big technology  company over in China.  So, I think this is a play for overseas dominance  in the Chinese markets where they can address a lot of users who want their  home virtual assistants.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now, you have the Apple speaker, right, Dagen, you love it. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The quality of it, I would argue that they seem to be -- it's a  loss leader.  They seem to be selling it at a price that's less than what  they're actually paid to develop it and build it because it's -- the sound  quality is superior.  I would argue at this point, Spotify is being  reactive not proactive in terms of coming out with a speaker, because given  their user base, they have to provide them with something in order to avoid  losing those customers to an Apple at this point or even an Amazon. </p><p>KELLY:  They're doing very well on the streaming side, right?  They've  overtaken here in the U.S. more subscribers for their music services.  So,  yes, they have to be reactive especially to the big behemoth which has an  automatically built in user base.  So, they need to do something like this.</p><p>MURPHY:  One thing that shocked me is we just got a few of the Amazon Echos  in our house, was how superior the voice controls were for Alexa versus  Siri, so I don't -- can't speak to the speaker necessarily, but I think  running a venture capital fund, one thing we look for is voice controls and  how that's going to be a big part of the future where in everything -- you  used to say everything you need will be at the touch of a button, well, now  it's actually at the sound of your voice.  So, that I think is the big  differentiator here, and I wonder about does Spotify moving into this  market reminds me a little bit of Snapchat moving into the Spectacles  market -- moving into hardware.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Too late.</p><p>MURPHY:  It didn't work out so well.</p><p>KELLY:  Well, yes, I think there's a little bit of a difference.  They were  trying to be a leader in that.  And if we go back to -- when you're talking  about Siri, I mean, think about how Apple was the first that brought out a  voice assistant, it was Siri.  Now, they're lagging behind Amazon which  came out with the Echo that put Alexa in our homes.  So, Apple is actually  trying to actually react.  And I think they're the biggest loser in this  situation because they're taking on everybody from all sides, and everyone  else is going to be taking market share from Apple.  That needs to change. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the speaker quality is good enough that they're giving them  all a run for their money. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got to get to this story before we go because Amazon --  there's a question if the employees accidentally revealed the location of  the company's (INAUDIBLE) second headquarters.  So, the Web site Arlington  now noticed a lot of Web traffic from an internal section of Amazon  dedicated to the search for a second headquarters.  Arlington County is in  the D.C. Metro area which was one of the cities on the tech titan list of  20 finalists.  Now, people are saying, because there was so much traffic  around this, is Amazon going to Virginia?  Is -- are they going near  Washington?  I think they are because Jeff -- because Jeff Bezos bought  like the most expensive house in Washington.</p><p>MURPHY:  It's on the short list.  I mean, to be clear, he could buy the  most expensive house anywhere, I guess.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  Why did buy Washington?</p><p>MURPHY:  But it makes -- it makes sense, I think, for the Washington Post,  but you have enough space there so they can move all the employees they  need --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's no space left in Virginia.  Go somewhere else.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, we'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show, everybody.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rock on, Maria Bartiromo.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you for joining us, everybody.  Let's go to \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" right now.  Charles Payne in for Stu this morning.  Charles, take  it away.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Thanks to the brightest minds in Silicon Valley, however, they're rapidly becoming science fact. Google is nearing the final stages of testing for its autonomous car programme, Tesla drivers can enjoy an 'Autopilot' feature for hassle-free motorway driving, and Pittsburgh residents can hail an Uber that drives itself. But how do driverless cars work?</p><p> Are they safe? When can we expect to try one out for ourselves? We answer all these questions, and more, below.Latest news05/11/2018: Unpredictable London pedestrians to help test autonomous cars The \"risky\" and unpredictable nature of London's pedestrians is being used to help teach autonomous cars to navigate through busy city streets. A startup based at Imperial College London has developed software that scans and analyses footage of people walking down the most popular streets of the capital. The data is being used to help driveless cars predict human behaviour and gauge whether a pedestrian is about to dart across the road. The company is called Humanising Autonomy and its co-founder Leslie Nootboom, believes the behaviour of Londoners is more \"risky\" and \"confident\" compare to other city inhabitants around Europe. This, he says, presents a complex challenge for autonomous cars. \"We are very confident that we are able to predict if someone is going to cross or not,\" he told the Evening Standard[1]. \"Cars need to understand the full breadth of human behaviour before they're ever going to be implemented into urban environments. \"The current technology is able to understand whether something is a pedestrian and not a lamp post, and where that pedestrian is moving, framing them as a box. We're looking inside that box to see what the person is doing, where they're looking, are they aware of the car, are they on the phone or running - does this mean they are distracted, or risky?\" What goes on 'in the box', where the subject is analysed, is far more complex than just whether its an obstruction or not. The machine has to assess whether the subject is going to attempt to cross the road from body language. In a busy city, where hoards of people walk up and down the streets and can cross at any given moment, that can be a bit of a minefield.Busy street analysed by prediction model - courtesy of Humanising Autonomy Nootboom's startup uses dashcam and roadside footage from popular streets such as Oxford Circus and Regent Street to train its machine learning model. Combining this human data with computer vision models is how the system can understand and predict complex human behaviours. \"We are working on both current vehicle safety systems (combining human decision making and computer vision models) and fully autonomous use cases. This means that our prediction systems are becoming more accurate with the day. Our vision is that cities can be safer, with automated vehicles that have a better reliability than human drivers,\" Nootboomtold IT Pro. 22/10/2018: Addison Lee aim to ditch drivers by 2021 London cabbies might be out of a job as soon as 2021 as ride-hailing firm Addison Lee has entered a partnership to accelerate the implementation of driverless cars. Following in the footsteps of rival firm Uber, the cab company has agreed on a deal with self-driving software maker Oxbotica to develop and deploy autonomous driving technology on the streets of London within three years. \"Urban transport will change beyond recognition in the next 10 years with the introduction of self-driving services and we intend to be at the very forefront of this change by acting now,\" said Andy Boland, CEO of Addison Lee Group. The two companies will work together to create a detailed, digital maps of more than 250,000 miles of public roads in and around the capital. These maps will record the position of every kerb, road sign, landmark and traffic light in preparation for the deployment of autonomous cars. Graeme Smith, CEO of Oxbotica, said: \"This represents a huge leap towards bringing autonomous vehicles into mainstream use on the streets of London and eventually in cities across the United Kingdom and beyond.\" Interestingly, unlike Uber or Google, both of which plan to develop and deploy autonomous cars around the world, Addison Lee has opted for a British company to provide the AI and data mapping for London. MPs in the UK have questioned the safety of US developed self-driving technology because the data collected and used is too contextual to the US and doesn't take into account differences in other countries. Already in the US, a woman was killed in Tempe, Arizona after an Uber car hit and killed her. The woman crossed the road with a bike and a few shopping bags and as a result, was killed because the car's dataset didn't include that specific combination of objects. Speaking over the weekend, MP Julian Knight, who sits on the Commons' Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said that it was an example of how Silicon Valley makes software only relevant to California. He questioned whether it could recognise more district vehicles such as a red London bus. \"This is an example here of how these new social media companies and big tech companies are so US focused,\" the Telegraph reported[2]. \"It means the rest of the world, which makes up 97% of the population, are not tailored to and ignored.\" In a more blunt statement, the appropriately named MP Tom Brake said: \"This cannot be considered a mature technology if it cannot recognise a red bus but it can spot a Chevrolet.\" 14/09/18:Uber driverless car development sees investment accelerate Uber has committed to invest more than $150 million to open an engineering hub in Toronto to help accelerate and drive forward its self-driving car plans. While Uber found itself in a difficult situation following a fatal collision between one of its driverless cars and a cyclist, the financial commitment the ride-sharing firm has made is indicative it's not turning off the highway to autonomous vehicles. The investment, reported Reuters[3], will cover a five-year plan to expand Uber's engineering capabilities as well as its work on utilising artificial intelligence. And despite being based in San Francisco, Uber will carry out this engineering push in Canada with some 500 people expected to bee added to its workforce in Toronto, a city in which it chose to open a driverless cars research centre in last year. While Uber looks to develop a driverless car fleet, Nvidia continues to push the hardware and systems needed to get such self-driving automotive technology on the road. Notably, the graphics card giant has made its Drive AGX Xavier development kit available for worldwide use, opening access to a platform that can underpin autonomous cars, trucks, shuttles and other vehicles. Nvidia also wants to push its driverless car technology down other routes, with Project Maglev. The Project looks to push the Drive artificial intelligence-centric platform beyond self-driving cars and bring more smart automation into other industries such as robotics and healthcare, reported VentureBeat[4]. 13/08/2018: Multiple codes open self-driving cars up for hacking The scale of coding needed to operate self-driving cars offers an easy opportunity for hackers to potentially turn a vehicle into a \"fully loaded weapon\". That's according to John Chen, CEO of BlackBerry, who warned yesterday that \"a car could easily be infected with viruses\" allowing a criminal to hijack it, in an interview with theTelegraph[5]. Although mostly known for smartphones, Blackberry has recently started to develop driverless car technology, in partnership with Chinese internet company Baidu.\"I can create a car I think is 90% virus free but as soon as that car gets on the road and is being used, those conditions need to be regularly checked,\" he said. \"Regulation and safety and security tech need to be established well before I think anyone should allow the cars on the road. The self-driving car still has a lot of human error and safety control.\" Indeed, although there are no examples of the technology being involved in a crash due to software being hacked, most of the major companies have had an incident during or after testing. Recently, it was reported that Apple had a self-driving vehicle involved in an accident and both Uber and Tesla have had multiple issues in the US. Tesla's accident proved fatal as its car hit and killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona. Highlighting Chen's point, the multiple lines of code the car used detected the woman, but because she was behind a bike with shopping bags on the handlebar, the software didn't recognise her as an obstruction. The exploitation of code to launch cyber attacks has been demonstrated in recent attacks on TicketMaster and British Airways, the latter's website only requiring22 lines of code[6] to be tweaked in order for criminals to access details on 380,000 of its customers. 30/08/2018: People are the cause of most driverless car accidents Analysis suggests autonomous vehicles are to blame for just seven of the 88 crashes that have occurred in California in the last four years - with humans at fault for the rest. Given more than 50 companies now have permits to test these cars on California's roads, there have inevitably been a number of accidents along the way; one of which was serious enough to have resulted in a death. But analysis by news outlet Axios[7] shows that just 8% of accidents were caused by a fault in the vehicle - with only one of these incidents occuring while the vehicle was in 'autonomous mode' and moving. To further the case for autonomous driving, six of the seven accidents occurred while the car was both moving, and in 'conventional mode' - i.e. when a human was at the wheel. Just one of the 57 accidents involving a moving vehicle was caused by a fault in the AI. The remaining 31 accidents, meanwhile, occurred while a self-driving car was stopped, with three of these incidents involving a human intentionally attacking a self-driving car, for example by hitting or climbing on top of it. Axios previously examined data[8] on self-driving cars, provided by the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles, in August 2017 where there had just been 34 recorded incidents since 2014. In the last 12 months, this figure has risen by 54. Writer Kia Kokalitcheva said there will be a multitude of issues and accidents with self-driving cars as the AI-driven vehicles must contend with other vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians, and objects with which they share the road. With the number of companies testing autonomous vehicles on the rise, and continuous investment flooding into research efforts, the number of accidents involving self-driving cars is also certain to heighten. But, at least according to this analysis, it'll be the people who are to blame. 28/08/2018: Uber teams with Toyota on driverless cars after fatal crash Uber is partnering with Toyota to make driverless cars, with reports theJapanese car maker is investing $500 million in the ride-hailing company. Technology from each company will be integrated into purpose-built Toyota vehicles that will be deployed on Uber's ride-sharing network. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the deal was the first of its kind to offer mobility as a service - or ride-hailing to the rest of us - using driverless cars. Uber has come under heavy scrutiny on safety after one of its autonomous cars hit and killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona. Khosrowshahi was keen to highlight the safety benefits of the tieup with Toyota. \"Our goal is to deploy the world's safest self-driving cars on the Uber network and this agreement is another significant step towards making that a reality,\" he said. \"Uber's advanced technology and Toyota's commitment to safety and its renowned manufacturing prowess make this partnership a natural fit. I look forward to seeing what our teams accomplish together.\" The partnership will see Uber's self-driving tech and the car maker's automated safety system used in Toyota Sienna minivans, with pilots starting in 2021. The aim is to be able to mass produce the vehicles to offer for autonomous fleets. \"Combining efforts with Uber, one of the predominant global ride-sharing and automated driving R...ompanies, could further advance future mobility,\" said Shigeki Tomoyama, president of Toyota Connected Company. \"This agreement and investment mark an important milestone in our transformation to a mobility company as we help provide a path for safe and secure expansion of mobility services like ride-sharing that includes Toyota vehicles and technologies,\" he added. 16/08/2018: Uber investors suggest it ditches driverless car unit Some of Uber's investors have suggested the taxi-hailing firm should \"divest\" its autonomous car unit, on which it has spent billions of dollars. The company has been spending between $125 million and $200 million a quarter on its driverless car unit over the past 18 months, according to The Information[9], reportedly responsible for between 15% and 30% of the company's quarterly losses. Uber has spent large amounts developing autonomous vehicles, which require expensive hardware and sensors that are attached to the cars but have frustrated investors with the lack of a clear path to commercialising the technology. There is now growing pressure on CEO Dara Khosrowshahi to make Uber more profitable with the company targeting an initial public offering in the second half of the year, according to Bloomberg[10]. And, despite investing billions of dollars into its autonomous vehicle projects, Uber has had a number of high profile issues with its testing of the technology. In March, one of its driverless vehicles hit and killed a woman in Tempe, Florida after its software detected her but deemed her not an obstruction. The company suspended its operations nationwide and, following a long investigation from the US National Transport Safety Board (NTSB), it culled it's self-driving car operation in Pittsburg, laying off 100 operatives. Khosrowshahi has been in the Uber hot seat for over a year and has said the company has invested heavily into \"big bets\" such as Uber Eats, electric bikes and Uber Air, its flying car unit. 14/08/2018:FiveAI cars to gather data from South London streets A driverless car startup has been given the go-ahead to unleash data-gathering vehicles on the streets of South London. FiveAI, which has received the single largest investment into an AI company from the UK government, has 10 months to build a roadmap of contextual data by introducing information-gathering vehicles to the boroughs of Bromley and Croydon. Five human-controlled cars will be operated by fully trained safety drivers and will collect data about the areas traffic rules and the behavioural patterns of pedestrians and other drivers. \"For our service to eventually operate in London, we have to learn about the road layout, topology and traffic flow,\" said Ben Peters, co-founder of FiveAI. \"As with any vehicle on the road, safety is paramount and that's why all of our vehicles will be driven by fully-trained safety drivers. \"We believe that autonomous vehicles will be many times safer than human drivers, and this data gathering phase is a vitally important step towards making that a reality. By supporting London's transport objectives with a shared driverless car service, FiveAI can play a crucial role in reducing congestion, emissions, incidents and the cost and time of journeys to benefit all Londoners.\" Urban areas such as cities have proved difficult to fully map out for many of the big operators, with high profile incidents dogging the progress of the likes of Uber and Tesla. According to a blog on FiveAI's website, written by the firm's software engineer Lars Mennen, mapping the terrain of a city is far more challenging than that of a highway or non-urban area. \"The complexity of the European urban sprawl throws plenty of spanners into the works,\" he wrote. \"For GPS to function as it should, you'll ideally have a straight line from your GPS receiver to a satellite. Many buildings block satellite signals, and reflections from buildings interfere with signals also, making it impossible to get an accurate location.\" To tackle this problem FiveAI cars are fitted with a featured call Vision which matches images collected with definitive references from map coordinates, blending the two data sets together to create a detailed roadmap. \"A car needs to be aware of pedestrians, cyclists, other vehicles and many, many other stimuli,\" Mennen said. \"By looking at what you see and comparing it to what you expect, i.e. your map data, you can successfully detect these dynamic objects.\" The data gathered during the trial will be solely used by FiveAI to develop autonomous vehicle technology and will be processed and stored to fully comply with UK and EU laws. The company is targeting 2019 to launch a supervised trial of a pilot fleet of shared autonomous vehicles on London roads and hope to demonstrate how the technology can be used to build services to reduce commuting costs, cut accident rates, limit congestion and lower emissions. 26/7/2018:Waymo-re convenient grocery shopping Google's self-driving car division, Waymo, has launched a pilot with Walmart to ferry shoppers to and from stores to collect groceries. The trial is currently restricted to the 400-plus members of its early rider programme in Phoenix, Arizona, and indicates how the tech giant sees its technology being used after the trial stage. \"While these are Metro Phoenix-specific partnerships today, these businesses are national and what we learn from these programs will give us a network of partners when we launch in new cities down the road,\" Waymo said in a blog post[11]. The Waymo early rider programme was launched in April 2017, and the company has spent the last year collecting people's feedback on useful ways to try its driverless cars - one of them being trips to and from the supermarket, which ranked eighth. Other popular use cases for driverless cars in Phoenix were commuting to work, going to restaurants, dropping kids off at school and visiting bars. Trips to the supermarket came behind journeys to car repair shops, retail shopping and health and spa trips.The partnership with Walmart will offer discounts to customers that order groceries on Walmart.com. While the order is being prepared at the store, a Waymo vehicle will collect the customer and take them to the store to collect their shopping, and then drive them home again. Waymo has also launched a pilot to ferry passengers to the local town centre to avoid the stress of parking. Dining out came second on the list of top ten trips, with visiting bars fourth and retail shopping sixth, indicating how Waymo sees future uses of its technology. The self-driving cars will also be used in VIP experiences for visitors to the Element Hotel in Chandler, where selected guests will have access to Waymo vehicles. Waymo is also expanding existing partnerships with AutoNation Group, who currently helps Waymo service and maintain the vehicles in Phoenix and is now making it possible for customers to ride in a loaned Waymo while they have their personal vehicles serviced. The focus of the pilots in Phoenix is errand running and convenience, such as being able to wine and dine without worrying about where to leave your car, or driving over the limit, and indicates how the technology might be used in a future smart city environment. A number of autonomous vehicle companies having taken up projects in the US, while driverless car projects are underway in several UK areas too, including Greenwich and Milton Keynes[12]. Main image and body copy image: Waymo 24/7/2018: Stagecoach to trial UK's first driverless bus Transport operator Stagecoach has partnered with a bus manufacturer and sensor startup to trial the UK's first autonomous bus later this year. Due to current legislation, the self-driving bus won't pick up passengers, but will operate in the firm's depot doing parking manoeuvres, practising refuelling and entering a bus wash. Stagecoach UK bus engineering director Sam Greer said the project could have a positive short-term effect within bus depots and prove a big disrupter to the wider public transport industry. \"This is an exciting trial that will deliver the UK's first fully autonomous single deck bus, he said.\"We look forward to working with our partners on this project which we believe could, in time, help improve safety and efficiency within our depots, and over the longer term, help transform bus travel in the future.\"The vehicle is currently being worked on by bus manufacturer Alexander Dennis (ADL) at its site in Guildford, where it's being fitted with Fusion Processing;s CAVstar sensor system that also appearedin the UK's largest public trial ofautonomous vehicles in Greenwich[13]earlier this year. The CAVstar system uses multiple sensor types, such as radar, laser, camera, ultrasound and satellite navigation to detect and avoid objects and obstructions. The system is said to be efficient enough to operated day and night and in all weather conditions and can plan the optimum route. The bus is expected to be ready for operation in Stagecoach's depots by the end of the year. Picture: Shutterstock 12/07/2018: Uber culls self-driving car operatives in Pittsburgh Uber has laid off 100 of its self-driving car operatives in Pittsburgh as the company revises its strategy for driverless cars in the wake of a fatal crash in Tempe, Arizona last March. The San Francisco-based company held a meeting on 11 July to inform the 100 safety drivers who ride in autonomous Uber vehicles that their positions are being terminated. Uber had suspended its self-driving tests in North America following the fatal accident, but it had kept the drivers on the payroll. But, it seems it now is scaling down operations and replacing the positions with 55 mission specialists - more technically minded developer roles. The company said that the redundant operators could apply for new vacancies. 'Our team remains committed to building safe self-driving technology, and we look forward to returning to public roads in the coming months,' an Uber spokesperson said. Uber originally halted its self-driving test in San Francisco, Toronto and Pittsburgh after one of its cars hit and killed Elaine Herzberg as she crossed a street in Tempe, Arizona. A US National Transport Safety Board (NTSB) investigation criticised the car's software stating that it 'detected but ignored' Herzberg before the crash. Despite the damning investigation, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the firm would resume testing in the city, but stressed the company would put safety first. Speaking at Uber's Elevate conference in May, he said: 'Are we doing the right thing? Are we pushing too hard, and is it coming at the cost of safety? ...if it is then you have to take a step back. We will win because of the talent of the technical people we have in our offices.' Uber has said it remains focused on implementing the safety recommendations that came out of its internal safety review, which looked at everything from the system safety to the company's training processes for vehicle operators. The safety aspect of driverless cars is becoming more critical in the deployment of the technology, with Uber having to cut back its operations and competitors such as Tesla also having high profile accidents with autonomous cars. In June, the City of Boston granted nuTonomy and it's parent company Aptiv permission to operate driverless cars on public roads in Boston. It is the first and only company to operate citywide and its safety record was highlighted as the reason. 31/05/2018: MIT unveils algorithm for more 'human-like' autonomous cars Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology[14](MIT) have unveiled a new algorithm that gives \"on-the-fly\" analysis for autonomous cars to behave in a more human-like fashion. The team from the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) say the algorithm creates and reassesses buffer zones around a vehicle by making the best use of the limited information to then interpret different types of human behaviour behind the wheel. \"The motivation is, 'what can we do with as little information as possible?' How can we have an autonomous vehicle behave as a human driver might behave? What is the minimum amount of information the car needs to elicit that human-like behaviour?\" said Alyssa Pierson, lead author of the research paper, which was presented at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation. Sensors in autonomous cars constantly monitor and assess the surrounding area of a vehicle, called buffer zones, calculating the other cars' positions and their likely future positions. The new formula goes beyond these current pre-computed buffer zone calculations and provides a more dynamic evaluation of driving situations. The algorithm was tested in a simulation that included up to 16 autonomous cars driving in an environment with several hundred other vehicles. Each of the 16 cars had a slightly different style of driving to mimic more human-esquebehaviour behind the wheel. \"The autonomous vehicles were not in direct communication but ran the proposed algorithm in parallel without conflict or collisions. Each car used a different risk threshold that produced a different driving style, allowing us to create conservative and aggressive drivers,\" Pierson said. \"Using the static pre-computed buffer zones would only allow for conservative driving, whereas our dynamic algorithm allows for a broader range of driving styles.\" One of the biggest challenges of autonomous vehicles is how they will integrate with human drivers and recent incidents have highlighted the need to improve the technology. A Tesla Model S electric car that crashed into a firetruck earlier this month was reported to have sped up before the collision. A police report suggested the Tesla car was following another vehicle and dropped its speed to 55mph to match the vehicle in front. That car was said to have changed lanes and the Tesla car automatically increased its speed to 60mph without noticing the stopped cars directly ahead.[embedded content]18/05/2018: Intel's Mobileye tests self-driving car tech in Jerusalem Intel's Mobileye division has started testing self-driving cars in Jerusalem, a city supposedly know for its challenging driving conditions. While Mobileye is based in Jerusalem, so testing in its home city is sensibly convenient, the city also throws Intel's driverless car technology into the deep end. \"Jerusalem is notorious for aggressive driving. There aren't perfectly marked roads. And there are complicated merges. People don't always use crosswalks. You can't have an autonomous car traveling at an overly cautious speed, congesting traffic or potentially causing an accident. You must drive assertively and make quick decisions like a local driver,\" explained Professor Amnon Shashua, chief executive at Mobileye. This testing will put Intel's camera-only sensors setup to the test, as it tries to create a driverless car system that uses 12 cameras around a car rather than tap into Lidar and GPS systems. The idea is to create a system with \"true redundancy\", where each sensors system is capable of piloting a car on its own, which Intel noted is a faster wait to validate a car's self-driving perception system as well as create autonomous cars capable of still operating if one sensor system fails. Intel's driverless car tech is also set to spread further afield as Mobileye secured a deal with a European car maker to put its self-driving technology into eight million cars, reported Reuters[15]. While the car maker was not named, Intel's deal will see it provide Level 3 driverless car technology, whereby a car can pilot itself autonomously but needs a human driver to be behind the wheel and paying attention to the road ahead. Mobieye already works with a swathe of car makers, including General Motors, Nissan, Audi and BMW to supply them with Level 3 autonomous driving technology. 17/05/2018:Tesla confirms Autopilot crash amid mounting safety concerns The driver of a Tesla car that crashed into a firetruck in Utah last week had enabled its Autopilot feature, the company has confirmed. The Model S collided with a stationary vehicle in its path on 11 May after the driver turned on both the 'autosteer' and 'cruise control' features 80 seconds prior to the accident, Tesla told police. The driver, who suffered a broken ankle in the crash, had taken her hands off the wheel to check her phone, according to Tesla, and reported on by the Guardian[16], and has received a traffic citation for \"failure to keep [a] proper lookout\", police said. Tesla said there were more than a dozen instances where the driver had taken her hands off the wheel for more than a minute. It added that the driver's use of Autopilot was \"contrary to proper use\" because she \"did not pay attention to the road at all\". Tesla's manual warns its drivers that the automatic emergency braking is not a substitute for maintaining a safe distance from cars in front of them. \"Drivers are repeatedly advised Autopilot features do not make Tesla vehicles 'autonomous' and that the driver absolutely must remain vigilant with their eyes on the road, hands on the wheel and they must be prepared to take any and all action necessary to avoid hazards on the road,\" the company wrote. The confirmation came out the same day that the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced it was sending a team to investigate the crash. Earlier this week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter to rebuff claims from the Wall Street Journal that his company considered adding eye tracking and steering-wheel sensors to its Autopilot system but opted not to over financial reasons. \"This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is the safest car on the road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg,\" he tweeted[17]. 10/04/2018: Uber to resume self-driving car tests in a few months according to CEO Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said that the company would resume testing its self-driving cars in a few months after suspending the tests following the fatal accident in March. Speaking from the stage of Uber's second annual Elevate conference in Los Angeles, Khosrowshahi said the tests could resume in the next few months, but would not provide any details before the National Transport Safety Board (NTSB) finish its investigation into the accident. Elaine Herzberg was killed when she was hit by one of Uber's self-driving cars in Tempe, Arizona in March. It's reported that the accident was caused by a software issue that caused the vehicle to detect but ignore her as she crossed the road. Khosrowshahi said that the company wouldn't tweet any information before the NTSB publish its findings and said the company would not put innovation above safety. \"Are we doing the right thing, are we pushing too hard, and is it coming at the cost of safety, and if it is then you have to take a step back. We will win because of the talent of the technical people we have in our offices,\" he said. Khosrowshahi briefly spoke about the company's self-driving car tests at its annual Elevate vent where it laid out detailed plans to launch a flying taxi service by 2023. Announcing partnerships with Nasa and the US aeronautics agency, Uber hopes to fill the skies with thousands of short-range electric aircraft and mass produce them to the extent that the cost of aerial commuting would come down to the level of its land-based carpooling service. Eric Allison recently left air taxi startup Kitty Hawk to join Uber as head of aviation programmes and spoke at the event detailing the task the company has taken on. \"To make this happen we have to do something that is basically completely unprecedented: a real-time network of aerial vehicles that all operate together at a massive scale,\" he said. Khosrowshahi was interviewed at the end of the event and spoke of the need to look at urban congestion in another way and said that taking to the skies is the best way. \"We have to solve this transportation problem in more than just two dimensions, we need this third dimension,\" Khosrowshahi added. 08/04/2018: Uber car 'detected but ignored' woman that it hit The Uber self-driving car involved in the test that resulted in the death of a 49-year-old woman saw but ignored her, according to a report inThe[18]Information[19]. Elainze Herzberg died on 18 March after the vehicle collided with her at 40mph as she pushed her bike across the road in front of the car outside of a crossing in Tempe, Arizona. Sensors in the modified Volvo XC90 are tuned to differentiate between large, obtrusive objects, such as other cars and people, and smaller objects labelled 'false positives' that do not require the car to stop, like plastic bags. Although it detected Herzberg, the car's software was tuned in favour of ignoring these so-called false positives and did not stop or swerve as she crossed the road,The Informationreported. A human safety driver did not react in time. Uber has already reached its preliminary conclusion and is working with the US National Transport Safety Board (NTSB), which will publish a full report later in the year. \"We're actively cooperating with the NTSB in their investigation. Out of respect for that process and the trust we have built with NTSB, we can't comment on the specifics of the incident,\" an Uber spokesperson told IT Pro. \"In the meantime, we have initiated a top-to-bottom safety review of our self-driving vehicles programme, and we have brought on former NTSB chair Christopher Hart to advise us on our overall safety culture. Our review is looking at everything from the safety of our system to our training process for the vehicle operators, and we hope to have more to say soon.\" 30/04/2018:Driver banned after moving to passenger seat with Tesa on Autopilot A 39-year-old man has pleaded guilty to dangerous driving after another driver filmed him on the M1 in the passenger seat of his Tesla S 60. The video, taken in May 2017 by a passenger in another vehicle, shows Bhavesh Patel in the passenger seat with his arms behind his head, allowing the car to run in Autopilot mode on a busy road going at around 40mph, despite the manual warning owners to be prepared to take over at all times.  The clip went viral on social media before being reported to police, who interviewed Patel, of Alfreton Road in Nottingham, at Stevenage Police Station. There hetold officers his actions were \"silly\" but that the car had \"amazing\" capabilities and he was \"the unlucky one who got caught\".[embedded content]A Tesla engineer told police that the Autopilot mode is not designed to make the car driverless, and the car's features are only meant to assist a \"fully-attentive driver\" with acceleration, deceleration and steering, and should not be the sole form of navigation. Patel was handed an 18-month driving ban, 100 hours unpaid community work, ordered to undergo 10 days \"rehabilitation\" and must pay 1,800 in costs to the Crown Prosecution Service. \"This case should serve as an example to all drivers who have access to autopilot controls and have thought about attempting something similar,\" said investigating officer PC Kirk Caldicutt. \"I want to stress that they are in no way a substitute for a competent motorist in the driving seat who can react appropriately to the road ahead.\" This message mirrors warnings from Tesla following several deaths in automated cars in the US.Tesla has warned that the cruise control is programmed to stay within painted lane lines and doesn't recognise stationary objects. After the first death in 2016, caused by a collision with a parked truck, Tesla reduced the time limit a driver can go without touching the wheel. Despite cases of misuse, a US Department of Transportation study[20] in 2017 reported that Autopilot on Tesla reduces the risk of crash by 40%. \"There are about 1.25 million automotive deaths worldwide,\" a Tesla spokesperson said[21] in March of this year after the second driverless car death. \"If the current safety level of a Tesla vehicle were to be applied, it would mean about 900,000 lives saved per year.\" 19/04/2018:California investigates workplace safety at Tesla California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) has opened an investigation into workplace safety at Tesla's Fremont factory. The decision to investigate the electric car manufacturer comes after claimsthat Tesla put speed and style over workplace safety to the extent that the company's lack of coloured warning signs were down to CEO Elon Musk hating the colour yellow. Other claims in the article, byReveal[22], suggest Tesla under-reported workplace injuries. Tesla dismissed the report in a blog posted shortly after and called the article an \"ideologically motivated attack\" and referred to the website as an \"extremist organization\". \"In our view, what they portray as investigative journalism is in fact an ideologically motivated attack by an extremist organization working directly with union supporters to create a calculated disinformation campaign against Tesla.\" But a spokeswoman forCal/OSHA said it \"takes seriously reports of workplace hazards and allegations of employers' underreporting recordable work-related injuries and illnesses\". It has been a bruising week for Musk, who had to go on a PR offensive to dispel wide reports that his company placed unreasonable demands on staff and caused production to halt due to over-automation of factory jobs. It had been reported that a three to five day break in production was due to failing to produce enough cars per week, but a statement from a company spokesmen claimed that it was a planned pause. \"Our Model 3 production plan includes periods of planned downtime in both Fremont and Gigafactory,\" a spokesperson said. \"These periods are used to improve automation and systematically address bottlenecks in order to increase production rates. This is not unusual and is in fact common in production ramps like this.\" However, a leaked email from Musk, listing a set of demands of his employees to \"burn the midnight oil\" and demonstrate the ability to produce 6,000 Model 3 cars per week by the end of June, brought more scrutiny on Tesla. 18/04/2018: Musk emails rallying call to Tesla staff Tesla CEO Elon Musk has called on his staff to 'burn the midnight oil' and begin operating 24/7 at the company's Fremont assembly plant in California. In a long and detailed email obtained by Jalopnik, Musk rallied his teams and laid out the strategy for production of the Model 3 vehicle, setting a higher bar for both his employees and parts suppliers. On Tuesday the assembly line had been shut down, for up to five days, to begin an upgrade to the way it operates. Later that day the CEO emailed staff with exactly what that would entail. The email is structure almost like a compliment sandwich, begin and ending with praise for his 'kickass team'. He starts by congratulating them for three weeks of consistently producing 2,000 cars and ends with calling their accomplishments 'miracles'. The more blunt and provocative points of the message are in the middle. The Gigafactory in Nevada and the Fremont plant in California are to stop for up to five days to receive upgrades to set them up for Model 3 production targets of 3,000 per week. Fremont will begin operating 24-hours a day with 400 new jobs created for around seven weeks. A further upgrade is planned for late May to then double production to 6,000. The high target was issued with an ultimatum: 'Please note that all areas of Tesla and our suppliers will be required to demonstrate a Model 3 capacity of 6000 per week by building 850 sets of car parts in 24 hours no later than June 30th,' he wrote. 'Any Tesla department or supplier that is unable to do this will need to have a very good explanation why not, along with a plan for fixing the problem and present that to me directly. We are going to find a way or make a way to get there.' Part of the reason for setting the target at 6,000 and not 5,000 is to include a margin for error, but a few paragraphs later Musk issues a warning to parts suppliers to meet his company's high standards. 'Our car needs to be designed and built with such accuracy and precision that, if an owner measures dimensions, panel gaps and flushness, and their measurements don't match the Model 3 specs, it just means that their measuring tape is wrong,' he added. 'Some parts suppliers will be unwilling or unable to achieve this level of precision. I understand that this will be considered an unreasonable request by some. That's OK, there are lots of other car companies with much lower standards. They just can't work with Tesla.' He also laid out a strategy for boosting profit by skimming away unnecessary expenditure and personally overseeing anything over $1M. He rounded it all off with a list of productivity recommendations where he takes issue with meetings, acronyms and communication speeds and asks staff to send him a note if they feel that they have any ideas to make Tesla better. 17/04/2018:Tesla shuts down Model 3 Sedan production again Tesla has reportedly shut down its assembly line for Model 3 cars for a second time after failing to reach manufacturing targets. CEO Elon Musk gave CBS This Morning host Gayle King a tour of his Silicon Valley factory last week and said he was optimistic about the company's ability to speed up production of their Model 3 Sedan cars. However, an announcement of a four-to-five day pause in production has since allegedly been issued to Tesla employees, who spoke to BuzzFeed[23] about the issues surrounding the electric car company's production of their Model 3 vehicles. It's the second time the line has been shut down this year, following a brief pause in production in late February. Musk introduced the Model 3 Sedan last summer. It was billed as the company's first mid-priced, mass-produced electric car accessible to middle-class customers and not just the super wealthy.But following issues in assembly, Musk personally took over the Model 3 production line at the beginning of April after realising it needed improving and has even said he had resorted to pulling all-nighters at the plant and, at times, even slept in his factory. \"When things get really intense, I don't have time to go home and shower and change, so I just sleep here,\" Musk told CBS. Tesla's main issue has been meeting its production goals over the last six months, BuzzFeed reported. Musk had said the company would be manufacturing 2,500 cars a week by the end of the first quarter of 2018, but it was making only 2,000 per week by the start of April. Now, just two weeks later, production is once again on hold, the publication reports. The car maker's current goal is to manufacture 5,000 cars per week by the end of the second quarter; 5,000 per week had initially been its year-end goal for 2017. On April Fool's day, Musk posted a joke on his Twitter about the electric car company going bankrupt, following growing speculation about its future. Tesla has struggled to reach ambitious production goals during what Musk has referred to as \"production hell\". He has also cited complacency with the use of technology. \"We got complacent about some of the things that we felt were our core technology....We put too much new technology into the Model 3 all at once. This should have been staged,\" he said. A Tesla spokesperson issued the same statement as was given during the last shutdown, saying: 'Our Model 3 production plan includes periods of planned downtime in both Fremont and Gigafactory 1. These periods are used to improve automation and systematically address bottlenecks in order to increase production rates. This is not unusual and is in fact common in production ramps like this.' 09/04/2018: UK government won't create regulation for driverless cars yet The UK government will not define how autonomous vehicles are regulated before the technology is widely available, it has confirmed. Instead, the government plans to wait until it sees what kind of driverless technologies will come from car manufacturers, and legislate accordingly, said Parliamentary under-secretary of state for transport, Baroness Sugg. \"Whilst we do know that there will be different types of automated vehicles, with varying levels of sophistication, it is not possible at this stage to state what those changes will be. With this in mind it would not be appropriate to set definitive regulations in legislation at this time,\" she said in a letter[24] addressed to the House of Lords last month. Her memo sought to address points raised in Parliamentary debates around Automated and Electric Vehicles (AEV) Bill, including how autonomous vehicles are licensed. Sugg said the Department for Transport is working with DVLA to ensure the vehicle licensing body's definition of different types of driverless cars works for both insurers and drivers, creating a list of the autonomous cars in the UK potentially by cross-referencing them with cars stored on the DVLA's database. She also suggested that regulation for autonomous vehicles could be defined under the Road Traffic Act 1988, adding: \"Regulating for further standards now is likely to impede innovation but, as new technologies reach the point of market readiness, we will be able to set and define the standards both internationally and domestically.\" The day before Sugg's letter, roads minister Jesse Norman made a statement about a review the Law Commission of England and Wales and the Scottish Law Commission will carry out over the next three years. The review will focus on how automated vehicles will operate with current laws and whether any new regulations are necessary. Norman also stated that the commissions have to consider how to judge criminal offences in which there is no driver and possibly no steering wheel.03/04/2018:US watchdog blasts Tesla over Model X crash probe A US transportation watchdog has said it's \"unhappy\" with Tesla's handling of an investigation into a fatal crash involving a Model X Tesla, after the company suggested publicly that the driver may have been partly to blame. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is currently investigating the crash and death of driver Walter Huang, has chastised the company for releasing the information to the public during on an ongoing investigation, according to the Washington Post[25]. Tesla concluded in a blog post that the autopilot technology inside the Model X electric vehicle was engaged six seconds before the vehicle collided with a concrete road divider. Internal assessments of the car's computer logs showed that the car's autonomous cruise control system, which is designed to speed up or slow down a car, was turned on moments before the incident, according to Tesla. However, the company added that the driver's hands were off the steering wheel during that time, despite receiving repeated warnings from the vehicle. \"In the moments before the collision, which occurred at 9:27 a.m. on Friday, March 23rd, Autopilot was engaged with the adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum,\" said Tesla, in a blog post[26]. \"The driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver's hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.\"The company added that the driver had around 5 seconds and 150 metres of unobstructed view of the road before the car hit a concrete divider, however, no action was taken to avoid the obstacle. Tesla claims that the crash was made more severe as the divider, known as a crash attenuator, had been damaged by a previously unreported incident and was unable to absorb the shock of the crash effectively. However, reports last week[27] suggested that Huang had complained to Tesla about the car's autopilot feature, frequently returning his Model X to the dealer after the system veered towards the same barrier that his car ultimately collided with. Tesla has maintained that autonomous autopilot systems have helped reduce crash rates by up to 40% in the US, and that the consequences of the public not using such systems would be \"extremely severe\". \"There are about 1.25 million automotive deaths worldwide. If the current safety level of a Tesla vehicle were to be applied, it would mean about 900,000 lives saved per year. We expect the safety level of autonomous cars to be 10 times safer than non-autonomous cars,\" said Tesla. The UK's Law Commission, responsible for regularly reviewing laws enacted in England and Wales, told IT Pro that automated technology like this is evolving quickly and must be scrutinised before they reach the UK. \"This technology doesn't easily fit within current legal frameworks and questions around safety and accidents, amongst others, have to be answered before they hit British roads,\" said a spokesperson for the independent body. The Law Commission echoed a commitment made last month that it would be reviewing relevant laws with the potential of introducing reforms around the use of automated technology, which would also include self-driving cars. 27/03/2018:Uber has been ordered to suspend all tests of its self-driving cars on Arizona roads after one of its vehicles hit and killed a pedestrian last week. A woman from Tempe was fatally injured by one of Uber's autonomous cars on 18 March while crossing a street, in what is considered to be the first time a pedestrian has been killed by the emerging technology. Arizona governor Doug Ducey described the incident as an \"unquestionable failure\" to comply with the expectation that testing of the technology would prioritise public safety above all else, according to a letter addressed to Uber chief Dara Khosrowshahi, seen by the New York Times[28]. In response to the accident, Uber spokesperson Matt Kallman told the NYT that it has \"proactively suspended self-driving operations in all cities immediately following the tragic incident last week.\" \"We continue to help investigators in any way we can, and we'll keep a dialogue open with the governor's office to address any concerns they have.\" Despite the self-imposed suspension, Arizona's governor said he has told the state's department of transportation to suspend all further Uber self-driving tests. IT Pro has contacted Uber for comment. Arizona has been lauded for its positive attitude towards self-driving cars and its reluctance to impose heavy-handed regulations, favouring instead the potential economic benefits that it could bring. Arizona's Tempe Police Department said that video evidence suggested that neither the self-driving SUV, nor its onboard safety driver, noticed the pedestrian crossing the road, and that the vehicle failed to slow down before hitting the woman. Both Google's Waymo and General Motors' Cruise will continue to test their fleets in the state, although it's unclear whether heavier restrictions will be imposed following Sunday's incident. 20/03/2018:Uber suspends self-driving tests as pedestrian dies Uber has halted trials of its driverless vehicles across North America following a fatal collision between one of its cars and a pedestrian. The incident happened on Sunday evening in Tempe, Arizona, according to the local police department (as reported by BBC News[29]), when a woman, named as Elaine Herzberg, stepped out into the road in front of the specially equipped Volvo, which was in autonomous mode but also had a human behind the wheel. Herzberg wasn't using a pedestrian crossing at the time. Tempe police chief Sylvia Moir told the San Francisco Chronicle[30] Uber is likely not at fault, however.\"The driver said it was like a flash, the person walked out in front of them,\" she said. \"His first alert to the collision was the sound of the collision.\" The incident was caught on video by the car, which had at least two operational cameras at the time - one facing forward in front of the car and one facing the driver. Of the recordings, Moir said: \"It's very clear it would have been difficult to avoid this collision in any kind of mode [autonomous or human-driven] based on how she came from the shadows right into the roadway.\" \"I suspect preliminarily it appears that the Uber would likely not be at fault in this accident,\" she added. This is the second accident involving a self-driving Uber car in Tempe, with one of its vehicles being flipped on its side in a collision last year. However, this is the first reported instance of any autonomous vehicle being involved in a fatal collision. Consumer Watchdog, a citizen safety lobby group, said on Twitter: \"This is a tragedy we have been fighting years to prevent. We hope our calls for real regulation of driverless cars will be taken seriously going forward by Silicon Valley and the Trump Administration.\" Tempe mayor Mark Mitchell called Uber \"responsible\" for pausing driverless car tests, but said he still supports the technology. \"Testing must occur safely,\" he said in a statement. \"All indications we have had in the past show that traffic laws are being obeyed by the companies testing here. Our city leadership and Tempe Police will pursue any and all answers to what happened in order to ensure safety moving forward. \"I support the step that Uber has taken to temporarily suspend testing in Tempe until this event is fully examined and understood. That is a responsible step to take at this time.\"20/03/2018: Gatwick will implement Oxbotica's driverless vehicles to ferry its staff around the airport, saving money and reducing emissions. The airport's 300 airside vehicle spend 90% of their time stationary as their drivers tend to passengers and aircraft around the airfield and in terminal buildings. The pilot study will be the first step in a much bigger project that may mean other vehicles, such as the buses to take passengers between terminal buildings, aircraft push back tugs, passenger aircraft bridges and luggage trucks are automated in future. It will attempt to prove driverless vehicles are safe for use on live airfields and could lead to an Uber-like car ordering and staff delivery system around worldwide airports. 'Airports offer an incredibly interesting domain for our autonomous driving software,' Dr. Graeme Smith, CEO of Oxbotica said. 'There is a huge diversity of vehicles, each with a very specific mission. The challenge of choreographing all of the activity around an individual plane, or in support of airport operations is immense and we look forward to working closely with Gatwick on this initial pilot that will demonstrate our self-driving technology carrying staff around the airfield.' Gatwick's trial will start this summer, although theywon't include passengers or aircraft yet, as the airport trials the vehicles on airside roads between its North and south terminals. The project will collect a large amount of data from a range of different vehicle types, all powered by Oxobotica's driverless car technology. This information will be provided to the Department of Transport, Civil Aviation Authority and others transportation agencies around the world to assess whether they could be used in other markets on a commercial basis. 'If this trial proves successful then in the future we could have an Uber-like service operating across the airfield which staff can hail as and when they need to travel,' said Cathal Corcoran Gatwick Airport's CIO. 'This trial is just the start and much more research will be needed, but ultimately this could be the start of widespread use of autonomous vehicles on airfields across the world. The new technology is a more efficient way to manage vehicles and could lead to a reduction in the number of vehicles required, their associated costs and harmful emissions.' 06/03/2018:Stanford University researchers have come up with new technology that could enable self-driving cars to 'see' around corners and view hidden objects. Called \"Confocal non-line-of-sight imaging\", the researchers described the technique in a research paper published[31] in Nature. Scientists used lasers that bounce off walls and onto an object hidden from view, then reflect back from the object, back off the wall and onto a light-detecting sensor. Normally such scans can take hours to develop, so the team had to come up with an extremely efficient and effective algorithm to process the final image. \"A substantial challenge in non-line-of-sight imaging is figuring out an efficient way to recover the 3D structure of the hidden object from the noisy measurements,\" said David Lindell, a graduate student in the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab and co-author of the paper. \"I think the big impact of this method is how computationally efficient it is.\" The new algorithms mean that data from the scans could be processed in less than a second and also run on a regular laptop.Now, the scientists are further developing the system to cope with many more different situations and finish the scan quicker. Work is needed to refine the system to work better when there is a lot of ambient light, though. The researchers said that if the technology were used on a car today, it could easily detect road signs, safety vests or road markers, although it might have problems with a person wearing non-reflective clothing. \"We believe the computation algorithm is already ready for LIDAR systems,\" said Matthew O'Toole, a postdoctoral scholar in the Stanford Computational Imaging Lab and co-lead author of the paper. \"The key question is if the current hardware of LIDAR systems supports this type of imaging.\" 01/02/2018:UK to test self-driving car on 200 miles of country roads A self-driving car project will attempt to navigate over 200 miles of UK country roads and roundabouts in what is considered a major step towards a full rollout of autonomous vehicles by 2021. The HumanDrive initiative, a collaborative effort between leading car manufacturers and educational groups, will run a series of initial simulations and machine learning tests in order to train the vehicle how to manoeuvre on complex roads, before a live journey in December 2019. The project aims to take advantage of a raft of changes introduced by chancellor Philip Hammond in November's budget speech, allowing self-driving car trials to start as early as 2019. Although a handful of live tests have been carried out on UK roads by companies such as Oxbotica[32], the HumanDrive project is thought to be the first to trial a self-driving car without a human onboard. The UK hopes to have self-driving cars on roads by 2021, yet progress still lags far behind the likes of the US. However, business and energy secretary Greg Clark told the[33] BBC[34] that \"trailblazing projects\" like these \"will play a vital role helping us deliver on that ambition\". \"Low-carbon and self-driving vehicles are the future and they are going to drive forward a global revolution in mobility,\" added Clark. The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance has pledged its support to the collaboration, alongside Leeds and Cranfield Universities, Highways England and the Transport Systems Catapult. Initial stages of the project involve using human drivers performing intricate tasks inside a simulator at Leeds University. The data from these tests will be fed into machine learning algorithms, where it will be analysed in order to train the system to drive like a real person. Mark Westwood, chief technology officer of the Transport Systems Catapult, said UK roads offer unique challenges for autonomous driving systems. \"They are different from American roads with roundabouts and demanding country lanes,\" said Westwood. \"These are really testing environments. This project is about advancing the state of the art and trying to do something more demanding. The control system will learn to drive like a human.\" 25/01/2018:Crashes call into question autonomous vehicle safety The safety of self-driving cars is once again up for discussion, following two crashes in California involving cars that had been put into self-drive mode. The first accident involved a Chevrolet Bolt, which collided with a motorbike on a San Francisco highway. According to the motorbike rider, Oscar Nilsson, the car - which was in self-driving mode but also had a human driver behind the wheel - started to change lanes to the left, but as he rode forward the Bolt swerved back into its original lane and knocked him to the ground. Local paper Mercury News[35] reports that the motorcyclist is now suing General Motors, which owns and manufactures Chevrolets and other brands, but the car maker contends Nilsson was at fault. The other incident, which occurred earlier this week, is slightly less complex in terms of the mechanics of the incident. Rather than involving two moving vehicles, the crash in Culver City was between a stationary fire engine and a Tesla car. According to Culver City Firefighters[36], the Model S ploughed straight into the back of one of their fire engines, which was attending a separate incident, at 65mph on a freeway.The car's autopilot mode - which allows for semi-autonomous driving, but also requires the driver to be attentive (e.g. holding the wheel and being prepared to intervene if necessary) - was apparently engaged at the time. There is little other information about the circumstances of the crash, currently. When approached for comment by IT Pro, Tesla didn't comment on this case in particular, but said: 'Autopilot is intended for use only with a fully attentive driver.' 16/01/2018: BlackBerry launches security software designed for self-driving cars Ailing smartphone firm BlackBerry has had its sights set beyond the mobile industry for some time now since ceding the production of its devices to a third party in 2016[37]. Focusing instead on its expertise in security software, BlackBerry is now bringing that speciality beyond the smartphone and to driverless cars. Named Blackberry Jarvis - possibly a nod to the AI system in the Iron Man films -the cybersecurity software aims to identify vulnerabilities in programs used inautonomous vehicles. BlackBerry is promoting it on a pay-as-you-go basis -but, according to Reuters[38], it could also be used within the healthcare and industrial automation industries. BlackBerry said that once the software has been bought, car firms will have online access to the Jarvis software, which will give them the ability to scan files at every stage of their software development. 05/01/2017: Roborace and Nvidia jump on level 5 autonomy Roborace and Nvidia have announced they're working towards introducing level 5 autonomy to Robocars via an upgrade to Nvidia's Drive Pegasus AI autonomous car platform. The platform was first revealed in October 2017 and is capable of performing 320 trillion operations per second - the computational power equivalent to a 100-server data centre. What's more impressive is the power operates from a device the size of a single licence plate. 'Roborace will enable motorsport to play an increasingly significant role in the development of technologies which will improve driver performance and ultimately save lives on our roads,' said Bryn Balcombe, chief strategy officer at Roborace. 'Cognitive power will soon rival horsepower as an automotive performance measure and the Nvidia Drive Pegasus sets a new benchmark which will enable Roborace to extend competitions well beyond the confines of traditional circuit racing.' Nvidia's Drive PX platform has already been showcased alongside Roborace's development cars when the two took part in a race around Hong Kong'sFormula E street circuit last month. 'Roborace is pushing the limits of AI technology and delivering autonomous driving experiences that have never been achieved before,' said Danny Shapiro, senior director of Automotive at Nvidia. 'The advances made with Nvidia technology in motorsport will accelerate adoption of autonomous vehicles on public roads, making daily travel safer and more enjoyable.' Although Robocars have been developed with racing in mind, the company hopes to apply much of the technology to street cars too. 22/12/2017: Cruise automated car crashes into a motorcyclist in San FranciscoAn automated car operated by General Motors-owned Cruise hit a motorcyclist earlier this year, although it's only just been revealed to the public. According to a filing with the Californian Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), the motorcyclist was at fault and although injured in the collision, he was only treated for murder injuries in hospital. The report explained the Cruise car was travelling in the middle lane of a three-legged road in San Francisco's Lower Haight area. It began moving into a space in the left lane, but as the traffic ahead slowed, it raliser the gap was too small and so returned to the centre lane. However, in that time, a motorcycle was travelling between the right and centre lanes. It began moving towards the centre lane, hit the autonomous car and fell of his bike. \"We test our self-driving cars in challenging and unpredictable environments precisely because, by doing so, we will get better, safer AV technology on the roads sooner,\" Cruise said in a statement. \"In this case, the motorcyclist merged into our lane before it was safe to do so.\" The car's speed was logged at 12mph, while the motorcyclist was travelling at 17mph. California's DMV posts all automated car incidents, including collisions, on its website. This year alone, Cruise has been involved in 14 accidents around San Francisco, including one incident when another vehicle hit the back of a Cruise car. Although 14 incidents does seem a lot compared to the average non-automated car, this isn't directly comparable to other automated car manufacturers because Cruise's biggest competitors - Uber and Waymo - test their cars in Phoenix and Arizona doesn't post its data publicly. 17/11/2017:JaguarLand Rover's first autonomous vehicle hits the streets JaguarLand Rover tested its first driverless vehicle on British streets it announced today. The tests are taking place in Coventry, where the company is headquartered. They are part of the 20m UK Autodrive project which is a government-backed competiton to trial autonomous vehicle technology.The company is using a Range Rover Sport[39] which can operate autonomously through a city and is a step closer to level 4 autonomy, one of the highest grades of self-driving a car can reach. It wants to make the autonomous vehicle work in on and off-road driving environments and all kinds of weather. \"Testingthis self-driving project on public roads is so exciting, as the complexity of the environment allows usto find robust ways to increase road safety in the future. By using inputs from multiple sensors, andfinding intelligent ways to process this data, we are gaining accurate technical insight to pioneer theautomotive application of these technologies,\" said Nick Rogers, executive director of product engineering at JaguarLand Rover.In June, Tony Harper, director of engineering research at the company said: \"The automotive landscape is changing faster today than ever before. As a technology company, our innovation is continuous and our cars of the future will become more capable, cleaner, more connected, more desirable and smarter. Our Autonomous Urban Drive research is JaguarLand Rover's next step in our development of both fully and semi-autonomous vehicle technologies.\" With the launch of the trials, Coventry joins 12 other cities which are carrying out self-driving vehicle tests on public roads globally. In Arizona, Google's Waymo has already launched driverless Chrysler Pacifica minivans. The driverless vehicles previously had human drivers and offered free rides to residents; now there will be no driver. However, one of Waymo's staff will be present in the vehicle until the novelty wears off. Image Source: JaguarLand Rover 09/11/2017:Autonomous shuttle involved in accident on its first day A self-driving shuttle was involved in a crash on it's launch day in Las Vegas yesterday. The shuttle, launched by the American Automobile Association (AAA) in partnership with Keolis and manufactured by NAVYA, had begun its first day of a 12-month pilot scheme The City of Las Vegas stated[40] that the shuttle was \"grazed\" by a delivery truck in downtown Las Vegas. \"The shuttle did what it was supposed to do, in that it's sensors registered the truck and the shuttle stopped to avoid the accident. \"Unfortunately the delivery truck did not stop and grazed the front fender of the shuttle. Had the truck had the same sensing equipment that the shuttle has the accident would have been avoided,\" the City wrote.It added that the shuttle will continue with its 12-month pilot scheme but remained out of service for the rest of the day yesterday. The driver of the truck was issued a ticket by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police. Mike Blasky, PR at AAA, wrote on Twitter[41]: \"Truck making delivery backed into shuttle, which was stopped. Human error causes most traffic collisions and this was no different. Driver of truck was cited. No one hurt except a bruised bumper!\"The shuttle aims to provide a quarter of a million visitors and residents of Las Vegas with the chance to ride a self driving vehicle. The pilot also wants to survey riders to see if they are wary of driverless technology and whether taking part in the scheme changes their mind. The AAA wants to explore how other people on the street react to the autonomous vehicle too. The shuttle has LiDAR technology, GPS, cameras and can seat up to 8 passengers with seatbelts. It covers a 0.6 mile loop in the Fremont East district and can be boarded at any of its three stops. Image source: NAVYA 08/11/2017: Waymo launches fully-autonomous cars The race to deploy truly driverless cars has hotted up, with Waymo announcing that its fleet of autonomous vehicles in Phoenix, Arizona will now operate with no 'safety driver'. Waymo, the self-driving car arm of Google's parent company Alphabet, has had a number of Chrysler Pacifica minivans operating in the Phoenix area since April 2017, offering free rides to residents. Until now, however, they have had a human driver behind the wheel who can take action in case of emergency - a stipulation in most locations where autonomous vehicles are being tested on public roads. At Web Summit in Lisbon, however, John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, revealed that these vehicles will now start operating without a driver. \"What you're seeing now marks the start of a new phase for Waymo and the history of this technology, Krafcik said, according toUSA Today[42]. \"Our ultimate goal is to bring our fully self-driving technology to more cities in the US and around the world,\" he added. Waymo's testing had largely taken place in California until recently, but it ran into several regulatory barriers and subsequently moved to Arizona, where there's no need for a special permit in order to operate an autonomous vehicle on public roads. The state offers other benefits too, notably its steady, warm climate; it's easier for driverless cars to operate in reliably dry conditions than in rain, snow, high winds and so on. It also doesn't have the high variability of daylight hours that states and, indeed, countries further north do. Arizonan passengers who successfully applied to a programme to use one of Waymo's fully-autonomous vehicles won't be totally alone at first, with a member of Waymo's staff present in the vehicle until the novelty wears off. After that time, however, there will be no human intermediary between the car and those who choose to be taken for a spin. 08/09/2017: Former Android developer Cyanogen leaps into driverless cars Remember Cyanogen, the open-source Android developer? After renaming itself Cyngn\u2014 though it's presumably pronounced the same way\u2014 the company looks set to pivot into driverless car development. Cyngn has received a permit to test driverless cars in California, according to a report byAxios[43],and job listings suggest its on the lookout for staff to develop hardware and software for autonomous cars. The report claims it's hired dozens of employees with such skills recently. The company imploded last year following layoffs and the departure of CEO Kirt McMaster, who was replaced by former COO Lior Tal. It then stopped updating its CyanogenMod version of Android, which let users fiddle with settings and personalise the mobile operating system, offering an alternative to running the wholly Google linked OS.  An alternative version of autonomous car software could be seen as a useful counter to the driverless systems under development by Silicon Valley giants, but there's plenty of rivals for Cyngn to have to see off for its as yet unannounced version to win the business of car makers. 08/09/2017: UK launches new autonomous vehicle initiative The government has announced the launch of its MERIDIAN programme, which will help those developing driverless vehicles co-ordinate their testing and is a place to store information regarding all autonomous vehicle testing in the UK. Part of the initiative will involve developing a \"cluster of excellence\" along the M40 corridor, where the majority of driverless car testing will occur. The government hopes that by building a hotspot for autonomous vehicle testing, it will attract investment from businesses both at home and abroad, helping to build the UK's reputation as a leader in connected car testing. \"At the heart of our Industrial Strategy is a commitment to delivering world class science, research and innovation,\" climate change and industry minister Claire Perry said. \"The MERIDIAN co-ordination hub embodies this ambition, creating a globally recognisable brand that will bring the automotive sector, academia and Government together behind a common set of strategic goals.\" The project has been part-funded by the government's 100 million CAV investment programme and the rest of the funding has been provided by the tech industry, which recognises the importance of building a hub to continue the effective development of autonomous vehicle testing. \"These technologies are coming and will profoundly change our understanding of mobility,\" Ford director of global vehicle evaluation and verification and chair of the Auto Council Technology Group, Graham Hoare said. \"The UK has long-standing capabilities across many of the sectors supporting new vehicle technologies and an approach that is more open and collaborative than other markets.\"How do self-driving cars work?Self-driving cars use a battery of sensors to detect their surroundings, including radar, lasers and camera arrays. The vehicle's onboard computer then uses specialised software to react to this input in real-time, adjusting the car's steering and acceleration to suit the situation. While some vehicles, such as the Google prototypes which have popularised the idea, are totally autonomous, other cars only automate certain aspects of driving. Tesla's Autopilot feature, for example, features adaptive cruise control, which maintains a safe speed and distance from other vehicles when driving on the motorway. It also features basic automated steering to ensure you don't accidentally drift into the wrong lane, and although it can perform basic steering maneuvers automatically, it is not intended to replace a human driver altogether.Are self-driving cars safe?There is still much debate over whether or not fully autonomous cars should be made widely available. Some say that their safety record is impeccable, while others argue that automobiles are simply too dangerous to be operated by an algorithm. This debate has been reignited by a number of high-profile Tesla crashes[44], one of which has been blamed on an Autopilot malfunction. The incidents have raised questions over whether or not self-driving technology is ready for implementation.On the other hand, Google has emphasised how safe its fleet of self-driving cars are. As part of the testing programme for its autonomous vehicles, the company has posted regular safety logs detailing any crashes the vehicles are involved in, with the vast majority being caused by human drivers[45] in other cars. Experts remain divided, however, and if self-driving cars are ever likely to be widely commercially available, they will doubtless be heavily regulated, monitored and tested.When will self-driving cars hit the road?In many cases, they already have. Some high-end luxury vehicles already feature 'assisted driving' elements that are close to fully autonomous driving, with Tesla being the obvious example. Elsewhere, testing of various driverless car projects is underway in the US, with California, Texas, Seattle and more all hosting autonomous vehicle test runs. The UK government has also given the green light for similar trials in Britain[46], so UK commuters may soon be sharing the roads with autonomous shuttles. As for when driverless cars will become commercially available, however, that is yet to be seen. As the technology is young and comparatively untested, it is likely that substantial tests will have to be conducted in partnership with government and regulatory bodies before the vehicles are available for public purchase. There is also a question as to whether or not the average driver will be able to purchase one at all. Even if fully autonomous cars are allowed to be sold, the price of each vehicle is likely to be prohibitively expensive due to the large amount of sophisticated technology that goes into them. As such, it's likely to be at least a few years before autonomous cars are approved for general road use, and most likely another few years after that before they become a commonplace sight.

To begin with, he focused on SDG 16, a goal that was developed to tackle corruption, organised crime and terrorism. <br/>He said because AI is commonly used in national security databases, it can be misused by criminals to launder money or organise crime. This is especially relevant in developing countries, where input data may be easily accessible because of poor protective measures. <br/>Dr Truby suggested that, to prevent this, there should be a risk assessment at each stage of AI development. Moreover, the AI software should be designed such that it is inaccessible when there is a threat of it being hacked. Such restrictions can minimise the risk of hackers obtaining access to the software.<br/>Then, Dr Truby took the example of SDG 8, a goal that seeks to increase public access to financial services. AI is regularly used in financial institutions to make banking simpler and more efficient. But, while learning, AI might inadvertently develop certain biases, such as reducing financial opportunities for certain minorities. <br/>Dr Truby suggested that to avoid such biases, there is a need for transparency in AI-driven processes. Human review and intervention at each step can ensure that such discrimination does not go unnoticed. Moreover, it is necessary to train software developers to recognise the harmful implications of biases, so that it can be regulated more efficiently.<br/>Finally, Dr Truby explaind how AI is a threat to SDG 10, a goal that focuses on equal opportunity. <br/>He explained how AI can be used by big firms to generate employment opportunities in developing countries and that this might threaten smaller businesses and local companies. However, if designed with sustainable development in mind, AI can create better job opportunities and increase productivity by removing labour-intensive jobs.<br/>AI is a powerful technology that needs to be used carefully and efficiently. Although Dr Truby is optimistic about the future implications of AI, he believed that developers and legislators should exercise caution through effective governance. <br/>He said, \"The risks of AI to the society and the possible detriments to sustainable development can be severe if not managed correctly. On the flip side, regulating AI can be immensely beneficial to development, leading to people being more productive and more satisfied with their employment and opportunities.\"<br/>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has generated considerable interest over the past few decades, owing to its promising applications across a wide range of fields. But, it has also sparked an ongoing debate on whether the risks of using AI outweigh its benefits. The biggest concern with AI is a lack of governance, which gives large companies, popularly called as the \"Big Tech\", unlimited access to private data. <br/>Multiple scandals in the recent past have confirmed the threats of this - such as the infamous Cambridge Analytica scandal of 2018, in which Facebook conducted a major privacy breach by leaking confidential user information to a data-mining company. <br/>Moreover, although AI should be developed in a socially responsible way, governments often do not impose strict legislations on AI development, which may be detrimental - rather than beneficial - to the society.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/20/25/45/159727300519.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/20/25/45/159727300519.jpeg</url></p><p>Unregulated use of AI can harm developing countries: QU prof<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QATART-181919032</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QATART2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K7-9NJ1-F11P-X373-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">357157</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"721\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Qatar Tribune.

The continued disorder, the violence and the impacts on residents and businesses are not just at odds with the message of justice and equity. They cannot continue to occur.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Residents near the CHOP zone criticized the city for waiting until the deadly shooting to break up those protests. Meanwhile in New York City gun violence skyrockets across New York City and police warned that this could be the new normal.</p><p>The first 3 weeks of June seeing 125 shooting incidents 53 of which coming last week alone.

Investors seeing DOW Futures trading down as many as 439 points overnight following White House Trade Adviser Peter Navarro's comments on the U. S. China Trade Deal last night on Fox News watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There had been progress made on that trade deal but given everything that's happened in all the things you just listed is that over?</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, WHITE HOUSE TRADE ADVISER: It's over yes. They came here on January 15th to sign that trade deal--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>NAVARRO: --and that was a full 2 months after they knew the virus was out and about it was at the time when they're already sent hundreds of thousands of people to this country to spread that virus. And it was just minutes after wheels up when that plane took off that we began to hear about this pandemic.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Markets rebounding quickly after Navarro walked back those comments saying this comments have been taken wildly out of context. They had nothing at all to do with the phase one trade deal which continues in place. I was simply speaking to the lack of trust we now have of the Chinese Communist Party after they lied about the origins of China virus and foisted a pandemic upon the world.</p><p>With that markets came back President Trump also waited on Twitter he wrote this the China trade deal is fully intact. Hopefully they will continue to live up to the terms of the agreement and of course those terms are $200 billion worth of purchases of agricultural and commodities.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning Haverford Trust Company Co-Chief Investment Officer Hank Smith also joining me this morning is Fox Business Dagen McDowell the Wall Street Journal Senior Writer John Hilsenrath and Senior Fellow at The National Taxpayers Union and Forward Strategies President Mattie Duppler great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>Thanks so much for being here. And Hank I want to kick it off with you. So now Peter Navarro and the President walking back those comments that the deal is not over but let's face it. The Chinese Communist Party has not kept up in terms of the promises were still waiting for that $250 billion of purchases. We may not get it in the face of all of this and the relationship has changed. How does that impact markets?</p><p>HANK SMITH, HAVERFORD TRUST COMPANY CO-CIO: Well, it clearly shows you that trade are still important issue. I mean what the S&amp;P Futures were down 400 points as you pointed out. But also the market knows that China's dealing with their own economic problems right now as are all countries do to this pandemic.</p><p>But trade and if we get into a trade war is clearly a headwind for the economy as we learned a year before. And hopefully we don't have to learn that lesson again. But you are right in pointing out our relationship with China is afraid to say the least.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So I mean, why was this such a surprise initially that market sold off when Navarro said it's over? They still haven't bought the phase one promises anyway.</p><p>SMITH: Well, that is true. But again I think the market is over - is overlooking the fact that they have involved due to the fact that we're in this pandemic. And we - you know we have to - we have to heal our country of the pandemic and then the expectation is that they will be of good all at least at phase one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Dagen jump in here. The NASDAQ hitting its 20th record close of 2020 yesterday get big tech companies like Apple, Amazon and Microsoft powering the NASDAQ forward?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS: Yes. On that note Hank, \"The Wall Street Journal\" wrote about this yesterday that the games are more widespread and are driven just necessarily by these tech monopolies if you well is that a positive sign in terms of the breadth of this rally?</p><p>SMITH: No question that it is a broadening out of the market and both offense and defense is participating. You know defense those companies that are hold up very well in a declining economic environment and then offense the more cyclical companies.</p><p>And then you have tech which is both offense and defense which is a remarkable transition from say 20 years ago. But I think it's a very healthy sign that the market is broadening out and it portends I think well for future gains.</p><p>BARTIROMO: John Hilsenrath, what are your thoughts on what's taken place with China? Obviously overnight markets were back and forth 400 point selloff when we first heard Peter Navarro says that, that the deal is over.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SENIOR WRITER: Well, you know I think we're in a new economic Cold War with China and this is an example of it. And you know we're also going to see it on immigration issues in Chinese students coming to America to study.</p><p>And this is something I wanted to ask Hank about. The Trump Administration announced that it would start scaling back H1B visas. Hank, I want to hear your thought about what does that mean for the economy and for growth?</p><p>As an investor I'm sure you're thinking about growth a lot of these tech companies look to H1B visas what's your read on this decision to cut back on visas into the country?</p><p>SMITH: Yes so John, look of the Trump Administration in terms of growth has gotten it right on taxes. It has gotten it right on a regulation and deregulation. But they've got it wrong on trade and they've gotten it wrong on immigration.</p><p>This country needs immigration. We need immigration both with PHDs and we need immigration with blue collared labors. And also our schools and colleges and universities are desperate for foreign students in large part because 95 percent of them plus or minus a full K.</p><p>And so it is a big question this fall as to whether foreign student's in particular Asian students will be able to attend our colleges and universities. And that's going to have a huge financial impact.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hank, is it just about the money then? I mean at the end of the day we've spoken with many Senators who have said that this is a national security issue. The Chinese Communist Party sends in researchers to steal our data and they're doing it right now.</p><p>I mean that was one of the key things I think that Senator Cotton was talking about when said we need to be restricting these visas. And I suspect this is part of what the President's plan is here that I mean there's a reason that at least 7 university professors are workers at universities have been indicted for getting money from the Chinese Communist Party for sending back data. So when does it become a national security issue and not just about the money?</p><p>SMITH: Right. But also Maria and you have a very good point. But also a lot of these foreign students stay in the United States and become very, very productive. Create companies and really add to Silicon Valley. So you know they're always going to be issues and problems.</p><p>But I think net, net immigration is a plus for this country in terms of growth as opposed to a drain on our resources.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll leave it there. Hank Smith so it's a pleasure to see sir. Thanks so much.</p><p>SMITH: Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hank Smith joining us from Haverford. We're just getting started this morning coming up infectious disease expert Dr. Amesh Adalja is here on the Coronavirus surge in Florida, Texas and other states. Are we seeing the beginnings of a second wave?</p><p>Former California Congressman Darrell Issa is here on California's move to expand voting by mail and what Attorney General William Barr told me about the issue? And then in the 7:00 am hour we'll have California Congressman John Garamendi and Florida Congressman Michael Waltz on the 2020 race and the COVID-19 pandemic in their states.</p><p>Plus, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka is here on Facebook's move to allow employers to block the word union eyes on workplace platforms. And tennis pro Andy Roddick got his new Bourbon business we're are to hear that.</p><p>Plus the 8:00 am hour we have Ohio Senator Rob Portman on the government's plan to take on China and Archbishop of New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan on the challenges Catholic schools have been facing during this pandemic. Don't miss a moment of it we've got a big three hours. Quick break and we'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Coronavirus cases are on the rise as states reopen at least 20 states seeing an increase in infections now. In Florida cases are now topping 100,000 in Georgia and in Houston hospitalizations are rising dramatically and in Arizona one in 5 people have now tested positive.</p><p>Joining us right now is Infectious Disease Expert Senior Scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security Dr. Amesh Adalja. Dr. Adalja great to see you, what's behind this jump in new cases in your view is it due to more testing or the reopenings?</p><p>DR. AMESH ADALJA, INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERT: --things we do know that states are doing more testing but if you look at the percentage positivity of tests, that's going up faster than the number of tests are going up.</p><p>So there is spread that's going on in communities that's not really being recognized and that's the important thing is trying to get the case contact investigation scaled up to be able to stop that. Those cases are spilling into the hospital so we do have an issue in some states that many of us are concerned about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are more PR - are more young people testing positive now? I mean are there fears that they could pass it to the elderly given the numbers we're seeing on young people?</p><p>DR. ADALJA: That's definitely the case. We're seeing a skewing where the average age of diagnosed cases is going down and that's because today we do have more tests. So we're testing more mild cases where the younger people tend to cluster and be social out distancing restrictions are lifted.</p><p>The first people that are about to reengage in society tend to be younger and they're getting infected at bars and restaurants. And I think that's a challenge because maybe they won't get sick but they might be a bridge to somebody that could be vulnerable that could end up being hospitalization.</p><p>So we really have to clamp down on those cases by actually identifying them and isolating them and doing contact tracing. So we have to get very aggressive with the case management of this new case we're getting in certain states.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure, really troubling info. Dr. Amesh Adalja good to see you this morning sir, thank you very much.</p><p>DR. ADALJA: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll keep watching that of course. We'll take a break when we come back at the clue that almost took down a President what Attorney General William Barr is saying about the report? Muller investigation as well that's coming up stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back Attorney General Bill Barr confirming to me that the FBI claimed it was a conversation in a wine bar that sparked the probe into Russia collusion. During my sit down, exclusive sit down with the AG this week I spoke to him about the origins of the Russia investigation and the beginnings of the alleged coup to take down President Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: But is there any evidence that in fact it was appropriate to launch an investigation other than a conversation in a bar? I know that George Papadopoulos had a conversation in a bar.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: That is the official version of what happened at that comment in a London wine bar was with the basis really watch for going forward. And I've said that I thought that was a very slender reed to get law enforcement and intelligence agencies involved in investigating the campaign of one's political opponent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Can you tell me at all just mischievous?</p><p>BARR: No, but I'll just say that one of the things it takes time is that Mr. Durham is trying to look at all the various allegations and concerns that have been raised. So he has been looking at things pre July and trying to run those down.</p><p>And so there's a lot to look at. Throughout this whole episode both before and after the election and he's diligently looking at everything.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When did the DOJ start paying informants?</p><p>BARR: I don't know, but it's common practice.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Okay.</p><p>B ARR: A confidential human sources.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I guess because you've been around. I mean you were the AG under George H. W. Bush and you've seen a lot of the same player so Alexander Downer, Mifsud are these regular names that have been working with the intelligence community before?</p><p>BARR: I couldn't I couldn't say anything about that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And he couldn't say anything about that because this is an active criminal investigation taking place right now. So Dagen McDowell now that we know that the FBI is claiming that's the reason that they investigated Donald Trump because of this conversation in a wine bar. Next question becomes was that conversation organic or was that information planted?</p><p>Joseph Mifsud met George Papadopoulos in April of 2016 and told him Russia has Hillary Clinton's email that's what George Papadopoulos said to his informant friend several months later in a wine bar Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the issue is now the clock is ticking on the John Durham investigation with the Presidential Election coming up in a matter of months. And I'll tie it to the firing of the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman for him being told to get the heck out it.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal Editorial page touches on this. That this messy removal of Geoffrey Berman it - Bill Barr loses some political capital here, wasted and it's in the interest of people in the FBI and the Justice Department who push this to launch the investigation into President Trump sold along with some members of the media who sold the phony Steele dossier to the American people and the whole Russia collusion story.</p><p>It's in their interest to focus on Geoffrey Berman's removal because it absolves them of any responsibility of investigating a Presidential Candidate and a President and then selling a lot of the American people. So it's exceedingly complicated right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's really extraordinary to me that more people are not outraged by what has taken place in 2016? Jon Hilsenrath we've spoken about this. You would think that people would not want to see the powers that these people in powerful positions put their finger on the scale but that is exactly what took place in 2016 and we will learn more about the activity before July 2016 that's when the FBI said the start of the investigation but we know there was a lot of activity informants as early as March and April of 16 that same year?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, and Maria I think you're right. And I think Dagen put her finger on it. You know we talk about the fog of war. I think for the next 4 or 5 months we're going to be seeing the fog of political war fair where both sides are throwing out all kinds of accusations and versions of events of what happened in 2016?</p><p>But also what's going on right now we know there's all this fighting about mail in ballots. I think for you know most Americans watching it it's going to be hard, very hard to make sense of it all.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're going to talk about the mail and ballots coming up. Also coming up Americans headed to the ballot box that debate the potential risks over mail in voting ballots and what the Attorney General told me about that? Stay with us for we're going to talk about that. Then dinosaurs dominate again Jurassic Park another classic blockbusters making noise about and big bucks at the Box Office. We're going to take a look. Stay with us.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS HOST, MORNINGS WITH MARIA: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, June 23rd.</p><p>Let's take a look at where the markets are right now, 6:31 a.m. on the East coast. Futures are back in green this morning after plunging better than 400 points overnight. This, as Trade and Manufacturing Policy Director Peter Navarro appeared to say the China trade deal was over in an interview with Martha MacCallum last night. President Trump and Navarra quickly confirmed phase one was still on, after markets reacted immediately. In the end, markets finished up yesterday, even as the cases of coronavirus spike in several states. The NASDAQ seeing its 20th record close in 2020, as you see yesterday the Dow Industrials were up 153, and this morning futures show a gain of almost 300 points.</p><p>European markets, meanwhile, also seeing uptick this morning. EU officials are warning China during Monday's virtual summit, it could possibly cut ties if there is no sign of opening up the Chinese economy to European countries. All the major indices overseas higher in Europe. The DAX Index in Germany up 2 1/2 percent right now.</p><p>In Asia, meanwhile, green across the board there as well. Japan signaling it will keep to its plans to gaining surplus by 2025 despite massive spending on the COVID-19 crisis. The Nikkei Average up 1/2 of one percent.</p><p>Meanwhile, the European Union taking a harder line on trade with China, Cheryl Casone now with more details on that story. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: That is right Maria. Good morning, some strong words from top European officials to China. They are warning Beijing to honor its promise to open its economy or risk damage to the relationship between the two groups. The EU wants greater access to China's market, particularly in the auto, telecommunications, and biotech sectors as the block looks to rebalance trade and investment ties with that country. Trade volumes reach $1.67 billion at daily, and EU officials say this is an unbalanced trade and investment relationship. The virtual summit, by the way, was held as the EU is accusing China of spreading disinformation about how Europe handled the COVID-19 crisis, and also, they have issues with China's grip on Hong Kong.</p><p>Well, an incredible show of support for Nascar driver Bubba Wallace after a noose was discovered in the Alabama racetrack driver's garage. Drivers, pit crews and others escorted Wallace's number 43 car onto the track at Talladega Super Speedway yesterday, just one day after that incident. Meanwhile, the FBI and Justice Department officials are both investigating. Nascar said just a small number of racing personnel had access to that garage. Nascar's President says if the person responsible is found, they will banned for life from the sport. Investigators are looking at camera footage in that garage, and who could have had access to that area.</p><p>And finally, here is a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Ben &amp; Jerry's says it's considering boycotting advertising on Facebook platforms until further action is taken to address racism and social reform. The coronavirus pandemic pushing more than five million shoppers aged 45 and older to buy online. Before the pandemic that age group only made up about five percent of online shopping. And, if and when the market crashes again, if and when, Motley Fool names three stocks you shouldn't have in your portfolio, Aurora Cannabis, Kohl's, and Tesla. Those are your headlines Maria from the newsroom. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alright, Cheryl, thank you. Meanwhile, fighting voter fraud is on the front burner now. A bitter debate unfolding over mail-in voting. Advocates for voting by mail argue it will keep voters safe and socially distant amid the pandemic. But critics say it opens the door to ballet tampering. Over the weekend I spoke with US Attorney General William Barr who outlined the threats posed by mail-in ballots.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, there's a big discussion right now about mail-in voting.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: Yeah.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hillary Clinton said it's fine. It's fair.</p><p>BARR: Well it absolutely opens the flood gates to fraud. Those things are delivered in the mailboxes. They can be taken out. There's questions about whether or not it even denies a secret ballot, because a lot of the states have you signing the outside of the envelope, so the purpose, open this envelope, person who opens the envelope will know how people voted. There's no, right now, a foreign country could print up tens of thousands of counterfeit ballots and be very hard for us to detect, which was the right, and which was the wrong ballet. So, I think it can upset and undercut the confidence in the integrity of our elections. If anything, we should tighten them up right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: My next guest has filed a lawsuit against California Governor Gavin Newsom to block the state from expanding mail-in voting. Joining me right now is former California Congressman, and now Congressional Candidate himself, Darrell Issa, and Congressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thank you so much for being here.</p><p>DARRELL ISSA (R-CA) FORMER CONGRESSMAN, CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Well, thank you Maria. And, you know, with a history in California of excess voters on the rolls, California is particularly shameful in the Governor sending out five million unasked for absentee ballots, or at least he plans to. You know, in Los Angeles alone, when they were sued and challenged on never cleaning up their rolls, they had over one million voters that had to be removed, because of course, they didn't really exist.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, where do we stand right now? Because I know that, you just heard the AG and what he said, that it opens the flood gates of fraud. You know, foreign governments can be printing ballots and we will not even, they could print thousands and thousands of ballots and we will not even know what's the real thing and what's just fake from foreign governments trying to meddle in our election. Where do we stand now on mail-in ballots? On a federal level.</p><p>ISSA: Well, I'm afraid that--</p><p>BARTIROMO: Going into the election.</p><p>ISSA: I'm afraid it's Gavin Newsom and the Democrats that are going to be printing those fake ballots. They're not cleaning up the voter rolls. They intent to send those five million excess, unasked for, many of these people have never voted, they were just registered through motor voter. They intend to send them out, but they're doing worse than that, they've just passed a bill, it's on the Governor's desk that actually allows for voting for 17 days after the election. 30 days before, nearly 30 before the election, you can begin voting, but they're allowing for 17 days afterwards, basically to find out how many votes are needed and go get them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. That is unbelievable. So, can the administration do anything about this?</p><p>ISSA: Well, there's a real question about whether or not those 17 days will, in fact, create an invalidity. Prior to this time, you had to be postmarked by election day. You could be received afterwards, but you had to have an outside government agency. But with voter harvesting in California, basically, union thugs will go and get these things, maybe for weeks after the election, and questionably where they get them from, because they're going to be mailed to dorm rooms where the students aren't there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>ISSA: There's going to be several million ballots just sitting around waiting to be filled out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's unbelievable. We'll keep watching. This is such an important subject going into the election. But I want to turn to the other election meddling that we're talking about this morning. And that is the Russia probe. During my interview with AG Barr, I asked him about accountability for elected officials. You were there as an oversight chairman. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Adam Schiff is an elected official, the Chairman of the Intel Committee. When these guys speak, you stop and listen. Adam Schiff said multiple times that there was collusion in plain sight. Is it no accountability for an elected official, someone that the public obviously trusts, just by their resume, to say one thing in a closed door situation when your under oath, like so many in the Obama administration said, we have no evidence of collusion. But then they went out on television, and they said the complete opposite. They said, collusion is in plain sight. That's a quote from Adam Schiff.</p><p>BARR: Well, as far as public comments like these people have been making in press conference and on television and so forth, yeah, the accountability is really elections for Schiff. You know, that's why we have elections. If the people of his district want him to continue to behave as he has, then they can send him back to office. It is infuriating and it's the same phenomenon I discussed with the media, which is the media mislead the American people grossly over a long period of time with exaggerated claims and misinformation. And they haven't been held accountable and the same for a lot of these talking heads.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ISSA: Well, there's abso--</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about that, Congressman?</p><p>ISSA: You know, unfortunately we don't hold people who lie under oath in front of Congress accountable and, to be honest, Adam, who came into Congress, we came in together in 2001, his history was that he was for law and order, and the rule of law, and not impeaching people without a good reason. He's done a 180 and his willingness to flat lie and then stand by that lie even when its proven to be wrong is very disappointing. He is, by the way, in a very safe Democratic seat, and perhaps that's the reason that he can be Nancy Pelosi's right arm on these kinds of, in this case, part of an attempted coup of the President.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, shouldn't it be that there's accountability here for three years he said there was collusion in plain sight. He mislead the American people. We know now there was no collusion after spending $40 millions dollars plus on the Mueller report. After three years of the country being in hysteria over this. Where's the accountability? Is anybody going to ask him where's the plain sight?</p><p>ISSA: Well there's no question at all, if you're an independent voter in his district you've got to be angry as can be that you've been misled. And so even if you would tend to vote for a Democrat, it's a great time to vote for his opponent and send a strong message that there is a point at which politicians have to be held accountable. It's one thing to say one thing and do another. It's another thing to outright lie about classified information that the American people will never see in most cases, and as a result, mislead them in to believing and losing confidence in their government. This is shameful. He should apologize. He certainly should be defeated in the ballot box, but I'll tell you, it's going to take a lot of independent voters in his district to do it. And I hope they will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alright, Darrell Issa, great to talk with you this morning. Thank you, sir. We will keep watching all of these developments, particularly that mail-in voting situation.</p><p>ISSA: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Coming up, keeping Americans employed. One company doing its part during the COVID-19 pandemic, even expanding. Taking on workers. Then this, T-Rex back on top. Jurassic Park among the classic blockbusters dominating the box office. How much their pulling, coming up right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Bringing America together by keeping American's employed. IT service management company Insight Global, not laying off a single employee during the pandemic, while creating new jobs as part of its response. Joining me right now is Insight Global CEO Bert Bean. Bert, it's great to have you. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>BERT BEAN, CEO, INSIGHT GLOBAL: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to get into IT spending, and what you're seeing, but first, how were you able to do this?</p><p>BEAN: Well, you know, it's, we value our culture tremendously here and we believe that culture drives engagement, and then engagement drives better business results. And so, we just really tried to stick to our guns to not do any layoffs, and to not do any furloughs and by doing so we're able to keep the trust of our people, which allows us to continue to produce strong results.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, I've got to ask you about the CapEx cycle and where you see it right now in terms of companies investing in IT, etc. I'm looking at a Cornerstone Macro report, Nancy Lazar, who's a frequent guest here, says the pieces are falling into place for a renewed CapEx cycle lead by technology. US onshoring is picking up, the COVID-19 economy demands more investment to adapt, from retailers to banks to manufacturers. What are you seeing in that regard?</p><p>BEAN: Well, I tell you what, April and May were certainly dark. Those were low, but we are seeing green shoots. We are starting to see more new openings come every single week in our company. And we are starting to see a lot more spend out there, if you go look for it, and that's been one of the things that we've been driving internally, is trying to find ways to even reinvent ourselves a little bit to go find more spend wherever that may be. And one of the things that we did during this pandemic was we actually launched an insight global healthcare staffing division. And just since March 12th we've actually been able to put 3,000 healthcare workers back to work. So, you know, this business is certainly starting to come back. I wouldn't say it's rolling back in, but we are optimists about the signs that we're seeing in the broader economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, I'm glad you mentioned the campaign, Be the Light, I want to hear more about it, but Lazar writes that the second quarter real CapEx likely plunge 30 percent, that's the second quarter, these those months that you're referring to that were really bad. But she says the new information is it will probably rebound 10 percent in the third quarter, followed by a sustained expansion in 2021. She's looking at eight percent growth for next year, so CapEx up in the third quarter and up in 2021. Do you believe that to be true?</p><p>BEAN: We do believe that to be true. You know, it was a great economy before this, and look, I mean, things like IT are mission critical departments and they, people still to protect their data. People still need to run their businesses, and while this has not been fun three months and while I think we're not quite out of the woods yet, we refer to this time as the long middle that we think we're still in. We do think the Q3 will be strong. Q4 will be stronger and we're very optimistic about 2021.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alright, we will leave it there. Bert, it's great to talk with you this morning. Thanks very much.</p><p>BEAN: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks for that campaign, Be the Light. Bert Bean joining us there. Quick break, and then ahead is back to Jurassic Park.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The most phenomenal discovery of our time. How'd you do this? Becomes the greatest adventure of all time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh yeah. The summer classic roars back into theaters. What's behind the comeback? Right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Breaking news this morning, Reuters is reporting that Sanofi is expecting to get approval for its potential coronavirus vaccine that it is developing with GlaxoSmithKline by the first half of next year. Now in April, the company said the vaccine would be available in the second half of 2021, so this is certainly more promising news there from Sanofi this morning.</p><p>Time for the morning buzz, first up, not without my pickup truck. A new study from Ford shows American truck drivers are willing to give up some of life's luxuries before they give up their pickups. They include streaming services, alcohol, coffee, their phones, meat, even intimacy. Dagen, do you have pickup truck? I need some confirmation on all of this, because I'm not buying all of this. You're going to give all this stuff up for the pickup. What do you think?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: I'm not either, and I got my driver's license in a Ford F-150 and drove a full sized Bronco which is essentially a pickup truck for years and years and years. If you, 82 percent of the truck owners in this survey would rather give up streaming services, but the intimacy, the sex part, that fell to 38 percent of respondents, said they would give us sex to keep they're truck. I suspect its much lower than that. A lot of people would rather hang onto the intimacy and drive a lawnmower.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'd say. Next up, devouring some classic films, Director Stephen Spielberg's iconic Jurassic Park hitting it big again. This time at Drive In theaters. The film pulling in $517,000 dollars in one weekend at more than 230 nationwide locations. Another Spielberg hit, Jaws, earned $516,000 over a weekend. Jon, you've seen both.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, SENIOR WRITER, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: I sure have, and you know, at drive in theatres watching Jaws, I think I've got to go find my mom's old Ford Country Squire station wagon with no seat belts and back that up into a drive in theater watch in from that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I sort of like this whole drive in idea. I've never been to a drive in, I would like to check it out. Alright, finally this.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I spent my summers in drive in theaters.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The happiest place on earth is still on pause, unfortunately, as Disneyland hopes to reopen on July 9th. The Coalition of Resort Labor Unions pushing back on the plan. Many workers say they still do no feel there's enough time to make employees and guests feel safe in the park. Mattie, would you go?</p><p>MATTIE DUPPLER, SENIOR FELLOW, THE NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION: Well, Maria, this is the challenge with the lack of leadership at the state level with the reopening in the state. There needs to be clear guidance, so consumers and workers feel protected and safe. Congress needs to step in here too with the next round of coronavirus relief or support, but really clarifying what it is that the rules are going to be in these states as they reopen. Particularly with large arenas, like something like Disneyland.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alright, we will take a break. President Trump just Tweeting on prosecuting people vandalizing monuments. Here's what the President just wrote. He writes this, I have authorized the Federal Government to arrest anyone who vandalizes or destroys any monument, statue or other such Federal property in the United States with up to 10 years in prison per the Veterans and Memorial Preservation Act, or such other laws that may be pertinent. This action is taking effective immediately but may also be used retroactively for destruction of vandalism already caused. There will be no exceptions. Do you think this is going to stop the vandalism of our monuments across the country? Ten years in prison. We're going to talk about it. More Mornings with Maria when we come right back. Stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020062301cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:606F-DN91-JB20-G527-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6879\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 23, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001XZ0</classCode><className>A G BARR PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS312111 SOFT DRINK MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC2086 BOTTLED &amp; CANNED SOFT DRINKS &amp; CARBONATED WATER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>BAG (LSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>White House</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Coronavirus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trump Administration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>President Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>COVID-19</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DOW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Futures</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NASDAQ</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republicans</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>New York City</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>GDP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Capitol Hill</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>GOP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Former President George W.

As of this moment, no unemployed person in America is getting anything above their state's share in weekly checks. After governors pushed back strongly[1] on Trump's executive measure, which would have had them pony up 25 percent of a $400 unemployment boost (California[2], Kentucky[3], New Jersey[4], and really everybody; this map[5] lists the states that have spoken publicly on it), the White House acknowledged that the state share will not be required[6], and unemployed workers will just get $300. This appears to be illegal under the statutory authority they're using to do this unilaterally, which requires a 25 percent match. But since when has the law been relevant?</p><p>When anyone will get even that $300 is an open question, as it will take significant reprogramming of state unemployment systems. Meanwhile, I haven't heard a single company say they'll actually stop withholding payroll taxes to give workers a temporary, ephemeral 6.2 percent pay boost. So for the foreseeable future, the economic impact of the Trump unilateral actions is nothing.There is increasingly no hope of actual talks to create a Congressional package. Claims from both sides[7] that they're 'open[8]' to talks haven't led any to happen, the chief of staff and chief enforcer[9] in deal negotiations Mark Meadows has left town for a week, and the House is out of town[10] until September 14. Every expectation is that nothing will happen[11] until at least then, and I think it could be longer. You have Republicans who've found their inner deficit hawk cheerleading failure[12], and in general there's nothing compelling bringing them to the table, after the corporate bailout was set in motion in March.Read all of our Unsanitized reports[13]In the meantime, we can expect the economy to deteriorate, potentially rapidly. More rent payments are getting put on credit cards[14], a sign of financial stress. People are liquidating 401(k) plans[15] for ready cash. Food pantries are seeing record demand[16]. The evictions have begun[17]. People are saving in expectation of an extended recession, creating the vicious cycle that leads to recession-induced job loss, not just pandemic-related layoffs. State and local budget crunches[18] (5.6 percent annualized spending cuts last quarter, with more to come) are just going to compound this pain, and the federal government has pulled out all the supports for the economy. This situation is dire.What can be done about it? How can depression be prevented through a fiscal deal?The answer, in my estimation, lies in suing every corporation in sight.There are only a couple ways to get Republicans, who have little interest in further relief on its own, to the table to make a deal. One would be a collapse of the stock market. But it's approaching an all-time high[19], and whatever stumble came at the end of yesterday's session after fears of an impasse on fiscal relief have subsided by today, as stocks are up[20]. As long as the Fed keeps vowing to inflate assets, and as long as the companies dominating the Dow\u2014Big Tech, essentially\u2014keep expanding their market position, there's little reason for investors to worry.

Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT[21]Even if the market does deteriorate as the reality of the next depression hits, by that time we'll be in the undertow of an economic collapse. This is not what you want to wait for to get Republicans to think seriously about a fiscal response. So hoping stocks go under is not a realistic option.The only other thing that has roused Republicans in recent weeks is this idea that corporations will be endlessly sued by workers and customers over contracting COVID-19, and that we need a mass liability release to protect them. The problem is that there is no flood of lawsuits[22] at the moment, relieving the pressure for this. But let's do a thought experiment here. What if every trial lawyer in America started streaming into courts with wrongful death and injury lawsuits? What if every corporation in America suddenly had to deal with liability on a mass scale? What if the suits sought to make CEOs personally liable for this activity?Maybe the courts are so in hock to corporate interests that this wouldn't cause much concern either. But I'd gather that more lobbyists would be in the ear of Republicans to get to bargaining if there were thousands of lawsuits hanging over them, compared to now, when almost no suits have been filed.Sure, what would result would be distasteful: Republicans would eagerly seek immunity for corporations' role in the deaths of thousands of people. But this depression will also kill thousands of people. And what's standing in the way of that right now is a lack of interest on the part of Republicans to do anything about it. The immunity can be written far more narrowly than Mitch McConnell's opening bid, which pretty much would have put medical malpractice cases on ice for five years. But at least if immunity were on the table, there might actually be a negotiation.This modest proposal reverses the terrible mistake Democrats made in not getting long-lasting relief the last time there was something Republicans wanted. That's going to come at a high cost.Unfortunately, liberals aren't the well-organized machine of conservative fever dreams. There is no Bat-signal to the trial lawyers to start ramping up cases. But that's what I think it'll take for there to be any interest in an actual bargain. It's sad, of course. But it's also necessary. Odds and Sods Some Monopolized[23] news: I was on BNN Bloomberg (the Canadian version of the business network) discussing the book. Watch here[24]. I also was on the LitHub podcast with Andrew Keen for a long discussion. Listen here[25].WHYY's Radio Times had me on yesterday to discuss the Big Tech hearings. Listen here[26].And at about 8:30 of this 'Closer Look' segment on Late Night with Seth Meyers, you can see a clip from me talking about the post office. Watch here[27].I'm deliberately not linking to a New York Times story that blatantly rips off The Capitol Forum and us, in telling the story about the Postal Service seeking[28] to force higher postage rates[29] from states to deliver mail-in ballots[30] without crediting the originators (see the links) who told the story. This is depressingly common and an extension of many of the themes in Monopolized, with big incumbents muscling out competition by just copying them. The Times' building facilities department is probably bigger that our staff and the Capitol Forum's combined. They have every ability to get their own stories. And if they don't, one line of credit saying where it originated from is literally the least they can do. It's shameful and designed to undermine media diversity, as in 'nobody should exist but the New York Times.' So get your Times coverage elsewhere from now on.

The USPS put out a denial and everything, calling it a 'baseless assertion without merit, and frivolous.' But it was carefully worded, calling only the idea that the postal service would raise rates in order to restrict voting by mail meritless, and that 'if public policy makers choose to utilize the mail as part of their election system' the agency would stand ready.A letter unearthed yesterday[2] reveals how the USPS might be influencing that decision. This letter, sent to Kim Wyman, Secretary of State of the vote-by-mail state of Washington, addressed how 'certain deadlines concerning mail-in ballots may be incongruous with the Postal Service's delivery standards.' </p><p>Specifically, it notes that states can use either marketing mail or first-class mail to get their ballots to voters, but that first-class mail would get them there significantly faster.'The Postal Service recommends that election officials use First Class Mail to transmit blank ballots and allow 1 week for delivery to voters,' the letter reads. 'Using Marketing Mail will result in slower delivery times and will increase the risk that voters will not receive their ballots in time to return them by mail.'Note that a previous letter to election officials, referenced in this one, went out May 29, before Trump donor Louis DeJoy was installed as Postmaster General, and then this one, dated July 31, went out after he was in place.Read all of our Unsanitized reports[3]There is definitely a way to read this letter as the Postal Service helpfully reminding election officials of key dates and timelines for delivery, so they can get ballots printed and out to voters in a reasonable timeframe. Indeed, the rest of the letter is specific to Washington, states that ballots are usually mailed out with enough advance time, and expresses concern mainly for voters who update their voter registration after the mailing date. States may be setting unrealistic goals with their own systems on what can be done with mail-in voting.But all that would divorce this letter from the context of prior reporting that the Postal Service really wants states to pay the increased rate, and that states and cities are increasingly cash-strapped. It would also divorce it from the reality that mail is slowing down[4] and backlogs are seen everywhere. (DeJoy has denied the slowdowns[5], and any ulterior motive about the election.)It's hard to believe that this is about money. Let's say that every single registered voter in the United States\u2014153 million[6] as of 2018\u2014gets a ballot mailed to them. (They won't, but for the sake of argument let's say that.) The net increase from 20 cents to 55 cents is a total of $53.55 million. That level 'is not going to help the postal service appreciably,' said Rick Hasen, election law professor at UC-Irvine; it's a tiny portion of their overall revenue.

Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT[7]It may create enough of an excuse, however, to have local election officials decide not to mail ballots at all, citing the increased cost. That appears to be the play here, to put states and cities in the position to create their own hurdles for voters.Marc Elias, the Democrats' top election lawyer, called the letter[8] 'an early warning that USPS has abdicated its responsibility to facilitate a free and fair election.' He said that states now face a 'logistical and financial crisis' in preventing mass disenfranchisement, and cited examples from previous primary elections of thousands of ballots being left uncounted.Meanwhile, the Capitol Forum has a follow-up, revealing documents where career staff warn that raising the price of ballot delivery would violate the National Voter Registration Act or the Voting Rights Act. The documents also show that USPS top brass saw this as an opportunity to raise revenue (as noted above, this isn't that true, so it's probably a fig leaf for regulatory purposes) and that the initiative was designated a 'high priority' by leadership.Raising the ballot cost would be almost impossible to do statutorily at this point, given that it would require regulatory action and need to survive a lawsuit. But the letter shows an alternative route: darkly warn that ballots won't get to voters in time unless states pay more. And if states use that to change their systems and place burdens on voters to get a ballot, that's just the way it goes. Odds and Sods Here are my segments from Democracy Now[9] yesterday.

Despite being one of the least competitive (and least popular) industries in America, the administration has taken a hatchet to telecom consumer protections, often using bogus data[1] and fraud[2] to do it. Massive, competition and job-eroding mergers are rubber stamped before the administration even sees the data[3]. Any pretense at meaningful oversight is theater. A new report by the American Antitrust Institute[4] suggests that despite the administration's rhetoric around \"big tech,\" its apathy to monopolies is fairly uniform. Experts have noted for a decade than US antitrust enforcement has grown toothless and frail[5], and our definitions of monopoly power need updating in the Amazon era[6]. Antitrust enforcement had already waned under the Obama administration, getting severely worse once Trump came to power:\"Despite its anti-corporate concentration rhetoric on the campaign trail, key metrics of cartel and merger enforcement have declined since the Trump administration took over. </p><p>And in 2017 and 2018, the DOJ did not open one monopolization investigation, the longest span of inattention to dominant firms in the last 50 years.\"That's not particularly surprising for those who watched the head of the Trump DOJ antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, not only ignore the input of his staff[7] and approve T-Mobile's competition eroding $26 billion merger with Sprint, but personally helped usher the deal through the process[8] via his personal phone and email accounts. The report notes that cartel investigations, fines, and the amount of fines levied are down overall as well, with the number of corporations fined by the Trump agencies in 2017 and 2018 falling by about 45% compared to the Obama administration. This sort of corruption isn't new, and it's certainly bipartisan. Trump's just exponentially worse at disguising feckless obedience to profit and corporate power as a more elaborate ethos. For years, America routinely embraced mindless \"deregulation\" of broken markets like telecom under the belief that antitrust enforcement would come in and maintain some semblance of proper balance. That is, again unsurprisingly, proving to be total fantasy in practice:\"As markets have changed over time, deregulation garnered broad support through bipartisan efforts intended to remove regulatory barriers that were thought to impede competition more than their benefits could justify. This was based, however, on the assumption that lost government oversight would become unnecessary due to active antitrust enforcement. Conservative administrations have often deregulated without concern for whether antitrust enforcement or competition policy would effectively fill the gap.\"When the administration does act, it often acts for the wrong reasons, as seen with the short-lived \"antitrust investigation[9]\" into the auto industry for adhering to pollution standards. Or the administration's lawsuit to stop the AT&amp;TTime Warner deal, which had less to do with protecting markets and consumers, and more to do with making Rupert Murdoch happy[10] and getting revenge on CNN for critical coverage[11] of his bumbling and corrupt administration. Throughout all of this, somehow, many policy folks and tech reporters still somehow take Trump's rhetoric about reining in \"big tech\" monopolies seriously. The DOJ's announcement of \"investigations\" into everyone from Google to Apple are treated with deadpan seriousness by a press and policy ecosystem that doesn't seem to learn from experience. Some Economists advise we perhaps should stop doing that, since there's zero indication the administration takes Section 2 of the Sherman Act seriously, and there's very little indication any of these investigations will result in substantive action: Tech reporters breathlessly reporting on the DOJ's imminent case against the tech platforms need to take a chill pill. Ain't gonna happen under this administration. They don't believe in section 2. pic.twitter.com/P3O9m3O1WQ[12] \u2014 Hal Singer (@HalSinger) April 14, 2020[13]More often than not, such investigations are being used more for leverage on other issues (see: Barr's war on encryption, or more positive coverage and ranking). Because in reality, Trump cares about three things: attention, power, and personal enrichment. It's not clear how much more idiotic theater we need to witness before policy experts and tech reporters understand that, and stop treating egomania, grift, and corruption as \"very serious policy.\"Permalink[14] | Comments[15] | Email This Story[16] [ 1]: <url

He is unconcerned about Google's announcement that it may offer a consumer checking account. But he is a little nervous about how comfortable clients have become with an array of digital financial tools, and what that might mean for his livelihood.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I would not be shocked if Google offers more planning,\" says Balcom, the founder of 1650 Wealth Management, an RIA in Lauderdale-by-the Sea, Florida.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For many advisors, though, it's not if, but when.</p><p>Even now, technology allows firms to seamlessly partner with broker-dealers or independent advisors to offer managed investment accounts, lending products, checking accounts and retirement vehicles. At the same time, other barriers between traditional financial services and wealth management are breaking down.</p><p>Apple, for instance, launched its credit card in March. In November, Google said it would look to partner with Citigroup to offer checking accounts sometime this year. While the firms may use the accounts to collect client data and peek more deeply into customers' behavior, they are also seen as taking big steps toward the traditional purview of wealth management.</p><p>\"It's obvious from where I sit that big tech will want to make the jump,\" says Jud Mackrill, chief marketing officer at Carson Group. \"A managed account solution is going to come along with one of these product launches.\"</p><p>These latest offerings are an unwelcome reminder of an ever-present question on the minds of wealth managers: Will the FAANG companies - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google - as well as other big tech companies make a land grab of services historically provided by financial services? If so, at what cost to traditional RIAs?</p><p>\"Potentially, if Google got cleared to conduct a brokerage business, they could move in any direction they want,\" says Greg O'Gara, a senior research analyst at Aite Group.</p><p>\"Essentially, nothing is going to stop the democratization of investing through technology, and once one of these [tech companies] makes an imprint on the broker-dealer landscape, the growth prospects are very, very good,\" he adds.</p><p>Google's entry into finance can be traced, in part, to recent efforts by fintechs to evolve beyond investing and advice. And, just as those partnerships have rapidly grown, there is little to prevent the search engine giant from teaming up with a broker to launch a wealth management pilot.</p><p>\"We're exploring how we can partner with banks and credit unions in the U.S. to offer smart checking accounts through Google Pay,\" says Google spokesman Craig Ewer. In the United States, more than 2,000 banks already offer card transactions via Google Pay, Ewer says.</p><p>Last year, a host of digital wealth managers served up a buffet of new financial services options including banking and lending.</p><p>Betterment and many of its competitors added cash products with annual percentage yields sometimes as much as 2% more than traditional accounts at incumbent banks. (The yields depend heavily on prevailing interest rates.</p><p>Wealthfront advertised its account as the highest-yielding in the market when it announced in early 2019, and says that it attracted $1 billion in assets as a result.</p><p>The most successful may be from micro-savings app Acorns, which was one of the first to tack on additional services and now boasts checking, debit cards and retirement savings vehicles with 6.2 million accounts and $1.7 billion in AUM, according to the firm. Its retirement product, Acorns Later, built up 170,000 accounts in its first two months, according to Acorns CEO Noah Kerner.</p><p>The business strategy of partnering with financial institutions has essentially been mapped by smaller fintechs and has proved successful. Google is now emulating that model to launch its checking account slated to pilot this year. The question may now become not whether tech giants will enter wealth management - but what can possibly stop them?</p><p>Carson Wealth Management became one of the first big advisory firms to offer checking accounts to its clients last May.</p><p>Through its partnership with the digital banking provider Galileo, Carson's RIA clients have access to a Mastercard-branded debit card, online bill paying, direct deposit options and the ability to use tens of thousands of ATMs, according to the firm.</p><p>\"We view Amazon as the competition,\" Ron Carson, CEO of Carson Group, told Financial Planning after Apple announced its credit card launch in March. \"Whenever they decide to get directly into our business, we have to be prepared. They haven't yet because there is just so much low-hanging fruit. But they are coming.\"</p><p>Too big to succeed?</p><p>Ominously for independents, a majority of investors who are considering switching financial services providers said they would think about banking with tech companies such as Facebook, Google or Amazon if they could, according to a recent survey by MX, a digital banking technology provider.</p><p>Almost 60% of the survey respondents said they would consider depositing a paycheck with a major technology company.</p><p>\"Cash is a very easy commodity to generate income on, and once you attract clients, you can cross-sell anything,\" O'Gara says.</p><p>\"There really is not much that would stop them from building out a broader investment platform. With the right regulatory oversight, nothing is stopping them,\" he adds.</p><p>It's not a foregone conclusion, however. Google had a similar product, Google Compare, that compared different financial products for consumers, which potentially could have shifted into robo advice. It was shuttered in 2016. \"Google has a bit of attention deficit\" disorder, Mackrill says. \"They'll try something new and have no problem killing it.\"</p><p>The fintech partnerships have one important advantage: the ability to leapfrog regulatory hurdles. Many RIAs cite regulation as a top barrier preventing FAANGs from entering wealth management.</p><p>\"The team at Google Pay has been working for years to help make money simple and accessible for our users, in close partnership with banks, credit unions, and the existing regulatory and financial systems,\" the Google spokesman says. \"We believe our partners' regulatory and financial know-how is a great complement to our experience in building helpful tools and technology for our users.\"</p><p>What about robos?</p><p>What's stopping Google from offering an off-the-shelf retirement product? The answer is, not much.</p><p>\"If I were a robo advisor, I would certainly be worried,\" says 1650 Wealth Management's Balcom. \"Amazon is probably not far behind.\"</p><p>However, the robo advice industry is also a crowded soup of new entrants, and the initial results haven't been as promising as some had hoped.</p><p>Major competitors like Schwab and Vanguard have their own megalithic robo platforms, and many of the FAANG companies may hesitate to enter a highly regulated market with entrenched competitors, says Eric Walters, founder of SilverCrest Wealth Planning, an RIA located in Greenwood Village, Colorado.</p><p>Another reason that a move by Google into wealth management may not be imminent is the current economics of the digital financial advice space, which are tough, given high customer acquisition costs and increased pricing pressure as the industry shifts to zero commissions in trading.</p><p>\"They would rather leverage their ubiquity, control of consumer data and iconic cultural status to facilitate the flow of money - including via partners like Citigroup - to the extent they become irreplaceable components of the financial services ecosystem,\" says Will Trout, a senior analyst at Celent.</p><p>Even if advisors don't expect to face direct competition for clients from big technology firms, one could well offer a new platform, like a wealth management integration, that RIAs might then adopt, says Linda Erickson, founder of Erickson Advisors, an RIA in Greensboro, North Carolina.</p><p>\"I can't see [big tech firms] replacing my money management skills,\" Erickson says. \"Where money management is a commodity - not personalized - maybe they will develop a better approach than robo advisors. I doubt client relationships will be entirely replaced by artificial intelligence.\"</p><p>Still, automated advice continues to defy the industry's initial growth expectations. Assets under robos are expected to grow to over $1.26 trillion by 2023, according to a study by Aite Group.</p><p>In fact, robo advice was listed as one of the top technologies that would change wealth management in the course of the next three years, according to Financial Planning's latest annual Tech Survey. Robos beat out other high-profile technologies like artificial intelligence and advanced risk profiling.</p><p>Resistance is unwise</p><p>Whether or not Google ends up getting into the wealth management game, there are tangible steps RIAs can take to mitigate the potential risks.</p><p>The first is to find additional value beyond what a FAANG robo advisor would provide clients.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, advisors shouldn't be focused on the tech companies coming in,\" Mackrill says. \"They should be focused on what they can actually control.\"</p><p>Advisors will need to provide value to their clients through comprehensive financial planning or a unique investment strategy that is not available through automated platforms, Mackrill says.</p><p>Some good places to start include adding tax services, financial planning or estate planning.</p><p>Ultimately, the human element will be the advisor's secret weapon.</p><p>\"The future of advice looks a lot more like therapy than anything else,\" Mackrill says.</p><p>RIAs will have to open their eyes to the potential risks from tech disruptors, because ultimately technological transformation will happen, he says. It might not be the FAANGs that come into the advice marketplace, but they represent a larger ideology. Change is coming - and RIAs have traditionally been resistant to change.</p><p>\"It's certainly a growing problem,\" Mackrill says. \"And looming larger by the day.\"</p><p>Sean Allocca is an associate editor of Financial Planning.

nitf:lede=\"true\">The UN human rights chief urged Facebook Wednesday to more proactively address hate speech but warned against excessive regulation, after US President Donald Trump accused tech giants' platforms of bias against him.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein's appeal follows a decision by Facebook this week to ban Myanmar's army chief and other top military brass named in a UN probe linking them to a possible \"genocide\" against Rohingya Muslims.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The social media network is the prime source of news and information for many in the country, but has also been a platform for the army and Buddhist hardliners to spread hate speech against the Rohingya and other minorities.</p><p>The site aired support for the military's bloody \"clearance operations\" last year that forced some 700,000 Rohingya over the border into Bangladesh.</p><p>\"We felt early on very uncomfortable with what we were seeing in Myanmar, (but) in the early meetings that we had with Facebook, I didn't think they were taking it seriously,\" said Zeid, who is due to step down from his post as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights at the end of the week.</p><p>\"Hopefully they've now awoken,\" he told reporters in Geneva, warning that there could easily be other cases \"where Facebook is the dominant medium in a country where you see a deterioration of human rights conditions and then their role would be brought into question.\"</p><p>He cautioned that the company should be \"careful\", since it risked being subpoenaed in possible future trials \"of those accused of the worst crimes.\"</p><p>- 'Accessory' -</p><p>\"We've seen from the jurisprudence of the past that if you've enabled, you've abetted, you've been an accessory,\" Zeid said, stressing that while he was not accusing Facebook of that, \"they have to be sure that they know where they are and what side of the law they are on.\"</p><p>The Jordanian national, who is set to be succeeded by former Chilean president Michelle Bachelet, urged Facebook to not wait until a full-blown crisis erupts to act against hate speech.</p><p>\"They should be thinking proactively about what steps they will take to mitigate that,\" he said.</p><p>Zeid meanwhile warned of going too far in the opposite direction, cautioning that \"there is also another danger (of being) overregulated.\"</p><p>He pointed to recent comments by the US president, who has accused big tech firms like Facebook, Google and Twitter of bias against him, slamming what he called \"rigged\" internet search results.</p><p>Trump offered no details on what if any actions he might take, but a top White House aide suggested the administration may look at some type of regulation in response to the president's complaints.</p><p>Zeid insisted that instead of more government regulations, the platforms' actions must \"be regulated by (international) human rights law.\"</p><p>- 'Dangerous' -</p><p>The comments did not mark the first time the UN rights chief has criticised Trump.</p><p>He has repeatedly warned that the US president's relentless attacks on the media are \"dangerous\".</p><p>On Wednesday, Zeid said Trump's recent statements \"have been very worrisome to me,\" reiterating his warning that the president's words could trigger violence against journalists.</p><p>\"All of us would be horrified, but perhaps not shocked if we heard of a journalist that was attacked and severely beaten for example at one of the rallies,\" he said, stressing that if that happens \"the president would bear some responsibility.\"</p><p>\"As the campaigning seasons heat up, whether it be for the midterm elections or the presidential elections to come, the conduct of the president should be under very careful scrutiny by the international community and by this office,\" Zeid said.</p><p>apo-nl/je</p><p>Facebook</p><p>GOOGLE</p><p>Twitter</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

many in the country, but has also been a platform for the army and Buddhist hardliners to spread hate speech against the Rohingya and other minorities.</p><p>The site aired support for the military's

I am not aware of any other country seriously looking at this idea of an algorithm regulator.\"</p><p>The<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/competition-watchdog-suggests-new-ombudsman-to-handle-google-and-facebook-20181210-p50l80.html\"> Australian Competition and Consumer Commission earlier this week released landmark findings</url> from a year-long inquiry into digital platforms, declaring that Google and Facebook's substantial market power in digital advertising is hurting traditional publishers.</p><p>The regulator proposed a number of measures to curb their dominance, including a new government body to monitor their conduct in the advertising market, and to scrutinise how their secretive algorithms distribute traffic to publishers.</p><p>It also wants to create a new ombudsman to monitor consumer complaints about the platforms, toughen privacy regulations and make it harder for the tech giants to collect user data without unambiguous consent.</p><p>\"There is not a lot of clarity in what it would do but ... it seems pretty unworkable,\" Mr O'Connell said of the proposal for a new regulator.</p><p>\"At its core [Facebook's] news feed is just a list of pages you have chosen to follow and people who have chosen to be friends with, the news feed is just a process of ordering them.</p><p>\"These algorithms are personalised feeds based on choices individual people have made, so it is really hard to conceive how a government body can intervene in those choices.\"</p><p>In its report, the ACCC said the algorithmic selection of news is exposing users to risks of \"filter bubbles\" and unreliable information that could have flow-on effects for democracy.</p><p>Facebook has been hit by a series of scandals this year involving its news feed, including admissions the platform was manipulated by Russian troll groups spreading misinformation during the 2016 US elections, and criticism for acting too slowly to prevent hate speech from spreading in Myanmar, where there has been a genocide against the Rohingya people.</p><p>Facebook in January made substantial changes to its news feed, to refocus its platform on content posted by individual users rather than professional organisations, including media outlets. The changes led to significant drops in traffic for some publishers.</p><p>Mr O'Connell said Facebook has for years provided clear public warnings when it makes changes to the way its news feed works. \"The focus on transparency doesn't quite seem necessary,\" he said.</p><p>ACCC chair Rod Sims has said he hopes international regulators, including in the US and Europe, follow his lead on regulating big tech.</p><p>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has campaigned globally for an 'Algorithm Review Board' to be established to monitor the tech giants' secretive inner workings. But tech industry figures are sceptical whether a government bureaucracy would be able to handle the massive amounts of data involved.</p><p>Mr O'Connell said hundreds of thousands of signals are used to determine whether a post makes it into a Facebook users feed. \"It's not particularly meaningful to just throw a bunch of code at somebody,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook has 17 million monthly users in Australia, according to the ACCC inquiry. It has 2.3 billion monthly active users around the word.</p><p>\"I would say that I am concerned about the prospect of any open ended generalised push for a regulator that doesn't have specific ends or problems that it is seeking to address,\" Mr O'Connell said. \"That is what's most concerning about this.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNBTOL-1520080832</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNBTOL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY6-H121-DY19-C02M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437139</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><timeReceived>12:12 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

I am not aware of any other country seriously looking at this idea of an algorithm regulator.\"</p><p>The<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/competition-watchdog-suggests-new-ombudsman-to-handle-google-and-facebook-20181210-p50l80.html\"> Australian Competition and Consumer Commission earlier this week released landmark findings</url> from a year-long inquiry into digital platforms, declaring that Google and Facebook's substantial market power in digital advertising is hurting traditional publishers.</p><p>The regulator proposed a number of measures to curb their dominance, including a new government body to monitor their conduct in the advertising market, and to scrutinise how their secretive algorithms distribute traffic to publishers.</p><p>It also wants to create a new ombudsman to monitor consumer complaints about the platforms, toughen privacy regulations and make it harder for the tech giants to collect user data without unambiguous consent.</p><p>\"There is not a lot of clarity in what it would do but ... it seems pretty unworkable,\" Mr O'Connell said of the proposal for a new regulator.</p><p>\"At its core [Facebook's] news feed is just a list of pages you have chosen to follow and people who have chosen to be friends with, the news feed is just a process of ordering them.</p><p>\"These algorithms are personalised feeds based on choices individual people have made, so it is really hard to conceive how a government body can intervene in those choices.\"</p><p>In its report, the ACCC said the algorithmic selection of news is exposing users to risks of \"filter bubbles\" and unreliable information that could have flow-on effects for democracy.</p><p>Facebook has been hit by a series of scandals this year involving its news feed, including admissions the platform was manipulated by Russian troll groups spreading misinformation during the 2016 US elections, and criticism for acting too slowly to prevent hate speech from spreading in Myanmar, where there has been a genocide against the Rohingya people.</p><p>Facebook in January made substantial changes to its news feed, to refocus its platform on content posted by individual users rather than professional organisations, including media outlets. The changes led to significant drops in traffic for some publishers.</p><p>Mr O'Connell said Facebook has for years provided clear public warnings when it makes changes to the way its news feed works. \"The focus on transparency doesn't quite seem necessary,\" he said.</p><p>ACCC chair Rod Sims has said he hopes international regulators, including in the US and Europe, follow his lead on regulating big tech.</p><p>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has campaigned globally for an 'Algorithm Review Board' to be established to monitor the tech giants' secretive inner workings. But tech industry figures are sceptical whether a government bureaucracy would be able to handle the massive amounts of data involved.</p><p>Mr O'Connell said hundreds of thousands of signals are used to determine whether a post makes it into a Facebook users feed. \"It's not particularly meaningful to just throw a bunch of code at somebody,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook has 17 million monthly users in Australia, according to the ACCC inquiry. It has 2.3 billion monthly active users around the word.</p><p>\"I would say that I am concerned about the prospect of any open ended generalised push for a regulator that doesn't have specific ends or problems that it is seeking to address,\" Mr O'Connell said. \"That is what's most concerning about this.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520080832</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY6-H121-DY19-C040-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><timeReceived>12:12 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

I am not aware of any other country seriously looking at this idea of an algorithm regulator.\"</p><p>The<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/competition-watchdog-suggests-new-ombudsman-to-handle-google-and-facebook-20181210-p50l80.html\"> Australian Competition and Consumer Commission earlier this week released landmark findings</url> from a year-long inquiry into digital platforms, declaring that Google and Facebook's substantial market power in digital advertising is hurting traditional publishers.</p><p>The regulator proposed a number of measures to curb their dominance, including a new government body to monitor their conduct in the advertising market, and to scrutinise how their secretive algorithms distribute traffic to publishers.</p><p>It also wants to create a new ombudsman to monitor consumer complaints about the platforms, toughen privacy regulations and make it harder for the tech giants to collect user data without unambiguous consent.</p><p>\"There is not a lot of clarity in what it would do but ... it seems pretty unworkable,\" Mr O'Connell said of the proposal for a new regulator.</p><p>\"At its core [Facebook's] news feed is just a list of pages you have chosen to follow and people who have chosen to be friends with, the news feed is just a process of ordering them.</p><p>\"These algorithms are personalised feeds based on choices individual people have made, so it is really hard to conceive how a government body can intervene in those choices.\"</p><p>In its report, the ACCC said the algorithmic selection of news is exposing users to risks of \"filter bubbles\" and unreliable information that could have flow-on effects for democracy.</p><p>Facebook has been hit by a series of scandals this year involving its news feed, including admissions the platform was manipulated by Russian troll groups spreading misinformation during the 2016 US elections, and criticism for acting too slowly to prevent hate speech from spreading in Myanmar, where there has been a genocide against the Rohingya people.</p><p>Facebook in January made substantial changes to its news feed, to refocus its platform on content posted by individual users rather than professional organisations, including media outlets. The changes led to significant drops in traffic for some publishers.</p><p>Mr O'Connell said Facebook has for years provided clear public warnings when it makes changes to the way its news feed works. \"The focus on transparency doesn't quite seem necessary,\" he said.</p><p>ACCC chair Rod Sims has said he hopes international regulators, including in the US and Europe, follow his lead on regulating big tech.</p><p>Rupert Murdoch's News Corp has campaigned globally for an 'Algorithm Review Board' to be established to monitor the tech giants' secretive inner workings. But tech industry figures are sceptical whether a government bureaucracy would be able to handle the massive amounts of data involved.</p><p>Mr O'Connell said hundreds of thousands of signals are used to determine whether a post makes it into a Facebook users feed. \"It's not particularly meaningful to just throw a bunch of code at somebody,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook has 17 million monthly users in Australia, according to the ACCC inquiry. It has 2.3 billion monthly active users around the word.</p><p>\"I would say that I am concerned about the prospect of any open ended generalised push for a regulator that doesn't have specific ends or problems that it is seeking to address,\" Mr O'Connell said. \"That is what's most concerning about this.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-1520080832</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TY6-H121-DY19-C049-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><timeReceived>12:12 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
