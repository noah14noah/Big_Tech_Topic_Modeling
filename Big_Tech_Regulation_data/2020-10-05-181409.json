As for impacting on the shops in Noosa Junction, I disagree. </p><p>Most of those shops are exclusive, unique boutiques that have great appeal to the tourists who are usually cashed up and can afford to pay more. However, probably most of the locals are just average people who can't afford the high prices of Hasting St and Noosa Junction, and would welcome more of the low-price shops that one tends to find in big shopping centres.</p><p> Why do the people of Noosa Shire have to settle for half a shopping centre on the whim of the council?</p><p>Is this also going to cost the ratepayers in court costs? Why do we have to continue to spend our money in Maroochydore? </p><p>Of course Maroochydore Plaza doesn't want the Civic to expand and it's obvious why.

I can tell you from personal experience that my daughter who lives in NSW has lived in two councils that have tried and failed.</p><p>Her first attempt started well when she had only one child and plenty of time, but the enthusiasm lasted only six months until she got another job and had another child, and green waste was not a priority any more. The bins were collected every two weeks and they were only a third full at best, and in the middle of winter the smell was not too bad; you just had to make sure it was not near a window. During summer I washed the organic bin out twice and I nearly vomited both times due to the smell. So my advice is: you will set yourselves up to fail.</p><p> Ask Coles to put a bin at the back of its stores for customers. I use all my scraps to feed my worms who fertilise my garden so I won't be giving away any organic waste. The best option is give a compost bin to every home on the user pays system. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tewantin</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Brian, our understanding is that food scraps in bins will be possibly considered later, and if adopted by the jury would have to be a weekly service to stop scraps going \"off\".</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">- Acting Editor</emphasis></p><h>Negative energy</h><p>COLIN Bond expended quite a lot of negative energy (15/9) to ask the eventual Dorothy Dixer \"how will we get to the non-fossil fuel future without coal, oil and gas?\" The simple answer is \"we can't\". </p><p>That is why scientists and knowledgeable people are pushing so hard for our society to act as soon as possible to use as little of the fossil fuels still available as possible to establish the infrastructure for the non-carbon future before we shut off the oil taps, fill in the mines and cap the gas fields.</p><p> It will definitely take the last hurrah of the fossil fuel industry to set us up for a long-term relationship with solar, wind, tidal, wave, river (great article about Paul Camilleri's river powered turbines, NN 15/9) and geothermal energy. However, it is essential for us to avoid, as much as possible, the production of more CO2 and the exacerbation of global warming.</p><p>Why should the nuclear option be avoided? </p><p>Now is the perfect opportunity for civilisation to take the path towards decentralised energy sources and away from the big tech, highly vulnerable, profit motivated and resource-dependent centralized energy source.</p><p>Making electricity close to the point of use reduces unnecessary infrastructure, heat loss through transmission and vulnerability to terrorist activities.</p><p>Besides, 60 years of research has failed to solve the problem of storage of nuclear wastes.

If it works, it could potentially save you money and give you new ways to watch television.  </p><p>The proposal aims to increase the number of companies that build and sell set-top boxes, injecting competition into the industry. Whether it\u2019s big tech firms like Apple or small, independent developers, the new rules could make it easier for some to challenge the cable industry \u2014 and lower your cable bill.<br/><br/> It would allow non-cable companies to make new set-top boxes, customizing search functions, menu designs and other aspects of the user interface that consumers might not currently enjoy from their provider, officials say.<br/><br/> Right now, most people rent their boxes directly from their cable or satellite TV providers, to the tune of $20 billion a year, according to the Federal Communications Commission.<br/><br/> Consumers pay, on average, about $20 a month to rent their boxes from cable providers, a congressional probe found last year.<br/><br/> \u201cNinety-nine percent of pay-TV subscribers are chained to their set-top boxes because cable and satellite operators have locked up the market,\u201d according to an agency fact sheet released Wednesday.<br/><br/> The proposal from FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler would require operators to behave differently in several ways. In general, they\u2019d have to provide much of the information that their own set-top boxes already rely on to other companies. That includes everything related to a cable firm\u2019s channel line-up \u2014 such as which networks appear on which channels, and what programming can be found there.<br/><br/> Cable providers will also have to relay basic data about privileges and permissions, such as whether a device can record shows for later playback. And, of course, the companies will have to make the actual shows available to third party devices, as well.<br/><br/> This isn\u2019t the first time the FCC has tried to crack open the set-top box.<br/><br/> But changes in technology are demanding new approaches to the issue, senior FCC officials told reporters Wednesday.<br/><br/> The cable industry\u2019s supporters are opposed to this move, lashing out at what it views as government overreach and a threat to consumers. Many of them joined a new group that launched Wednesday called the Future of TV coalition.<br/><br/> \u201cInnovation and competition should drive the creative marketplace, not government mandates that have the potential to undermine and impede the best TV market in the world,\u201d the group said in a release.<br/><br/> The FCC\u2019s proposal will be voted on at its Feb. 18 meeting. If it\u2019s approved, it will open up a proceeding to allow for public feedback before the rules are finalized during a later vote.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EVANCR-E0007933232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EVANCR2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HYG-MHB1-F0BC-M3S3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318683</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"457\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Evansville Courier Co.

In response, the company has been beefing up its wireless-security and data-center businesses.</p><p>- Reuters</p><h>AUTO INDUSTRY</h><h>Auto tech shifts westto Silicon Valley</h><p>For the first time in America's industrial history, the center for automotive technology is drifting away from Detroit.</p><p>Ford Motor Co., aiming to put fully autonomous vehicles into the economy by 2021, announced that it is doubling the size of its office in Silicon Valley to 260 people and investing in four companies that are key to building self-driving cars. The carmaker's move follows more than $1 billion in investments made by Detroit-based General Motors in a pair of California technology companies earlier this year to keep up with Google's autonomous-car project and Uber Technologies' ride-hailing business.</p><p>While the old-school mechanical engineering remains in the Midwest, as does low-skilled factory work that hasn't moved to Southern states, these investments show that Detroit carmakers have realized they must go to the nation's technology center to find the software expertise needed to make the autos of tomorrow. Traditional automakers now directly employ hundreds in Silicon Valley, which is also home to Palo Alto-based Tesla Motors.</p><p>\"The shift to California is undeniable,\" said Eric Noble, president of the CarLab consulting firm.</p><p>- Bloomberg News</p><h>Also in Business</h><p>l  U.S. home construction  unexpectedly accelerated in July to the fastest pace in five months, indicating that the housing industry remains an area of support for the economy. Residential starts increased 2.1 percent to a 1.211 million annualized rate, exceeding all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey, from 1.186 million in June, Commerce Department data showed Tuesday in Washington.</p><p>l  Uber Technologies  is suing London's transport regulator in the latest skirmish over rules that may harm the controversial company's business. Uber will ask London judges to decide the legality of rules that require drivers from non-English speaking countries to pass a language exam, the company said. The measures also force Uber to notify Transport for London of any changes made to its mobile-phone app.</p><p>l Hyundai is in discussions with Google about further partnerships as South Korea's largest carmaker seeks external expertise to remain competitive. The two companies have some common areas that may require cooperation, Hyundai President Jeong Jin Haeng said in an interview in Seoul after a meeting between the trade ministry and local carmakers. </p><p>l Lowe's posted second-quarter profit that trailed analysts' estimates, showing it isn't taking as much advantage of a continued boom in renovation spending as larger rival Home Depot. Earnings were $1.37 a share, excluding some items, in the quarter that ended July 29, the Mooresville, N.C.-based company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts estimated $1.42, on average.</p><p>- From news services</p><h>Coming Today</h><p>l 8:30 a.m.:  Labor Department releases weekly jobless claims</p><p>l 10 a.m.:  Freddie Mac releases weekly

The carmaker's move follows more than $1 billion in investments made by Detroit-based General Motors in a pair of California technology companies earlier this year to keep up with Google's autonomous-car project and Uber Technologies' ride-hailing business.</p><p>While the old-school mechanical engineering remains in the Midwest, as does low-skilled factory work that hasn't moved to Southern states, these investments show that Detroit carmakers have realized they must go to the nation's technology center to find the software expertise needed to make the autos of tomorrow. Traditional automakers now directly employ hundreds in Silicon Valley, which is also home to Palo Alto-based Tesla Motors.</p><p>\"The shift to California is undeniable,\" said Eric Noble, president of the CarLab consulting firm.</p><p>- Bloomberg News</p><p>          Also in Business          </p><p>             l                          <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">U.S. home construction</emphasis>unexpectedly accelerated in July to the fastest pace in five months, indicating that the housing industry remains an area of support for the economy.

If it works, it could potentially save you money and give you new ways to watch television.</p><p>The proposal aims to increase the number of companies that build and sell set-top boxes, injecting competition into the industry. Whether it s big tech firms like Apple or small, independent developers, the new rules could make it easier for some to challenge the cable industry   and lower your cable bill.</p><p>It would allow non-cable companies to make new set-top boxes, customizing search functions, menu designs and other aspects of the user interface that consumers might not currently enjoy from their provider, officials say.</p><p>Right now, most people rent their boxes directly from their cable or satellite TV providers, to the tune of $20 billion a year, according to the Federal Communications Commission. Consumers pay, on average, about $20 a month to rent their boxes from cable providers, a congressional probe found last year.</p><p> Ninety-nine percent of pay-TV subscribers are chained to their set-top boxes because cable and satellite operators have locked up the market,  according to an agency fact sheet released last week.</p><p>The proposal from FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler would require operators to behave differently in several ways. In general, they d have to provide much of the information that their own set-top boxes already rely on to other companies. That includes everything related to a cable firm s channel lineup   such as which networks appear on which channels, and what programming can be found there.</p><p>Cable providers will also have to relay basic data about privileges and permissions, such as whether a device can record shows for later playback. And, of course, the companies will have to make the actual shows available to third-party devices, as well.</p><p>This isn t the first time the FCC has tried to crack open the set-top box. But changes in technology are demanding new approaches to the issue, senior FCC officials said.</p><p>The cable industry s supporters are opposed to this move, lashing out at what it views as government overreach and a threat to consumers. Many of them joined a new group called the Future of TV coalition.</p><p> Innovation and competition should drive the creative marketplace, not government mandates that have the potential to undermine and impede the best TV market in the world,  the group said in a release.</p><p>The FCC s proposal will be voted on at its Feb. 18 meeting. If it s approved, it will open up a proceeding to allow for public feedback before the rules are finalized during a later vote.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WLSTAR-2855311</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WLSTAR2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J05-37N1-DYX1-N4RK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">154046</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"447\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Star-News, Inc.

Crawford, Analyst May 30, 2014 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorideas.com\">www.investorideas.com</url> newswire) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Say the words and most people think of poverty... famine... epidemics... political strife... sectarian violence. Yet, just recently, Microsoft announced a new investment on the continent, calling Africa a \"game changer in the global economy.\" So what gives Game Changer For starters, we concede SSA faces challenges... relatively low per-capita GDP, relatively low life expectancy, and more than its fair share of military conflict. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made. </p><p>Politically, things have changed dramatically over the last two decades. In a recent report from financial advisory service firm KPMG titled \"African Emergence-The Rise of the Phoenix,\" researchers explained why... The end of the Cold War more than two decades ago brought new freedom to Africa. People started to demand political representation and called on governments to be more transparent. Democratic features were introduced and a vibrant civil society emerged. Influenced by this political renaissance, governments began to act more responsibly. Several ended hostilities with neighboring countries. With political change came economic change. Beginning in the 1990s, fledgling African democracies increasingly accommodated private enterprise by reducing trade barriers, cutting corporate taxes, and privatizing state-run industries. By the time the 2000s rolled around, these reforms started to gain traction. In 2000, GDP for all of SSA was a meager $331 billion. By 2012, it had quadrupled to $1.3 trillion. As far as the future is concerned, with more stable political and economic environments and the unleashing of market forces, SSA will reap the benefits of two megatrends: 1) growing demand for natural resources; 2) increasing consumer spending by an expanding middle class. Let me explain... As the world's population grows and per-capita consumption rises in emerging economies, the demand for natural resources will increase... and SSA has plenty of natural resources, such as gold, oil, chromium, and platinum. But as important as natural resource exports will be, they aren't the region's only engine for economic growth. Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households. All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively. Leapfrogging to the Tech Frontier Microsoft is not the only big tech company betting on growth opportunities in SSA. Intel, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM have also invested heavily in the region. But are these companies a little early Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems Not really. Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\" In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016. But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice An African telecom. The Gains Down in Africa As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time. That means millions more in the region will have more money to purchase necessities, and they'll begin to purchase things like mobile phones and mobile services. According to GSMA, a global trade organization for mobile phone operators, there will be 250 million mobile phone connections in Africa over the next five years. That bodes well for African telecoms. But it's a hotly contested space. So which telecom is the best bet We like MTN Group Limited (MTNOY). The company is on solid financial ground. It pays a nice dividend. Its network is superior to the competition's, which is why MTNOY is the market share leader in SSA. Oh, and the stock is cheap-even after the 12% run the stock has gone on since we recommended it in the December issue of BIG TECH. If you want access to our comprehensive report on MTNOY as well as access to our other buy recommendations, which include a networking equipment provider with 90% near-term upside potential, then sign up for a risk-free trial of BIG TECH.

Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households. All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively. Leapfrogging to the Tech Frontier Microsoft is not the only big tech company betting on growth opportunities in SSA. Intel, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM have also invested heavily in the region. But are these companies a little early? Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems? Not really. Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\" In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016. But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice? An African telecom. The Gains Down in Africa As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time. That means millions more in the region will have more money to purchase necessities, and they'll begin to purchase things like mobile phones and mobile services. According to GSMA, a global trade organization for mobile phone operators, there will be 250 million mobile phone connections in Africa over the next five years. That bodes well for African telecoms. But it's a hotly contested space. So which telecom is the best bet? We like MTN Group Limited (MTNOY). The company is on solid financial ground. It pays a nice dividend. Its network is superior to the competition's, which is why MTNOY is the market share leader in SSA. Oh, and the stock is cheap--even after the 12% run the stock has gone on since we recommended it in the December issue of BIG TECH. If you want access to our comprehensive report on MTNOY as well as access to our other buy recommendations, which include a networking equipment provider with 90% near-term upside potential, then sign up for a risk-free trial of BIG TECH.

Crawford, Analyst May 30, 2014 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorideas.com\">www.investorideas.com</url> newswire) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Say the words and most people think of poverty... famine... epidemics... political strife... sectarian violence. Yet, just recently, Microsoft announced a new investment on the continent, calling Africa a \"game changer in the global economy.\" So what gives? Game Changer?</p><p> For starters, we concede SSA faces challenges... relatively low per-capita GDP, relatively low life expectancy, and more than its fair share of military conflict. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made. Politically, things have changed dramatically over the last two decades. In a recent report from financial advisory service firm KPMG titled \"African Emergence-The Rise of the Phoenix,\" researchers explained why... The end of the Cold War more than two decades ago brought new freedom to Africa. People started to demand political representation and called on governments to be more transparent. Democratic features were introduced and a vibrant civil society emerged. Influenced by this political renaissance, governments began to act more responsibly. Several ended hostilities with neighboring countries. With political change came economic change. Beginning in the 1990s, fledgling African democracies increasingly accommodated private enterprise by reducing trade barriers, cutting corporate taxes, and privatizing state-run industries. By the time the 2000s rolled around, these reforms started to gain traction. In 2000, GDP for all of SSA was a meager $331 billion. By 2012, it had quadrupled to $1.3 trillion. As far as the future is concerned, with more stable political and economic environments and the unleashing of market forces, SSA will reap the benefits of two megatrends: 1) growing demand for natural resources; 2) increasing consumer spending by an expanding middle class. Let me explain... As the world's population grows and per-capita consumption rises in emerging economies, the demand for natural resources will increase... and SSA has plenty of natural resources, such as gold, oil, chromium, and platinum. But as important as natural resource exports will be, they aren't the region's only engine for economic growth. Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households. All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively.

But are these companies a little early? Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems? Not really.

Crawford, Analyst May 30, 2014 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorideas.com\">www.investorideas.com</url> newswire) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Say the words and most people think of poverty... famine... epidemics... political strife... sectarian violence. Yet, just recently, Microsoft announced a new investment on the continent, calling Africa a \"game changer in the global economy.\" So what gives Game Changer For starters, we concede SSA faces challenges... relatively low per-capita GDP, relatively low life expectancy, and more than its fair share of military conflict. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made. </p><p>Politically, things have changed dramatically over the last two decades. In a recent report from financial advisory service firm KPMG titled \"African Emergence-The Rise of the Phoenix,\" researchers explained why... The end of the Cold War more than two decades ago brought new freedom to Africa. People started to demand political representation and called on governments to be more transparent. Democratic features were introduced and a vibrant civil society emerged. Influenced by this political renaissance, governments began to act more responsibly. Several ended hostilities with neighboring countries. With political change came economic change. Beginning in the 1990s, fledgling African democracies increasingly accommodated private enterprise by reducing trade barriers, cutting corporate taxes, and privatizing state-run industries. By the time the 2000s rolled around, these reforms started to gain traction. In 2000, GDP for all of SSA was a meager $331 billion. By 2012, it had quadrupled to $1.3 trillion. As far as the future is concerned, with more stable political and economic environments and the unleashing of market forces, SSA will reap the benefits of two megatrends: 1) growing demand for natural resources; 2) increasing consumer spending by an expanding middle class. Let me explain... As the world's population grows and per-capita consumption rises in emerging economies, the demand for natural resources will increase... and SSA has plenty of natural resources, such as gold, oil, chromium, and platinum. But as important as natural resource exports will be, they aren't the region's only engine for economic growth. Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households. All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively. Leapfrogging to the Tech Frontier Microsoft is not the only big tech company betting on growth opportunities in SSA. Intel, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM have also invested heavily in the region. But are these companies a little early Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems Not really. Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\" In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016. But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice An African telecom. The Gains Down in Africa As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time. That means millions more in the region will have more money to purchase necessities, and they'll begin to purchase things like mobile phones and mobile services. According to GSMA, a global trade organization for mobile phone operators, there will be 250 million mobile phone connections in Africa over the next five years. That bodes well for African telecoms. But it's a hotly contested space. So which telecom is the best bet We like MTN Group Limited (MTNOY). The company is on solid financial ground. It pays a nice dividend. Its network is superior to the competition's, which is why MTNOY is the market share leader in SSA. Oh, and the stock is cheap-even after the 12% run the stock has gone on since we recommended it in the December issue of BIG TECH. If you want access to our comprehensive report on MTNOY as well as access to our other buy recommendations, which include a networking equipment provider with 90% near-term upside potential, then sign up for a risk-free trial of BIG TECH.

Crawford, Analyst May 30, 2014 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorideas.com\">www.investorideas.com</url> newswire) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Say the words and most people think of poverty... famine... epidemics... political strife... sectarian violence. Yet, just recently, Microsoft announced a new investment on the continent, calling Africa a \"game changer in the global economy.\" So what gives Game Changer For starters, we concede SSA faces challenges... relatively low per-capita GDP, relatively low life expectancy, and more than its fair share of military conflict. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made. </p><p>Politically, things have changed dramatically over the last two decades. In a recent report from financial advisory service firm KPMG titled \"African Emergence-The Rise of the Phoenix,\" researchers explained why... The end of the Cold War more than two decades ago brought new freedom to Africa. People started to demand political representation and called on governments to be more transparent. Democratic features were introduced and a vibrant civil society emerged. Influenced by this political renaissance, governments began to act more responsibly. Several ended hostilities with neighboring countries. With political change came economic change. Beginning in the 1990s, fledgling African democracies increasingly accommodated private enterprise by reducing trade barriers, cutting corporate taxes, and privatizing state-run industries. By the time the 2000s rolled around, these reforms started to gain traction. In 2000, GDP for all of SSA was a meager $331 billion. By 2012, it had quadrupled to $1.3 trillion. As far as the future is concerned, with more stable political and economic environments and the unleashing of market forces, SSA will reap the benefits of two megatrends: 1) growing demand for natural resources; 2) increasing consumer spending by an expanding middle class. Let me explain... As the world's population grows and per-capita consumption rises in emerging economies, the demand for natural resources will increase... and SSA has plenty of natural resources, such as gold, oil, chromium, and platinum. But as important as natural resource exports will be, they aren't the region's only engine for economic growth. Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households. All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively. Leapfrogging to the Tech Frontier Microsoft is not the only big tech company betting on growth opportunities in SSA. Intel, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM have also invested heavily in the region. But are these companies a little early Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems Not really. Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\" In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016. But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice An African telecom. The Gains Down in Africa As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time. That means millions more in the region will have more money to purchase necessities, and they'll begin to purchase things like mobile phones and mobile services. According to GSMA, a global trade organization for mobile phone operators, there will be 250 million mobile phone connections in Africa over the next five years. That bodes well for African telecoms. But it's a hotly contested space. So which telecom is the best bet We like MTN Group Limited (MTNOY). The company is on solid financial ground. It pays a nice dividend. Its network is superior to the competition's, which is why MTNOY is the market share leader in SSA. Oh, and the stock is cheap-even after the 12% run the stock has gone on since we recommended it in the December issue of BIG TECH. If you want access to our comprehensive report on MTNOY as well as access to our other buy recommendations, which include a networking equipment provider with 90% near-term upside potential, then sign up for a risk-free trial of BIG TECH.

Crawford, Analyst May 30, 2014 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorideas.com\">www.investorideas.com</url> newswire) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Say the words and most people think of poverty... famine... epidemics... political strife... sectarian violence. Yet, just recently, Microsoft announced a new investment on the continent, calling Africa a \"game changer in the global economy.\" So what gives Game Changer For starters, we concede SSA faces challenges... relatively low per-capita GDP, relatively low life expectancy, and more than its fair share of military conflict. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made. </p><p>Politically, things have changed dramatically over the last two decades. In a recent report from financial advisory service firm KPMG titled \"African Emergence-The Rise of the Phoenix,\" researchers explained why... The end of the Cold War more than two decades ago brought new freedom to Africa. People started to demand political representation and called on governments to be more transparent. Democratic features were introduced and a vibrant civil society emerged. Influenced by this political renaissance, governments began to act more responsibly. Several ended hostilities with neighboring countries. With political change came economic change. Beginning in the 1990s, fledgling African democracies increasingly accommodated private enterprise by reducing trade barriers, cutting corporate taxes, and privatizing state-run industries. By the time the 2000s rolled around, these reforms started to gain traction. In 2000, GDP for all of SSA was a meager $331 billion. By 2012, it had quadrupled to $1.3 trillion. As far as the future is concerned, with more stable political and economic environments and the unleashing of market forces, SSA will reap the benefits of two megatrends: 1) growing demand for natural resources; 2) increasing consumer spending by an expanding middle class. Let me explain... As the world's population grows and per-capita consumption rises in emerging economies, the demand for natural resources will increase... and SSA has plenty of natural resources, such as gold, oil, chromium, and platinum. But as important as natural resource exports will be, they aren't the region's only engine for economic growth. Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households. All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively. Leapfrogging to the Tech Frontier Microsoft is not the only big tech company betting on growth opportunities in SSA. Intel, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM have also invested heavily in the region. But are these companies a little early Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems Not really. Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\" In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016. But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice An African telecom. The Gains Down in Africa As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time. That means millions more in the region will have more money to purchase necessities, and they'll begin to purchase things like mobile phones and mobile services. According to GSMA, a global trade organization for mobile phone operators, there will be 250 million mobile phone connections in Africa over the next five years. That bodes well for African telecoms. But it's a hotly contested space. So which telecom is the best bet We like MTN Group Limited (MTNOY). The company is on solid financial ground. It pays a nice dividend. Its network is superior to the competition's, which is why MTNOY is the market share leader in SSA. Oh, and the stock is cheap-even after the 12% run the stock has gone on since we recommended it in the December issue of BIG TECH. If you want access to our comprehensive report on MTNOY as well as access to our other buy recommendations, which include a networking equipment provider with 90% near-term upside potential, then sign up for a risk-free trial of BIG TECH.

Crawford, Analyst May 30, 2014 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorideas.com\">www.investorideas.com</url> newswire) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Say the words and most people think of poverty... famine... epidemics... political strife... sectarian violence. Yet, just recently, Microsoft announced a new investment on the continent, calling Africa a \"game changer in the global economy.\" So what gives? Game Changer?</p><p> For starters, we concede SSA faces challenges... relatively low per-capita GDP, relatively low life expectancy, and more than its fair share of military conflict. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made. Politically, things have changed dramatically over the last two decades. In a recent report from financial advisory service firm KPMG titled \"African Emergence--The Rise of the Phoenix,\" researchers explained why... The end of the Cold War more than two decades ago brought new freedom to Africa. People started to demand political representation and called on governments to be more transparent. Democratic features were introduced and a vibrant civil society emerged. Influenced by this political renaissance, governments began to act more responsibly. Several ended hostilities with neighboring countries. With political change came economic change. Beginning in the 1990s, fledgling African democracies increasingly accommodated private enterprise by reducing trade barriers, cutting corporate taxes, and privatizing state-run industries. By the time the 2000s rolled around, these reforms started to gain traction. In 2000, GDP for all of SSA was a meager $331 billion. By 2012, it had quadrupled to $1.3 trillion. As far as the future is concerned, with more stable political and economic environments and the unleashing of market forces, SSA will reap the benefits of two megatrends: 1) growing demand for natural resources; 2) increasing consumer spending by an expanding middle class. Let me explain... As the world's population grows and per-capita consumption rises in emerging economies, the demand for natural resources will increase... and SSA has plenty of natural resources, such as gold, oil, chromium, and platinum. But as important as natural resource exports will be, they aren't the region's only engine for economic growth. Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households. All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively. Leapfrogging to the Tech Frontier Microsoft is not the only big tech company betting on growth opportunities in SSA. Intel, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM have also invested heavily in the region. But are these companies a little early? Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems? Not really. Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\" In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016. But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice? An African telecom. The Gains Down in Africa As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time. That means millions more in the region will have more money to purchase necessities, and they'll begin to purchase things like mobile phones and mobile services. According to GSMA, a global trade organization for mobile phone operators, there will be 250 million mobile phone connections in Africa over the next five years. That bodes well for African telecoms. But it's a hotly contested space. So which telecom is the best bet? We like MTN Group Limited (MTNOY). The company is on solid financial ground. It pays a nice dividend. Its network is superior to the competition's, which is why MTNOY is the market share leader in SSA. Oh, and the stock is cheap--even after the 12% run the stock has gone on since we recommended it in the December issue of BIG TECH. If you want access to our comprehensive report on MTNOY as well as access to our other buy recommendations, which include a networking equipment provider with 90% near-term upside potential, then sign up for a risk-free trial of BIG TECH.

Crawford, Analyst May 30, 2014 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorideas.com\">www.investorideas.com</url> newswire) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Say the words and most people think of poverty... famine... epidemics... political strife... sectarian violence. Yet, just recently, Microsoft announced a new investment on the continent, calling Africa a \"game changer in the global economy.\" So what gives? Game Changer?</p><p> For starters, we concede SSA faces challenges... relatively low per-capita GDP, relatively low life expectancy, and more than its fair share of military conflict. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made. Politically, things have changed dramatically over the last two decades. In a recent report from financial advisory service firm KPMG titled \"African Emergence-The Rise of the Phoenix,\" researchers explained why... The end of the Cold War more than two decades ago brought new freedom to Africa. People started to demand political representation and called on governments to be more transparent. Democratic features were introduced and a vibrant civil society emerged. Influenced by this political renaissance, governments began to act more responsibly. Several ended hostilities with neighboring countries. With political change came economic change. Beginning in the 1990s, fledgling African democracies increasingly accommodated private enterprise by reducing trade barriers, cutting corporate taxes, and privatizing state-run industries. By the time the 2000s rolled around, these reforms started to gain traction. In 2000, GDP for all of SSA was a meager $331 billion. By 2012, it had quadrupled to $1.3 trillion. As far as the future is concerned, with more stable political and economic environments and the unleashing of market forces, SSA will reap the benefits of two megatrends: 1) growing demand for natural resources; 2) increasing consumer spending by an expanding middle class. Let me explain... As the world's population grows and per-capita consumption rises in emerging economies, the demand for natural resources will increase... and SSA has plenty of natural resources, such as gold, oil, chromium, and platinum. But as important as natural resource exports will be, they aren't the region's only engine for economic growth. Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households. All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively. Leapfrogging to the Tech Frontier Microsoft is not the only big tech company betting on growth opportunities in SSA. Intel, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM have also invested heavily in the region. But are these companies a little early? Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems? Not really. Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\" In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016. But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice? An African telecom. The Gains Down in Africa As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time. That means millions more in the region will have more money to purchase necessities, and they'll begin to purchase things like mobile phones and mobile services. According to GSMA, a global trade organization for mobile phone operators, there will be 250 million mobile phone connections in Africa over the next five years. That bodes well for African telecoms. But it's a hotly contested space. So which telecom is the best bet? We like MTN Group Limited (MTNOY). The company is on solid financial ground. It pays a nice dividend. Its network is superior to the competition's, which is why MTNOY is the market share leader in SSA. Oh, and the stock is cheap-even after the 12% run the stock has gone on since we recommended it in the December issue of BIG TECH. If you want access to our comprehensive report on MTNOY as well as access to our other buy recommendations, which include a networking equipment provider with 90% near-term upside potential, then sign up for a risk-free trial of BIG TECH.

Crawford, Analyst May 30, 2014 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorideas.com\">www.investorideas.com</url> newswire) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Say the words and most people think of poverty... famine... epidemics... political strife... sectarian violence. Yet, just recently, Microsoft announced a new investment on the continent, calling Africa a \"game changer in the global economy.\" So what gives Game Changer For starters, we concede SSA faces challenges... relatively low per-capita GDP, relatively low life expectancy, and more than its fair share of military conflict. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made. </p><p>Politically, things have changed dramatically over the last two decades. In a recent report from financial advisory service firm KPMG titled \"African Emergence-The Rise of the Phoenix,\" researchers explained why... The end of the Cold War more than two decades ago brought new freedom to Africa. People started to demand political representation and called on governments to be more transparent. Democratic features were introduced and a vibrant civil society emerged. Influenced by this political renaissance, governments began to act more responsibly. Several ended hostilities with neighboring countries. With political change came economic change. Beginning in the 1990s, fledgling African democracies increasingly accommodated private enterprise by reducing trade barriers, cutting corporate taxes, and privatizing state-run industries. By the time the 2000s rolled around, these reforms started to gain traction. In 2000, GDP for all of SSA was a meager $331 billion. By 2012, it had quadrupled to $1.3 trillion. As far as the future is concerned, with more stable political and economic environments and the unleashing of market forces, SSA will reap the benefits of two megatrends: 1) growing demand for natural resources; 2) increasing consumer spending by an expanding middle class. Let me explain... As the world's population grows and per-capita consumption rises in emerging economies, the demand for natural resources will increase... and SSA has plenty of natural resources, such as gold, oil, chromium, and platinum. But as important as natural resource exports will be, they aren't the region's only engine for economic growth. Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households. All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively. Leapfrogging to the Tech Frontier Microsoft is not the only big tech company betting on growth opportunities in SSA. Intel, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM have also invested heavily in the region. But are these companies a little early Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems Not really. Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\" In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016. But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice An African telecom. The Gains Down in Africa As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time. That means millions more in the region will have more money to purchase necessities, and they'll begin to purchase things like mobile phones and mobile services. According to GSMA, a global trade organization for mobile phone operators, there will be 250 million mobile phone connections in Africa over the next five years. That bodes well for African telecoms. But it's a hotly contested space. So which telecom is the best bet We like MTN Group Limited (MTNOY). The company is on solid financial ground. It pays a nice dividend. Its network is superior to the competition's, which is why MTNOY is the market share leader in SSA. Oh, and the stock is cheap-even after the 12% run the stock has gone on since we recommended it in the December issue of BIG TECH. If you want access to our comprehensive report on MTNOY as well as access to our other buy recommendations, which include a networking equipment provider with 90% near-term upside potential, then sign up for a risk-free trial of BIG TECH.

Crawford, Analyst May 30, 2014 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorideas.com\">www.investorideas.com</url> newswire) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Say the words and most people think of poverty... famine... epidemics... political strife... sectarian violence. Yet, just recently, Microsoft announced a new investment on the continent, calling Africa a \"game changer in the global economy.\" So what gives Game Changer For starters, we concede SSA faces challenges... relatively low per-capita GDP, relatively low life expectancy, and more than its fair share of military conflict. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made. </p><p>Politically, things have changed dramatically over the last two decades. In a recent report from financial advisory service firm KPMG titled \"African Emergence-The Rise of the Phoenix,\" researchers explained why... The end of the Cold War more than two decades ago brought new freedom to Africa. People started to demand political representation and called on governments to be more transparent. Democratic features were introduced and a vibrant civil society emerged. Influenced by this political renaissance, governments began to act more responsibly. Several ended hostilities with neighboring countries. With political change came economic change. Beginning in the 1990s, fledgling African democracies increasingly accommodated private enterprise by reducing trade barriers, cutting corporate taxes, and privatizing state-run industries. By the time the 2000s rolled around, these reforms started to gain traction. In 2000, GDP for all of SSA was a meager $331 billion. By 2012, it had quadrupled to $1.3 trillion. As far as the future is concerned, with more stable political and economic environments and the unleashing of market forces, SSA will reap the benefits of two megatrends: 1) growing demand for natural resources; 2) increasing consumer spending by an expanding middle class. Let me explain... As the world's population grows and per-capita consumption rises in emerging economies, the demand for natural resources will increase... and SSA has plenty of natural resources, such as gold, oil, chromium, and platinum. But as important as natural resource exports will be, they aren't the region's only engine for economic growth. Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households. All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively. Leapfrogging to the Tech Frontier Microsoft is not the only big tech company betting on growth opportunities in SSA. Intel, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM have also invested heavily in the region. But are these companies a little early Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems Not really. Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\" In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016. But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice An African telecom. The Gains Down in Africa As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time. That means millions more in the region will have more money to purchase necessities, and they'll begin to purchase things like mobile phones and mobile services. According to GSMA, a global trade organization for mobile phone operators, there will be 250 million mobile phone connections in Africa over the next five years. That bodes well for African telecoms. But it's a hotly contested space. So which telecom is the best bet We like MTN Group Limited (MTNOY). The company is on solid financial ground. It pays a nice dividend. Its network is superior to the competition's, which is why MTNOY is the market share leader in SSA. Oh, and the stock is cheap-even after the 12% run the stock has gone on since we recommended it in the December issue of BIG TECH. If you want access to our comprehensive report on MTNOY as well as access to our other buy recommendations, which include a networking equipment provider with 90% near-term upside potential, then sign up for a risk-free trial of BIG TECH.

According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016. But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice? An African telecom. The Gains Down in Africa As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time. That means millions more in the region will have more money to purchase necessities, and they'll begin to purchase things like mobile phones and mobile services. According to GSMA, a global trade organization for mobile phone operators, there will be 250 million mobile phone connections in Africa over the next five years. That bodes well for African telecoms. But it's a hotly contested space. So which telecom is the best bet? We like MTN Group Limited (MTNOY). The company is on solid financial ground. It pays a nice dividend. Its network is superior to the competition's, which is why MTNOY is the market share leader in SSA. Oh, and the stock is cheap-even after the 12% run the stock has gone on since we recommended it in the December issue of BIG TECH. If you want access to our comprehensive report on MTNOY as well as access to our other buy recommendations, which include a networking equipment provider with 90% near-term upside potential, then sign up for a risk-free trial of BIG TECH.

Crawford, Analyst May 30, 2014 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorideas.com\">www.investorideas.com</url> newswire) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Say the words and most people think of poverty... famine... epidemics... political strife... sectarian violence. Yet, just recently, Microsoft announced a new investment on the continent, calling Africa a \"game changer in the global economy.\" So what gives? Game Changer?</p><p> For starters, we concede SSA faces challenges... relatively low per-capita GDP, relatively low life expectancy, and more than its fair share of military conflict. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made. Politically, things have changed dramatically over the last two decades. In a recent report from financial advisory service firm KPMG titled \"African Emergence-The Rise of the Phoenix,\" researchers explained why... The end of the Cold War more than two decades ago brought new freedom to Africa. People started to demand political representation and called on governments to be more transparent. Democratic features were introduced and a vibrant civil society emerged. Influenced by this political renaissance, governments began to act more responsibly. Several ended hostilities with neighboring countries. With political change came economic change. Beginning in the 1990s, fledgling African democracies increasingly accommodated private enterprise by reducing trade barriers, cutting corporate taxes, and privatizing state-run industries. By the time the 2000s rolled around, these reforms started to gain traction. In 2000, GDP for all of SSA was a meager $331 billion. By 2012, it had quadrupled to $1.3 trillion. As far as the future is concerned, with more stable political and economic environments and the unleashing of market forces, SSA will reap the benefits of two megatrends: 1) growing demand for natural resources; 2) increasing consumer spending by an expanding middle class. Let me explain... As the world's population grows and per-capita consumption rises in emerging economies, the demand for natural resources will increase... and SSA has plenty of natural resources, such as gold, oil, chromium, and platinum. But as important as natural resource exports will be, they aren't the region's only engine for economic growth. Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households. All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively. Leapfrogging to the Tech Frontier Microsoft is not the only big tech company betting on growth opportunities in SSA. Intel, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM have also invested heavily in the region. But are these companies a little early? Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems? Not really. Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\" In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016. But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice? An African telecom. The Gains Down in Africa As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time.

Crawford, Analyst May 30, 2014 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorideas.com\">www.investorideas.com</url> newswire) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Say the words and most people think of poverty... famine... epidemics... political strife... sectarian violence. Yet, just recently, Microsoft announced a new investment on the continent, calling Africa a \"game changer in the global economy.\" So what gives? Game Changer?</p><p> For starters, we concede SSA faces challenges... relatively low per-capita GDP, relatively low life expectancy, and more than its fair share of military conflict. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made. Politically, things have changed dramatically over the last two decades. In a recent report from financial advisory service firm KPMG titled \"African Emergence--The Rise of the Phoenix,\" researchers explained why... The end of the Cold War more than two decades ago brought new freedom to Africa. People started to demand political representation and called on governments to be more transparent. Democratic features were introduced and a vibrant civil society emerged. Influenced by this political renaissance, governments began to act more responsibly. Several ended hostilities with neighboring countries. With political change came economic change. Beginning in the 1990s, fledgling African democracies increasingly accommodated private enterprise by reducing trade barriers, cutting corporate taxes, and privatizing state-run industries. By the time the 2000s rolled around, these reforms started to gain traction. In 2000, GDP for all of SSA was a meager $331 billion. By 2012, it had quadrupled to $1.3 trillion. As far as the future is concerned, with more stable political and economic environments and the unleashing of market forces, SSA will reap the benefits of two megatrends: 1) growing demand for natural resources; 2) increasing consumer spending by an expanding middle class. Let me explain... As the world's population grows and per-capita consumption rises in emerging economies, the demand for natural resources will increase... and SSA has plenty of natural resources, such as gold, oil, chromium, and platinum. But as important as natural resource exports will be, they aren't the region's only engine for economic growth. Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households. All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively. Leapfrogging to the Tech Frontier Microsoft is not the only big tech company betting on growth opportunities in SSA. Intel, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM have also invested heavily in the region. But are these companies a little early? Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems? Not really. Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\" In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016. But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice? An African telecom. The Gains Down in Africa As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time. That means millions more in the region will have more money to purchase necessities, and they'll begin to purchase things like mobile phones and mobile services. According to GSMA, a global trade organization for mobile phone operators, there will be 250 million mobile phone connections in Africa over the next five years. That bodes well for African telecoms. But it's a hotly contested space. So which telecom is the best bet? We like MTN Group Limited (MTNOY). The company is on solid financial ground. It pays a nice dividend. Its network is superior to the competition's, which is why MTNOY is the market share leader in SSA. Oh, and the stock is cheap--even after the 12% run the stock has gone on since we recommended it in the December issue of BIG TECH. If you want access to our comprehensive report on MTNOY as well as access to our other buy recommendations, which include a networking equipment provider with 90% near-term upside potential, then sign up for a risk-free trial of BIG TECH.

Crawford, Analyst May 30, 2014 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorideas.com\">www.investorideas.com</url> newswire) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Say the words and most people think of poverty... famine... epidemics... political strife... sectarian violence. Yet, just recently, Microsoft announced a new investment on the continent, calling Africa a \"game changer in the global economy.\" So what gives? Game Changer?</p><p> For starters, we concede SSA faces challenges... relatively low per-capita GDP, relatively low life expectancy, and more than its fair share of military conflict. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made. Politically, things have changed dramatically over the last two decades. In a recent report from financial advisory service firm KPMG titled \"African Emergence--The Rise of the Phoenix,\" researchers explained why... The end of the Cold War more than two decades ago brought new freedom to Africa. People started to demand political representation and called on governments to be more transparent. Democratic features were introduced and a vibrant civil society emerged. Influenced by this political renaissance, governments began to act more responsibly. Several ended hostilities with neighboring countries. With political change came economic change. Beginning in the 1990s, fledgling African democracies increasingly accommodated private enterprise by reducing trade barriers, cutting corporate taxes, and privatizing state-run industries. By the time the 2000s rolled around, these reforms started to gain traction. In 2000, GDP for all of SSA was a meager $331 billion. By 2012, it had quadrupled to $1.3 trillion. As far as the future is concerned, with more stable political and economic environments and the unleashing of market forces, SSA will reap the benefits of two megatrends: 1) growing demand for natural resources; 2) increasing consumer spending by an expanding middle class. Let me explain... As the world's population grows and per-capita consumption rises in emerging economies, the demand for natural resources will increase... and SSA has plenty of natural resources, such as gold, oil, chromium, and platinum. But as important as natural resource exports will be, they aren't the region's only engine for economic growth. Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households. All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively. Leapfrogging to the Tech Frontier Microsoft is not the only big tech company betting on growth opportunities in SSA. Intel, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM have also invested heavily in the region. But are these companies a little early? Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems? Not really. Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\" In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016. But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice? An African telecom. The Gains Down in Africa As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time. That means millions more in the region will have more money to purchase necessities, and they'll begin to purchase things like mobile phones and mobile services. According to GSMA, a global trade organization for mobile phone operators, there will be 250 million mobile phone connections in Africa over the next five years. That bodes well for African telecoms. But it's a hotly contested space. So which telecom is the best bet? We like MTN Group Limited (MTNOY). The company is on solid financial ground. It pays a nice dividend. Its network is superior to the competition's, which is why MTNOY is the market share leader in SSA. Oh, and the stock is cheap--even after the 12% run the stock has gone on since we recommended it in the December issue of BIG TECH. If you want access to our comprehensive report on MTNOY as well as access to our other buy recommendations, which include a networking equipment provider with 90% near-term upside potential, then sign up for a risk-free trial of BIG TECH.

Crawford, Analyst May 30, 2014 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorideas.com\">www.investorideas.com</url> newswire) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Say the words and most people think of poverty... famine... epidemics... political strife... sectarian violence. Yet, just recently, Microsoft announced a new investment on the continent, calling Africa a \"game changer in the global economy.\" So what gives Game Changer For starters, we concede SSA faces challenges... relatively low per-capita GDP, relatively low life expectancy, and more than its fair share of military conflict. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made. </p><p>Politically, things have changed dramatically over the last two decades. In a recent report from financial advisory service firm KPMG titled \"African Emergence-The Rise of the Phoenix,\" researchers explained why... The end of the Cold War more than two decades ago brought new freedom to Africa. People started to demand political representation and called on governments to be more transparent. Democratic features were introduced and a vibrant civil society emerged. Influenced by this political renaissance, governments began to act more responsibly. Several ended hostilities with neighboring countries. With political change came economic change. Beginning in the 1990s, fledgling African democracies increasingly accommodated private enterprise by reducing trade barriers, cutting corporate taxes, and privatizing state-run industries. By the time the 2000s rolled around, these reforms started to gain traction. In 2000, GDP for all of SSA was a meager $331 billion. By 2012, it had quadrupled to $1.3 trillion. As far as the future is concerned, with more stable political and economic environments and the unleashing of market forces, SSA will reap the benefits of two megatrends: 1) growing demand for natural resources; 2) increasing consumer spending by an expanding middle class. Let me explain... As the world's population grows and per-capita consumption rises in emerging economies, the demand for natural resources will increase... and SSA has plenty of natural resources, such as gold, oil, chromium, and platinum. But as important as natural resource exports will be, they aren't the region's only engine for economic growth. Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households. All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively. Leapfrogging to the Tech Frontier Microsoft is not the only big tech company betting on growth opportunities in SSA. Intel, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM have also invested heavily in the region. But are these companies a little early Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems Not really. Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\" In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016. But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice An African telecom. The Gains Down in Africa As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time. That means millions more in the region will have more money to purchase necessities, and they'll begin to purchase things like mobile phones and mobile services. According to GSMA, a global trade organization for mobile phone operators, there will be 250 million mobile phone connections in Africa over the next five years. That bodes well for African telecoms. But it's a hotly contested space. So which telecom is the best bet We like MTN Group Limited (MTNOY). The company is on solid financial ground. It pays a nice dividend. Its network is superior to the competition's, which is why MTNOY is the market share leader in SSA. Oh, and the stock is cheap-even after the 12% run the stock has gone on since we recommended it in the December issue of BIG TECH. If you want access to our comprehensive report on MTNOY as well as access to our other buy recommendations, which include a networking equipment provider with 90% near-term upside potential, then sign up for a risk-free trial of BIG TECH.

Crawford, Analyst May 30, 2014 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorideas.com\">www.investorideas.com</url> newswire) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Say the words and most people think of poverty... famine... epidemics... political strife... sectarian violence. Yet, just recently, Microsoft announced a new investment on the continent, calling Africa a \"game changer in the global economy.\" So what gives? Game Changer?</p><p> For starters, we concede SSA faces challenges... relatively low per-capita GDP, relatively low life expectancy, and more than its fair share of military conflict. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made. Politically, things have changed dramatically over the last two decades. In a recent report from financial advisory service firm KPMG titled \"African Emergence-The Rise of the Phoenix,\" researchers explained why... The end of the Cold War more than two decades ago brought new freedom to Africa. People started to demand political representation and called on governments to be more transparent. Democratic features were introduced and a vibrant civil society emerged. Influenced by this political renaissance, governments began to act more responsibly. Several ended hostilities with neighboring countries. With political change came economic change. Beginning in the 1990s, fledgling African democracies increasingly accommodated private enterprise by reducing trade barriers, cutting corporate taxes, and privatizing state-run industries. By the time the 2000s rolled around, these reforms started to gain traction. In 2000, GDP for all of SSA was a meager $331 billion. By 2012, it had quadrupled to $1.3 trillion. As far as the future is concerned, with more stable political and economic environments and the unleashing of market forces, SSA will reap the benefits of two megatrends: 1) growing demand for natural resources; 2) increasing consumer spending by an expanding middle class. Let me explain... As the world's population grows and per-capita consumption rises in emerging economies, the demand for natural resources will increase... and SSA has plenty of natural resources, such as gold, oil, chromium, and platinum. But as important as natural resource exports will be, they aren't the region's only engine for economic growth. Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households. All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively. Leapfrogging to the Tech Frontier Microsoft is not the only big tech company betting on growth opportunities in SSA. Intel, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM have also invested heavily in the region. But are these companies a little early? Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems? Not really. Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\" In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016. But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice? An African telecom. The Gains Down in Africa As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time. That means millions more in the region will have more money to purchase necessities, and they'll begin to purchase things like mobile phones and mobile services. According to GSMA, a global trade organization for mobile phone operators, there will be 250 million mobile phone connections in Africa over the next five years. That bodes well for African telecoms. But it's a hotly contested space. So which telecom is the best bet? We like MTN Group Limited (MTNOY). The company is on solid financial ground. It pays a nice dividend. Its network is superior to the competition's, which is why MTNOY is the market share leader in SSA. Oh, and the stock is cheap-even after the 12% run the stock has gone on since we recommended it in the December issue of BIG TECH. If you want access to our comprehensive report on MTNOY as well as access to our other buy recommendations, which include a networking equipment provider with 90% near-term upside potential, then sign up for a risk-free trial of BIG TECH.

Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\" In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016. But here's the thing: Africa won't significantly move the revenue needle for the global tech giants, so investors should look elsewhere for opportunities. Our advice? An African telecom. The Gains Down in Africa As mentioned before, over the next few years, millions of SSA households will be acquiring discretionary income for the first time. That means millions more in the region will have more money to purchase necessities, and they'll begin to purchase things like mobile phones and mobile services. According to GSMA, a global trade organization for mobile phone operators, there will be 250 million mobile phone connections in Africa over the next five years. That bodes well for African telecoms. But it's a hotly contested space. So which telecom is the best bet? We like MTN Group Limited (MTNOY). The company is on solid financial ground. It pays a nice dividend. Its network is superior to the competition's, which is why MTNOY is the market share leader in SSA. Oh, and the stock is cheap--even after the 12% run the stock has gone on since we recommended it in the December issue of BIG TECH. If you want access to our comprehensive report on MTNOY as well as access to our other buy recommendations, which include a networking equipment provider with 90% near-term upside potential, then sign up for a risk-free trial of BIG TECH.

Crawford, Analyst May 30, 2014 (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.investorideas.com\">www.investorideas.com</url> newswire) Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Say the words and most people think of poverty... famine... epidemics... political strife... sectarian violence. Yet, just recently, Microsoft announced a new investment on the continent, calling Africa a \"game changer in the global economy.\" So what gives? Game Changer?</p><p> For starters, we concede SSA faces challenges... relatively low per-capita GDP, relatively low life expectancy, and more than its fair share of military conflict. Nevertheless, considerable progress is being made. Politically, things have changed dramatically over the last two decades. In a recent report from financial advisory service firm KPMG titled \"African Emergence--The Rise of the Phoenix,\" researchers explained why... The end of the Cold War more than two decades ago brought new freedom to Africa. People started to demand political representation and called on governments to be more transparent. Democratic features were introduced and a vibrant civil society emerged. Influenced by this political renaissance, governments began to act more responsibly. Several ended hostilities with neighboring countries. With political change came economic change. Beginning in the 1990s, fledgling African democracies increasingly accommodated private enterprise by reducing trade barriers, cutting corporate taxes, and privatizing state-run industries. By the time the 2000s rolled around, these reforms started to gain traction. In 2000, GDP for all of SSA was a meager $331 billion. By 2012, it had quadrupled to $1.3 trillion. As far as the future is concerned, with more stable political and economic environments and the unleashing of market forces, SSA will reap the benefits of two megatrends: 1) growing demand for natural resources; 2) increasing consumer spending by an expanding middle class. Let me explain... As the world's population grows and per-capita consumption rises in emerging economies, the demand for natural resources will increase... and SSA has plenty of natural resources, such as gold, oil, chromium, and platinum. But as important as natural resource exports will be, they aren't the region's only engine for economic growth. Consumerism is also a powerful factor, and it's being driven by an emerging middle class. More and more SSA citizens are moving from subsistence farming to higher-paying urban jobs. In 2000, about 59 million African households were earning discretionary income; by 2020, discretionary income will be available to 128 million households. All of this points to the expectation of continued economic growth. Economists at the International Monetary Fund estimate that by 2018, GDP for SSA will reach $1.9 trillion. That amounts to a compounded annual growth rate of 7%, which compares favorably with estimates for Latin America and developing Asia of 4.7% and 8.1% respectively. Leapfrogging to the Tech Frontier Microsoft is not the only big tech company betting on growth opportunities in SSA. Intel, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM have also invested heavily in the region. But are these companies a little early? Won't the benefits to tech come after the buildup of roads, power grids, and healthcare systems? Not really. Whereas in developed countries, high tech has been \"bolted onto\" existing infrastructures years after they have been created, in developing regions high tech can be integrated in as the infrastructure is constructed. For example, as the US struggles to mesh electronic health records with the healthcare system and smart-grid technology with the power grid, developing economies can build these features right into their nascent systems at the outset. In the words of John Kelly, head of research at IBM, Africa \"can leapfrog straight to the tech frontier, without worrying about adapting old systems...\" In addition, the Cloud is adaptable to and quite useful in the early stages of an economy's development. According to The Economist, \"The ability to use software, computing power, and storage online 'as a service,' paying only for what you need and only when you need it, may put the cost of information technology within the budget of many small African businesses.\" The point is: the time for tech in SSA is now... not a decade from now. That's why so many big tech firms are setting up shop in the region. Research firm IDC predicts that IT spending across Africa will increase from $30 billion in 2012 to $40 billion in 2016, and if telecom is included, spending will increase from $103 billion in 2012 to $130 billion by 2016.

Hello...// I'm... Jeff barnd... ...And I'm jennifer gilber eating healthy &gt;&gt; U'reatch first business ming news, with tom hudson, angela miles, and jon and pete najarian with the trade of the d today on first business,re american companies prepd in case the bird flu pandemic comes ashore? And how watching march madness on the small screen is becoming a big deal. Plus this week's trades the day. &gt;&gt; here we go, rocking and rolling this Friday morning, march 17, 2006. . Patrick's day and here we go, new highs for markets. &gt;&gt; a Friday frame of mind going on here toda r &gt;&gt; We haven't seen that since may or June of 2001 into that is right. </p><p>&gt;&gt; of course, could be in store for volatity. Tech stoc not coming alon for theide. Oil prices up a-- &gt;&gt; Concerns about Iran. &gt;&gt; absolutely and Iraq for that matter. The u.S. Launching its biggestng counter offense since invasion three years ago. Let's take a real quick looki at that market calendar, a smtches and practice con nd of day. Triple witcheswitches so options expiring today. And earnings of note, it is not a company affiliated with me by I like the name is tom on lean. On-line, you can shop at saks. L take a look at the options because I'm hearing there are agrees brest April call buyers in saks and willing to pay upto 90- t as&gt;&gt; And some are trailingsaraylor traders are calling that pricey. &gt;&gt; and different color green on &gt;&gt; St. Patrick's day. Folks in the north eastern united states shouldered the biggest tax responsstles ith federal taxes according to the tax foundatio it finds it highest in the state of Connecticut, $10,500 collected in taxes for every man, woman and child there. Miss miss half that t around 4 grand per person. Mississippi. &gt;&gt; and New Mexico is tops,for ee tax dollarit dsadwat gets back $2 in spending. That was the case in 2004. The lowest rate of return is New Jersey, every dollar in federal taxes brought back 55-cents in federal money to the garden state. The united nations today the security council is due hold a former discussion on what to do with the nuclear swaigz in Iran. The response comes as they work on this and calling the country to stop enriching uranium and ensuring themit is for peaceful purposed only and this would like Iran to do that in the next two weeks. &gt;&gt; moving tmcmch madness and they call it madness for a reason because it is really crazy the lengths that sports fan will go to t catch the0s, latest scores in the ncaa tournament. Graheg those f the internet used to be the way to get hoop highlights but these days there is a call for small. That is rigy can you watch the antics of tony soprano -- &gt;&gt; Today overcast, high 71. &gt;&gt; get a check on the weather. La&gt;&gt; Or score the latt sports news, all on your cell phone and for this year's ncaa tourney, wireless providers areing into over time to get to you watch their way. Cingular is showing two minute CBS video clips of march madness. &gt;&gt;as key players inhereiessgame, cingular is hoping f a profitable connection withha co mers by traerring big screen tv to cell screens. &gt;&gt; consumers understand they can do more with their phones besides make calls. They have lot of down time during the day and during those two or three or four minutes in an airport lounge or waiting for kids in the doctors office they can see their favorite tv programs. &gt;&gt; but print is answering ciular's call wi a game plan of its own. Jason coyle, senior vice president of intersport tells us his company has teamed up with sprint to provide ornal made for mobil content from the first tip off a wait to the big dance. Will get full alime news reat and analysis in the tournament, the latest scores and whais hpening, who is in trouble and why it is happening and hearing from insiders and trusted basketball personalities. &gt;&gt; timing is a criti l part of the wireless tv game. Coyle says cell phones are in play now with the tournamet because much of the audience is at office. &gt;&gt; it is not le the supebowl and seven at homeo it is the perfecttalatform for people to seek ways other than television to consume the statistics and analys. &gt;&gt; there is stale question, however, how sports fans will view tuning into a teeny tiny screen. &gt;&gt; there is no difference as far as I'm concerned. As long as there is o way to e it, this all ireally care b. I don't care if the picture is like this small. &gt;&gt; I feel more relaxed infront of my tv, obviously you are on a uch or hanging out but I uldn't say there is much difference. &gt;&gt; you watch on a phone you mean? &gt;&gt; um-hum. &gt;&gt; I can't it would be too good. Comes to sports they think small. &gt;&gt; when we choose shots or graphics we do so completely of a mind that we areproducing for a smaller screen some of we pick our shots differently andrame our shots differently and we choose our graphics differently than for television. &gt;&gt; people in the cellular industry pictures growing revenue by adding tv data to cell phones. They 6% in 2004 and 8 1/2% in 2005 and could reach 12% this year, a cear signal tv and cell phones are clicking with consumers. &gt;&gt; we will see what they say about Michigan state. &gt;&gt; did you catch thppt migan state reference of course any company that offers m basketball on t a screen is likely to be hugelygo ccessful, right. Verizon also is offering material as well on espn and fox. &gt;&gt;and success sectorful in the miles household. &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; and what about the cost of a this content though? &gt;&gt; interesting to note that intersport is really waiting for the consumer to decide. They will let coumer build business mo they say itis free if have you sprint service. &gt;&gt; if you build it, they will come. &gt;&gt; a from Iowa. &gt;&gt; that is true. Still more to come on this Friday stay close. &gt;&gt; still to come, how prepareyour who was it comes t bird flu? Plus the week's trades of the day storm board is still ahead. The winpppppp{w{w . 8@fi mane an I he fecas is dt at &gt;&gt; Here we go, we're back on this Friday. St. Patrick's day andy busch has peeled himself away from the green beer for a moment. Harris nesbitt. By the way I have to say the onlgreen I have on today in my wallet and there is not too much of it in there as well. Gold, which would you rather have? &gt;&gt; I don't like either one of these but gold mass hd up better thane thought. Earlier ie year I was telling clients 545 to 560 it would stall out and it has done that and I feel good about. That the dollar doesn't look good right now. The whole discussion as far as interest rate goes, cing this week we had 100% certainly at the beginning of the week the fed going in theg next two meetings. All the sudden by midweek that was about gone and that hurt the brean back a bit this or week. &gt;&gt; also, the dubai ports deal has put the protectionist on the united states and a lot of united statnvestors sayn. Maybe we don't want to hold so many u.S. Dollars these day into u.S. Treasure vie very ctacerned about dwl.? Chu enthusiasm he were and his bdy going China and will meet with these guys and this is what is coming dn the road. Expect something to happen. &gt;&gt;et's talk abouthe federal reseomewve. You mentioned earlier here.Ator it ould really talk lbut carry to some degrea small staple. Ben bernanke warning ut deficits and another talking about if interest rates rise and home prices start to collapse, don't come to us. We don't plan on protectithe housing ma. &gt;&gt; I tha x`jge@jge@jge@jge@jge@jg it is a cane and p`e@jge@jge@jge@jge x jge e@jge@jge@jge@jge e@jge@jge@jge@jgerjge jganjge a number comes o e@jge@jge@jge@jge@jge@jge@jge e ge@jg ge@jge@jge@jge@jge@jge@jge jge@jge@jge@jge@jge@jge@jge@jg e@jge@jge@jge@jges higher. &gt;&gt; I don't know how much success they will have. We had a decent sell-off in the bonds and yields went up to 4.80. We will have housing data later in the month and housing sales ahat is going to be weak. &gt;&gt; Monday is the thi jge@jgled invasion of Iraq. Jge@jg e@jge jge@jge@jge@jge@jge@jge@jge@jge x3e;&gt; I don't think so but it is like owning tech stoc we had a rock and roll year last year. Look at this, 23 the top ten returningstocks were empty middle east last year. Now five of the wors stocks are in the middle east this year. That is what is going on. It is very volatile. They also tie currencies to the dollar. There is pressure buildi on the middle east. One thing too, t y've increased government employee -- &gt;&gt; Spending or pensions? &gt;&gt; not pensions, payrolls. What they paying pee, 15 to 30% in each of these countries. The there's inflation there. &gt;&gt; there is a foreign policy and toll all this because when retail I vestors based in the persian gulf getsucked into these rallies an see 20% 30rbgs% loss lost, it will feed around tieing u.S.Sentime. &gt; and we are stowed g currency or mass c. How about the bot? &gt;&gt; a currency. &gt;&gt; gales? &gt;&gt; gales, that would be a mascot. &gt;&gt; all right, all right. How about the real. &gt;&gt; that would be a currency. &gt;&gt; and three for three, you are in the second round. Andy busch. &gt;&gt; I get to keep my job zoom that job by the way at harris nesbitt. &gt;&gt; thank you, tom. &gt;&gt; it is one step forward this week for a proposal in congress that is supposed to allow small billses more opportunities to provide health insurance for their workers. The full senate is set to consider this and makes it ea sier for small firms to join across state lines through to her and give them more leverage. A number of them a nothere work, over h f work for companies with fethan m oyees. The they one inoh three small firms do not offer health benefits to workers currentl &gt;&gt; Still ahead, how safe will you be if a u.S. Birdlu reaches u.S. Stores. Plus the week's trades of the day scores still ahead. The small business report brought to you by spr business, sprint business, yes, you can. P iforhersmeleunma inle picthe: &gt;&gt; 'ty' of p ic e@jge@jge ge@jg mat &gt;&gt; Today of scores st. Patrick day, spring begins next week although the flu season sll has seven or eight weeks left. We have talking about the influenza. Avia flu, the bird flu, continues to gather worries worldwide from China to Germany and France even, avian flu has been found in three dozen pcountries. Human case much moreare, 173 confirmed, 93 fatalities but it couldorth or south America in six to twelve nths. A global outbreak could cost the economy $2 million. A bad outbreak and the insurance ins information institute that could cost me30 billion in life insurance claims alone. Life insurance companies areic worries, is there anything they can do if and when it hits. Bu.Ark roberts is with us now, he is the chief t or senior managing sciencist at engineering consulting firm. Good morning to you. &gt;&gt; could companies plan for the potenssibilmuch a 9nflu. &gt;&gt; they can and they have been and they need tcontinue that. &gt;&gt; are they doing enoug &gt;&gt; It is hard to tell. How do you know when it isx enough. &gt;&gt; with those questions out there how did the company begin trying to pan plan for not the inevitable but the potential. &gt;&gt; there are certain thing jge disasters and terrorist sponse, contingency plan what have to do when certain things happen. &gt;&gt; contingency plan for a hurricane for instance, it has got to be much different compared to what could be a pan dem he can disease. &gt;&gt; in a hurricane they have three days of notice and we've got a lot more notice forpoa potntial for a influenza outbreak like they are talking about. &gt;&gt; walk us through something, from a medical srspecksive what should companeeilude as the plan anwt suld hareholders be asked investors in their corporations how they are prepared. &gt;&gt; number one is contingency plans upstream and downstream. &gt;&gt; what do you mean by that. &gt;&gt; suppliers wh a they going do when this happens. How is it going effect your act to get your product to market and your sales force. A lot of times business depend thoonz interaction between the purchaser and the product.Ec &gt;&gt; Not to be a doom sayier blue may not be a market to sell to. &gt;&gt; that is true but we don't know h it is going effect the u.S. In the global economy. Ight &gt;&gt; So ats point I think that we shouldn't hang ast lot ofrepe w t out in, say, of a reduc on of our workforce of half. &gt;&gt; what can we learn other disease outbreaks like sais at couple yearsyears ago. &gt;&gt; we learned even in a small period of time when there is pressure on community, take toronto, they lost millions as a result of that very short period of time. So I think what we have to do is think about what we can do as for as woking from home, shifting our workforces to other areas or work to other aas and also gearing soup that when the information starts c omin out that we have good communication with our employees. &gt;&gt; finally, you know, let's talk about the prepared s here because some executives said pc s marss of w and high rtedy price and pr ssure from companies, tell me when to worry about the avian they usually tell bus a week beforehand. &gt;&gt; is it time? &gt;&gt; it is not time. What is time do is set up your system to communicate your employees. &gt;&gt; got you. Dr. Mark robert has been with u, always good to see y u? &gt;&gt;: Good to be here. &gt;&gt; on this Friday we always check a week's worth of trades of the guy, pete najarian is with us. On this st.

As the firms' youthful bosses arrive each morning at their eco-friendly offices in their T-shirts and trainers, they like to imagine they are a cut above conventional business leaders. #</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Google's mission statement is ``Don't be evil'' and its founders, Larry Page, 39, and Sergey Brin, 38, say they want to make the world a better place. Facebook's freshly minted billionaire boss, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>28, claims he is dedicated to ``openness, connecting and sharing''. Before his death last year Steve Jobs, Apple's chief executive, said: ``Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter. Saying we've done something wonderful, that's what matters.''</p><p>#</p><p>The shine is coming off Silicon Valley's finest, however. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), Britain's data watchdog, announced it was reopening an investigation into Google's Street View cars, which travel around taking photographs to create the search engine's mapping service. #</p><p>It has emerged that Googleprogrammed the vehicles to gather private data, including email, web searches and photographs, from unsecured home wi-fi networks. It also stands accused of trying to cover up what it had been doing. #</p><p>European Union regulators are examining claims that Googleis abusing its dominance in the search business by ranking its own products higher up in results than those of its rivals. A similar case in the 1990s tarnished the reputation and hit the profits of Microsoft, then the world's most fearsome tech behemoth.</p><p>#</p><p>The latest moves come as Apple faces criticism over its plans for an answer to Street View: an even more intrusive 3-D service using military- grade aerial camera satellites capable of revealing objects as small as 10 centimetres across.</p><p>#</p><p>Facebook is having a torrid time, too. Shares in the world's most successful social network have fallen sharply since it floated on the Nasdaq in New York last month. To add to its woes, figures showed its hitherto phenomenal growth is beginning to slow.</p><p>#</p><p>The new figures have fuelled the anger of many disgruntled small investors who are suing Facebook over claims that it had told bankers and a select group of investors that its growth was slowing before its float - but neglected to share the information with them.</p><p>#</p><p>The recent setbacks mean the bosses of the big tech firms will spend a lot less time talking to their flipflop-wearing staff this summer and a lot more time talking to buttoned-up lawyers. Googlefaces fines if the ICO finds its Street View cars breached data protection laws. The company could also face a police investigation.</p><p>#</p><p>How did we fall out of love with these pillars of the new economy whose services and products have so quickly become central to our lives? The simple answer is that consumers and legislators alike have finally woken up to an uncomfortable truth: despite their laid-back image, these tech giants are just as corporate, money-grabbing and venal as the old-school businesses they so disdain.</p><p>#</p><p>As Rob Cox, a leading United States technology writer, puts it: ``Under the hoodies and the moral language lurk rapacious business people, robber barons, with the same profit motive that drives all businesses and a ruthlessness rivalling history's greatest industrial bullies.''</p><p>#</p><p>The charge sheet against the big tech firms is long: as well as pinching the private data of unsuspecting homeowners, carrying out creepy aerial surveillance and ripping off investors, they also stand accused of violating privacy.</p><p>#</p><p>Each makes money by vacuuming up the digital footprint we leave online and using it to sell advertisements or market products. Hardly a day passes without some new revelation of one of them taking a byte too far.</p><p>#</p><p>Googlerecently altered its computer code to circumvent the privacy settings in Apple's Safari web browser, used by hundreds of millions of people. Facebook has come under fire for allowing companies to turn users' ``likes'' into advertisements that are then sent to their own online friends. #</p><p>Googleis accused of ``looking the other way'' on copyright. Newspapers and magazines say the search engine ``steals'' their content and uses it to sell lucrative advertisements. Apple is being investigated over claims the firm, along with several publishers, colluded to raise the price of electronic books.</p><p>#</p><p>Apple has also been condemned for using Chinese manufacturers with lousy working practices. Foxconn, the Chinese factory where Apple's iPhones are made, has been investigated for treating its workers so badly many have committed suicide.</p><p>#</p><p>Aggressive tax avoidance, say critics, is practised by the big three. Google, Facebook, and Apple have set up elaborate webs of overseas companies to funnel revenues from high-tax economies through tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. #</p><p>In the end it is you and me, the users, who have the real power over the big three. If we continue to log on they will carry on growing - and doing whatever they like.</p><p>#</p><p>If we turn against them or switch to a new operator whose products and values we prefer, they will die in a heartbeat. The choice is ours - at the click of a mouse.#SRC# The Sunday Times</p><p>#</p><p>--------------------</p><p>CAPTION:</p><p>Don't be evil: Googlefounder Larry Page says he wants to make the world a better place.</p><p>Picture: REUTERS</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EVESTD-EVS1206180008153268040-BX</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EVESTD2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55X6-DRV1-JCBN-V37C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">155915</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"914\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Fairfax New Zealand All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Manawatu Standard (New Zealand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>June 18, 2012 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It's the latest in a trove of conservative literature trying to dance around the fact that high-tax, highly regulated, bureaucratic states can be economic powerhouses.</p><p>In recent years, California has indeed suffered from gridlocked government, punishing pension obligations and debt. It's been addressing these challenges. And although one cannot vouch for the wisdom of every regulation, the state's environmental ethic is a big reason smart people put up with the warts.</p><p> But only Silicon Valley is doing well, The Economist said. Manufacturing stinks. \"IPhones are 'designed by Apple in California,' \" the article noted, \"but made in Shenzhen.\"</p><p>Apple nonetheless employs 16,000 Californians in and around Cupertino and plans to expand that number to 24,000. There must be something going for Apple in California.</p><p> There's this fantasy that if our environmental regulations just went lax, America would have some renaissance in factory employment. Thing is, manufacturing output in this country has actually tripled in the last 60 years, Bloomberg Businessweek reports.</p><p>U.S. factories are simply being run with fewer, well-trained people operating computers. The low-skilled, low-wage, labor-intensive factory jobs are not coming back, and why should we want them?</p><p> The Economist seems vexed that Gov. Jerry Brown would sign a bill raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour in 2016. By the way, in 1968, the national minimum wage was $10.77 in today's dollars.</p><p> Only Silicon Valley?! Check out The Wall Street Journal's new \"Billion-Dollar Startup Club.\" These are companies valued at $1 billion or more by venture capital firms.</p><p> Of the 37 billion-dollar startups, 26 are based in the U.S. - 22 of them in California. Of the four U.S. startups not located in California, three are in New York City - not exactly your low-tax haven. The other one is in Jacksonville, Fla.</p><p> Those who strike it rich will do tax planning, and that may include buying homes in low-tax places. But the big tech innovators are still building their companies where their brainiacs want to be.</p><p> Two years ago, The Wall Street Journal published an essay titled \"California Declares War on Suburbia.\" The writer was upset that the Association of Bay Area Governments had proposed limiting new housing beyond the San Francisco and San Jose \"urban fringe\" to 3 percent of the total. Most new building would be multifamily homes.</p><p> The strict building rules have kept San Francisco a beautiful place. That's why tech people working in surrounding areas insist on making their nests in San Francisco when they could live cheaper, bigger and closer to work.</p><p> Universities are another magnet and incubator for new companies. They tend to spawn the liberal, active-government cultures in which innovation thrives.</p><p> To the states with good education, an open-minded community and an attractive environment go the tech spoils. Taxation does matter, and there's such a thing as dumb regulations. But for the knowledge economy, that's not everything or even, it seems, the big thing. California shows how.</p><p> (Harrop is a writer</p><p> for Creators Syndicate)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKPA-MERLIN5019255</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28979A74565F7C NWBKPA2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BD9-KFJ1-JD6S-R1C6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"535\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Pottsville Republican &amp; Evening Herald, Pottsville, PA<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

THANKS ALL OF YOU FOR JOINING US. &gt;&gt;&gt; NOW TO CHARLIE WITH DEVELOPING NEWS REGARDING GOLDMAN-SACHS. GOLDMAN OUT WITH STRONG EARNINGS TODAY. CHARLIE, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING? &gt;&gt; YOU NO. GOLDMAN MAY HAVEH A GREAT FOURTH QUARTER. CNBC CONFIRMED THE FIRM FINISHED VERY POORLY. PERFORMANCE IN NOVEMBER HORRIBLE ACCORDING TO A SENIOR EXECUTIVE AT THE FIRM AND THE LAST TWO WEEKS, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, PROBABLY THE WORST IN THE FIRM'S HISTORY. NOW, THERE'S TWO THINGS YOU CAN EXTRAPOLATE FROM THIS. NUMBER ONE, GOLDMAN, DESPITE ALL THE GREAT PRESS THEY GET IS NOT INFALLIBLE. NUMBER TWO, POSSIBLY THE CREDIT CRUNCH IS NOT OVER. THAT IT MAY BE PICKING UP STEAM. THAT IT'S THE BEST FIRM AND TRADING SECURITIES AND DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES IS FINISHING POORLY AT THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER. YOU CAN SEE THE STOCK PRICE ACTUALLY WENT DOWN. AS THIS RUMOR WAS CIRCULATING THROUGH THE MARKET. &gt;&gt; QUICKLY, CHARLIE. DOES THE MARKET NOW THEN WORRY THAT GOLDMAN HAS MORE EXPOSURE THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT? &gt;&gt; YES. THAT AND -- WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY, THE WHOLE MARKET HAS SOMETHING TO WORRY ABOUT GOING FORWARD. PREDICTING THE BOTTOM NOW. MAYBE PUT THIS ON THE BALANCE SHEETS, MAYBE IT'S NOT OVER YET. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO BE BACK IN A SHORT WHILE WITH SOME RUMBLINGS ON INTERNALLY FROM BEARS STERNS AND ALSO LEHMAN. WE'LL WAIT FOR THAT. &gt;&gt; MERRILL. &gt;&gt; OKAY. WE'LL LET YOU WORK THE PHONES ON THAT. &gt;&gt; THANK YOU. &gt;&gt; THANKS. SEE IF YOU A FEW MINUTES. &gt;&gt;&gt; TO OUR MARKET REPORTERS AND PERSPECTIVE OF THE MARGARET SELL-OFF ONLY DOWN ABOUT 50 POINTS NOW, ABOVE SIGNS THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, SCOTT AT THE NASDAQ SHOWING US THE NEW YORK MARKET AND THE BOSS STARTS US UP A RCHLTSZ THANK YOU, SUE. NOTHING SHORT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT IN TERMS OF MARKET REACTION, FOLKS. THE MID DAY BUZZ. THE RALLY FADED AN IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT THERE'S HEAVY 1E8ING. NO INTEREST ON PART OF BUYERS HERE. VOLUME'S ON THE LIGHT SIDE. WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT? THE ECB PUMPS LIQUIDITY INTO THE SYSTEM. YOU CAN'T COMPLAIN AND FINANCIAL WEAK, AND LEADING DOWN, FINANCIALS THROUGHOUT THE MORNING. ENERGY WAS THE LEAD ARE NOW ALSO FADING IN THE LAST 20 MINUTES OR SO. LOOK AT THE FINANCIALS HERE. CHARLIE MENTIONED GOLDMAN HERE. THE CFO IN THE MORNING WAS CAUTIOUS ON THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR THE BUSINESS. ALSO SAID THAT THEY ARE GETTING CLOSE TO THE BOTTOMED SUBPRIME BUT NOT THERE YET AS WELL. ALSO GRIPING ABOUT OVERALL EARNINGS QUALITY FROM ANALYST WHOSE PUT OUT COMMENTARY TO THAT EFFECT. ALL THE OTHER PLAYERS ALSO TO THE DOWN SIZE, MORGAN STANLEY. ENERGY WAS THE LEADER WHEN OIL WAS 93, 92, 91. NOW IT'S BELOW 90 DOLLARS AND IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ALL THE OIL STOCK. THERE'S EXXON MOBILE AS AN EXAMPLE. MOVING SOUTH, ALL, IN THE LAST 15, 20 MINUTES. ELECTRONICS, LET ME TALK ABOUT EARNINGS GROWTH QUICKLY OVER AT BEST BUY. CONCERNED ABOUT FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS EVEN THOUGH THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS REPORT WAS TERRIFIC. CONCERN, THEY GAVE GUIDANCE STILL GOOD IN THE THIRD QUARTER. FOURTH QUARTER, MAY NOT BE AT STRONG AS SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT HERE. CNBC.COM GOES OVER ALL OF THIS. SCOTT AT THE NASDAQ. &gt;&gt; THANKS. NO INTEREST FROM BUYERS WHAT BOB SAID. BOY, HIT IT ON THE HEAD. WE WENT REALLY, REALLY DOWN ABOUT A HALF HOUR OR SO AGO. IT'S THE BIG TECH TECHNOLOGY STOCKS ONCE AGAIN. NO CONVICTION TO REALLY JUMP IN RIGHT NOW. GOOGLE, APPLE, MICROSOFT, Y Y, ALL DOWN TO THE DOWN SIDE. ONE OF THE POSITIVE NOTES TODAY. ADOPEY UP 2% ON AN UPGRADE OVER DEUTSCHE BANK TO HOLD. GUIDANCE AHEAD OF ESTIMATES AND INCREASING STOCK BUYBACK BY 30 MILLION SHARE. TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SOFTWARE STOCKS. ONE OF THE FEW SECTORS IN TECHNOLOGY THAT IS UP. I WON'T TELL YOU 100% ACROSS THE BOARD, A LOT OF THE NAMES ARE UP. VERISIGN UP. ARRIBA, SYMANTEC AND BEA SYSTEMS AS WELL. AND A ROUGH GO OF IT, GARMIN. DOWN 10% NOW. I WANT TO SHOW YOU WHY AND WHAT'S HAPPENING. AND AS WE'VE KNOWN, THE GPS UNITS SELLING OFF THE SHELVES. GARMIN'S HAD A GREAT YEAR. GARMIN LOST 18 POINTS OF MARKET SHARE IN NOVEMBER. THEY LOST A TOP SPOT IN THE U.S. TO TOMTOM, DEUTSCHE BANK THOUGH CAME OUT AND SAID DON'T READ MUCH INTO THE NUMBERS.

I'm Paula Akana. Hawaii congresswoman and former Lieutenant Governor Mazie Hirono declared herself a candidate for the U.S. Senate today...setting up a primary battle with Ed Case for the seat vacated by Dan Akaka. As KITV 4's Daryl Huff reports...the decision is expected to set off a chain reaction of political ambition. hirono made her announcement on the internet from washington DC ... without making herself available for reporters' questions ...she emphasized traditional democratic credentials. </p><p>we must protect social security and medicare... On the heels of positive poll results ...experts say hirono brings her washignton experience little negative baggage to the race with Ed Case. neal milner phoner 21:58 it makes her a fairly formidable candidate Two more potential candidates..mufi hannemann and <person><nameText>colleen hanabusa </nameText></person>both said they are still considering the race ...but hirono's early announcement may force hanabusa to stick with her newly one congressional seat... while hannemann has to worry about splitting hirono's strength among traditional democrats. IF hirono wins -- her most likely opponent would be as yet undeclared linda lingle -- who beat hirono in 2002 governor's race. upper 46:23 the other and possibility even bigger opportunity for republicans is that Hirono's decision has opened up her 2nd congressional district a rarely open opportunity to represent rural oahu and the neighrbors island 41:28 definitely building a base on the neighbor islands is important to winning a statewide race so its definitely something we want to put some resources into former republican congressman charles djou might go for that race -- so might hannemann...the democrats big worry -- too many democrats. 32:21 we would discourage people just throwing their hat in the ring to throw their hat in the ring daryl huff kitv4 news Hirono won the congressional seat eight years ago. Before that she was Lieutenant governor and a state representative. Ed Case was in washington today..and did not issue a comment on Hirono's candidacy. A Texas judge has delayed AGAIN-- the public release on the cause of death... of surfing champion Andy Irons. The three-time world champion died November 2nd in a Dallas hotel room while on his way home from a competition in Puerto Rico... which he left because he was sick. He reportedly suffered from dengue fever but that was never verified. In December, a Texas judge granted a request from Irons' wife to delay releasing the report for six months. That order expires tomorrow. But a judge granted another family request today... that the report be released first to Irons' wife ... Who has 30 days to review the report. In a court filing ... Lyndie Irons said the autopsy findings could be misconstrued ... And wants other experts to review the report before it is released. Honolulu Police found a stash of drugs and cash in the home of a suspected drug dealer. Police arrested 40 year old Happy-Lee Rivera on suspicion of drug dealing at a Pearl City parking lot Friday... After a six month investigation.

Police say the case may be linked to a mainland drug ring. The case has been turned over to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. In other local news... There were some terrifying moments for residents in a Waikiki high rise today, when fire broke out and they believed they were trapped on the upper floors. Dick Allgire reports the fire damaged one unit, but filled the stairwells with thick smoke. The fire was reported at about 12:30 this afternoon at the Waikiki Sky Tower, a high rise on Cleghorn Street in the heart of Waikiki. It is a narrow street, not the easiest fit for big ladder trucks, but firefighters got there quickly. The fire was burning on the 5th floor. Residents above had smelled smoke and called for help. Grace Loomis tried to get out of the building with her cat and wheelchair bound husband, but had to turn back. 14:42 I went to the stairwell and opened it and it was full of thick smoke. So I couldn't put him in there. So I went back in the unit. I'm panicking. Grab my cat put him in the carrier and I was hoping that firemen would get here quick to help him get out. You thought you were trapped. Oh my God, yes. Firefighters did come get them and escort them out. Officials say the fire was confined to one unit on the fifth floor. 5:54 So it appears the fire began in the kitchen area. We have an investigated it yet. It doesn't look like the unit is heavily damaged. There is enough damage they won't be able to stay there. So we've called Red Cross. Reportedly two people live there. Neither home at the time. Despite the scare, there were no injuries. Firefighters are investigating whether unattended food may have caused the fire. Dick Allgire KITV 4 News. The official cause of the fire is still under investigation. Honolulu police are asking the public's help... In locating a missing 90-year-old man. Authorities say 90 year old Tai King Loo was last seen Tuesday... At about 11 A-M in the Liliha area. Loo suffers from Alzheimer's and may be disoriented. He's about 5-foot-2... And weighs about 150 pounds. He was last seen wearing a white long sleeve shirt, red sweat pants, pink \"crocs.\" If you have any information about Loo ... You are asked to call CrimeStoppers at 955-8300. Lawyers representing 100 thousand victims of a data breach at the University of Hawaii ... say the public is being misled about what is being done to protect them. Attorney Thomas Grande is questioning why U-H has not released a consultant's report recommending what should be done to protect the affected individuals who may be at risk for identity theft. UH is being urged to implement a credit monitoring program. This morning... sources told KITV that UH regents had not yet seen the report, but that once it had been reviewed, it was expected to be made public. Big Island police believe alcohol was a factor in a fatal crash on the Keeau-Pahoa highway last night. Police say 52-year-old Fidel Bautista Junior of Pahoa failed to yield the right of way to a motorcycle as he made a left turn off Highway 130 onto Ainaloa Boulevard about ten o'clock. His car collided with the motorcycle. The passenger on the motorcycle.... a 61-year-old woman from Oregon, died later at Hilo Medical Center. The motorcyclist--- a 55-year-old man from New Jersey--- was listed in serious condition. Neither were wearing a helmet. Police arrested Bautista . He faces charges of negligent homicide and driving under the influence. Forecasters expect a busy hurricane season in the Atlantic. For more on the forecast... let's go to KITV4 meteorologist Justin Fujioka. Justin, isn't this the opposite from our forecast? That's right Paula. And often times, when things are quiet here in the Central Pacific... it's very active in the Atlantic. Government forecasters say as many as 18 tropical storms may form in the months ahead... Six-to-10 of them could strengthen into hurricanes with sustained winds of at least 74 miles per hour. Three-to-six could become major hurricanes, that's category-three status or higher... with winds stronger than 111 miles per hour. A live look now across the south side of Oahu... what a difference a day makes! A lot more sunshine today... all thanks to the return of the trade winds... complete forecast, a little later. Paula? In Louisiana... Flood waters have already swallowed hunting camps... Along the Morganza Spillway. This is Krotz Springs. Crews have setup a levee to try and protect a nearby refinery... And over 200 families that live in that area. Earlier today... A man died after being pulled from the overflowing Mississippi floodwaters. He is believed to the first casualty since the river started spilling into Mississippi and Louisiana. The materials confiscated from Osama Bin Laden's compound ... are raising alarms about new terror attacks he was hoping to carry out. In a voice from the grave, the terrorist delivered one final recorded message. \"My Muslim people, we watch closely what's going on in the world today\" the voice on the watch closely what's going on in the world today\" the voice on the tape says. \"We rejoice with your rejoicing and your pride.\" That message praising the Arab spring in Egypt and Tunisia... is believed to be the same message found by Navy Seal's in Bin Laden's hideout. ABC news has learned that the seized Bin Laden files also show that the Al Qaeda leader was pushing to launch attacks on U-S soil... on or before the 10th anniversary of 9-11. \"AL QAEDA DOES LIKE TO USE THE ANNIVERSARIES THEY LIKE TO USE SIGNIFICANT DATES SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS.. SO IF THEY 10TH ANN WAS IN SOME WAY GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE ORGANIZATION AND INTO HIS GRAND PLAN WE ARE WELL INSIDE THAT WINDOW WHERE AQ WOULD HAVE STARTED PLOTTING AND WOULD HAVE STARTED PLOT IN PROGRESS.\" Meanwhile U-S officials announced today no one will receive the 25 million dollar bounty on Bin Laden's head. They say electronic intelligence... not human informants... led to finding him. Following months of unrest in the Middle East and North Africa... President Obama says the U-S WILL SUPPORT political and economic change in that region. \"OUR MESSAGE IS SIMPLE, IF YOU TAKE THE RISKS THAT REFORM ENTAILS, YOU WILL HAVE THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES.\" But in somewhat of a surprise, President Obama made an important new demand on Israel. \"WE BELIEVE THE BORDERS OF ISRAEL AND PALESTINE SHOULD BE BASED ON THE 1967 LINES WITH MUTUALLY AGREED SWAPS, SO THAT SECURE AND RECOGNIZED BORDERS ARE ESTABLISHED FOR BOTH STATES.\" President Obama will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu next week at the White House.

ABC News says they have seen a sworn declaration on TMZ written by Kerry Campbell. They also have several family members and sources who stood by the Botox story. Privacy advocates are urging Congress to strengthen mobile privacy laws for children. The concern is that too many smart phone apps are targeting kids for data collection. KITV 4's Sally Kidd is in Washington with the story. REPORTER LEDE: The big tech companies say they take children's privacy very seriously...but some lawmakers say they aren't doing enough. PKG. SCRIPT:) NATS Your child's favorite apps could be providing more than just entertainment. NATS They could be collecting data on your child's location, email and social networking activities, and other personal information. Companies can use the data for targeted advertising. Roderick Roberts/Parent \"Kids are naive and not old enough to realize what they're being targeted for, whereas a parent or someone older would understand that.\" Some in Congress say when it comes to apps and privacy for children, there should be a law for that. Sen. John Kerry/D- Massachusetts \"Common sense, very restrained, simple privacy protections.\" Online privacy laws prohibit the collection of data from kids under the age of 13, but privacy advocates say safeguards should be extended to the mobile universe. Amy Guggenheim Shenkan/Common Sense Media \"Kids are not little consumers, they are children; let's not invade their privacy and then pummel them with ads.\" Representatives from Apple, Facebook, and Google told members of a Senate panel parents have options. Alan Davidson/Google \"We have made our mobile location services opt-in only, treating this information with the highest degree of care.\" Catherine Novelli/Vice President, Apple \"If we learn that we have inadvertently received information of a child under 13, we take immediate steps to delete that information.\" Some parents say better parental oversight--not more regulation-is the answer. Mary Terry/Parent \"Are they really paying attention to what their kids are watching or playing with or getting involved with?\" Let's see how the evening rush hour is going. Justin's back with an update on what's happening on the roadways... Justin ad-lib... Justin ad-lib... BREAK #2 Trade winds will strengthen into the weekend as high pressure builds to the north. Clouds and showers will focus along windward facing slopes and higher terrain. A few showers will also affect leeward sections of the islands at times. Dry weather continues to prevail over most areas this evening as the weather pattern across the state is now a more stable trade wind regime. The few showers that are around this evening mainly dot the interior leeward Big Island with gages showing light amounts. These showers will decrease this evening with the setting sun. As the ridge north continues to strengthen tonight, the trades will ramp up and expect trade showers to fill in over windward and mauka areas overnight. The trade winds will increase and become locally strong tomorrow, especially in the windy channels and along the headlands of the Big Island and Maui. This breezy trade wind pattern will continue through the weekend as the ridge sets up far to the north of the state. Winds at summit level will shift more east-northeast and increase late in the weekend through early next week as the upper ridge shifts north of the state, possibly reaching wind advisory speeds. Precipitation amounts will be on the light side through the middle of next week as the strong flow through the boundary layer keeps the trade showers moving fast. The trade winds are expected to increase into the small craft advisory criteria in the windier marine zones adjacent to Maui and the Big Island starting tomorrow. An advisory has been issued beginning 6 A-M tomorrow and currently goes through Saturday, however these advisory conditions will likely continue in these areas at least through early next week and the advisory will need to be extended. A southwest swell will produce small to moderate breakers across south-facing shores this weekend. A northwest swell is expected to build early Friday, which will produce a noticeable increase in surf heights along north and west facing shores of most of the smaller islands. Another north-northwest swell will produce another round of similar sized surf on Sunday and Monday. The crew from the Space Shuttle Endeavour has finished installing an Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on the International Space Station. The device is designed to sift through particles... That may even help explain the origins of the universe. Meanwhile... NASA is also inspecting possible damage to heat shield tiles on the space shuttle. The tiles appear to have been gashed by falling debris during the launch. Commander Mark Kelly says they've seen this kind of stuff before-- and it's not too big of a concern. The crew returns to earth on June 1st. Still ahead on KITV 4 News... An important tool in the battle against cancer... May not be effective when it comes to ovarian cancer.

Just post it on the uLocal section of our website... in the battle against cancer-- But it doesn't work for all types of cancer. According to a new study presented at the meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncologists ... researchers found that blood tests and ultrasound- based screening for early ovarian cancer... do not reduce the risk of dying from the disease. Researchers also found that the screenings resulted in a large number of FALSE POSITIVES... which led to a large number of unnecessary biopsies and sometimes serious complications. While ovarian cancer is only the 7th most common form of cancer in women, it is the 5th leading cause of death because it is difficult to detect. Public housing will be getting a facelift... Lara Yamada joins us LIVE with a preview of what's coming up tonight at 6. Lara?

If you want to know what to do, here are the CDC's tips: Make an emergency plan. Stockpile food, water and medicine. Keep a utility knife, duct tape and battery-powered radio handy, along with some changes of clothes. But if you get bit by a zombie... The CDC says you're a goner.

THAT'S A LITTLE MORE SOLID -- &gt;&gt; HALF A MILLION PEOPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED SMALL AMOUNTS TO SENATOR BARACK OBAMA. &gt;&gt; WE'RE GEEKS BECAUSE WE LOVE THESE NUMBERS. THE 48 HOURS AFTER SUPER TUESDAY, OBAMA RAISED $7.2, HILLARY CLINTON $6.4 MILLION SMACKERS. &gt;&gt; A LOT OF CAMPAIGN MONEY. &gt;&gt; MORE THAN I'LL SEE IN THIS LIFETIME. NASDAQ STOCKS THIS DAY, WORTH NOTING THE DOW IS DOWN 110 POINTS. BIG TECH NAMES, MICROSOFT, YAHOO, INTEL AND ORACLE ALL MOVING THIS DAY. LET'S TAKE A LIVE LOOK AT THE BIG BOARD IF WE CAN QUICKLY. 116 POINTS DOWN ON THE DOW. WE HAVE A TRIPLE-DIGIT LOSS MARKING WHAT HAS BEEN A ROUGH WEEK FOR STOCKS. COMING UP ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS ROUGH, ROUGH MARKET, THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE MESS. IS JUST ANOTHER SCANDAL LIKE INSIDERS TRADING BACKDADING EARNINGS OR IS IT SOMETHING ALL TOGETHER DIFFERENT? WE'LL TALK TO A FORMER WORLDCOM INSIDER, A WHISTLE BLOWER STRAIGHT AHEAD. &gt;&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW THE NAMES AND KNOW THEM WELL. ENRON, 'EM CLONE, WORLDCOM. IT'S BEEN LESS THAN A DECADE THE LARGEST CORPORATE SCANDALS HAPPENED IN THIS COUNTRY AS THOSE SCANDALS UNFOLDED. WE'RE SEEING A WHOLE NEW SET OF SCANDALS AND LOSSES TOPPING $100 BILLION BUCKS. IS IT ABOUT CORPORATE CULTURE? LET'S ASK THE WORLDCOM WHISTLE BLOWER AND THE AUTHOR OF EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES, THE JOURNEY OF A CORPORATE WHISTLE-BLOWER. A CENTRAL QUESTION THAT STUART AND I HAVE BEEN ASKING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. HOW DID WE GET BACK TO THIS? EVEN THOUGH THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ACCOUNTING SCANDAL AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY, HOW DID WE GET BACK TO THIS? LOSSES LIKE THIS SO QUICKLY? &gt;&gt; YEAH. WELL, IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I'VE ACTUALLY WRITTEN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE I SAW SO MANY PEOPLE SUFFER GOING THROUGH THE WORLDCOM FRAUD AND ALL THESE OTHER SCANDALs AS WELL. AND IN MY OPINION WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE FRAUD. FRAUD WILL ALWAYS BE WITH US BECAUSE OF HUMAN NATURE, GREED, PRIDE, A SENSE OF MISGUIDED LOYALTY. WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS FIND MORE BALANCED REGULATION. WE CONTINUE TO SEE CYCLES WITH WE HAVE SCANDALS, HUGE MARKET BUBBLES. IF YOU LOOK AT SOME TO THE PARALLELS BETWEEN TELL COME AND WHAT WE SEE IN THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY, CHIEF CAPITAL INTO THE MARKET, HUGE BUBBLES, WHEN THE BUBBLE BURST, RISK TAKING. AND OFTEN UNDERNEATH THERE'S FRAUD BECAUSE THERE'S THE SEVERE PRESSURE THAT COMES TO BEAR. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU SAYING THE ROOT OF ALL THIS, THE ACCOUNTING SCANDALS AND THIS IS WALL STREET? AND THE GREED THERE THAT JUST FEEDS THE DESIRE TO MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE? &gt;&gt; WELL, GREEDY THINK IS CERTAINLY A PART OF IT. WHEN YOU HAVE THESE SCANDALS, REGULATORS ARE OFTEN ASKED TO STEP INTO THE GAP IN CRISIS MODE. WHEN YOU STEP IN CRISIS MODE, SOMETIMES THE PENDULUM CAN SWIN</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GBDENG-95896468</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GBDENG2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4RSX-JWC0-TW7J-30KH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">297753</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"451\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 inewsnetwork Inc.

EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO INVESTORS CITI LAGS ITS PEERS IN EARNINGS GROWTH EXPECTED TO BE NEGATIVE THIS YEAR AND IN STOCK PERFORMANCE. EVEN THOUGH ITS PE IS JUST TEN AND ITS DIVIDEND YIELD IS ALMOST 4%. &gt;&gt; IT IS, A GOOD VALUE. I THINK THOUGH THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILIP EQUAL, OUTPERFORMANCE FOR THE SHARES. I THINK THE SHARES NEED GROWTH CATALYST PERHAPS, YOU KNOW, TO PROVIDE, SHAREHOLDERS WITH AN ATTRACTIVE TOTAL RETURN. &gt;&gt; ALSO, WEIGHING ON THE SHARES, MANY OF WEILL'S TOP LIEUTENANTS HAVE LEFT INCLUDING COO ROBERT WILLEM STAD AND GLOBAL CONSUMER CHIEF. THAT LEAVES THE RETAIL BUSINESS WHICH GENERATES MORE THAN HALF OF THE BANK'S PROFITS IN THE HANDS OF NEW MANAGERS. FIDELITY CUT ITS STAKE BY 40% SINCE LAST YEAR. PUTNAM SLASHED ITS HOLDING ALMOST IN HALF. IN JUST THREE MONTHS, MERRILL LESS A RENDINO WHO MANAGES $16 BILLION CUT HIS STAKE BY 10%. USING THAT MONEY TO BUY SHARES OF JPMORGAN CHASE. &gt;&gt; I STILL OWN CITY CORP. I STILL LIKE IT. A BROKEN COMPANY DOESN'T EARN $20 BILLION A YEAR. THERE IS LOT OF GOOD HERE AND OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF POTENTIAL OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T CONTINUE TO OWN IT. I THINK THEY NEED TO ARTICULATE WHERE THEY'RE HEADING. &gt;&gt; FOR THAT HE AND OTHERS ARE LOOKING TO SANDY WEILL'S SUCCESSOR. MELISSA LEE, CNBC BUSINESS NEWS. JOE: TOMORROW ON THE \"CLOSING BELL\" WE'LL TAKE A LOOK WHY DRUG COMPANY, PFIZER, HAS BEEN UNDER PRESSURE. MARIA: LISTEN UP IT'S TIME TO STOP TRADING BECAUSE \"MAD MONEY\"'S JIM CRAMER IS HERE ONCE AGAIN TO TELL US HOT STOCKS HE IS WATCHING RIGHT NOW. JIM? &gt;&gt; LET AS TALK ABOUT CITIGROUP. IT'S A CHEAP STOCK. WHOLE GROUP IN INCREDIBLY CHEAP. SOME OF THE FINANCIALS ARE SELLING AT FOUR OR FIVE. ACCREDITED LEND. THAT'S SELLING 4 1/2 TIMES EARNINGS. CITIGROUP IS NO REAL BARGAIN. THAT REASSURING THE TO HEAR THE PRINCE SAY HE DOESN'T WANT TO SELL. I THINK THE STOCK HELD UP WELL. LARGE SELLERS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO KNOCK IT DOWN. I THINK IT'S ABOVE AVERAGE IN THE GROUP. I RATHER BE IN WACHOVIA BETTER YIELD OR JPMORGAN MORE CATALYSTS. PEOPLE ARE SAYING QUIET BULL MARKET GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN BIG TECH. MICROSOFT, NOW STARTING TO CHALLENGE, BACK TO WHERE IT'S BEEN, HASN'T BEEN HERE A LONG TIME. INTEL BOUNCING VERY NICELY. MICRON, TEXAS INSTRUMENTS. MARVELL. ALL THESE ARE ACTING MUCH, MUCH BETTER. OUT OF OIL INTO TECH TRADE SEEMS TO BE ALIVE AND WELL ON WALL STREET, MARIA. MARIA: TECHNOLOGY A RISKY GROUP. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OWNING MICROSOFT AT A TIME HERE IS STOCK THAT HASN'T DONE ANYTHING IN FIVE YEARS, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; IN ANOTHER TEN DAYS I THINK CLAMORING FOR XBOX 360 WILL BE A HARRY POTTER MEETS \"LORD OF THE RINGS\". I THINK EVERYBODY WILL BE ON THE BUZZ ABOUT IT. MY UNDERSTANDING ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ONE. I THINK THAT WILL CREATE A NICE FRENZY. IT WILL BECOME THE LOGICAL GIFT FOR CHRISTMAS. I THINK THAT PROPELS MICROSOFT INTO 2006. AND THEN, WE GET THE, VISTA, WHICH IS NOT GOING TO BE LATER INTO 2006. THERE ARE SERIES OF STORIES OUT THERE MAY MAKE SOFT THE CHEAPEST AND BEST TECH. MARIA: LET'S TALK ABOUT OTHER TECHS. YOU MENTIONED TEXAS INSTRUMENTS SORRY TO DO THIS AGAIN. WHAT WAS THE PRICE YOU TOLD ME TO BUY IT BEFORE THE. &gt;&gt; 30.301. MARIA: NOW AT 31. &gt;&gt; REITERATED TO BUY IT AT 28 AND 27. PEOPLE SHOULD BOUGHT THE HECK OUT OF IT. THIS IS ONE OF THE SITUATIONS LIKE MOTOROLA WHICH ALSO WENT DOWN AFTER THEY REPORTED. LIKE APPLE WHICH WENT DOWN AFTER THEY REPORTED ALL THE COMPANIES WERE BEING SLAMMED BY SHORTS MOMENT THEY CAME OUT. TURNED OUT TO BE PRETTY GOOD OPPORTUNITIES. AS LONG AS OIL STAYS DOWN I THINK A SEE A LOT OF MONEY COMING INTO TECH. I THINK OIL TRADE IS PROBABLY DONE FOR THE YEAR UNLESS WE GET A REAL COLD SPIKE. TECH TRADE HAS JUST START. &gt;&gt; THERE IS LOT OF MONEY OUT THERE. THAT'S NUMBER ONE. &gt;&gt; SURE. PLUS, THE NOVEMBER, DECEMBER, HISTORICALLY TERRIFIC MONTHS FOR TECH. WE'RE NOT HEARING ANYTHING BAD OUT OF RETAIL ANYMORE BECAUSE OF GASOLINE COMING DOWN. I ALSO THINK, LOOK AT CORNING BACK TO 20. I SANDISK PULLING BACK UNDERSTANDABLY BECAUSE IT'S HAD SUCH A BIG MOVE. PRINCE NAILED THE APPLE. I THINK APPLE STILL A GOOD CHRISTMAS PLAY. I'M NOT HEARING THAT ANY CON HE TRO VERTS THE NOTION THAT TECH IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER WON'T BE EXACT PLACE TO BE. KEEP IN MIND CISCO REPORTS WEDNESDAY. I HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE IN JDSU WHICH REPORTS WEDNESDAY GIVEN THE FACT THE COMPANY MADE CHANGES TO GET IT ON RIGHT COURSE. MARIA: LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR YEAR-END RALLY. &gt;&gt; SURE AM. MARIA: YOU CAN SEE EVEN MORE OF JIM'S PICKS AND HIS OPINIONS ON \"MAD MONEY\" TONIGHT AT 6:00 AND 9:00 EASTERN ON CNBC. JOE: WITH 20 MINUTES BEFORE THE CLOSING BELL WE'VE GOT THE DOW, UP 46 POINTS. NASDAQ UP ABOUT 6. RIGHT NOW. MARIA: CASH, COLD CASH ALMOST ONE-THIRD OF THE COMPANY'S IN THE S&amp;P 500 HAVE MORE CASH THAN DEBT. UP NEXT WE'LL TAKE A LOOK WHERE THE CASH IS GOING WHICH COMPANIES ARE STASHING THE CASH AND WHICH MAY BE RIGHT FOR YOUR PORTFOLIO. BACK IN A MOMENT. JOE: IT WAS A COVER STORY. OF \"BARRON'S\" HOARDING CASH. THAT'S WHAT LOTS OF COMPANIESES ARE DOING THESE DAYS. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CHART. THE CASH STASH OF THE S&amp;P 500, INDUSTRIALS HAVE SOARED TO $622 BILLION SO FAR THIS YEAR. FAR, FAR ABOVE LEVELS JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. WE DIG DEEPER INTO THE MEANING OF THESE CASH STASHES. HARD TO SAY. HOPE DON'T HAVE TO SAY IT TOO MANY MORE TIMES. HENRY McVEY FROM MORGAN STANLEY SAID THE COMPANIES SHOULD PUT CASH TO GOOD USE OR RISK DRAGGING DOWN THEIR EQUITY. JANNA SAMPSON LIKES TO THE CASH AS LONG AS IT'S USED TO BUY SHARES. USING IT TO BUY BACK SHARES IS DIFFERENT THAN SITTING ON IT, JANNA? &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. SAT CASH ON IS NOT WORKING FOR INVESTOR OR COMPANIES. IT'S NOT A GOOD THING. JOE: BUFFETT IS LIKE THE ONE \"BARRON'S\" POINTED OUT WITH THE BIGGEST CASH HOARD. HE MAY NOT FIND ANYTHING HE LIKES RIGHT NOW. FOR REGULAR INDUSTRIAL COMPANY, I MEAN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE DEBT? YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO USE DEBT. NOT SUPPOSED TO SIT ON CASH, ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; I THINK THAT'S WHAT EQUITY INVESTORS ARE SAYING SHOW ME THE MONEY. EVERYBODY WANTED TO PAY DOWN DEBT AFTER BUBBLE THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WHAT HAPPENED THERE IS PERIOD WHERE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH DON'T OUT THERE. COMPANIES ARE FLUSH WITH CASH HURTING RETURN ON EQUITY THAT IS NUMBER ONE THING DRIVING VALUATIONS IN THE S&amp;P RIGHT NOW. I LOOK AT MANAGEMENT'S SAYING YOU DID THE RIGHT THINGS. GO THE NEXT LEG AND START TO REDEPLOY THE CAPITAL. JOE: JANNA, EVERYBODY LIKES BUYBACKS. IT SEEMS LIKE IT KEEPS THE STOCK OF THE PRICE UP BUT EVERYBODY, TALKED ABOUT EASTMAN KODAK. 07 LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. BUY MORE BACK AT 60. THAT WAS THROWING MONEY DOWN THE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT I'M NOT GOING TO BE CRASS. &gt;&gt; DRAIN. JOE: THROWING IT RIGHT DOWN THE DRAIN. WHAT IF YOU'RE STOCK IS NOT A GOOD BUY, DOESN'T HELP BUYING BACK STOCK, DOES IT? &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT MORE THAN CASH AND BUYBACKS. YOU HAVE TO EVALUATE THE WHOLE COMPANY. SOME OF THESE STOCKS WILL BE GOOD, INVESTMENTS. OTHERS WON'T. JOE: WHAT ABOUT DIVIDENDS? GIVE ME SOME MONEY. SHOW ME MONEY. GIVE ME DIVIDENDS. &gt;&gt; THAT'S A LEGITIMATE USE ALSO. THAT SAYS THE COMPANY HAS NO BETTER OPTIONS FOR THE MONEY THAN TO PAY IT OUT TO SHAREHOLDERS. I THINK LOTS OF US THINK EITHER INVESTING IN THEIR OWN STOCK IF IT'S REASONABLY PRICE OR, PUTTING IT TO WORK, AND, LOOKING FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FOR THE COMPANY IS BETTER OPTION USUALLY. JOE: HENRY IS THIS HANG OVERFROM THE BUBBLE. &gt;&gt; NO DOUBT. WHAT WE FOUND, JOE COMPANIES THAT BUY BACK MORE THAN 4% OF THE THEIR STOCK ACTUALLY GET PAID FOR IT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT MARKET THIS YEAR COMPANIES WITH YIELDS ABOVE 3% IN EARNINGS GROWTH ABOVE 10% THAT'S SWEET SPOT. THAT'S WHERE THE SWEET SPOT IS IN THE S&amp;P. WE ALSO THINK YOU WILL SEE A WAVE OF M&amp;A. EUROPE WILL DO ABOUT A TROLL DOLLARS IN M&amp;A. WE THINK NEXT WE'RE WILL BE THE BIG YEAR IN THE U.S. WE THINK THE MONEY IS STARTING TOM BACK TO THE SHAREHOLDERS. I LOOK FOR BATAAN BEING PASSED FROM FIXED IN TO EQUITY HOLDERS IN '06, WE'RE WAITING FOR CORPORATE MANAGERS TO UPGRADE I-T SYSTEMS. DOESN'T HAVE TO GO TO SHAREHOLDERS. SEEMS LIKE CORPORATE MANAGERS RELUCTANT AFRAID TO HE DEPLOY IT IN NORMAL WORKINGS IN THE COMPANY. &gt;&gt; THIS IS GOOD POINT. WE DID A SURVEY OF 1,000 FORTUNE 500 CFO Z INTERNAL HURDLE RATE IS 13 TO 14%. THAT'S TOO HIGH. THE SECOND THING I WOULD SAY, EXPECT MORE SPENDING IN NONI-T WELL LIVE TO I-T. 90'S WAS ABOUT THE I-T BUDGET FLUSH. NEXT COUPLE YEARS WILL BE ABOUT NONI-T. WE'RE LOOKING FOR NONI-T CAP-EX TO RUN 6 1/2% IN '06. WE'RE LOOKING FOR I-T ABOUT 5%. THERE WILL BE SPOTS TO MAKE MONEY ON CAP-EX TRADE. YOU HAVE TO BE A LITTLE MORE SELECTIVE. JOE: JANNA, IF WE SEE BIG BUILDUP OF CASH IN THE MUTUAL FUND COFFERS OR INVESTORS POCK ACCOUNTS WE THINK THAT'S BULLISH. IS THIS BULLISH FOR THE MARKET THESE COMPANIES HAVE ALL THE CASH OR IT BEARISH? &gt;&gt; I THIS IT'S TAIL END OF BEARISH. I THINK IT'S RESULT OF BEARISH FIVE YEARS FOR PARTICULARLY LARGE CAP GROWTH STOCKS. MOST OF THOSE HIGHLIGHTED WERE LARGE CAP GROWTH STOCKS THAT HAVE BEEN VERY OUT OF FAVOR SO IT'S THE END OF THE BEARISH PHENOMENON. MAYBE THAT'S BEGINNING OF SOMETHING BULLISH. THANKS, GUYS. APPRECIATE IT. GOOD TO SEE YOU HENRY AND JANNA. MARIA: IT'S INTERESTING, JOE, ALL OF THE CASH ON SIDELINES IS NOT DOING MUCH FOR THE MARKET. THAT IS QUESTION WE'LL TALK ABOUT IN OUR NEXT INTER VIEW. GOT 12 MINUTES BEFORE THE CLOSING BELL SOUNDS ON WALL STREET. DOW AND NASDAQ HOLDING STRONG. JOE: COMING UP NEXT OUR MARKET BULL AND BEAR BATTLE IT OUT FOR BRAGGING RIGHTS. TOPIC, TRADE, CASH AND THE FOURTH QUARTER. MARIA: NOW ON-LINE INVESTING IN RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNTS EACH MONTH IN DIVIDEND PAYING COMPANIES THAT CAN YIELD SOME BIG RESULTS. CHECK IT OUT ON OUR WEB SITES PLUS PORTFOLIO TOOLS AND LATEST STOCK ACTION ON CNBC.COM ON MSN. m9 &gt;&gt; WE WERE TALKING ABOUT CASH REALLY IS KING FOR COMPANIES AND SHARE BUYBACKS HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN ALL THE RAGE BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY HELPING THE MARKET. LET'S HEAR IT FROM THE BULLS AND BEARS AND FIND OUT WHY. OUR BULL, NED RILEY CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT RILEY ASSET MANAGEMENT. OUR BEAR, DAVID KOTOK, CHIEF INVESTMENT ADVISER FOR CUMBERLAND ADVISORS. WE WANT TO BEGIN IT OFF ASKING YOU BOTH WOULD YOU INVEST IN A CERTAIN COMPANY BECAUSE OF THE BUYBACK HISTORY BECAUSE OF THE DIVIDEND HISTORY? IS THAT ONE OF THE KEY REASONS FOR YOU WHEN IN FACT, WHEN YOU DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO OWN A STOCK? &gt;&gt; I WILL GO FIRST. IT WOULD BE ONE OF THE REASONS, BUT NOT NECESSARILY TOTAL REASON. I LOOK FOR COMPANIES WITH HIGH RETURN ON EQUITY AND CAPITAL WHICH INCLUDES DEBT AS WELL. I LOOK FOR COMPANIES THAT HAVE GOOD SECULAR GROWTH RATES. WHETHER THEY BUY THEIR STOCK BACK OR NOT I THINK IF YOU BUY IT AT RIGHT PRICE, IN OTHER WORDS RELATIVE TO YOUR RETURNS IT WILL BE A GREAT INVESTMENT. I THINK STOCKS THAT ARE BUYING BACK TODAY ARE CHEAP STOCKS. I HEARD JOE'S ARGUMENT ABOUT EASTMAN KODAK AGREE. MANAGEMENT IS BIASED NO QUESTION. YOU GOT TO PICK COMPANIES YOU THINK LONG TERM I WOULD USE IT, YEAH. MARIA: DAVID, HOW COME WIE HAVEN'T SEEN A REACTION FROM INVESTORS. WE HAVE ALL THE CASH ON SIDELINES AND COMPANIES BUYING BACK STOCK AND INSTITUTING DIVIDENDS. WHY IS THAT NOT HELPFUL TO THE MARKET. &gt;&gt; I HAVE TO AGREE WITH NED YOU DON'T MAKE DECISION ON CASH. SMALL, MID-CAP COMPANIES THAT ARE HEAVY IN CASH COULD BE TARGETS THAT COULD AFFECT THE STOCK PRICE. LARGER COMPANY COMPANIES YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT OTHER THINGS. WHAT CURRENCY IS IT IN HOW MANY SUBSIDIARY IS DO THEY HAVE AROUND THE WORLD. MICROSOFT HAD A LOT OF CASH BIG DIVIDEND STOCK HASN'T DONE VERY MUCH. LET GROWTH CATCH FIRE IN THE MICROSOFT THAT WILL MOVE THE STOCK NOT THE CASH. YOU LOOK AT EXXONMOBIL. BIG BUYBACK THAT'S NOT MOVING THE STOCK. THAT STOCK IS DOUBLE WHAT IT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO BECAUSE OF HIGHER OIL AND ENERGY PRICES. I DON'T THINK CASH IS DRIVER IN BIG CAPS. MARIA: WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY, GUYS. &gt;&gt; I THINK TODAY IS JUST ANOTHER GREAT DAY AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IN THE MARKET. I'M STILL BULLISH, BULLISH FOR THE FACT FIRST OF ALL JOE'S SEGMENT THE CASH IS AVAILABLE ON CORPORATE SIDE. THERE IS CASH VEIL ON INDIVIDUAL SIDE. MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY THE MARKET DOESN'T, ACT TO WHAT IS HAPPENING TODAY. IT'S ACT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. IF YOU GO BACK TO THIS FED TIGHTENING EVERYBODY IS FOCUSING ON GO BACK LOOK AT TIMES THEY HAVE TIGHTENED THEN EASED. WHEN THEY TIGHTENED THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF THE TIGHTENING PROCESS THE MARKET WAS UP ALMOST 10% ON AVERAGE AND SIX MONTHS AFTER THE TIGHTENING WAS CONCLUDED MARKET WENT UP ANOTHER 9% THAT'S WHY THE MARKET IS GOING UP TODAY BECAUSE OF THAT. &gt;&gt; NED, YOU CAN'T EASE UNTIL THE TIGHTENING IS OVER. WE'RE LOOKING AT, THE FUTURES MARKET ARE PRICING, 4.50 TO -- &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN CARE OR NOT. &gt;&gt; HOW RIGHT HAS THE FUTURES MARKETS BEEN IN THE LAST YEAR-AND-A-HALF, ZERO. &gt;&gt; FUTURES MARKETS HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD ABOUT PRICING FED FUNDS IN THE NEAR TERM. &gt;&gt; WE'RE PRICING IN 4.50 TO 4.57 COMING WITH A NEW FED CHAIRMAN. EVERY FED CHAIRMAN HAS RAISED RATES WHEN THEY TOOK OFFICE EXCEPT THE ONES WHO GOT INTO TROUBLE LIKE ARTHUR BURNS. YOU CAN'T SAY, YOU'VE GOT TO GET TO EASING THERE IS NO EASING. &gt;&gt; YOU AND I HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE. MARKET HAS RUSSEN --. MARIA: GENTLEMEN, GENTLEMEN. WE CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING OVER EACH OTHER. WHEN ARE YOU EXPECTING THAT YOU WILL SEE THE END OF THE FED TIGHTENING CYCLE, DAVID? BECAUSE CLEARLY AT SOME POINT, IF THE MARKET DOES BUY INTO THAT, WE ARE COMING TO AN END THAT WOULD BE A POSITIVE, RIGHT FOR STOCKS? &gt;&gt; THE FED, YES IT WOULD BE POSITIVE AND I WOULD GO TO 100% INVESTED AS SOON AS I THOUGHT THE FED TIGHTENING WAS NOT ONLY ENDING BUT WE HAD ECONOMIC WEAKNESS TO JUSTIFY IT. &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; THIS FED IS ACTING PREEMPTIVELILY, MARIA. THAT'S WHY IT'S GOING TO RAISE RATES UNTIL ITS SATISFIED THAT THE RISK OF INFLATION IS SQUASHED AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT WILL BE SO PAINFUL TO STOP IT IF IT IT GETS OUT OF CONTROL. WE HAVE A PROBE ACTIVE PREEMPTIVE FED THE DANGER IS THEY OVERSHOOT IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE OVERSHOOTING RIGHT NOW. CAN I MAKE A POINT HERE? MARIA: YES. &gt;&gt; THE STOCK MARKET IS 8% SINCE FED IS NOT OUT. THE HIGHER RATES SLOWED THE AS SENT BUT NOT KILLED T. MARKET WILL ANTICIPATE. IF DAVID IF YOU WAIT FOR THE DAY TO SAY WE'RE STOPPED THE MARKET WILL BE UP 15 OR 20%. YOU WILL MISS IT. MARIA: GENTLEMEN, THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUES FOR SURE AT ANOTHER TIME. NED RILEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU. DAVID KOTOK SEE YOU AGAIN. &gt;&gt; THANKS, DAVE. JOE: FOUR MINUTES LEFT, 4 1/2 MINUTES BEFORE THE CLOSING BELL. WE'RE BACK ABOVE 50 PINES ON DOW. ALMOST 120600. NASDAQ UP ABOUT 8 POINTS. -- 10600. WE'RE COMING RIGHT BACK WITH THE CLOSING COUNTDOWN. JOE: THERE IS THE DOW, YOU CAN SEE UP ABOUT 55 POINTS. NASDAQ TRADING ABOUT 8 POINTS HIGHER. LESS THAN TWO MINUTES TO GO BEFORE THE CLOSING COUNTDOWN. TIME FOR THE COUNTDOWN. JOINING US GREG CHURCH, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER FOR CHURCH CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND, WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A LITTLE BIT OF A RALLY HERE, DON'T YOU THINK, GREG, OVER LAST COUPLE WEEKS? &gt;&gt; IT'S BEEN A DECENT RALLY, JOE. WE HAD SUCH A SELL-OFF IN OCTOBER WE'RE JUST MAKING UP FOR SOME LOST GROUND HERE. IT'S GOT A NICE FEEL TO IT. JOE: EVERY TIME WE GO UP NO NOT BECAUSE OF THE ENERGY STOCKS. THAT IS SORT OF A HEADWIND WHICH FIGURES, RIGHT. OIL GOES TO 70 KILLS THE MARKET T COMES DOWN AND EXXON DRAGS THE DOW DOWN. &gt;&gt; IT DOES, JOE. OIL STILL AT 60. AND I STILL THINK THE TOP OF THIS RANGE IS PROBABLY ABOUT 10800 ON THE DOW. JOE: WHAT ABOUT FINANCIALS? YOU LIKE THE STEEPENING OF YIELD CURVE? CAN THEY MAKE MONEY NOW? &gt;&gt; I THINK BANK STOCKS ARE CHEAP. THEY HAVE BEEN HORRIBLE PERFORMERS NOBODY LIKES THEM. I THINK IF THE YIELD CURVE STEEPENS UP. IF YOU CAN GET 810% EARNINGS GROWTH WITH 4% DIVIDEND THAT IS 14% RETURN I WILL TAKE IT. JOE: YOU LIKE CITIGROUP, J.P.. &gt;&gt; IF J AND P COMES DOWN I THINK THEY SHOULD BUY THEM. JOE: WE HAD PRINCE ON YOU'RE IN PRETTY GOOD COMPANY. HE BOUGHT HIS CITI, $2.75. &gt;&gt; I DIDN'T GET IT THAT LOW. JOE: ALL RIGHT, GREG, APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. [CLOSING BELL RINGING] THERE IS THE CLOSING BELL. LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO END ON A POSITIVE NOTE WITH THE DOW UP SOME 50 POINTS. UP 53.

Verdi Discusses Hollywood Deals and Tech Investments in Apple and NXT-ID Inc.'s (OTCQB: NXTD) Wocket NEW YORK and POINT ROBERTS, Washington - May 19, 2014 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Verdi to Produce/Executive Produce Three Films with Oscar winning Director Martin Scorsese: Star studded actors include Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver \"You may see a Wocket in a very famous Pocket\" - C. Verdi Investorideas.com, a global news source covering leading topics and sectors including technology and entertainment, releases an exclusive Q&amp;A with entrepreneurial movie producer, businessman and investor Chad A. Verdi of Rhode Island. Mr. Verdi discusses new and recent ventures including new movie deals and his investments in game-changing technologies, including Apple and biometric mobile security company NXT-ID Inc., (<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fq%3Fs%3DNXTD%26amp%3Bql%3D0\">OTCQB: NXTD</url>), which is currently preparing to launch its smart wallet, the Wocket\u2122 (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wocketwallet.com\">www.wocketwallet.com</url>), with advance orders starting May 28th. Mr. Verdi notes, \"I am always looking ahead and I'm never satisfied with 'good enough', My goal is to partner with the best, hire the best talent and invest in leading edge companies. </p><p>Steve Jobs made Apple known for 'Think different', Richard Branson made his motto, 'Screw it , let's do it' and I live by 'Go big or go home'.\" Q&amp;A Interview: Q: Investorideas.com This past year has already seen you reach some key milestones; making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less than a year. What are you most excited about for the balance of this year? A: Chad A. Verdi Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am the most excited about NXTD right now, only because they are about to launch the Wocket\u2122 this month. Wocket\u2122 is a smart wallet with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics. I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide. Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it. I think Wocket\u2122 has the right approach; separate from your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens if they lose their phone or it gets stolen - what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket\u2122, it's not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info are safe! It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the payment sector that I thought it would! Q: Investorideas.com In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks and invest in smaller companies with emerging technology like NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off? A: Chad A. Verdi I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like I have with NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works. Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but it's hard to know if the vision will stay intact. NXTD is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that. In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and currently needs. The Wocket\u2122 can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product; the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my second-largest holding. Q: Investorideas.com The company stated that they will launch the Wocket\u2122 May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking advance orders for the Wocket\u2122 once the event is done. Will you be attending and will you be buying one once advance orders are opened up? A: Chad A. Verdi For sure I will be there supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket\u2122 is embraced. And of course, I will be buying many, many Wockets\u2122! I will be giving them out to all of my actor and celebrity friends in Hollywood. Soon, you may see a Wocket\u2122 in a very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event. Q: Investorideas.com Speaking about Hollywood and movies, you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB you have signed on Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films. It seems like you are on fire! How did this all come about? A: Chad A. Verdi Yes, it's just nuts, crazy nuts! It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his producing partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,' Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and they invited us to the premiere of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called 'Bad Hurt' that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated to where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, 'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza. Q: Investorideas.com That is exciting and all happening very fast. How many years will it take you to complete these four films and what about the ten picture deal with Screen Media? A: Chad A. Verdi That's what's amazing. Eighteen months in regards to the four films: Bad Hurt is in post-production right now along with A 50 Year Argument. Bleed for This and Silence will be filmed this fall with completion dates no later than fall 2015, just in time for the Oscars. As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December 2014. Then we begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is to meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to facilitate this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions. Both companies are working separately and independent of one another and this gives us the capacity to handle the volume of projects we are involved with.

A 20-year old woman is dead after a rafting accident on the Green River yesterday evening. Investigators say tragedies liek that could have been avoided if she had been wearing a life jacket.KIRO 7 Eyewitness News Reporter Lori 33 33 33 33 The victim's name has not been released. 33 33 33 not been released.The victim's name has 33 you are.\" 33 The victim's name has not been released. 33 33 A man who was the focus of a lengthy police chase in South Everett --is locked up this morning.Police dogs were brought out to sniff around the woods and water near the Mallard Cove Apartments.They were looking for a man who ran off during a traffic stop when police found out he had a warrant out for his arrest. After more than three hours , deputies found him hiding and arrested him. 33 The gunmen who broke into a Thurston home and shot a man ...have not been caught yet.It happened at this home in Lacey yesterday morning.Two men burst into the home of 23-year-old Mark Maynard and shot him three times.His grandmother says he was able to tell police he didn't know the men who shot him and grabbed stuff from his house. 33 Police immediately set up roadblocks in the area and the state patrol's airplane circled overhead trying to spot the suspects...but they got away.We're still waiting to hear how the victim is doing. 33 This morning there's an arrest warrant out for that pilot who disappeared last week near Chinook Pass. Yesterday searchers called off efforts to find George Trupp of Snoqualmie.He has a court date in Pierce County tomorrow to face indecent liberties charges.Trupp was returning from Idaho when he disappeared...despite the fact that he's not supposed to leave Western Washington. 33 Trupp's roommate says he had flown to Montana and Colorado before vanishing on his return trip. 33 One year ago... CBS News Correspondent Kimberly Dozier was seriously wounded in a car bombing while reporting on a story in Baghdad about American soldiers working with Iraqi security forces. Her cameraman Paul Douglas, and soundman James Brolan were killed in the bombing, as well as the U-S Army captain who they were following... and his Iraqi translator. Dozier literally died on the operating table, but thanks to all the generous soldiers who donated their blood, she survived. In a prime-time special tonight... she talks about the attack...and a life-threatening bacteria that affects many soldiers who suffered similar injuries in Iraq... and a medication that is equally toxic. 33 A CBS News Primetime Special featuring Kimberly Dozier... that's on \"FLASHPOINT\" tonight at ten.. right here on KIRO-7. 33 Cindy Sheehan... the California mother who became an anti-war activist after her son was killed in Iraq... says she's walking away from the peace movement.Sheehan believes her son died \"for nothing.\"She also says she is exhausted by the personal, financial and emotional toll of the past two years... and wants to spend more time with her surviving children. 33 Last week the Seattle Super Sonics added Kansas City to the team's list of potential new homes. But IF the Sonics leave town .. will the economic impact be felt throughout Seattle?? KIRO 7 Eyewitness News Reporter Michelle Millman is live this morning at 33 33 33 33 33 K7ENEWS. 33 Our partner, \"The News Tribune,\" reports new standards for air quality could be trouble for Tacoma and other Washington cities. The federal government last year announced a new limit on \"soot\" focusing on Tacoma's South End.But now the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency concluded that the city's dirty air isn't exclusive to a single neighborhood, or even confined to Tacoma. Under federal law, the state Department of Ecology has until mid-December to identify Washington communities unlikely to meet the new standard. 33 This morning Sound Transit celebrates completion of a major eastside project.It's the new freeway transit station and pedestrian bridge over 405 that you can see on this live D-O-T camera in Canyon Park.Sound transit says it will save time for commuters and make it easier for buses to get in and out of the Park and Ride.And they say the project came in on time...and under budget. 33 Two tech titans are set for a historic conversation. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and Apple's C-E-O Steve Jobs will sit down tomorrow for a 75-minute joint interview at the fifth annual \"All Things Digital\" conference in California.Over the years, Gates and Jobs have agreed to disagree on some big tech issues.This will be their first public interview together. 33 33 33 33 33 Time now is...

President Bush just announced new economic sanctions against Sudan.He wants to force Sudan's government to stop blocking international efforts to end the violence in Darfur. KIRO 7 Eyewitness News reporter Alison Burns joins us live now from our Washington, 33 33 Reporter tag. 33 New this morning: Federal officials are stepping up efforts to find and deport illegal immigrants jailed for committing other crimes in Washington and Oregon. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says it's adding more agents in Seattle, Yakima, Portland and Eugene. The director of the Seattle office says the idea is to get them deported before they can be released back onto the street. 33 The names of local servicemen and women who've died this past year in Afghanistan and Iraq now have a special place to be remembered. 33 Bells tolled at a dedication yesterday that brought family and friends to the Garden of Remembrance at Benaroya Hall. 27-year old Sgt. Travis Pfister's name is one of 28 that's been placed on Seattle's wall of remembrance. The Marine's family traveled hundreds of miles for the service. 33 33 In all, 8-thousand names are engraved in the granite walls. They are all Washington state servicemen and women killed in world war two, korea, vietnam, desert storm and all other conflicts. 33 The newest 'low fare' airlines is set to make its inaugural flight out of the North Sound. Skybus promises flights as low as ten dollars ...to and from its base in Columbus, Ohio --to eight cities across the country.Today's flight will leave from Bellingham to Columbus.Skybus says more flights will be added as it acquires more jets. 33 There may be an easy way to help younger women avoid breast cancer.A new study... published in yesterday's edition of \"Archives of Internal Medicine\" ... found pre-menopausal women who consumed higher amounts of calcium and Vitamin \"D\" had a lower risk of the disease. However, the effect seems to wear off after menopause and investigators aren't sure why. Previous studies in animals have linked Vitamin \"D\" and calcium to breast cancer prevention. 33 There's a good reason this morning to keep tabs on your children's money.A new study of 10-thousand 15 and 16 year olds found that teens with larger allowances were more likely to drink alcohol... and drink it often.The study... out of Britain... found the teens buy their own booze... and are also twice as likely to binge drink, frequently. 33 Two humpback whales stranded in California ...are back on course to return to sea this morning ...but they have a few obstacles to get around.Video yesterday evening shows one of the whales thrashing its tail... which scientists say could be a sign of 'distress.' The humpback whale and her calf are now about 45 miles from the Pacific. 33 Scientists are taking a close look at the California Gray Whale that washed up near Newport, Oregon this weekend. Authorities still don't know how the two-year-old female died... but say it will be buried once they determine a cause of death. We're told there are no visible signs of trauma. 33 33 33 33 33 33 It's ... coming up, right here on KIRO 7 Eyewitness News... From cars to flares... one local police department goes \"green.\"Plus, a near empty lake ... and the possibility of a \"dry\" summer for boaters. And on a day the nation pauses to remember veterans... some pack boxes for the troops... who are serving our country right now.Details next... on KIRO 7 Eyewitness News. HI, HON.

(all) ONE SPOONFUL IS ALL IT TAKES. 33 The Seattle police department is trying to be more \"environmentally friendly\".The P-I reports that means using less paper, and putting detectives into hybrid vehicles.And they're getting rid of these old-style road flares, which put out a lot of smoke and leave mounds of residue behind.In their place: a new battery-operated flashing light called a \"power flare.\"It's rechargeable, and can be seen for more than a half mile. 33 This morning, rescuers have identified the local man saved by a daring Coast Guard Rescue...off Brother Mountain in Port Angeles. The Coast Guard helicopter crew... flying at just over 7-thousand- feet... plucked 64-year-old John Williams from Belfair off the rocks. We've also learned he ruptured an Achilles tendon on a climb... which is why he needed the Coast Guard's help. He was treated and released Sunday night from Olympic Medical Center in Port Angeles. 33 Experts predict ...it could take Lake Tapps until mid-June ...to reach normal levels -- and maybe longer.The lake is down to a dangerously low level now --a slow spring snow-melt is to blame.Docks are now unusable ..and could pose a danger to boaters. 33 New from overnight... China's former top drug regulator has beensentenced to death... for taking bribes to approve medicines... that were \"sub-standard\".

Verdi Discusses Hollywood Deals and Tech Investments in Apple and NXT-ID Inc.'s (OTCQB: NXTD) Wocket NEW YORK and POINT ROBERTS, Washington - May 19, 2014 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Verdi to Produce/Executive Produce Three Films with Oscar winning Director Martin Scorsese: Star studded actors include Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver \"You may see a Wocket in a very famous Pocket\" - C. Verdi Investorideas.com, a global news source covering leading topics and sectors including technology and entertainment, releases an exclusive Q&amp;A with entrepreneurial movie producer, businessman and investor Chad A. Verdi of Rhode Island. Mr. Verdi discusses new and recent ventures including new movie deals and his investments in game-changing technologies, including Apple and biometric mobile security company NXT-ID Inc., (<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fq%3Fs%3DNXTD%26amp%3Bql%3D0\">OTCQB: NXTD</url>), which is currently preparing to launch its smart wallet, the Wocket\u2122 (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wocketwallet.com\">www.wocketwallet.com</url>), with advance orders starting May 28th. Mr. Verdi notes, \"I am always looking ahead and I'm never satisfied with 'good enough', My goal is to partner with the best, hire the best talent and invest in leading edge companies. </p><p>Steve Jobs made Apple known for 'Think different', Richard Branson made his motto, 'Screw it , let's do it' and I live by 'Go big or go home'.\" Q&amp;A Interview: Q: Investorideas.com This past year has already seen you reach some key milestones; making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less than a year. What are you most excited about for the balance of this year? A: Chad A. Verdi Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am the most excited about NXTD right now, only because they are about to launch the Wocket\u2122 this month. Wocket\u2122 is a smart wallet with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics. I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide. Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it. I think Wocket\u2122 has the right approach; separate from your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens if they lose their phone or it gets stolen - what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket\u2122, it's not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info are safe! It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the payment sector that I thought it would! Q: Investorideas.com In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks and invest in smaller companies with emerging technology like NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off? A: Chad A. Verdi I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like I have with NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works. Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but it's hard to know if the vision will stay intact. NXTD is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that. In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and currently needs. The Wocket\u2122 can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product; the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my second-largest holding. Q: Investorideas.com The company stated that they will launch the Wocket\u2122 May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking advance orders for the Wocket\u2122 once the event is done. Will you be attending and will you be buying one once advance orders are opened up? A: Chad A. Verdi For sure I will be there supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket\u2122 is embraced. And of course, I will be buying many, many Wockets\u2122! I will be giving them out to all of my actor and celebrity friends in Hollywood. Soon, you may see a Wocket\u2122 in a very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event. Q: Investorideas.com Speaking about Hollywood and movies, you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB you have signed on Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films. It seems like you are on fire! How did this all come about? A: Chad A. Verdi Yes, it's just nuts, crazy nuts! It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his producing partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,' Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and they invited us to the premiere of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called 'Bad Hurt' that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated to where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, 'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza. Q: Investorideas.com That is exciting and all happening very fast. How many years will it take you to complete these four films and what about the ten picture deal with Screen Media? A: Chad A. Verdi That's what's amazing. Eighteen months in regards to the four films: Bad Hurt is in post-production right now along with A 50 Year Argument. Bleed for This and Silence will be filmed this fall with completion dates no later than fall 2015, just in time for the Oscars. As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December 2014. Then we begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is to meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to facilitate this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions. Both companies are working separately and independent of one another and this gives us the capacity to handle the volume of projects we are involved with. About the Verdi Productions and Woodhaven Production Company: Both Verdi Productions and The Woodhaven Production Company are fully funded film production companies, covering all aspects of filmmaking from conception of script through postproduction.<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.woodhavenfilms.com%2F\">http://www.woodhavenfilms.com/</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verdifilms.com%2F\">http://www.verdifilms.com/</url>About Chad Verdi Chad A.

Verdi Discusses Hollywood Deals and Tech Investments in Apple and NXT-ID Inc.'s (OTCQB: NXTD) Wocket NEW YORK and POINT ROBERTS, Washington - May 19, 2014 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Verdi to Produce/Executive Produce Three Films with Oscar winning Director Martin Scorsese: Star studded actors include Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver \"You may see a Wocket in a very famous Pocket\" - C. Verdi Investorideas.com, a global news source covering leading topics and sectors including technology and entertainment, releases an exclusive Q&amp;A with entrepreneurial movie producer, businessman and investor Chad A. Verdi of Rhode Island. Mr. Verdi discusses new and recent ventures including new movie deals and his investments in game-changing technologies, including Apple and biometric mobile security company NXT-ID Inc., (<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fq%3Fs%3DNXTD%26amp%3Bql%3D0\">OTCQB: NXTD</url>), which is currently preparing to launch its smart wallet, the Wocket\u2122 (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wocketwallet.com\">www.wocketwallet.com</url>), with advance orders starting May 28th. Mr. Verdi notes, \"I am always looking ahead and I'm never satisfied with 'good enough', My goal is to partner with the best, hire the best talent and invest in leading edge companies. </p><p>Steve Jobs made Apple known for 'Think different', Richard Branson made his motto, 'Screw it , let's do it' and I live by 'Go big or go home'.\" Q&amp;A Interview: Q: Investorideas.com This past year has already seen you reach some key milestones; making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less than a year. What are you most excited about for the balance of this year? A: Chad A. Verdi Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am the most excited about NXTD right now, only because they are about to launch the Wocket\u2122 this month. Wocket\u2122 is a smart wallet with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics. I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide. Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it. I think Wocket\u2122 has the right approach; separate from your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens if they lose their phone or it gets stolen - what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket\u2122, it's not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info are safe! It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the payment sector that I thought it would! Q: Investorideas.com In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks and invest in smaller companies with emerging technology like NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off? A: Chad A. Verdi I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like I have with NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works. Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but it's hard to know if the vision will stay intact. NXTD is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that. In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and currently needs. The Wocket\u2122 can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product; the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my second-largest holding. Q: Investorideas.com The company stated that they will launch the Wocket\u2122 May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking advance orders for the Wocket\u2122 once the event is done. Will you be attending and will you be buying one once advance orders are opened up? A: Chad A. Verdi For sure I will be there supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket\u2122 is embraced. And of course, I will be buying many, many Wockets\u2122! I will be giving them out to all of my actor and celebrity friends in Hollywood. Soon, you may see a Wocket\u2122 in a very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event. Q: Investorideas.com Speaking about Hollywood and movies, you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB you have signed on Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films. It seems like you are on fire! How did this all come about? A: Chad A. Verdi Yes, it's just nuts, crazy nuts! It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his producing partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,' Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and they invited us to the premiere of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called 'Bad Hurt' that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated to where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, 'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza. Q: Investorideas.com That is exciting and all happening very fast. How many years will it take you to complete these four films and what about the ten picture deal with Screen Media? A: Chad A. Verdi That's what's amazing. Eighteen months in regards to the four films: Bad Hurt is in post-production right now along with A 50 Year Argument. Bleed for This and Silence will be filmed this fall with completion dates no later than fall 2015, just in time for the Oscars. As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December 2014. Then we begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is to meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to facilitate this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions. Both companies are working separately and independent of one another and this gives us the capacity to handle the volume of projects we are involved with. About the Verdi Productions and Woodhaven Production Company: Both Verdi Productions and The Woodhaven Production Company are fully funded film production companies, covering all aspects of filmmaking from conception of script through postproduction.<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.woodhavenfilms.com%2F\">http://www.woodhavenfilms.com/</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verdifilms.com%2F\">http://www.verdifilms.com/</url>About Chad Verdi Chad A.

Verdi Discusses Hollywood Deals and Tech Investments in Apple and NXT-ID Inc.'s (OTCQB: NXTD) Wocket NEW YORK and POINT ROBERTS, Washington - May 19, 2014 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Verdi to Produce/Executive Produce Three Films with Oscar winning Director Martin Scorsese: Star studded actors include Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver \"You may see a Wocket in a very famous Pocket\" - C. Verdi Investorideas.com, a global news source covering leading topics and sectors including technology and entertainment, releases an exclusive Q&amp;A with entrepreneurial movie producer, businessman and investor Chad A. Verdi of Rhode Island. Mr. Verdi discusses new and recent ventures including new movie deals and his investments in game-changing technologies, including Apple and biometric mobile security company NXT-ID Inc., (<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fq%3Fs%3DNXTD%26amp%3Bql%3D0\">OTCQB: NXTD</url>), which is currently preparing to launch its smart wallet, the Wocket\u2122 (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wocketwallet.com\">www.wocketwallet.com</url>), with advance orders starting May 28th. Mr. Verdi notes, \"I am always looking ahead and I'm never satisfied with 'good enough', My goal is to partner with the best, hire the best talent and invest in leading edge companies. </p><p>Steve Jobs made Apple known for 'Think different', Richard Branson made his motto, 'Screw it , let's do it' and I live by 'Go big or go home'.\" Q&amp;A Interview: Q: Investorideas.com This past year has already seen you reach some key milestones; making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less than a year. What are you most excited about for the balance of this year? A: Chad A. Verdi Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am the most excited about NXTD right now, only because they are about to launch the Wocket\u2122 this month. Wocket\u2122 is a smart wallet with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics. I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide. Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it. I think Wocket\u2122 has the right approach; separate from your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens if they lose their phone or it gets stolen - what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket\u2122, it's not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info are safe! It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the payment sector that I thought it would! Q: Investorideas.com In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks and invest in smaller companies with emerging technology like NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off? A: Chad A. Verdi I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like I have with NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works. Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but it's hard to know if the vision will stay intact. NXTD is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that. In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and currently needs. The Wocket\u2122 can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product; the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my second-largest holding. Q: Investorideas.com The company stated that they will launch the Wocket\u2122 May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking advance orders for the Wocket\u2122 once the event is done. Will you be attending and will you be buying one once advance orders are opened up? A: Chad A. Verdi For sure I will be there supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket\u2122 is embraced. And of course, I will be buying many, many Wockets\u2122! I will be giving them out to all of my actor and celebrity friends in Hollywood. Soon, you may see a Wocket\u2122 in a very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event. Q: Investorideas.com Speaking about Hollywood and movies, you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB you have signed on Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films. It seems like you are on fire! How did this all come about? A: Chad A. Verdi Yes, it's just nuts, crazy nuts! It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his producing partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,' Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and they invited us to the premiere of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called 'Bad Hurt' that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated to where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, 'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza. Q: Investorideas.com That is exciting and all happening very fast. How many years will it take you to complete these four films and what about the ten picture deal with Screen Media? A: Chad A. Verdi That's what's amazing. Eighteen months in regards to the four films: Bad Hurt is in post-production right now along with A 50 Year Argument. Bleed for This and Silence will be filmed this fall with completion dates no later than fall 2015, just in time for the Oscars. As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December 2014. Then we begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is to meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to facilitate this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions. Both companies are working separately and independent of one another and this gives us the capacity to handle the volume of projects we are involved with. About the Verdi Productions and Woodhaven Production Company: Both Verdi Productions and The Woodhaven Production Company are fully funded film production companies, covering all aspects of filmmaking from conception of script through postproduction.<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.woodhavenfilms.com%2F\">http://www.woodhavenfilms.com/</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verdifilms.com%2F\">http://www.verdifilms.com/</url>About Chad Verdi Chad A.

Verdi Discusses Hollywood Deals and Tech Investments in Apple and NXT-ID Inc.'s (OTCQB: NXTD) Wocket NEW YORK and POINT ROBERTS, Washington - May 19, 2014 (Investorideas.com Newswire) Verdi to Produce/Executive Produce Three Films with Oscar winning Director Martin Scorsese: Star studded actors include Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver \"You may see a Wocket in a very famous Pocket\" - C. Verdi Investorideas.com, a global news source covering leading topics and sectors including technology and entertainment, releases an exclusive Q&amp;A with entrepreneurial movie producer, businessman and investor Chad A. Verdi of Rhode Island. Mr. Verdi discusses new and recent ventures including new movie deals and his investments in game-changing technologies, including Apple and biometric mobile security company NXT-ID Inc., (<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fq%3Fs%3DNXTD%26amp%3Bql%3D0\">OTCQB: NXTD</url>), which is currently preparing to launch its smart wallet, the Wocket\u2122 (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wocketwallet.com\">www.wocketwallet.com</url>), with advance orders starting May 28th. Mr. Verdi notes, \"I am always looking ahead and I'm never satisfied with 'good enough', My goal is to partner with the best, hire the best talent and invest in leading edge companies. </p><p>Steve Jobs made Apple known for 'Think different', Richard Branson made his motto, 'Screw it , let's do it' and I live by 'Go big or go home'.\" Q&amp;A Interview: Q: Investorideas.com This past year has already seen you reach some key milestones; making movies with the best in Hollywood, like Martin Scorsese and your investment in NXTD is up over 300 percent in less than a year. What are you most excited about for the balance of this year? A: Chad A. Verdi Well, that's a tough one. I guess I am the most excited about NXTD right now, only because they are about to launch the Wocket\u2122 this month. Wocket\u2122 is a smart wallet with a re-programmable single credit card device that operates under a secured system using biometrics. I feel it will change the way people make credit card payments worldwide. Everyone is trying to get in on this game with mobile payments, mobile wallets, mobile apps like LOOP and COIN. Everyone is trying to figure out the best way to do it. I think Wocket\u2122 has the right approach; separate from your phone. Most people are concerned about what happens if they lose their phone or it gets stolen - what happens with all that payment info on your phone? With Wocket\u2122, it's not a worry because after each transaction it basically goes back to a blank card. Your identity and payment info are safe! It's great to think I originally invested in this a few years ago and now it may become the leader in the payment sector that I thought it would! Q: Investorideas.com In terms of your investments, you invest in both large companies like Apple and Yahoo and other big tech and entertainment companies but you also take risks and invest in smaller companies with emerging technology like NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Where do you see the biggest potential pay-off? A: Chad A. Verdi I obviously wish I would have had the opportunity to get into Apple from the beginning. I would have bet big on it, just like I have with NXTD (OTCQB: NXTD). Companies that take a different path from what the competition is doing represent the biggest opportunity, if it works. Steve Jobs set the course for Apple, I still love the company but it's hard to know if the vision will stay intact. NXTD is still young and they are taking a revolutionary approach to payments and identity issues, very different from their competitors and I like that. In my opinion, I see a big risk/reward opportunity here today because they have a product that every consumer will want and currently needs. The Wocket\u2122 can store over 10,000 credit cards/coupons, under a secured system. It's never been done before. If they are successful in delivering this product; the sky is the limit. They could be the next Apple and that is my second-largest holding. Q: Investorideas.com The company stated that they will launch the Wocket\u2122 May 28th at the Plaza Hotel in New York and will be taking advance orders for the Wocket\u2122 once the event is done. Will you be attending and will you be buying one once advance orders are opened up? A: Chad A. Verdi For sure I will be there supporting them and seeing first-hand how the Wocket\u2122 is embraced. And of course, I will be buying many, many Wockets\u2122! I will be giving them out to all of my actor and celebrity friends in Hollywood. Soon, you may see a Wocket\u2122 in a very famous pocket! I also love the fact that the company is promoting the Wocket like Apple does with the launch of each IPhone - it's an event. They're running commercials on CNBC news along with using the Plaza hotel for the launch. They are also bringing in Miss Universe as a celebrity guest; it a first-class event. Q: Investorideas.com Speaking about Hollywood and movies, you and your wife Michelle are now involved in three projects with Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. According to IMDB you have signed on Liam Neeson, Andrew Garfield, Miles Teller, Aaron Eckhart and Adam Driver. On top of this, I read that you have signed a 10 picture deal with Screen Media films. It seems like you are on fire! How did this all come about? A: Chad A. Verdi Yes, it's just nuts, crazy nuts! It all started when Mr. Scorsese and his producing partner Emma Koskoff agreed to join my passion project,' Bleed for This'. My wife Michelle and I met with them a few times in New York and they invited us to the premiere of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. Then I was asked to get involved with a film called 'Bad Hurt' that was filmed in New York. Soon after that, things just escalated to where Michelle and I agreed to join Marty and Emma in his passion project called 'Silence'. The other two movies include 'The New York Review of Books: A 50 Year Argument' and then we'll produce my passion project, 'Bleed For This', the true-life story of five-time world champion, Rhode Island boxer, Vinny Pazienza. Q: Investorideas.com That is exciting and all happening very fast. How many years will it take you to complete these four films and what about the ten picture deal with Screen Media? A: Chad A. Verdi That's what's amazing. Eighteen months in regards to the four films: Bad Hurt is in post-production right now along with A 50 Year Argument. Bleed for This and Silence will be filmed this fall with completion dates no later than fall 2015, just in time for the Oscars. As far as the 10 picture deal with Screen Media Films, we are currently filming the first film called 'Almost Mercy' now and expect to release that film in December 2014. Then we begin filming the 2nd film in early 2015. The goal is to meet our obligations on the 10 picture deal prior to 1/1/2018. We are able to facilitate this because we have two production companies, The Woodhaven Production Company and Verdi Productions. Both companies are working separately and independent of one another and this gives us the capacity to handle the volume of projects we are involved with. About the Verdi Productions and Woodhaven Production Company: Both Verdi Productions and The Woodhaven Production Company are fully funded film production companies, covering all aspects of filmmaking from conception of script through postproduction.<url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.woodhavenfilms.com%2F\">http://www.woodhavenfilms.com/</url>,      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://redirect.viglink.com?key=11fe087258b6fc0532a5ccfc924805c0&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.verdifilms.com%2F\">http://www.verdifilms.com/</url>About Chad Verdi Chad A.
