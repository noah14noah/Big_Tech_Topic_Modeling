In 2013, Steyer, 62, started Nextgen America, a PAC that has contributed $230 million to Democrats in the 2014, 2016 and 2018 campaign cycles. With a net worth estimated at $1.6-billion built from decades of running the hedge fund Farallon Capital, Steyer has drawn criticism for spending his money on his unlikely campaign instead of on grass-roots organizations or his prior focus, impeaching President Trump. But he says he saw a need for a 2020 contender to speak more urgently about climate change and about Trump's behavior. 'I don't see the Democratic establishment doing anything real to stop him,' he said of the president in August. Steyer has struggled to find footing in the polls, but he gained enough support to earn a spot in the fourth Democratic presidential debate in October and the fifth in November.</p><p>Steyer released an aggressive plan to address climate change. He says his proposal is 'justice-centered' and calls for a 'Civilian Climate Corps' to create jobs and provide resources to help communities adapt to a clean energy economy. He set a deadline of 2045 to achieve net-zero global warming pollution and a 100-percent clean energy economy, five years earlier than many other candidates in the 2020 race. Steyer says he would use the emergency powers of the presidency to protect the country from climate change.</p><p>Steyer, a billionaire, advocates for a wealth tax and has said he wants to 'undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations.' He supports a $15-an-hour minimum wage and an increased earned income tax credit. Steyer says monopolies need to be broken up or regulated, saying on his website that 'unchecked capitalism undermines our democracy and hurts too many people.'</p><p> Steyer says he would increase teacher pay and improve school facilities. He also expressed support for universal pre-K. 'Every American should have the right to a free, quality, public education from universal pre-kindergarten through higher education, including workforce and technical training,' his campaign website says.</p><p>Steyer would work with global allies to address climate change and continue trade agreements 'with everyone at the table,' according to his campaign website. He has condemned Trump for having an 'America first' foreign policy strategy. 'What we really should be doing is addressing these things with our traditional allies in a multilateral way,' he told CBS News in July. 'We cannot draw a wall around the United States.'</p><p>Steyer has endorsed a public option and says he wants to bolster the government-run program so that it eventually would force private insurance companies out of business. 'I'm not in favor of saying to 150-million Americans who get their health care through their employer: 'That's now illegal. You will have to do it our way,' ' he told WBUR, Boston's NPR station, in August. He has also been outspoken against the pharmaceutical industry, criticizing companies for profiting from drug sales.</p><p>Steyer is self-funding his campaign.</p><p>The former vice president has centered his third presidential run on his vow to oust President Trump. He began his campaign with a video that start with the words 'Charlottesville, Virginia,' alluding to the white supremacist violence there as a way of drawing attention to the division and violence he says has racked the country under the current president. In September, Biden's name became part of the House's impeachment inquiry of Trump, who acknowledged asking the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. Neither Biden nor his son has been accused of wrongdoing. As Biden and his family face heightened scrutiny, the former vice president has struggled to maintain a lead over Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has steadily climbed in the polls. Biden, 77, has been a force in Democratic politics for nearly five decades, representing Delaware in the Senate for 36 years before serving two terms under President Barack Obama. His long history has forged connections with voters and prompted criticism of his past, including his positions on crime legislation, his interactions with women and his tendency to make gaffes on the national stage.</p><p>Biden is embracing the Green New Deal's framework, setting a deadline to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and vowing to create a clean-energy economy with new jobs. Biden said that he'd rejoin the Paris climate accord on his first day in office and would pressure other countries to take steps to lower emissions. But some climate activists, including Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a former Democratic presidential candidate, have accused Biden of having 'middle ground' climate proposal and skirting more ambitious short-term targets.</p><p>The former vice president says his policies are designed to lift up the middle class. He is in favor of a capital gains tax on assets held by the wealthiest Americans, and an increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour. He said the government needs to strengthen its antitrust enforcement and 'take a hard look at how we can rein in some of the abuses of power from the world's biggest corporations, whether it be big tech, insurance companies, or the agriculture industry.' Biden does not believe in providing a universal basic income or jobs guarantee, as some more liberal candidates have proposed.</p><p>The former vice president has made foreign relations and Trump's behavior on the international stage a cornerstone of his campaign. 'Foreign policy is domestic policy and domestic policy is foreign policy,' he said in a July speech. He has accused Trump of currying favor with dictators and alienating allies with his 'America first' mantra. Biden was a proponent of free-trade deals under the Obama administration but has since reversed his support of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and has been forced to defend his vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement. He has criticized Trump's trade war with China, calling for new guidelines that would facilitate trade between the nations without allowing China to 'keep moving and robbing U.S. firms.'</p><p>Biden's health-care policy proposal is built on the legacy of Obama's Affordable Care Act. He has been an outspoken proponent of a public option to allow anyone to buy into Medicare. Unlike many contenders to his ideological left, Biden has not endorsed Medicare-for-all. 'I understand the appeal of Medicare-for-all, but folks supporting it should be clear that it means getting rid of Obamacare, and I'm not for that,' Biden said in a video. He has said he thinks undocumented immigrants should be covered under a government-run health plan.</p><p>$37.7 million</p><p>Raised so far by the campaign, the 5th highest fundraising total in the Democratic field. Biden ranks 10th in in the field in percent of money coming from small-dollar donations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-7cb8040a3ee211eabacaeb7ace0a3455</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3N-82B1-DYX1-H4HV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1153\"/><timeReceived>11:53 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Also: Bay Area earthquakes; and Catalan human towers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(If you don\u2019t already get California Today by email, here\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">the sign-up</url>.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Tuesday night, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">12 Democratic presidential candidates</url> took the stage in Ohio for the biggest primary debate in history. My boss \u2014       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">Marc Lacey</url>, The Times\u2019s National editor \u2014 helped moderate, and my colleagues covered every minute of the three-hour show extensively. (They also made       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">a quiz on the 2020 campaign</url> so far, if you\u2019re into that.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here are the biggest takeaways for those of us watching from the Golden State: </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There were two Californians onstage, Senator Kamala Harris and the billionaire Tom Steyer, who lives in San Francisco. How did they do?</p><p>This was Mr. Steyer\u2019s first time on a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">presidential debate stage</url>, and he spent much of his seven minutes and 13 seconds of speaking time introducing himself and his ideas.</p><p>Yes, he acknowledged, he is a very rich guy. But as a longtime Democratic donor who has pushed for impeachment for years, he sought to position himself as the best person to expose what he described as the president\u2019s failures.</p><p>And asked whether billionaires should be taxed out of existence, he answered yes without hesitation. He also railed against a government that he said has been bought by big corporations. </p><p>\u201cThis is part of the Steyer conundrum,\u201d my colleague Lisa Lerer wrote. \u201cIn a race where attacking billionaires fuels several of these campaigns, Steyer is a billionaire. But he\u2019s also one of the most progressive candidates on the stage.\u201d</p><p>Before the debate Mr. Steyer had a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">national polling average</url>of about 1 percent. </p><p>Ms. Harris and Senator Cory Booker mainly played the roles of peacemakers and unifiers. Still, Ms. Harris landed a couple of applause lines, including when she drew attention to the fact that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">women\u2019s access to reproductive health</url> had been largely left out of the debates so far. </p><p>\u201cThis is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women\u2019s access to reproductive health care, which is under full-on attack in America today. And it\u2019s outrageous.\u201d</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">She spoke for</url>12 minutes and 23 seconds \u2014 almost precisely the middle of the pack. </p><p>There was a big discussion about big tech, which led to a dust-up between Ms. Harris and Senator Elizabeth Warren over President Trump\u2019s Twitter account.</p><p>Amid a fight between <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">Ms. Warren and Facebook</url> over misinformation and her       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">plans to regulate the tech industry</url>, Ms. Harris and Ms. Warren       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">sparred over Twitter.</url></p><p>\u201cSenator Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump\u2019s account, that you did not agree,\u201d Ms. Harris said. </p><p>Ms. Warren didn\u2019t agree and instead pivoted to campaign finance, and her vow not to take money from big tech executives. She didn\u2019t want to just \u201cpush Donald Trump off Twitter,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to push him out of the White House.\u201d</p><p>On Tuesday, Twitter said it would continue to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">stand by the president</url> because preserving his tweets is in the public interest.</p><p>Topics that didn\u2019t really crack the discussion? </p><p>Housing and homelessness \u2014 although candidates denounced growing economic <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">inequality</url> \u2014 and climate change. </p><p>But both Ms. Harris and Mr. Steyer have qualified for the next debate, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">which is set for Nov. 20</url>. </p><p>Here\u2019s what else we\u2019re following</p><p>We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

The door was open for more government scrutiny.</p><p>Amazon, Apple and Google have been subject to billions of dollars in fines, mainly levied by the European Union, the irony of which is not lost on those who are hard-pressed to name more than a handful of EU tech companies that are game-changers.</p><p> Before the digital pitchforks are hoisted too high, it's worth considering the good that has come from innovation that was only a bold idea at the start of the 21st century.</p><p> Social media is largely the product of a convergence of technologies that made it much easier, faster and cheaper to communicate with friends, colleagues and strangers alike \u2014 anywhere, anytime.</p><p> It has empowered people and, in many ways, democratized news, business startups and social action.</p><p> Dov Seidman, the CEO of corporate ethics and compliance firm LRN, believes the tools themselves are not the problem \u2013 but how we choose to use them.</p><p> The same technologies that can foster relationships and give people a voice \"can also breed isolation, embolden racists and empower digital bullies and nefarious actors,\" Seidman has said.</p><p> \"We now live in the era of behavior. We are thrust together technologically. We have become so connected that we are \u2026 ethically if not morally connected.\"</p><p> The technology revolution that began with the birth of the internet is maturing in ways that were hard to imagine.</p><p> Just as the first three Industrial Revolutions (machines, power and early computers) led to unintended consequences in society and democracy, so is the Fourth Industrial Revolution changing the world through mobile technologies, machine learning and open source software.</p><p> Those changes will remake how we get our food, clothing, shelter, health care, education, entertainment and more.</p><p> They may also lead society into uncharted territory that disrupts long-held values and beliefs.</p><p> It can be scary. That's why some members of Congress and policymakers elsewhere have looked to rein in tech, sometimes without fully considering the implications.</p><p> For example, efforts are underway in Congress to bring back Obama-era \"net neutrality\" rules, even if the rollback has not created the predatory disaster predicted by supporters.</p><p> Companies are competing to increase data speeds, not to reduce them.</p><p> Some states have pushed ahead with privacy legislation, not realizing they could create islands that discourage interstate commerce. A reasoned federal approach is the better answer.</p><p> Regulation has its place. It must be carefully implemented, however, as to not kill America's digital golden goose.</p><p> Technology itself is becoming part of the answer, as decentralized technologies have the potential to weaken the grip of Big Tech while enhancing cybersecurity.</p><p> An expert on the rise of decentralized technologies will visit Madison in early November for the Wisconsin Early Stage Symposium.</p><p> Investor and tech veteran Jeff Schumacher, who has long been a part of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, will speak Nov. 7 on the coming wave of innovation.</p><p> We can urge government to \"unfriend\" Big Tech or we can recognize that reactive regulation isn't the answer to problems linked, at least in part, to our own behavior.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKWI-7054f9cc91ddb6edc19493cc31c723416e3b2cd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C918AF8DD94 NWBKWI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X32-9341-DXVP-V4Y3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409764</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"750\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Chippewa.com<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

called an ``arrogant corporate elite'' and a ``coward'' by Labour deputy leader Tom Watson for failing to answer questions from MPs.</p><p>He said that he felt the UK did not matter to Mr <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>because it is seen as ``a little place on a map'' and a ``minor market to him''.</p><p>``You should always look to where you can do the most good - and what good comes from <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>behaviour?,'' Mr Watson said at an event in East London on Wednesday.</p><p>``He's an arrogant corporate elite and he's a coward - and he should be sitting in front of that Digital, [Culture, Media and Sport select] committee, which has cross-party unity and answering the questions that our democratic institutions need to know.</p><p>``For me, personally, the symbolism of that empty chair, having been through the phone hacking enquiry 10 years ago, it is really resonant.''</p><p>The Facebookchief executive has failed to turn up to hearings to answer questions before MPs on a range of social networking issues.</p><p>These issues include the tech giant's handing of data breaches, allegations of business malpractice, repeated electoral interference and the rampant spread of disinformation and hate speech on the platform.</p><p>``It's clear to me that for <person><nameText>Zuckerberg...</nameText></person>the United Kingdom is a little place on a map,'' the MP continued.</p><p>``It's a minor market for him and he doesn't feel that he has to answer to the people in this room and to the citizens that use his services, and therefore, with that arrogance, the Government has to act.''</p><p>Speaking at the event organised by centre-left think tank Progressive Centre UK, the shadow secretary of state for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, set out Labour's view on the need for regulation of big tech firms.</p><p>Mr Watson said that tech firms with huge amounts of data on users needed to be held to account for happens on their platforms, similar to other industries.</p><p>``Unfortunately the leadership of some of these data monopolists have

to be high enough to really hit these cash-rich monopolists, in order to change their behaviour.''</p><p>The MP for West Bromwich East said he was heartened that the Government wants change too, but accused it of being ``dazzled by the scale of corporate profit for far too long without questioning how much of the value reaches the bulk of the population''.</p><p>A White Paper on online harms will be published by the Government by the end of winter setting out expectations for social media companies, followed by a consultation over the summer that will set out new laws that could enforce the removal of harmful content.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Think Facebook, Apple, Amazon.com, Google (owned by Alphabet), Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings, all of which have cemented near-monopolistic positions in their respective businesses and generated hundreds of billions in value for shareholders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The textbook definition of a network effect is a scenario where each new user added to the platform enhances the experience for all existing users and gets value back in return. Hence, users beget more users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is no different from the network effect of the telephone - if no one else owns a phone, your phone and the system is of little value, but the value will increase exponentially with each additional phone user to the network. Naturally, it leads to monopolies. The long-term consequences were that these entities were dismantled by rules and regulations that promote competition.</p><p>In the initial stage, a start-up platform would have to spend heavily - whether through discounts, incentivised referrals or word of mouth and so on - to attract users. But the cost of acquisition would fall as the user base grows since users themselves are increasingly motivated to join, owing to the network effect. Decreasing marginal costs would then translate into rising profitability for the platforms once they start to monetise. This is the playbook for most tech companies operating digital platforms.</p><p>It is also the reason venture capitalists are willing to funnel massive amounts of money to start-ups to drive rapid user growth, and investors buy stocks in loss-making companies - in the belief that the network effect will snowball into user critical mass, unassailable moats and the inevitable pot of gold.</p><p>Many of today's technology companies - including Uber, Airbnb, Netflix, Spotify, Meituan Dianping and Didi Chuxing - use the term \"network effect\" liberally to justify their lofty valuations.</p><p>Ride-sharing company Lyft, whose IPO was one of this year's biggest and most-talked-about, stressed: \"Network effects among the drivers and riders on our platform are important to our success.\"</p><p>But do all tech start-ups deserve such confidence from investors? Most of these companies are capitalising on opportunities arising from the sharing and subscription economy. While this may be the way of the future, investors should evaluate the financial viability of each business model carefully.</p><p>Not all tech companies benefit from the network effect and certainly not all to the same extent. It is one thing to spend heavily on initial customer acquisition and another to be able to retain these customers as well as continue to attract new users once the monetisation phase begins.</p><p>Facebook and WeChat are the best examples of platforms with strong network effects. Recent privacy issues notwithstanding, their values are derived from high switching costs.</p><p>You are on Facebook, WhatsApp and WeChat because all your friends and family are using these same apps to communicate and share updates. To switch to another social media app would require all your friends and family to do the same. One would also have huge amounts of personal data already tied into these platforms.</p><p>Such large and loyal user bases, in turn, make it easier to monetise and further expand into other services as well as attract quality content. And, in the process, further strengthen the network effect.</p><p>By contrast, companies such as Lyft, Uber, Netflix, Didi and Meituan are all still burning cash and racking up huge losses. Yes, more customer sign-ups will attract more drivers/restaurants and, therefore, more customers to the ecosystem. However, the network effect is far weaker - and switching costs are far lower.</p><p>For instance, it is hard to see how my user experience is enhanced if another person uses Uber ride sharing or orders food delivery. The ride would not be more enjoyable nor would the food be tastier. In fact, it could be a negative network effect if congestion results in longer wait times.</p><p>Instead, these platforms are spending huge amounts on customer acquisition. They are capturing market share, but only through heavy subsidies. If they cut back on subsidies and raise prices, would they still get the same amount of sales? I think not.</p><p>Raising prices will also attract competitors. Barriers to entry are low. New entrants can cherry-pick and focus on localisation, in a single city or state. Most customers and drivers/restaurants use multiple ride sharing and food delivery apps. You choose the one that gives the most competitive price.</p><p>I suspect they are partly relying on the old \"economies of scale\" model. As a larger customer base results in increasing demand, which in turn draws in more suppliers, their size may enable cost per unit supplied to fall. After all, the sharing economy's value proposition is predicated on increasing assets utilisation.</p><p>Clearly, however, there is a limit if physical logistics are involved - unlike pure digital deliveries such as Facebook, Google and WeChat, where marginal cost can literally fall to zero.</p><p>To resolve the above dilemma, their longer-term goal must be to drive logistics costs to almost zero or at least much lower from current levels. This is where the technology of autonomous vehicles comes into play.</p><p>Another way is to be a universal app, where you bundle a vast array of services, including payments options. While each service may not itself be sticky, the combination or offer of a bundle may be stickier - and could perhaps create the necessary network effect where one service attracts users to another and so on and so forth. It is old-school \"horizontal integration\" - and the reason conglomerates were formed in the past.</p><p>The best example of early success in employing and monetising this strategy is \u00adWeChat, which new-generation tech players such as Meituan and Go-Jek are attempting to emulate. It remains to be seen whether they too can eventually find a path to profitability.</p><p>Positively, Amazon and Alibaba have very successfully bridged multiple businesses - from e-commerce to physical retail, financial services, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment, and consumer electronics - and have done so profitably. This may well be down to the timing in being the first disruptors - they were able to grow very quickly, capitalising on digitalisation and economies of scale to disrupt traditional business models.</p><p>That said, these companies may, one day, also be disrupted by new entrants. In a future where frictional cost has been whittled to zero, smaller and more nimble players may regain the upper hand. That is, if the tightening noose of government regulations has not already broken up big tech.</p><p>Similarly, subscription services such as Netflix and Spotify are powerful disruptors, exploiting changing consumer preference in how entertainment is consumed and delivering it more efficiently through digital distribution. But like ride sharing-food delivery platforms, switching costs are low. It makes little difference to me which subscription service my friends are on. My decision will be based solely on content and price.</p><p>With so many traditional media companies now getting into the game - including The Walt Disney Co, AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia and Comcast's NBCUniversal - not to mention Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+ services - first-mover advantage in these cases may be fleeting.</p><p>Scale alone provides a weak network effect when there are few reasons for customer loyalty, which makes it an unsustainable competitive advantage. Remember, the media companies are, at the same time, also pulling licensed content from Netflix in favour of their own streaming services.</p><p>Defending market share, therefore, depends on continuous evolution in the platform's value proposition and ways to strengthen the network effect through differentiating features, branding, trust and reputation, value-added services and others.</p><p>This is why Netflix is outspending all of its competitors, to the tune of billions of dollars each year to create original content. Instead of reaping the benefits of strong subscriber and revenue growth, its negative free cash flow has been growing larger each year - totalling US$2.9 billion ($3.9 billion) in 2018 and estimated to rise to US$3.5 billion this year.</p><p>Many believe that Netflix can maintain its leading position in streaming services. The real question is whether it can reduce content cost and/or raise prices sufficiently to reverse this cash burn and still maintain market share.</p><p>It is for this reason we have the old saying, \"content is king\". The quality of content is what customers want and will pay for. The way it is delivered will be commoditised.</p><p>The Global Portfolio ended higher for the week, led by gains for Ausnutria Dairy as well as a majority of our US stocks. The US market outperformed the rest of the world, with both the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and Nasdaq indices now just a hair's breadth from all-time record highs.</p><p>Last week's gains lifted total portfolio returns to 2.1% since inception. By comparison, the benchmark MSCI World Net Return Index is up 5.8% over the same period.</p><p>Tong Kooi Ong is chairman of The Edge Media Group, which owns The Edge Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0V-HVK1-JCF0-30M5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1552\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Edge Publishing PTE.

Did Apple deliver the goods when it comes to equity investors? It's such a big part of major benchmark indexes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TONY DWYER, EQUITY STRATEGIST, CANACCORD GENUITY</emphasis>: Well as Tom indicated, I don't comment on individual stocks, however--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TOM KEENE, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION</emphasis>: Well make an exception here, come on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ADAM JOHNSON, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION</emphasis>: Come on, it's Apple.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: It's a famous but, our analyst, Mike Walkley, did put out a comment this morning that he thought, he's higher than the Street in his estimates. He thought it was fine. We've got a buy rating and a $112 target on the stock.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Well as a matter of fact a number of strategists, I think of the team over at Strategas, I think of the team from Wells Fargo, pointing out that big cap technology, big boring Microsoft, Intel, Cisco, it's back. That's where the action is. Do you agree with that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: I do, I do. We are overweight information technology. Anything really related to capital spending the companies and the financials that support that. That provide that capital, create that capital and lend the money for it. I think that's the place to be.  </p><p>      0708  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      0709  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Let's bring it over to Tony Dwyer. You're going to be watching three iWatches for Christmas by the way. I can see it coming Dwyer.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: Four, I'll even include my wife on that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Four iWatches for Christmas. When you look at a trillion dollar company, that's a commitment to your bull market isn't it? Can you extrapolate out to Dow 20,000?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: Until you shut down credit, it is a levered society. Until you shut down the ability of the people at this table and people that are watching and listening to get credit the economy will move forward. And what we found historically, through making a lot of mistakes is, as long as earnings are higher, the market is higher.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: And Dwyer children just remember, Uncle Tom says the iWatch for Christmas, look for that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: The green band, no less. All right Tony Dwyer of Canaccord Genuity and of course Mo Koyfman of Spark Capital.  </p><p>      0710  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      0714  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Tony please?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: You want to be careful also. You know you hear a lot of \"it's a bubble\" because some of these big tech stocks are coming out at better valuation. Twitter, things like that--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: You mean like 14 times sales.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: Yeah like crazy stuff. Remember that Netscape was the initial internet company that came out in 1995. And that was doubled in price the day before and then it was, it went up to I think it doubled in actual price once it traded.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Yeah. You're the Wall Street guy here, this is an ecumenical offering. There's like 47 firms involved with Alibaba. Does Mo Koyfman's world need your world?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: Clearly.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Does tech need Wall Street?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: You do because you're raising capital. And again that's why I'm overweight the financials. It's those companies that provide the capital for these tech--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: Companies--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: In spite of increase in regulatory environment?  </p><p>      0714  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      0720  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Tony Dwyer of Canaccord Genuity, he's pushed it all aside. He sees higher stock prices founded simply on a good economy and better earnings. Yours is a simple calculus isn't it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: It is. There's five thesis points through making many mistakes over my career.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Give us one of them, we don't have time. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: I'm going to go real quick. The market correlates to the direction of earnings. So as long as the direction of earnings is positive, it's not whether you're a buyer, it's where you're a more aggressive buyer.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: The second, that is driven, earnings are driven by economic activity. That's driven by the slope of the yield curve and availability money through lending--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: We're nowhere near recession.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: We're not even in a light year of it. So let's do this, inflation's been flat for the last four years. Fed funds has been flat for the last four years. Interest rates have been in a range for the last four years. So exactly why should we become negative if nothing fundamentally has changed?  </p><p>      Now prices have gone up, but not to the degree, given inflation, that should be considered worrisome in any way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Where does use of cash change here? All the geniuses are telling me share buyback is going to change and this, that and the other thing. I don't observe a change in use of cash.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: It's not even close. For example, corporate credit new issuance according to my buddy Brian Reynolds who's a guest here, the two days following the Labor Day holiday were like the 5th and 6th largest day of corporate credit new issuance ever. What that means is, companies are still taking in, not just earnings and retained income, but tremendous amount of cash to buy back stock.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Mm-hmm.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: To shrink their share (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: And Scarlet that shows the confidence that has to be out there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: The confidence and the need to take advantage of low rates while you can. FU: Mo Koyfman our guest host for the hour.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MO KOYFMAN, GENERAL PARTNER, SPARK CAPITAL</emphasis>: Yeah just a question on that because we tend to look up here when we look at these things. And I'm wondering down on the ground, because every time whether it was the mortgage crisis or anything else, it starts from the populous.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOYFMAN</emphasis>: What about earnings? Not by corporations but by, you know, the large, the masses in this country and how much of the spending power and the earnings being generated today is coming from leverage versus actual--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Wages. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOYFMAN</emphasis>: Real dollars, wages.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: This is a raging debate right now on wage growth.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOYFMAN</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: Wages are beginning to grow but let's think about an economic cycle. What creates a change in an economic cycle is Fed policy which Fed starts to tighten interest rates because wages and real growth is beginning to pick up. It's just taken four years to get there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: So we're still, even though duration we're not, but we're still early in the economic cycle because we're building those wage (inaudible).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOYFMAN</emphasis>: That to me is the real question here, are we going to see the wage growth required to sustain this?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Right. And Adam within this bimodal discussion of the haves and the have nots--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Yep.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: The real question is can you have Dwyer's optimism with so many Americans struggling for that marginal wage growth?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Well perhaps and Tony maybe you can speak to this. What we're really getting at is whether there has been enough de-leveraging at the personal level. Not the government, not corporations, but yes Mo at the personal level has there been enough de-leveraging to allow people to go out and spend again?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: I would say yes. Forget my opinion, let's look at the evidence. The evidence is in the last two months you've seen an acceleration on consumer loans. OK that's the first time this cycle. That is telling me that's de-leveraged.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: But has leverage come down enough that an acceleration in leveraging is actually good? Do you know what I mean?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: See I think all that data is skewed. If you're paying down credit cards it takes a lot of $2,500 payments to pay down. But if you throw the keys back to the bank and take a hit on a $400,000 house, that's going to change the leverage ratio.  </p><p>      So in other words it's being skewed by something that hasn't happened before which is so many people flipping their house back to the bank.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: One of the whispers here Scarlet was yesterday Oliver Chen at Citigroup saying they've been surprised how the first two weeks of September--  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: On retail. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Have been pretty good for retail.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FU</emphasis>: Well certainly at the high end that's been the case. For Wal- Mart, for Target, for some on the lower end, it's a bit of a struggle. So going on that, with this two speed America, the haves versus the have nots, are the obvious sector picks that you avoid staples and you go straight for the luxury retailers?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: No I think you actually; we're neutral on consumer discretionary as well. Again rates are poised to go up. That's going to begin to restrict credit. Today credit has been wide opened. People can buy money to buy things. And again I think it's important to remember so far it's the haves and the have nots. But all wages and aggregate hours worked, average hourly earnings, they're all beginning to pick up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: I'll go with that. They're just starting to lift a little.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: And that's a good thing. That's a good thing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KOYFMAN</emphasis>: But that's the thing we need to watch.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JOHNSON</emphasis>: Yeah it is. We'll talk about haves and have nots.  </p><p>      0724  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p>      0755  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>: Do you believe in a linkage of the markets into the mid- term election? Should we be a student of those elections?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DWYER</emphasis>: I'm a student of history and the elections are, if you asked anybody today, we've never seen this kind of disconnect between Congress and the president. It seems so unique right?  </p><p>      The Republicans impeached a sitting president during the greatest period for stock market advance in our history in the 1990s when they impeached Bill Clinton. People forget that because the internet wasn't around then so you can't Google it.  </p><p>      But basically this is what happens in mid-term elections.

But they shouldn't be taking a percentage of profits, revenues, whatever the case may be.\" </p><p>  If food deliverers don't comply, they could face decades-old state regulations forcing them to register as partners on restaurants' liquor licenses - a potential bureaucratic nightmare that would involve thousands of such applications. </p><p>  The Monday hearing at the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. state office building on West 125th Street was attended by about 40 lawyers and company representatives. None of the delivery companies' reps spoke at the hearing.  </p><p>Grubhub's director of public policy, Sami Naim, walked in about a half-hour after the meeting started, and later declined to comment.  </p><p>  The meeting grew heated about 40 minutes after it started, when Zachary Hecht, policy director for Tech:NYC, said the proposed rule \"could impede innovation\" in the delivery industry.  </p><p>  \"How?\" Bradley asked, interrupting Hecht, whose trade group represents Postmates, Delivery.com, Uber and dozens of other big tech firms.  </p><p>  \"Based on what I've witnessed with these tech companies, should anyone go out of business because of this - which is not our goal at all - I would imagine there's 20 other people willing to step right in and follow the law, as we dictated it,\" he said, drawing laughter from the attendees.  </p><p>  After the hearing, Hecht told The Post he was \"not really satisfied with the lines of questioning or the framing,\" adding that state officials ought to study how a flat fee would affect restaurants.  </p><p>  \"The regulatory uncertainty contained in the advisory would be very concerning for tech companies,\" Hecht said.  </p><p>  Katie Norris, a Grubhub spokeswoman, said \"it was promising that the next version of the guidelines will clarify vague and confusing language from the first draft,\" declining to comment further.  </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:kdugan@nypost.com\">kdugan@nypost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYPOST-11533781076</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYPOST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X75-VCF1-DY2B-135V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164207</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 N.Y.P.

But he is wrong to think he's innocent and that the problem will go away. Facebook and other, so-called technology companies, Amazon and Google, should be scared.</p><p>The British Parliament has the social-media company in its sights and seized on company documents that purport to show a Facebook engineer had warned the company that a Russian IP address had been harvesting billions of data points from Facebook. The committee, which was made up of parliamentarians from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Latvia, Singapore, France, Belgium and Britain, called for a global system of internet governance. The Canadian representative, New Democrat MP Charlie Angus, suggested: \"The simplest form of regulation would be to break Facebook up or treat it as a utility.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Germany's federal competition regulator is launching an investigation into Amazon, the largest online marketplace in Germany, after complaints from third-party sellers that their business was being hindered by Amazon's dual role of retailer and operator of the marketplace. The European Commission's competition watchdog is already investigating whether Amazon gains unfair advantage from the data it collects from transactions by sellers using Amazon's marketplace.</p><p>Small wonder, you might think, that the colossal market power of the internet giants attracts scrutiny from regulators. What is extraordinary is the scrutiny, so far, is almost entirely from European antitrust regulators. The United States' Congress and Federal Trade Commission are only just beginning to show concern about the way in which the internet giants can manipulate the markets in which they dominate.</p><p>The country that created antitrust law - the one that first recognized the tendency of large conglomerate enterprises, such as Standard Oil and AT&amp;T, to suppress competition and engage in market abuse - is no longer in the business of cutting down tall poppies. In the United States, today, dominance per se is to be celebrated, (as long as it is American dominance). Foreign dominance in a business activity, especially when it is Chinese, is considered dubious, if not downright illegal. However, when U.S. companies achieve very high degrees of market control, such as Google's domination of search and online advertising or Amazon's dominance in bookselling, the prevailing view is that success should be rewarded.</p><p>Leaving aside the Trumpian suspicion of foreign manufacturing, U.S. antitrust law has for decades been shackled by a simplistic mantra: If prices are low or lower, what's the problem? In other words, if Amazon can sell you a book at a lower price, who cares if there are no book shops or indeed any specialist retailer, and who cares if tumbleweeds are rolling through the malls?</p><p>Disruption is the official religion and the new gods are Jeff Bezos, Sergey Brin and Mr. Zuckerberg. Surely, this is what capitalism ordered, goes the argument: new technology and business models kick out the old, delivering better and cheaper goods. And Mr. Zuckerberg would be right, except that we are told that the disruptors should not themselves be disrupted. Having created the new model economy, we are not allowed to touch it - not even government. The holy libertarian writ of creative destruction works only once: The stranglehold must not be broken. If you want to handle goods before you buy them, find a street market somewhere in Asia.</p><p>When did competition mean support for an unregulated utility, a conduit for commerce that is not only subject to no restraint but can freely compete with users of the conduit while at the same time mining their commercial data? When did competition mean the theft of intellectual property?</p><p>None of these questions has troubled the dominant thinkers in U.S. competition law. Thankfully, a young maverick American legal scholar, Lina Khan, is getting a lot of attention for suggesting, in a Yale Law Journal article last year, that online platforms are the new railroads, akin to the market infrastructure that supported Standard Oil's monopoly.</p><p>Those jurists and economists who sneer might consider where the United States would be if Standard Oil and Ma Bell were still intact and controlling, respectively, oil supply and telecommunications. Shale oil would still be locked underground and I don't think Google would be a thing.</p><p>Carl Mortished is a Canadian financial journalist and freelance consultant based in Britain</p><p>Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail.com: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-too-big-to-derail-why-breaking-up-big-tech-makes-sense/\">https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-too-big-to-derail-why-breaking-up-big-tech-makes-sense/</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRNWGM-RTGAM20181202ellipsis_WVDQP3BC35AO3CWNFYJAFCQXTQ</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRNWGM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TWB-9HB1-JCS0-V180-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">302564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"875\"/><timeReceived>5:49 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

If it works, the device will make mobile financial transactions infinitely more secure by eradicating old-fashioned PINs and passwords.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The unique test run comes at a crucial time for Canadian banks. Everyone from Apple to Facebook is encroaching on the territory of traditional lenders, and the threat of competition from these unusual rivals has forced financial institutions to invest in a flurry of innovations this fall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tangerine, formerly known as ING Direct Canada, recently unveiled biometric tools for its mobile banking app, including a fingerprint scanner that supplants old-fashioned passwords; the Bank of Nova Scotiahas just designed a new app for Samsung's smartwatch that lets users check account balances on their wrists.</p><p>For over a decade, financial institutions have watched Apple decimate record labels, Netflix disrupt cable companies, and Uber upend unimaginative taxi operators. They now fear their sector will be the next one to topple. Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., America's biggest bank, put it bluntly last February. The leaders of the digital revolution, he said, \"all want to eat our lunch.\"</p><p>To stay relevant, Canada's banks are investing big bucks in products that rival those being dreamed up by Silicon Valley's stars. They are also working overtime to look cutting-edge - developing such features as biometric identification - because market perception matters. Apple and Samsung don't spend hundreds of millions on advertising annually just for fun: In a world of hyperinnovation, appearing to be ahead of the pack is almost as important as being there.</p><p>This year was a particularly eyeopening one for the banks. PayPal, the payments company that made a name for itself by partnering with online auction house eBay, began aggressively marketing a mobile app that lets users pay by swiping their smartphones at the checkout counter; Facebook recruited PayPal's former president, and reports surfaced that the social-media juggernaut would incorporate money transfers into its chat service; and Apple unveiled a secure-payments business in partnership with leading retailers such as pharmacy chain Walgreens. Even Snapchat, the textmessaging service targeted at teens, launched a money-transfer service called Snapcash.</p><p>The rationale for those aggressive moves is clear: Despite their phenomenal user growth and ubiquity in everyday life, many tech companies are struggling to make money. Amazon, for instance, lost $437-million (U.S.) last quarter, despite having a reputation as a digital-retailing genius. Canada's Big Six banks, by contrast, collectively earned $33billion last year, making financial services seem like a profit oasis.</p><p>As they seek to get a piece of that pie, the tech giants are preying on certain weaknesses in the banking system. Scores of Canadians are sick of shelling out skyhigh monthly fees and paying $3 ATM charges, so the digital stars are marketing themselves as cheaper, tech-savvy alternatives.</p><p>The new entrants also know that clients are won over more by point-of-sale ease than by bricksand-mortar branches - and that it doesn't take much to get someone to swipe their smartphone, instead of a piece of plastic, at the checkout counter.</p><p>In that environment, big, bureaucratic companies, historically slow to innovate, are struggling to compete. \"We have to find a way to experiment, or else someone will reinvent our model for us,\" says Dave McKay, RBC's chief executive officer.</p><p>Still, a revolution won't be easy for the upstarts: Because the Canadian banks are so profitable, they have ample gunpowder to put up a fight. They also possess a secret weapon when it comes to people's hard-earned savings, something the tech giants can't replicate overnight: public trust.</p><p>As much as Canadians gripe about their banks, they have learned to count on them. Even in the face of a global financial crisis, the country's top lenders did not need a government bailout. Our banks have also played significant roles in federal policymaking since their formation, intertwining them with this country's political and cultural identity. For decades, the media widely covered what bank CEOs had to say on hot-button issues, such as the threat of Quebec's separation and ongoing worries about a housing bubble.</p><p>Digital disruptors, meanwhile, have stockpiled far less public confidence, most famously facing an intense backlash for the way they track user data; the recurring controversy about Facebook's privacy policies is probably the most notorious example.</p><p>No one knows how this ends, and the uncertainty makes the fast-changing landscape only more difficult to navigate. Facebook, Google and Apple have a history of shunning the press, and all three declined or ignored our requests for comment. PayPal Canada General Manager Cameron Schmidt said in an interview that the company is trying to bill itself as a secure alternative to traditional banks, and that it seeks to \"delight\" Canadians - Silicon Valley's latest buzzword.</p><p>What's at stake is hard to overstate. Canada's banks are crucial to the country's stock market: The six largest lenders now constitute 22 per cent of the entire S&amp;P/TSX Composite Index - more than all the energy companies combined - and our financial institutions are widely held in everything from pension funds to RRSP accounts. Retail services also account for 50 to 70 per cent of the industry's profits. No matter how you feel about your bank, the potential economic and financial effects of disruption cannot be dismissed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The challenge from big tech</emphasis></p><p>Silicon Valley's intense push into financial services started near the turn of the century. As Internet use soared, PayPal developed a secure way for customers to pay for purchases online, blindsiding a banking industry that was stuck in its old ways and slow to react to the digital revolution.</p><p>But then, financial institutions got lucky: PayPal's service didn't spur an immediate, larger wave of innovation, largely because the dot-com bust put so many startups out of business. It wasn't until this decade that Silicon Valley got serious about its onslaught.</p><p>To disrupt retail banking, the tech giants are now zeroing in on what's called disintermediation - not exactly a term that comes up every day, but a practice that is incredibly toxic to financial institutions.</p><p>At their very core, banks act as intermediaries, connecting consumers with purveyors of goods and services, or with other consumers: A bank may help someone pay for an airline ticket, or it may help them send money to a friend. Disintermediation strips banks of their pivotal role as the main conduit for these transactions, inserting a tech company in the middle of the equation. It \"changes the direct relationship that a bank has with its customers,\" says Paul Battista, a financial services consultant at Ernst &amp; Young, who advises the country's biggest banks. \"That has profound implications.\"</p><p>Consider Facebook, which everyone is expecting will soon allow its users to send money to their friends through the service.</p><p>It may seem rather harmless, but by facilitating that transfer, the social-media star puts itself between the banks and their own customers.</p><p>Silicon Valley has two ways to capitalize on this disintermediation. The first involves amassing vast amounts of information about customer habits. \"One of the hallmarks of a digital era is that it leaves a trail of data,\" Mr. Battista says. Disintermediation starves banks of the oxygen necessary for healthy customer relationships. Financial institutions have invested heavily, for instance, in IT systems that help them cross-sell products; if they see that a client starts paying rent on a new property, say, they can offer their own renters' insurance. Should their access to data become diminished, so too will their capacity to make these kinds of sales.</p><p>In practical terms, a disintermediated bank may only see a transaction's value, instead of where it took place and at what time of day. At the same time, exponential gains in computer processing power in the past decade allow the disruptors who collect this information to store and study it for very little cost. Such information, for example, is very helpful to Google - it's why an ad for something surprisingly familiar appears when you're searching for something not even remotely related.</p><p>The second major way that tech firms are wringing money from disintermediation - an approach preferred by Apple - is quite different. Although the user would still pay for a pair of jeans, say, with an app on their iPhone, Apple's payment service scrubs any personal information as money moves through its system.</p><p>The data can't be tracked. In return, Apple takes 0.15 per cent of the total transaction value, just as it is paid a cut of every song purchased on iTunes. Multiply that fee by the $4-trillion in credit and debit transactions processed annually in the U.S., and the allure is evident.</p><p>Simple payment processing may not seem like a major threat to the banks, but there's a long game to remember, says Oliwia Berdak, a digital-payments analyst at Forrester Research in London. Apple has a history of building ecosystems that devastate. And there are no assurances that processing money is its end game. \"Once they have all the elements that make up a proper digital wallet - credit cards, coupons - they will be the intermediary through which [retailers and banks] will have to go,\" she says.</p><p>Amazon, as well, may provide important clues to what the banks will face from the likes of Apple: The digital retailer's website has become a go-to destination for so many types of goods that it sets the retail industry's rules. If its payments business is wildly successful, Apple may develop the same kind of pricing power that has allowed Amazon to big-foot the likes of the large book publishers. In that scenario, Apple could jack up transaction fees whenever it so chooses. And it won't just be the banks who suffer then: Eventually, those hikes are likely to be passed on to the customer in the form of higher prices.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What happens next?</emphasis></p><p>The big fear for the banks, though, is that this is just phase one. If Canadians get comfortable with moving their money through Apple or Facebook, they may one day be confident enough to store that money with them as well. Ultimately, that would mean the banks have less to lend, and loans are where they make big money - which explains why a startup called Lending Club is generating so much buzz.</p><p>The company, which went public last week in a deal that valued it at $5.4-billion (U.S.), provides an online platform that matches borrowers directly with lenders, offering a new way for riskier clients to get money at cheaper rates than those offered by the banks. What started in 2007 has caught on like wildfire; since its inception, Lending Club has made $6-billion (U.S.) worth of loans.</p><p>PayPal is also creeping into this territory. What was once solely an online payments company is quickly evolving. Just like a bank, PayPal now stores money for customers, and lends it too. Working Capital, its brand new borrowing arm for small businesses, has been so successful that it is going global less than a year after launching, starting with Britain and Australia.</p><p>Because Working Capital is making PayPal more like a bank, the company is expected to face increased regulatory burdens: Lenders are required to hold certain amounts of capital that protect them from potential losses on loans they've issued. It's not yet apparent how tech companies will clear this hurdle.</p><p>That complication aside, PayPal and its peers have all sorts of technological expertise that helps them serve the masses.</p><p>Instead of competing with the banks on the traditional playing field - in branches, for instance - they can build a brand new arena in the cloud and on mobile devices that the legacy lenders have been slow to gravitate toward.</p><p>Companies born in the digital era have also learned how to make products that are incredibly easy to use. Despite being in her 50s, an age group that typically isn't considered tech-savvy, Toronto IT recruiter Sonia Cameron, is a self-professed Apple aficionado. \"Every time I go to an Apple store, I'm always amazed at the demographics,\" she says.</p><p>\"There are babies to 90-year-olds.</p><p>That's what Apple brings to the table.\"</p><p>Ms. Cameron sees it in her own children, who range in age from 7 to 32. Her oldest son, Jamaal, now an engineer, played with calculators when he was younger, notes his mother; she compares that to today, when \"babies are touching your iPhone, and they know how to swipe.\"</p><p>Canadian banks, by contrast, aren't known for being nearly as imaginative - and their big investments this fall will take time to catch on. \"I don't see a big innovative push in the Canadian banking space,\" says Chris Wu, a 35-year-old Toronto-based digital-product manager who has worked everywhere from startups to Rogers Communications.</p><p>\"They've basically taken the ATM, digitized it, and dropped everything that isn't easy to do\" on a phone.</p><p>Because many banks ignored Silicon Valley's threat for so long, they now face a time crunch and a talent shortage in their quest to keep the new rivals at bay. That problem is only exacerbated by a fast-paced market in which \"innovation cycles are unquestionably shrinking,\" notes Todd Roberts, head of retail payments at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.</p><p>Another major hurdle: Trial and error isn't in the banks' DNA.</p><p>RBC chief McKay, a graduate in math and computer science from the University of Waterloo, visited Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., and witnessed one of its legendary \"hacks\" - a 48-hour cram session during which coders develop a new product or service. Being there, he quickly realized that banks don't move nearly as quickly.</p><p>\"Because we have big, complex organizations with integrated systems ... it takes a while to build something that works,\" he says. To be competitive, he believes new rules must be enforced, such as killing misguided projects before they become too bloated. \"We have to find a way to fail fast.\"</p><p>Why the banks can't be discounted In this race, it can be easy to write off the banks. Some people even take pleasure in predicting their demise. The truth is, they aren't nearly as lost in the woods as the naysayers would claim.</p><p>CIBC and RBC in particular have taken the threat of disruption seriously for a few years. In 2012, CIBC became the first Canadian bank to launch a mobile wallet, developing an app of its own that lets clients pay for goods and services with their smartphones - a product that rivals the innovations of Google, PayPal and Apple. RBC now has a similar offering, and it is doing what it can to partner with rivals.</p><p>Earlier this year, it teamed up with Facebook to allow its clients to transfer money to one another through the social-media company's chat function.</p><p>At the same time, Silicon Valley's sweethearts are hardly infallible. Despite their disruptive powers, the tech giants have skeletons in their own closets - in the form of failed products. Apple Maps and Google+ are two of the best known disasters. There's no guarantee they're won't be more.</p><p>More significantly, Google has already stumbled spectacularly in the payments business. The mobile wallet it launched in 2011 flopped because \"there was a lot of mistrust on the side of merchants as to how Google would use the data,\" recalls Ms. Berdak, the digital-payments analyst.</p><p>Similar privacy concerns have plagued other disruptors. Facebook has long dealt with them, and Uber is now reeling from the news that its employees can openly track where its users travel and at what time.</p><p>Although Apple is trying to circumvent those worries by building a system that scrubs data as money moves through it, its business may not prove to be any more lucrative. When its Apple Pay service launched in October, U.S. drug stores Rite Aid and CVS had plans to be on board. Not even a month later, they changed their minds, announcing their intention to build in-house services.</p><p>Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey set out to dominate this same space with a service named Square, designed to help people pay with a credit card almost anywhere. If a yoga instructor holds a class in the park, say, students can pay by swiping their card through a small reader that attaches to the instructor's smartphone. Despite spending hundreds of millions on marketing and designing an easy-to-use interface, Square is stumbling because competition from rival products is so fierce.</p><p>The extent to which technology companies can reach into the financial world also has limits, unless they radically change the way they operate. Banking is a \"very complex, capital-intensive business,\" says CIBC's Roberts.</p><p>\"It's highly regulated, and it takes a lot of skill to run one of these [institutions] well.\"</p><p>If the disruptors want to ultimately look more like banks, they will have to comply with additional regulations that call for things like deposit insurance and cash cushions to protect against loan losses. Ottawa seemed unwilling to fight back when Netflix batted away a request to disclose user data from the national telecommunications regulator, but Canada's powerful banking watchdogs aren't likely to roll over when the financial system is at stake.</p><p>Add to that the difficulty of dealing with a diverse client mix.</p><p>The banks' \"customer base is very, very heterogeneous,\" says Ms. Berdak. \"Some of them are old, some of them are very used to using branches.\" Because of that, even the most wildly successful payment model will take time to catch fire - and that, in turn, will give the banks time to respond.</p><p>\"Payments are not like buying a new widget or a new phone at the store,\" says Mark O'Connell, head of Interac Canada, whose debit system is by far the preferred method of payment for transactions under $50. They are \"ingrained in people's daily behaviours\" and \"changing ingrained behaviours takes more time than every prediction I've ever seen.\"</p><p>In fact, if anything, Canadians are increasingly loyal to their financial institutions. As online services, such as automatic bill payments, tie people to their lender of choice, it requires more and more ingenuity to sway a client to leave. Five years ago, about 15 per cent of Canadians were prepared to switch banks, according to Scotiabank. New data show the figure is now roughly half that. Ultimately, the success of the disruptors will hinge on whether such loyalties can be swayed.</p><p>The banks also boast a wildcard advantage - one that gets lost in all the anger over ATM fees and credit-card interest rates. \"We are entering a dynamic period when consumers will likely be assessing who they are willing to trust in this complex world of digital/mobile shopping, payments and couponing,\" consulting firm Alix Partners wrote in an influential survey released earlier this year. In this era, \"banks seem to start with a significant trust advantage.\"</p><p>This is especially true in Canada. Despite problems in the past, including two bank failures in the 1980s, our lenders were praised globally for their strength during the recent financial crisis: While American banks had to take government bailouts, Canada's lenders survived the storm all on their own. That track record builds a level of trust that's tough to match.</p><p>Even Mr. Wu, who would seem open to experimentation given his age and technology literacy, admits he is keen to try something like Apple Pay only because there's a safety net. \"I'm still dealing with [the banks] at the end of the day,\" he says. \"It's still coming back to the credit-card system and the banking system.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hubris, innovation, trust</emphasis></p><p>Still, Canada's banks can't afford to get cocky. Hubris, after all, has hurt them more than once.</p><p>When ING Groep came here in 1997, the Dutch giant marketed itself as a \"virtual\" bank that had no branches and focused on a simple, unrivalled product: highinterest savings accounts.</p><p>Unfazed, Canadian banks dismissed the threat. Fifteen years later, the Bank of Nova Scotiaspent $3.1-billion to acquire ING Direct Canada (since renamed Tangerine) and its 1.8 million customers.</p><p>The same thing happened when U.S. credit-card companies MBNA and Capital One crossed the border and offered large credit limits. By the time MBNA was swallowed up by TD in 2011, it had amassed approximately 1.8 million Canadian accounts. Capital One, which remains an independent company, had roughly $4.9-billion in loans out to Canadian cardholders at the end of 2013.</p><p>This time around, the banks aren't taking as long to respond, but they still face an uphill battle as they develop rival services and work to sell themselves as innovative. CIBC's mobile wallet had a slow rate of consumer adoption, and RBC acknowledges that it has sunk millions into projects that barely had uptake or never saw the light of day. By contrast, whatever Apple launches is automatically considered cool and garners reams of international attention.</p><p>Warding off the unusual competition will also require bags of money: In 2013, the country's banks shelled out $13-billion on technology, according to IDC Canada, a consultancy. This heavy cash outlay is required just as banking profits come under the gun. This fall, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Scotiabank - two of the country's three largest financial institutions - both started talking about the need to cost cuts, and Scotiabank has already slashed jobs.</p><p>Luckily for the lenders, their biggest advantage is arguably priceless - and has absolutely nothing to do with innovation.</p><p>Trust is something that must be earned over time, and the banks have already spent decades building this goodwill. \"We have the advantage,\" says RBC's McKay.</p><p>\"We can't squander it.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Tim Kiladze covers banking for The Globe and Mail's Report on Business.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Client</emphasis>: Customer opens Google Wallet app at the checkout counter, swipes the phone instead of a plastic card Client's bank: Google connects to client's account or credit card to obtain payment</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Merchant's bank</emphasis>: Money transfers between banks, but instead of collecting fees, Google keeps all the details, including item purchased, size, time of deal, etc.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Merchant</emphasis>: Because Google facilitated the flow, the tech company now has all the same info the merchant does</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key takeaway</emphasis>: Google designed its system to track user data - and then profit from this valuable information despite making some merchants unhappy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Client</emphasis>: Customer opens PayPal app at the checkout counter, swipes the phone instead of a plastic card</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Client's bank</emphasis>: May or may not be part of the payment.

It's due to be hit with a $5 billion fine from the FTC over privacy issues, but Wall Street has largely shrugged it off, viewing the core business as still strong. Click here for more BI Prime stories.[3] Facebook is about to get hit with a record-breaking $5 billion fine, but Wall Street isn't going to let that spoil its love for the social networking company. On Wednesday, Facebook announces its financial results for the second quarter of 2019 \u2014 and by and large the market is bullish about its prospects, with one analyst labelling its stock \"too cheap to keep ignoring.\" </p><p>The broadly positive sentiment from analysts highlights how Facebook's two years of constant scandals have done little to affect the company's meteoric growth and power, even as it is implicated in everything from the spread of hate speech that fueled genocide in Myanmar to numerous privacy lapses. In a note to investors published last week, analysts at Jefferies said that the company \"arguably has the best sentiment\" of any of the big tech firms right now \u2014 pointing to the fact that its share price has climbed 54% over the year to date, and as of Tuesday's close of market sits at $202.36. (They predict it will climb to up to $250.) Barclays analysts are also stoked about the company's potential, suggesting that its scandals might be largely in the rear-view mirror. \"As the conversation moves away from putting out privacy fires and back toward innovation, we think FB shares can continue to move higher,\" they wrote. Wall Street is expecting Facebook to post Q2 revenues of around $16.49 billion, up 25% year-over-year, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg, with earnings per share (GAAP) of $1.88. Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch also has an optimistic outlook (and a price target for the stock of $224). It thinks the \"biggest risk\" is currently \"cautious commentary on [second-half of the year] revenue growth on increasing consumer privacy tools adoption, usage shifts to stories, and other changes.\" But there are a bunch of \"green shoots\" for the company that are worth paying attention to, its analyst write, including the potential for Instagram Checkout and Explore, the launch of cryptocurrency Libra, and growth of Facebook's various video products. Until there is significant evidence that users are abandoning Facebook over its scandals \u2014 something that has yet to happen \u2014 the company's business is safe, Macquarie's analysts argued: \"We expect that despite horrific headlines for almost two years, usage trends remain strong. FB's user metrics (whether on Facebook or Instagram) are still key for the health of the overall ecosystem, As long as users continue to find value in FB platforms, as demonstrated by the fact that FB has 2.7b MAUs and 2.1b DAUs, we think advertisers will continue to show up. Until we see users leave, we think FB will execute with appropriate and evolving business tools and models.\" Facebook is also facing a $5 billion FTC settlement over privacy issues, which is expected to be announced in the coming days. This has already been priced in; the company announced last quarter that it had set aside $3 billion in anticipation for it. It's a record-breaking fine for a tech company, but still pales in comparison compared to Facebook's quarterly revenues, and investors aren't worried about its impact on the firm. In fact, after it announced its expectations for the fine in Q1, Facebook's stock leapt by as much as 8% in after-hours trading[4]. However, other regulatory threats are now looming on the horizon. On Tuesday, the US Department of Justice announced that it was launching an antitrust probe into \"whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers.\" The DOJ did not specify which companies its investigation is focusing on, but share prices of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and Google parent company Alphabet all fell about 1% (the stocks later recovered) in after-hours trading when the news came out.Got a tip?Contact this reporter via encrypted messaging app Signal at +1 (650) 636-6268 using a non-work phone, email at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rprice@businessinsider.com\">rprice@businessinsider.com</email>, Telegram or WeChat at robaeprice, or Twitter DM at@robaeprice[5].

Good, because the companies that run these platforms seem incapable of controlling the powerful global tools they have built. Good, because the toxic digital waste of misinformation that floods these platforms has overwhelmed what was once so very good about them. And indeed, by Sunday morning so many false reports about the carnage were already circulating online that the Sri Lankan government worried more violence would follow.</p><p>  It pains me as a journalist, and someone who once believed that a worldwide communications medium would herald more tolerance, to admit this -- to say that my first instinct was to turn it all off. But it has become clear to me with every incident that the greatest experiment in human interaction in the history of the world continues to fail in ever more dangerous ways.</p><p>  In short: Stop the Facebook/YouTube/Twitter world -- we want to get off.</p><p>  Obviously, that is an impossible request and one that does not address the root cause of the problem, which is that humanity can be deeply inhumane. But that tendency has been made worse by tech in ways that were not anticipated by those who built it.</p><p>  I noted this in my very first column for The Times almost a year ago, when I called social media giants ''digital arms dealers of the modern age'' who had, by sloppy design, weaponized pretty much everything that could be weaponized.</p><p>  ''They have weaponized civic discourse,'' I wrote. ''And they have weaponized, most of all, politics. Which is why malevolent actors continue to game the platforms and why there's still no real solution in sight anytime soon, because they were built to work exactly this way.''</p><p>  So it is no surprise that we are where we are now, with the Sri Lankan government closing off its citizens' access to social media, fearing misinformation would lead to more violence. A pre-crime move, if you will, and a drastic one, since much critical information in that country flows over these platforms. Facebook and YouTube, and to a lesser extent services like Viber, are how news is distributed and consumed and also how it is abused. Imagine if you mashed up newspapers, cable, radio and the internet into one outlet in the United States and you have the right idea.</p><p>  A Facebook spokesman stressed to me that ''people rely on our services to communicate with their loved ones.'' He told me the company is working with Sri Lankan law enforcement and trying to remove content that violates its standards.</p><p>  But while social media had once been credited with helping foster democracy in places like Sri Lanka, it is now blamed for an increase in religious hatred. That justification was behind another brief block a year ago, aimed at Facebook, where the Sri Lankan government said posts appeared to have incited anti-Muslim violence.</p><p>  ''The extraordinary step reflects growing global concern, particularly among governments, about the capacity of American-owned networks to spin up violence,'' The Times reported on Sunday.</p><p>  Spin up violence indeed. Just a month ago in New Zealand, a murderous shooter apparently radicalized by social media broadcast his heinous acts on those same platforms. Let's be clear, the hateful killer is to blame, but it is hard to deny that his crime was facilitated by tech.</p><p>  In that case, the New Zealand government did not turn off the tech faucets, but it did point to those companies as a big part of the problem. After the attacks, neither Facebook nor YouTube could easily stop the ever-looping videos of the killings, which proliferated too quickly for their clever algorithms to keep up. One insider at YouTube described the experience to me as a ''nightmare version of Whack-a-Mole.''</p><p>  New Zealand, under the suffer-no-foolish-techies leadership of Jacinda Ardern, will be looking hard at imposing penalties on these companies for not controlling the spread of extremist content. Australia already passed such a law in early April. Here in the United States, our regulators are much farther behind, still debating whether it is a problem or not.</p><p>  It is a problem, even if the manifestations of how these platforms get warped vary across the world. They are different in ways that make no difference and the same in one crucial way that does. Namely, social media has blown the lids off controls that have kept society in check. These platforms give voice to everyone, but some of those voices are false or, worse, malevolent, and the companies continue to struggle with how to deal with them.</p><p>  In the early days of the internet, there was a lot of talk of how this was a good thing, getting rid of those gatekeepers. Well, they are gone now, and that means we need to have a global discussion involving all parties on how to handle the resulting disaster, well beyond adding more moderators or better algorithms.</p><p>  Shutting social media down in times of crisis isn't going to work. I raised that idea with a top executive at a big tech company I visited last week, during a discussion of what had happened in New Zealand.</p><p>  ''You can't shut it off,'' the executive said flatly. ''It's too late.''</p><p>  The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips.

The main target of antitrust...</p><p>Given the global backlash against the power of big technology companies, why isn\u2019t Microsoft in the crosshairs? The main target of antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1990s is now riding high again as the world\u2019s most valuable company. Its power is greater than ever.</p><p>One reason is that the PC has been superseded and Microsoft is not the digital gatekeeper it once was. But if it inspires less fear and dread these days, it\u2019s also because it has done a better job than rivals of addressing the thorny issues facing the industry \u2014 by getting out ahead of the pack and spelling out ground rules for how powerful technologies like cloud computing and artificial intelligence should be used, for instance.</p><p>Much of the credit rests with Brad Smith, who has spent 17 years as Microsoft\u2019s chief lawyer and diplomat. The title of his new book, written with his colleague Carol Ann Browne, is a reminder that the arc of technology does not inevitably bend towards good or ill. Its effects depend on how it is used and who controls it.</p><p>Core to the authors\u2019 argument is that technology is too important to leave to the technologists. That runs counter to the view on the west coast of the US, where keeping government out of the way has been seen as a prerequisite to innovation. In a refreshingly direct preface, Bill Gates acknowledges his own mistake in once believing that Microsoft was best off ignoring Washington. \u201cI prided myself on how little time we spent talking to people in federal government,\u201d the founder writes. Getting tied up in a damaging antitrust case showed him this \u201cwas not a wise position to take\u201d.</p><p>Mr Gates\u2019s error has been repeated by the new tech powers. Unlike Microsoft, they have moved quickly to establish a large presence in Washington, but they have used it mainly to shield themselves from regulation, rather than build bridges.</p><p>Another important failing the book identifies is a readiness on the part of tech companies to turn a blind eye to the effects of their technology. As a diplomat, Smith does not point the finger too readily, but he can scarcely disguise his disdain for Facebook.</p><p>When it comes to Russia\u2019s US election interference, for instance, Smith suggests anyone familiar with how politics works should have realised that the platform would be a gift to autocrats: \u201cAnd who were the last to wake up? Idealistic Americans on the west coast of the US who had lived their entire lives in freedom.\u201d</p><p>He describes how it was a Facebook lawyer\u2019s open contempt for European privacy law that provoked Austrian activist Max Schrems to mount a challenge to the company in front of European regulators \u2014 a move that ended up shattering the lax regime under which US companies were allowed to ship the data of Europeans wholesale across the Atlantic.</p><p>So what will it take to tame today\u2019s most powerful technologies, as well as the companies who have risen to such power on the back of them? This prescription begins with a sound legal framework for today\u2019s data-centric digital economy. </p><p>On regulation Smith goes much further than others. While Google\u2019s top boss Sundar Pichai argues that regulators should stay out of AI, he dives straight in with an argument for legislation on facial recognition. Picking such a controversial application of AI is a good start and sets a pattern for future rulemaking. It is hard to disagree.</p><p>Smith also argues for a much closer partnership between governments and tech companies to establish new norms for how tech is used. In today\u2019s divided world, he argues that the best hope lies in building \u201ccoalitions of the willing\u201d, finding governments (if not the US) who will to take a stand.</p><p>His final worry is about the new concentrations of power and wealth. Since data is the key raw material, a handful of big companies could grab an insurmountable advantage, leading to \u201can enormous transfer of economic wealth from other industrial sectors to these AI leaders\u201d. His answer: make the tools for AI more widely available, and find new ways of sharing data.</p><p>Might these recommendations help to lay the ground for a more responsible tech industry that does more to heal society\u2019s divisions, rather than aggravate them? Smith certainly doesn\u2019t allow himself any easy conclusions. </p><p>Taming Big Tech will not be easy. But this book at least shows where to start.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Richard Waters is the FT\u2019s west coast editor</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tools and Weapons: the Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age, </emphasis>by Brad Smith and Carol Ann Brown<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">, Penguin Press, $30, 368 pp</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-1fd55de41d1011ea97dfcc63de1d73f4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XRW-DC31-JB77-K1WT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 16, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Moderated by Zanny Minton Beddoes, Editor-in-Chief at The Economist, today's session featured insightful discussion from Alison Lewis, CMO at Johnson &amp;#38; Johnson Consumer Companies, Diana O'Brien, Global CMO at Deloitte and Dario Gargiulo, CMO at Diesel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The impact of data and analytics on the marketing ecosystem and the changing nature of client-agency relationships emerged as key themes from the panel.</p><p>When asked about marrying brand purpose and data, Alison Lewis said it was about having one singular idea to guide the brand, but you still had to listen to the data. While 'gentle' was used to guide Johnson &amp;#38; Johnson's baby care brand, the company recently relaunched its 124-year-old baby shampoo brand with fewer, simpler, more naturally derived ingredients, because data was telling them what new Mums wanted.</p><p>\"That doesn't come from on high, it comes from reading the data but then linking that back to 'are we being gentle'. No we're not and how do we address that?\"</p><p>Dario Gargiulo cautioned there was a risk that marketers are driven by data instead of driving growth and change data. \"Too many times we over-estimate data. Of course we can create growth thanks to data but on the other hand it shouldn't be only about that.\"</p><p>Diana O'Brien agreed - \"data can provide understanding but it's still a human experience\".</p><p>\"We run the risk of disenfranchising lots of people, putting them to the side and not engaging with them if we rely too much on data. We have to bring that empathetic ear and creativity.\"</p><p>Lewis discussed the 'agency of the future' model, with both Omnicom and WPP creating bespoke agencies to service the Johnson &amp;#38; Johnson account.</p><p>\"We're really trying to act more like we have everything in-house and we can move quickly and we can get to greater cultural leadership moments in terms of taking advantage of immediate opportunities, but also inspiring more creativity by allowing us to have multiple disciplines sitting together and not in silos as we had in the past.\"</p><p>Lewis admitted that the process had been hard and \"a big change\" for both the company and the agencies involved.</p><p>Diana O'Brien said Deloitte's relationship with external agencies is stronger as a result of building an in-house agency. \"Our agencies are part of the fabric as opposed to a vendor which is what they were previously.\"</p><p>When asked if they saw big tech platforms as a threat or an opportunity, Lewis said she saw them as an opportunity.</p><p>\"You have the biggest focus group in the world sitting out there under your fingertips.\" She said tech had given Johnson &amp;#38; Johnson more creative ways to surround their products, for example the Neutrogena SkinScanner.</p><p>Gargiulo agreed that tech platforms had a positive impact but for Diesel, which changes it products every six months, there was a temptation to include similar products in each collection based on positive data. \"So you need to balance the data and make bold decisions about changing your approach.\"</p><p>For Lewis, her biggest concern was around growth. \"At the heart of that is remembering that we're serving humans every day and as long as we stay consumer-centric and really understand how to serve the consumer better and surprise and delight them every day we will drive growth, we will grow share.\"</p><p>Diana O'Brien agreed that growth was the focus for Deloitte, \"but growth in a new world\".</p><p>\"We particularly worry about industry 4.0, the digital disruption that's connecting everything, the regulation changes around the world and the changing expectations of our workforce and our customer around data and experience -they expect a highly personalised, customer experience but they expect you to protect their data at all times.\"</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6342660 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6342660</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SM9-9MC1-JC11-11YX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 21, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That would have been nice to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But in post-scandal eras, the pendulum of reform often swings too far in the opposite direction. Rigid regulation can quickly replace lax oversight. And lately, calls for the mutual fund industry to give greater disclosure are starting to go a little too far.</p><p>Not to sound like a shill for the money management business, but mutual funds already tell you enough to make a solid decision about whether to buy, hold or dump a fund.</p><p>Mutual fund companies are required to release the complete holdings of their funds twice a year. Many fund firms disclose their holdings more often. Oakmark, for example, releases quarterly reports for its funds, which include all the holdings of each fund. Some firms only reveal their portfolios twice a year -- and that bare minimum is plenty.</p><p>Fund managers will tell you that they aren't intentionally keeping shareholders in the dark. They simply want to prevent some investors from trading with or against them. Another defense you'll hear: More frequent disclosure of holdings will cost a lot more money.</p><p>Maybe. Maybe not. Both of these points are the subjects of heated debate.</p><p>But this debate is largely beside the point. A fund shareholder doesn't need to see all of the fund's holdings more than twice a year. Ask yourself: If a fund tells you every stock it owns every month -- or every quarter -- what are you going to do with that information?</p><p>Proponents of more frequent disclosure might say, \"Why not disclose and let the investor decide?\" Here's the thing: If you've done your research -- checked the fund's expenses, its past performance, its manager's history and the risk levels -- and picked a good fund, then you don't need quarterly disclosure. Trust your manager unless continued underperformance dictates otherwise.</p><p>Some proponents of more frequent fund disclosure will argue that investors deserve to know what's going on with their hard-earned money.</p><p><table pgwide=\"624\"><tgroup cols=\"1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colnum=\"1\" colwidth=\"624\"/><tbody><row><entry/></row><row><entry>How the Pros Steer Clear of the Tax Bite Some fund managers' strategies for tax efficiency can be modified for individual portfolios.</entry></row><row><entry>10 Questions With Transamerica Premier Growth Opportunity's Kenneth Broad The skipper takes Big Tech to task for stance on expensing options.

Mutual funds price their shares at the close of every trading day. You can assess the risk of a fund looking at its short-term performance. If the fund swings far more violently than the broader market or its peers, that fund might be riskier. And you always know the expense ratio of a fund. That number tells you exactly how much money won't be going in your pocket in the future.</p><p>Also, some funds disclose their top 10 holdings more frequently, which tells you plenty about how much risk a manager is taking on. If more than one-third of its assets are in its top 10, that's a fairly concentrated mix that could be volatile.</p><p>Looking at a fund's portfolio every six months is enough to see if the manager sticking to his style and investing your money prudently. A fund's overall style or composition probably won't change much over a few months.</p><p>And even if you notice that a fund manager is altering his style -- maybe shifting from growth stocks to more value-oriented names -- that fund doesn't necessarily deserve to get the boot. You're paying a manager to pick great stocks and navigate rough markets. Why second guess the professional?</p><p>During the market rout of the past few years, Tom Marsico nimbly shifted his growth funds -- such as Marsico Growth -- out of tech and into more defensive sectors like -- well, defense. Some of his picks were not classic growth stocks. But his strategy saved shareholders lots of money. Selling simply because of a so-called change in style would have been a mistake.</p><p>\"You're giving your money to a manager because he purportedly knows more than you,\" says Bob Olstein, manager of the Olstein Financial Alert fund. \"It's not to get ideas or be a Monday morning quarterback.\"</p><p>Olstein only reveals the complete holdings of his fund twice a year. \"That's plenty,\" he says. \"But I do write my shareholders every quarter to tell them what's going on and what we're thinking. We give them performance, talk about what we're doing and our thoughts about stocks or the market.\"</p><p>The idea is to make investing easier. And frankly, more frequent disclosure of a fund's holdings will only make it more confusing.</p><p>Fund companies could, however, figure out a better way to present the information they're already required to reveal. Better disclosure -- not more frequent -- is what the industry needs to work on.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-#10042319#</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2002</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:46SK-6BB0-00MP-T0W5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>TheStreet.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19301\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2002 TheStreet.com, Inc.</copyright><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>September 16, 2002 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>JOHNSON CONTROLS INTERNATIONAL PLC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>TYC (NYSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS561621 SECURITY SYSTEMS SERVICES (EXCEPT LOCKSMITHS)\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0NAICS339113 SURGICAL APPLIANCE &amp;

But their leak this month triggered a very public showdown between the fast-rising frontrunner for the Democratic nomination and one of the most powerful executives in the world - a fascinating subplot of the 2020 primary.</p><p>\"It is the one thing that the CEOs of these companies absolutely hate,\" said Sarah Miller, deputy director of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">Open Markets Institute</url>, a Washington-based thinktank that advocates against monopolies.</p><p>They're begging for regulation because they know they game it, they know they can shape it, they know they can avoid it</p><p>  Sarah Miller    </p><p>\"They're begging for regulation because they know they game it, they know they can shape it, they know they can avoid it and they know that it will likely inhibit their competitors who won't have the same resources. But, more than anything, they do not want to be broken up.\"</p><p>Warren wants to regulate tech platforms as utilities, targeting companies that earn $25bn or more in global annual revenue. She would appoint regulators to unwind \"illegal and anticompetitive tech mergers\".</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies,\" she said, announcing her policy, \"have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy.\"</p><p>According to audio recordings leaked to the Verge, Zuckerberg called Warren's plan an \"existential\" threat.</p><p>\"If she gets elected president,\" he said, \"then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.\"</p><p>\"What would really 'suck',\" Warren <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">tweeted</url> in reply, \"is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\"</p><p>The war of words escalated after Facebook's decision to allow Trump's re-election campaign run a $1m <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">ad campaign</url> containing lies about Joe Biden. Warren responded by placing her own ad on Facebook.</p><p>It started with Warren announcing \"Breaking News\", before declaring that Zuckerberg and Facebook were supporting Trump's re-election. Warren then says, \"You're probably shocked, and you might be thinking, 'How could this possibly be true?' Well, it's not.\"</p><p>The point Warren was making is that by allowing her ad, Facebook was showing itself to be a \"disinformation-for-profit machine\".</p><p>Since the <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">Cambridge Analytica scandal broke</url>, Zuckerberg has worked to smooth relationships with politicians in DC. But Warren seems in no mood to play nice. The two sparred again after Zuckerberg defended Facebook in a speech at Georgetown University in Washington on Thursday.</p><p>\"We can continue to stand for free expression, understanding its messiness, but believing that the long journey towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us,\" Zuckerberg said, speaking in the ornate Gaston Hall, where presidents and foreign dignitaries have delivered major addresses. \"Or we can decide the cost is simply too great. I'm here today because I believe we must continue to stand for free expression.\"</p><p>Warren's response was withering: \"Mark Zuckerberg's speech today shows how little he learned from 2016, and how unprepared Facebook is to handle the 2020 election.\"</p><p>                   'Mark's power is un-American'                   </p><p>Warren has taken the most aggressive posture toward big tech, part of a call for \"big, structural change\" to the American economy. <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">After she introduc</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">ed her proposal</url> in March, her campaign put up a billboard near a busy transit station station in San Francisco that said in capital letters: \"Break up big tech\".</p><p>Before the latest debate, the Massachusetts senator announced that she would not take contributions of more than $200 from \"executives at big tech companies\", even as employees of those companies <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">help power her campaign</url>.</p><p>Warren has attracted an interesting ally: Chris Hughes, who co-founded Facebook with Zuckerberg at Harvard. Last week, the organization he co-chairs, the Economic Security Project, <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">announced the creation</url> of a $10m \"anti-monopoly fund\".</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">Writing in the New York Times</url> in May, Hughes said Zuckerberg's influence had far exceeded \"anyone else in the private sector or government\" and said Facebook's concentration of wealth, power and influence - 2.7bn people use it or its other platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp, each month- posed a threat to democracy itself.</p><p>\"Mark's power is unprecedented and un-American,\" Hughes wrote. \"It is time to break up Facebook.\"</p><p>Nick Clegg, the former British deputy prime minister who is now Facebook's vice-president for global affairs and communications, <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">responded</url> in the New York Times later that month: \"Facebook shouldn't be broken up - but it does need to be held to account. Anyone worried about the challenges we face in an online world should look at getting the rules of the internet right, not dismantling successful American companies.\"</p><p>The drive to break up Facebook has plenty of critics who agree the company has too much power but do not believe such action would address many of the major concerns with the platform, including how to <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">strengthen</url> user privacy protections,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">improve</url> election security and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">stop</url> propaganda intended to incite violence and extremism.</p><p>In a <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">Washington Post op-ed</url> earlier this year, shortly after Warren unveiled her plan, Zuckerberg called for \"updating the rules of the internet\" and outlined four areas where he said new regulation was needed: \"Harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.\"</p><p>We need to say to Facebook, 'We're going to treat you like a public utility, like AT&amp;T or the electric company'</p><p>  Dipayan Ghosh    </p><p>Dipayan Ghosh, a co-director of the Platform Accountability Project at the Harvard Kennedy School, <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">has argued</url> breakup is not the only way to thwart Facebook's capacity for \"capitalistic overreaches\" and \"economic exploitation\". He favors a \"novel, stringent\" set of \"pro-competition policies\".</p><p>\"We need to say to Facebook, 'We're going to treat you like a public utility, like AT&amp;T or the electric company,\" Ghosh said. \"We are going to make sure you can't make any mergers or acquisitions, we're going to tax you heavily, we are going to develop stringent privacy regulations that you're going to need to follow.\"</p><p>There are those who argue Facebook should not be singled out by a president, as the former congressman Beto O'Rourke said during the Democratic debate. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate antitrust subcommittee and another presidential contender, advocated for bolstering regulatory agencies to promote competition.</p><p>The debate underscored a broad consensus: that tech companies wield far too much power and influence.</p><p>\"It's remarkable that virtually all of these candidates are saying that there are a handful of tech companies that have too much power,\" said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">Institute for Local Self-Reliance</url>. \"If you turn the clock back even just three years, the idea that that discussion would have happened would seem pretty far-fetched.\"</p><p>                   'Dinners with lots of people'                   </p><p>Silicon Valley has faced a reckoning in Washington since 2016. But the events of the past few weeks have sharpened the divide and pulled Zuckerberg far more publicly and personally into the political maelstrom.</p><p>He is expected to <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c\">testify on Capitol Hill</url> this week, for the first time since he faced a public grilling in April 2018 over the company's handling of user information, whether it should be more heavily regulated, alleged censorship of conservative content and the extent of Russian meddling. In the 18 months since, Democrats and Republicans have only grown more frustrated, setting the stage for another contentious hearing.</p><p>Meeting new people and hearing from a wide range of viewpoints is part of learning ...

John Meagher reports</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Standard Oil was one of the largest companies the world has ever known. Co-founded by tycoon John D Rockefeller in 1870, it grew in tandem with the rise of the motor car, and by the second decade of the 20th century, its dominance looked unshakable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But then, in 1911, Standard Oil was no more.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a landmark ruling by the US Supreme Court, the corporation was deemed to be a monopoly. It was broken up into multiple companies, which came to be known as the 'Seven Sisters', and many of today's big-name brands - including Texaco and Esso - can trace their origins to that break-up.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">US presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren cited the example of Standard Oil when she talked about a need to end the monopoly of some of the world's biggest companies. In a move that has caused reverberations in Silicon Valley and beyond, the Democrat senator is calling for drastic change and an end to the dominance of the tech giants who have only come into being within the past 25 years.</p><p>\"Facebook, Amazon and Google have vast power over our economy and democracy,\" she tweeted last weekend. \"Time to break up these companies so they don't have so much power over everyone else.\"</p><p>The hashtag she chose, #breakupbigtech, mirrored the views of many tech-watchers around the globe.</p><p>Warren, who is considered to be one of the more progressive thinkers of her generation, outlined in detail on Medium - the online publishing platform - about how such a break-up could happen and why it is so urgently needed. \"Today's Big Tech companies have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.</p><p>\"I want a government that makes sure everybody - even the biggest and most powerful companies in America -plays by the rules. And I want to make sure that the next generation of great American tech companies can flourish. To do that, we need to stop this generation of Big Tech companies from throwing around their political power to shape the rules in their favour and throwing around their economic power to snuff out or buy up every potential competitor.\"</p><p>Warren's argument resonates strongly with Daragh O Brien, founder of Castlebridge, an Irish company specialising in information trust. \"I was pleasantly unsurprised when she said that, because she's echoing what European Commission has been saying,\" he says. \"These tech companies are, effectively, monopolies with a huge impact on smaller business and competitors trying to enter the market. Right now, they tend to be dependent on these big conglomerates to build a competing product.</p><p>\"The big issue is the level of invasiveness, the tracking, the gathering of information of individuals. And that arises because of the interconnectedness that exist between the various arms of these businesses.\"</p><p>He is especially concerned with the growth of Facebook. \"Mark Zuckerberg [Facebook founder] has come out to say that he wants to integrate WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, which is the very thing he was told he could not do by the European Union, but he's announced that he's going to go ahead and do it anyway.</p><p>\"The issue there is Facebook would have access to all the meta data, and what that means is all the information about who you communicate with, how often, how frequently - not the content - but the strength of connection in your network. And that's incredibly useful to them for advertising.\"</p><p>O Brien says the business model of the tech giants is \"leveraging a dominance in one area to generate cash flows and income in another area\" and argues that, from an EU perspective, it's a \"classic definition of an abusive monopoly\".</p><p>He believes now is the time to break up the likes of Facebook and Google, before they become even bigger and yet more entrenched in everyday life. \"We are at a point now where it would be possible to break apart or to prevent the merger of different aspects of these companies, such as taking the advertising business of Facebook and making it a completely separate entity to the social, communication and community aspect of Facebook.</p><p>\"In three to five years time, I don't think it will be possible. There's a very narrow window here. I'm not against technology. I don't want to appear to be a Luddite - the problem is the underlying business model. That business model has grown to a huge degree by becoming increasingly anti-competitive.\"</p><p>Digital marketing consultant and trainer Damien Mulley is sceptical about #breakupbigtech. He believes fit-for-purpose regulation is what is required and says the critical problem at present is that regulators are playing catch-up. \"I think the problem is these tech companies are unregulated and they're way ahead of the regulators that we do have.</p><p>'We need to stop these big firms from shaping the rules in their favour' \"If you look at Facebook, the data protection commissioner here has hired way more staff just to deal with Facebook and all the issues around their data. The had a year-long investigation into the privacy settings of Facebook, but nothing has changed really. Facebook has gotten bigger and their attitude to privacy hasn't changed.\"</p><p>He believes it would be exceptionally difficult to split up Facebook, which besides the titular social media platform, is also owner of Instagram and WhatsApp, and wonders if such a move would have much impact on Facebook's stance on privacy. \"I don't think it would slow the growth of the existing Facebook or change their attitude to privacy or anything like that.</p><p>\"What we need to see is proper regulation and Facebook already has the know-how to self-regulate as it sees fit,\" he adds, citing the experience of Elizabeth Warren, this week. Comments she had posted on Facebook about #breakupbigtech were removed by the social media giant. It later reinstated them, saying it welcomed \"robust debate\".</p><p>Her post immediately got suspended thanks to Facebook's internal triggers,\" Mulley says. \"They've got the know-how to regulate what goes up already, but they don't want to do that, because even if Nazi stuff goes up there, it will attract comments and those comments can be monetised. They don't want to regulate because it will cost them money.\"</p><p>Mulley believes Amazon may be easier to break up. \"It has so many companies that people just don't realise [the extent of its interests].</p><p>\"They own companies that you might think they'd be in completion with - such as Abe Books, the second-hand books website that's the biggest in the world - and they're able to crush smaller companies like <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.diapers.com\">www.diapers.com</url>, who they had tried to buy and then undercut in price until they got the firm for a knock-down price.\"</p><p>He argues that the conversation needs to focus on why companies like Amazon become so enormous. \"It's not just about crushing the opposition and taking over hundreds of companies,\" he says, \"it's asking what sort of wages they're paying their warehouse staff and what conditions are like for them.\"</p><p>Last year, it was reported that some staff were not taking toilet breaks for fear that they would lose their jobs.</p><p>Meanwhile, Daragh O Brien is hopeful that the example of Standard Oil - and the break-up of steel and rail industries in the early 20th century - will lead to a Big Tech shake-up. \"Ultimately, despite appearances at the moment, America is still a democracy,\" he says. \"We've been here before, where large industries have been broken up. EU and America are not that far apart when it comes to the approach to the tech giants. It needs to happen.\"</p><p>'We need to stop these big firms from shaping the rules in their favour' ;</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren: on a mission to break up Big Tech</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-147422762</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN6-RHG1-JCBW-N52B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1286\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 16, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It informs my attitude to the stock market and you'd be wise to adopt it as well. As a historian, I shake my head at people who assume things can continue as they are indefinitely. </p><p>That's never happened in recorded history. That's especially true of the stock market. Twice in the last 30 years, we've seen a massive rotation from one segment of the stock market to another. In the run-up to the dot-com collapse in 2000, technology stocks were all the rage. But for the three years after the bubble burst, small-cap value ruled the roost:The pattern reversed after the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009 (GFC). Technology stocks rocketed away from the rest of the market. Today the top five technology stocks in the S&amp;#38;P 500 Index \u2014Facebook Inc. (Nasdaq: FB)[1],Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL)[2],Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN)[3]andAlphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOGL)[4]\u2014 represent almost 23% of its value. That's the highest concentration of value in the top five stocks ever. Many investors assume this will continue indefinitely. But they should heed Heraclitus' warning and look for the next big change.The Winds of ChangeThe six largest technology stocks in the U.S. today \u2014 the five above plusNetflix Inc. (Nasdaq: NFLX)[5]\u2014 have appreciated by over 3,700% since the GFC. They've added another 33% just since the beginning of this year. By contrast, the S&amp;#38;P 500 Index as a whole is struggling to break even on the year. Without the big six, it would be down substantially. This outstanding run has convinced many investors to build their portfolios around Big Tech. But that could prove costly, given the storm clouds gathering on the horizon. All the big companies are currently priced well above the average price-to-earnings ratio for the S&amp;#38;P 500 Index, which is around 26. Amazon's is 146. Those premium valuations are based on expectations of future growth, as has long been the case. But there are four less visible elements in Big Tech's outperformance that suggest change could be on the way. Let's consider them. No. 1:Big Tech has become a victim of its own success. Many institutional portfolio managers, especially in pension and mutual funds, are not permitted to hold more than 5% of their portfolio in any one stock. All the Big Tech stocks are pushing those limits right now, which suggests that institutional demand for their shares will soon decline. No. 2:The Big Tech stocks have grown to dominance in a historically weak economic environment, which helped to boost their returns. Annual U.S. gross domestic product growth over the last decade has averaged around 2%, compared to 4% in the '80s and '90s and over 5% in the period after the Second World War. The resulting flat performance of real-world companies has made low-capital, high-margin Big Tech companies attractive by comparison, helping to push their prices up as investors have sought better returns. No. 3:Amid the COVID-19 crisis, the price differential between Big Tech and the rest of the stock market has become extreme. If these stocks fail to maintain their momentum for any reason, that will quickly drag down the entire stock market. Investors will pull their money out and move into bonds or gold, putting further downward pressure on prices, including the Big Tech companies themselves. No. 4:All of these companies are facing intense regulatory scrutiny for their monopolistic power. Authorities in the U.S. and Europe are becoming increasingly concerned that their market and financial power is distorting not only the stock market and the economy, but political life as well. The top executives from Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet will all be testifying about these antitrust issues on Wednesday \u2014 the day before those four report earnings.The Paradox of BignessThese factors suggest that Big Tech's run may come to an end sooner than many investors expect. But there's an important paradox at work here one that could lead to big profits if you position yourself correctly. I noted above that the largest technology stocks have benefited from the relatively weak performance of the real economy over the last decade. Companies selling physical products into a weak market weren't as attractive to investors. But with interest rates at historical lows, those investors wanted to buy stocks and Big Tech was there waiting for them. The paradox is that if the economy begins to recover, we will likely see a rotation away from these growth stocks toward cyclical value stocks that have been neglected for years. That could lead to a reversal in the relative performance of the two market segments. This is precisely what happened at the end of last week, when sharp drops in the Big Tech names sent the SPDR S&amp;#38;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) down 1.19%, while the Invesco S&amp;#38;P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) was off just 0.16%: Get Ready for the ReversalThe basic setup here is that one sector of the stock market \u2014 growth-oriented Big Tech \u2014 is nearing the upper limits of its long run. It's opposite \u2014 value-oriented mid and small caps \u2014 are trading at bargain prices and poised to recover strongly if and when the economy rebounds. Under these circumstances, a savvy investor might want to put some money into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like theVanguard Value ETF (NYSE: VTV)[6]or theiShares S&amp;#38;P Small-Cap 600 Value ETF (NYSE: IJS)[7]to pre-position for upcoming rotation toward the sectors. The likely gains will be much higher than those for already extended growth stocks. That could happen a lot sooner than anyone realizes. Most of the Big Tech stocks report earnings this week. That means rotation could begin almost immediately. Whatever you do, don't rest your laurels \u2014 or your money \u2014 on what has gone before. Heraclitus could tell you why.

Plus, Boeing (NYSE:BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg starts two days of testimony in front of Congress about the 737 MAX. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, 29th October.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. The Saudi Aramco IPO is here (probably)</p><p>Saudi Aramco, the world's most profitable company, is finally set to being marketing its initial public offering on Sunday, Saudi state TV reported.</p><p>The news triggered selling in European stock markets Tuesday, as portfolio managers made room in their portfolios for what is expected to be a large block of shares by paring existing holdings.</p><p>Questions still remain about the company's valuation. While the country's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had sought a valuation of $2 trillion, reports suggest bankers have guided for somewhere between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion. If the deal does go ahead, it will represent a substantial payday for Wall Street banks involved in it.</p><p>The Al-Arabiya channel said the company intends to start trading on the local Tadawul market on Dec. 4.</p><p>2. Oil prices slip on Russian comments; API data due</p><p>Crude oil prices fell to their lowest in nearly a week after Russian deputy energy minister Pavel Sorokin said it was still too early to commit to additional measures to stabilize a market haunted by the threat of oversupply.</p><p>Sorokin said in an interview with Tass that the existing output restraint agreement, which has held 1.2 million barrels a day of crude back from world markets, has been effective so far. It's consistent with previous official Russian comments suggesting that they expect this year's slide in prices to stop any further loss of market share to U.S. shale producers.</p><p>Oil traders didn't lose any time remarking that the planned Dec. 4 stock market debut of Aramco is just one day before Russia, OPEC and other major exporters meet in Vienna to review the output restraint deal, which is scheduled to run through the end of March.</p><p>Later Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute will release its weekly data for U.S. crude oil inventories. Analysts expect the official government data to show a build of 729,000 barrels.</p><p>3. Stocks set for lower open as Fed meets</p><p>U.S. stock markets are set to open lower, with the start of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting deterring bets on new record highs.</p><p>By 6:30 AM ET, Dow futures were down 55 points or  0.2%, while S&amp;P 500 Futures were down 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 Futures were flat.</p><p>Tuesday's earnings parade is a cast of thousands, with the following companies all set to report:  Mastercard, Merck, Pfizer, Amgen, Stryker, Mondelez, ConocoPhillips(NYSE:COP), S&amp;P Global Inc (NYSE:SPGI), Marsh McLennan, AMD, Shopify, Allstate, Electronic Arts, Corning, Edison, Kellogg, KKR, Martin Marietta, Mattel and FireEye.</p><p>In Europe,<br/><br/>BP<br/><br/>(LON:BP) kicked off earnings season for Big Oil with a 41% drop in underlying net profit that kept its debt levels slightly above its targeted range.</p><p>4. Alphabet's rising cost problem</p><p>Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the parent company of Google, said revenue grew 20% to $40.5 billion in the third quarter but profits still disappointed due to rising costs, not least the cost of bulking up its cloud-computing business, where it has much ground to make up on rivals Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The shares fell 2% in after-hours trading.</p><p>Overall profit of $7.1 billion was down 23% from a year earlier and some 15% below analysts' expectations.</p><p>Together with disappointing results from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), the numbers suggest that Big Tech is starting to suffer from cost inflation, even if it's still churning out healthy amounts of cash. The company's payroll expanded by some 6% in the quarter to over 114,000.</p><p>Elsewhere after Monday's closing bell, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) fell 10% despite posting its first quarterly profit and raising its revenue outlook. The post-IPO lockup on investors expires today.</p><p>5. Boeing's Muilenburg due before Congress</p><p>Boeing (NYSE:BA) chief executive Dennis Muilenburg is due to start two days of testimony before Congress regarding the 737 MAX scandal.</p><p>In prepared statements for his Senate testimony later today, Muilenburg will admit \"mistakes\" and repeat promises that the company will never let similar mistakes happen again.</p><p>How convincing Muilenburg's testimony is could have a big influence on the regulatory backlash coming its way. Peter DeFazio, the chairman of the House of Representatives transport committee, told reporters on Monday said he would propose a new law overhauling the regulatory system, which lets the Federal Aviation Administration pass on responsibility for approving design changes to aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing (NYSE:BA).</p><p><br/>Investing.com offers an extensive set of professional tools for the financial markets.<br/>Read more News on Investing.com and download the new Investing.com apps for Android and iOS!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOREN-158092440</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOREN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XCN-WFD1-JDJN-63CP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399231</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"844\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fusion Media Limited Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Technological usage in finance is something that has disrupted the different aspects of the financial system today. Fintech covers aspects from platforms for making mobile payments to blockchain and virtual currencies[1], HFT (high-frequency trading, and crowdfunding. This has caused some evolution in the financial industry[2] and has led to a change in how businesses and organizations now handle their finances. </p><p>Crowdfunding is one aspect of the financial system that is also very much affected by financial technology. According to Investopedia[3], crowdfunding refers to using an amount of money gotten from a large crowd of individuals as capital to start up[4] your business venture. It is, therefore, a collective effort by people, including friends, families, customers, and investors, to raise money for a particular cause. It is primarily done through online crowdfunding platforms and social media.  Get The Full Series in PDF Get the entire 10-part series on Charlie Munger in PDF.

Q4 2019 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[5] In 2014, over $16B were raised worldwide through different crowdfunding campaigns. The figure increased by more than double in 2015 to more than $34 billion, and it has continued to increase since then. In the short time that it has existed, crowdfunding has proven to be very popular worldwide. Following these trends, there are signs that are ideal for investors[6] that are socially conscious. Here are 10 crowdfunding[7] fintech startups for socially conscious investors.The Biggest Crowdfunding Fintech Startups KickstarterIt makes sense to kick start this list with one of the biggest crowdfunding platforms globally. This crowdfunding platform is a global platform that crowdsources funds for projects such as music, tech, art, movies, photography, games, design, and comics. Over 80,000 projects have been funded to completion by this community. Kickstarter has about 300,000 individuals who have been involved in the funding of 10 or more projects on the platform. There's also an incentive. People who support projects on Kickstarter are given high-class know-how and tangible rewards in a deal for their funds.GoFundMeThis is another fintech[8] crowdfunding startup that allows people source for funds from the crowd, people that are willing to help them, for their events. People use funds from a GoFundMe campaign to sponsor their life events such as getting travel accessories[9] and other things needed for graduation and other celebrations. But that's not all. This platform can also be used to source for funds during challenging circumstances such as a serious illness or an accident. This platform has raised over $2 billion for people through different inspiring GoFundMe campaigns.PeerbackersThis platform is well known and considered to be one of the top platforms for crowdfunding in the industry. The focus of Peerbackers crowdfunding platform is to source for funds for entrepreneurs and innovators that have good ideas and good business plans but do not have the funds to execute them and have also not been able to get investors to invest in their ideas. This platform has hosted and funded thousands of creative, entrepreneurial and civic projects for different people in different parts of the world. This fintech crowdfunding startup[10] birthed an academy by founders who saw the high rate of project failure in different industries. The crowdfunding academy is aimed at providing education and support to people that are hoping to source money for their projects from a crowdfunding campaign.CrowdfunderCrowdfunder is a crowdfunding platform that is the leading platform for sourcing for crowdfunds in the United Kingdom. According to regular contributors at Crowdfunder, this platform is where great projects and good people meet up, and the end is to bring great ideas to fruition. There are more than 500,000 members on this platform and there are thousands of projects that have been sponsored by funds from the members of this platform, and many others that are still being supported. The members of these communities are stimulated to get engaged in crowdfunding by a campaign sponsorship product and a distribution of the fund in the community.OurCrowdThis crowdfunding startup was created for investors that have their accreditation and are able to provide startups with venture capital funding. It sounds like a lot, but the reason this company was founded was to help startups and entrepreneurs gain their ground in the market. The founder of this company is Jonathan Medved, a serial entrepreneur, venture capitalist, angel investor. Back in March 2016, OurCrowd platform raised more than $10 million from the United Overseas Bank of Singapore, and it had just one goal in mind, which was to increase and expand its presence in the Asian markets.TiltThis is another crowdfunding platform that enables people, groups, and communities to collect, fundraise and pool money online. The growth of this platform has been drastic in the last few years, and for three years now, it has continued to grow popular among college students and community organizers. In one review of the different crowdfunding platforms by Social Times, they concluded that the crowdfunding platform that was growing the fastest was Tilt. This means that this platform beat other crowdfunding platforms that are popular as well such as GoFundMe, Kickstarter and the rest. This is most likely due to the fact that it is the commonest of the crowdfunding platforms among college students. So, it tends to grow faster than the others.CrowdcubeThis is a reputable crowdfunding platform backed up by an award to show for it. It is also one of the leading investment platforms in the UK. This is coupled with the fact that is one of the establishment that has been in existence for the longest period among those providing different firms the opportunity to raise the funds that they need in the UK. It was built as an alternative to venture capital funding, banks, and angel investors. It is not used today as one of the go-to platforms for entrepreneurs and startups looking to raise capital from a crowdsourced fund. This platform allows individuals to loan or invest in small businesses and startups and they'll receive an annual return on equity.IndiegogoThis crowdfunding platform was established in 2008, and in 12 years, it has risen as a global platform for people who needs others to help them raise funds for certain reasons. It is actually one of the first platforms to help people with crowdfunding before the influx of other sites and platforms. Indiegogo is a platform where people can go to raise funds for their start-up business, ideas or for the sake of charity. At least fifteen million people visit this site every month, and the site helps to publicize people that have great ideas but are unable to raise the funds that they need to finance their dreams by themselves.CircleUpCircleUp is a platform that acts as a middleman between retail companies and customers that are innovative with investors that have been accredited. It basically connects those that need funds with those that have funds to invest. Businesses that are able to produce new consumer products are connected to people who are willing to invest in the business. They are also linked up with other companies that can become their potential distribution partners such as eBay, General Mills, and P...128 different companies have raised as much as $145 million on this platform. On this platform though, the businesses must have revenue that's good enough (which is typically more than $500,000 per year) or at least must have other things to point to as potential for its success. Before the companies are accepted and allowed on the platform, they have to first go through an assessment by private equity investors. Once they have been assessed and cleared, they can then feature on the site. This company also starred on the squawk box of CNBC.SeedrsThis is a crowdfunding platform that is based on equity and is currently one of the leading platforms in the world for people to invest in the business that they believe in. this platform is also under regulations by the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) in the United Kingdom. It is, in fact, the earliest of all equity crowdfunding platforms to receive regulatory approval from the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.ConclusionWhile they are much more crowdfunding platforms and startups in the financial ecosystem[11] and the number continues to increase by the years, it is obvious that they have been a success thus far. Having helped numerous people with funds to start their businesses or for other important things in their lives, which also includes helping people in times of distress. In fact, there are some fintech crowdfunding sites that are dedicated to a charitable cause and helping the needy, with examples being US-based iDonate and Australian-based Chuffed.

Facebook, despite being one of the world's most powerful technology companies, has suffered serious reputation damage after the Cambridge Analytica scandal[2] and massive data breaches[3]. A survey conducted by Recode and Toluna last year named Facebook as the least trustworthy[4] company. Here we take a look at the top 10 most respected companies in the world. </p><p>As you'd expect, Facebook is not one of them.Ranking the most respected companiesThe ranking is based on data from Fortune magazine's 2019 list[5] of the most admired companies. Five of the top 10 most respected companies are from the technology sector. Fortune joined hands with management consulting firm Korn Ferry to compile a list of global companies with the best reputations. Korn Ferry and Fortune asked 3,750 executives, analysts, and directors to rate businesses in their own industry on nine criteria: Innovation, people management, use of corporate assets, social responsibility, quality of management, financial soundness, long-term investment value, quality of products and services, and global competitiveness. These emerged as the ten most respected companies:10- FedExWith an overall score of 6.47, FedEx is the 10th most respected company. The Memphis-based courier delivery services giant is known for its overnight shipping services. FedEx was the first to allow customers to track their packages in real-time, which makes it easier to find lost packages.9- JPMorgan ChaseNew York-based JPMorgan Chase is one of theworld's largest banks[6]. It offers a wide range of services such as asset management, investment banking, brokerage, credit cards, and treasury ...curity services. JPMorgan Chase was formed in 2000 following the merger of JPMorgan with Chase Manhattan. The financial services giant has an estimated $2.73 trillion in assets under management.8- NetflixNetflix moved up from 11th place last year to become the 8th most respected company this year with an overall score of 7.64. The video streaming giant has built a massive collection of original movies and TV shows. It spends about $12 billion a year to produce original programming. However, Netflix is going to face stiff competition[7] from Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus streaming services, both of which would launch later this year.7- AlphabetAlphabet is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Android, and many other popular technology products and services that we use almost every day. It has slipped from 3rd place last year to 7th this year. Regulators are currently investigating whether Google used its dominance to stifle competition. Politicians and industry experts are calling for breaking up of big tech companies including Alphabet. Only time will tell whether it would be broken up.6- MicrosoftMicrosoft is one of the best turnaround stories of the decade. The company's Surface line of hardware products have become immensely popular. Since taking over as its CEO, Satya Nadella has successfully turned the business around and given it a new direction. He has focused on cloud computing and on working with companies that are Microsoft's competitors. The company's stock hasmore than tripled under his leadership, surpassing $1 trillion in valuation.5- StarbucksStarted in 1971, Seattle-based Starbucks is the world's largest coffeehouse chain with more than 30,000 locations across the globe. The company has been expanding aggressively worldwide while preserving its culture. Starbucks controls the production process by collaborating with farmers to secure beans. It also manages distribution to all locations.4- Walt DisneyWalt Disney has seen explosive growth under chief executive Bob Iger, one of the highest paid CEOs[8] in Corporate America. Under his leadership, Walt Disney's market value has skyrocketed 433%. Barron's described Iger as 'Disney's most important figure since Walt himself.' Walt Disney owns some of the best content in the world, which it is going to bring to Disney Plus streaming service in November.3- Berkshire HathawayIt's difficult not to include Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway when you are talking about the world's most respected companies. Berkshire inched up from 4th place last year to 3rd spot this year. It's a holding company that owns several brands such as GEICO, Dairy Queen, and Duracell. It also holds large stakes in Coca Cola, Apple, Wells Fargo, American Express, Apple, and United Airlines.2- AmazonAmazon retains its second spot this year with a score of 8.30. It's one of the Big Four technology companies, the others being Apple, Google, and Facebook. Though e-commerce remains Amazon's primary business, the company also has a rapidly growing cloud computing, online media streaming, and smart speaker business. Amazon is most likely candidate to replace Apple as the world's most respected company in the future.1- AppleApple remains the world's most respected company for 12th consecutive year. It's also one of the world's most profitable companies and most valuable brands. The Cupertino-based tech giant has been a vocal proponent of user privacy. Though the iPhone sales continue to decline, Apple's smartwatch, accessories, and services businesses continue to grow at a healthy rate. Apple is set to launch its own media streaming service later this year. The post Top 10 Of The World's Most Respected Companies: Apple Tops[9] appeared first on ValueWalk[10].

The number one most accessed podcast was Scott Sagan on nuclear weapons[2] (video), followed by Qin Gao on poverty in China[3] (video), Ambassador Derek Mitchell on Burma[4] (audio), Amy Chua on political tribes[5] (video), and Andreas Harsono on Indonesia[6] (audio). Note that all these video podcasts are short highlights only. To access the full transcripts and audios, plus links to the full videos which are on YouTube, scroll down to the RELATED section for each video. TOP 10 VIDEO PODCASTS 1) Scott D. Sagan: Scott D. Sagan on the Nuclear Necessity Principle[7] Major changes must be made if U.S. nuclear war plans are to conform to the principles of just war doctrine and the law of armed conflict, declares Stanford University's Scott Sagan. He proposes a new doctrine: \"the nuclear necessity principle.\" </p><p>In sum, the U.S. will not use nuclear weapons against any target that could be reliably destroyed by conventional means. (Ethics Matter Interview Series, video, transcript, and audio, August 2017) 2) Poverty Reduction ...cial Welfare in China, with Qin Gao[8] Professor Qin Gao, director of Columbia's China Center for Social Policy, explains the workings of the Chinese \"Dibao\" (limited income guarantee) system. \"Dibao is doing relatively better than many other similar programs in developing countries,\" says Gao, yet it has limitations and some negative aspects. She also discusses Xi Jinping's ambitious goal to eradicate poverty by 2020, and the benefits of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) system. (Ethics Matter Interview Series, video, transcript, and audio, May 2018) 3) Political Tribes: Group Instinct and the Fate of Nations, with Amy Chua[9] \"The United States today is starting to display destructive political dynamics much more typically associated with developing countries: ethno-nationalist movements, the erosion of trust in our institutions and electoral outcomes, and above all, the transformation of democracy into an engine of zero-sum political tribalism,\" declares Yale Law School's Chua. (Public Affairs Program, video, transcript, and audio, March 2018) 4) Rescue: Refugees and the Political Crisis of Our Time, with David Miliband[10] Today there are 65 million people who have fled their homes because of conflict or persecution, says the International Rescue Committee's David Miliband. These are refugees not economic migrants, and half of them are children. It's a long-term crisis that will last our lifetimes. Why should we care? And what can we do about it, both at a policy level and as individuals? (Public Affairs Program, video, transcript, and audio, December 2017) 5) The Dangers of a Digital Democracy, with Rana Foroohar[11] The revelations about the misuse of Facebook data have started a pushback against the top five big tech companies: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. How do approaches to privacy and data use differ in the U.S., Europe and China? What kind of transparency should we demand? How will AI affect workers? All this and more in a lively and informative discussion with author and \"Financial Times\" columnist Rana Foroohar. (Ethics Matter Interview Series, video, transcript, and audio, April 2018) 6)Tunisia: An Arab Anomaly with Safwan M. Masri[12] Did you know that Tunisia started championing women's rights in the eighth century, and is still far ahead of most Arab and Muslim-majority countries? Indeed Tunisia's trajectory on many fronts has been radically more progressive than that of other Arab nations. So while it it may serve as an inspiration, its unique history probably makes its success impossible to duplicate, says Columbia University's Safwan Masri. (Public Affairs Program, video, transcript, and audio, January 2018)7) The Peacemakers: Leadership Lessons from Twentieth-Century Statesmanship, with Bruce Jentleson[13] What are the qualities and conditions that enable people to become successful peacemakers? At a time when peace seems elusive and conflict endemic, Duke University's Bruce Jentleson makes a forceful and inspiring case for the continued relevance of statesmanship and diplomacy and provides practical guidance to 21st-century leaders seeking lessons from some of history's most accomplished negotiators, activists, and trailblazers. (Special event in partnership with Carnegie Corporation of New York, video, transcript, and audio, April 2018) 8) Free-Enterprise Solutions to Climate Change, with Bob Inglis[14]<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/studio/briefings/20171011-free-enterprise-solutions-to-climate-change-with-bob-inglis-video-highlights\">https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/studio/briefings/20171011-free-enterprise-solutions-to-climate-change-with-bob-inglis-video-highlights</url> Republican politician Bob Inglis used to think that climate change was nonsense; but his son\u2014and science\u2014changed his mind. Today he advocates letting market forces do their work. \"The thing to do is to make it apparent in the marketplace what the costs of energy are, and eliminate all the subsidies, and have a level playing field and a strong competition. If you do that, we can fix climate change. That is what needs to be done.\" (Ethics Matter Interview Series, video, transcript, and audio, October 2017) 9)To Fight Against This Age: On Fascism and Humanism, with Rob Riemen[15] No more euphemisms and denials, says Nexus Institute's Rob Riemen in this frightening and inspiring talk. Call it by its name: fascism. Neither technology, nor economic growth, nor political activism can fix this, he continues. We must create a new counterculture that replaces kitsch and conformism with truth, empathy, beauty, and justice. (Public Affairs Program, video, transcript, and audio, February 2018) 10) Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides' Trap? With Graham Allison[16] Thucydides is not saying that the inevitable frictions between a rising power and a ruling one will always lead to war, says Harvard University's Allison. The danger is when \"third-party actions become provocations to which one or the other feels obliged to react, to which the other primary actor feels obliged to respond, which then leads to a cascade, often dragging people where they do not want to go.\" Think North Korea. (Public Affairs Program, video, transcript, and audio, November 2017) TOP 10 AUDIO PODCASTS 1)Moral Leadership Missing in Burma, with Ambassador Derek Mitchell[17] Former ambassador to Burma Derek Mitchell examines the complex situation there, including the roots of the ongoing Rohingya crisis and China's influence in Burma. Aung San Suu Kyi is not providing the necessary leadership, he says\u2014despite her constraints she should be speaking out about the Rohingya and about free speech, for example. Nevertheless, she has been given too much flak, and this has become counterproductive.(Asia Dialogues, podcast with transcript, January 2018) 2) Is Indonesia Becoming Like Pakistan? with Andreas Harsono[18] The maximum penalty for blasphemy in Pakistan is death, and public protest is not allowed. Indonesia is nowhere near as bad as this\u2014yet. \"Indonesia is now going down the Pakistan route,\" says Andreas Harsono of Human Rights Watch. \"There are more and more political manipulations using the blasphemy law, and there are more and more discriminatory regulations against minorities in Indonesia.\" (Asia Dialogues, podcast with transcript, February 2018) 3) The Future of War: A History, with Lawrence Freedman[19] \"Though most of the literature you will read on the future of war certainly talks about war as between regular armies, as proper fights, now with drones or with autonomous vehicles or robots or whatever, or even painless\u2014cyber and so on\u2014yet actually the reality of war is as it has always been: it is vicious, and it is nasty, and it kills the wrong people, and it does so in considerable numbers.\"---Sir Lawrence Freedman, King's College London (Public Affairs Program, podcast with transcript and video, October 2017) 4)What the Qur'an Meant: And Why It Matters with Garry Wills[20] How can we engage with Muslims around the world without really understanding what they believe? On studying the Qur'an, religious scholar Garry Wills found that many of our perceptions of Islam are false or distorted. Most surprisingly, Islam is a very inclusive religion, more so than Judaism or Christianity. What's more, the Qur'an gives women more property rights than early Christian women had. With official Arabic translation\u2014text and video subtitles. (Public Affairs Program, podcast with transcript and video, October 2017) 5)George Friedman: The End of the International Order and the Future of Asia[21] Tired of conventional wisdom? Check out geopolitical forecaster George Friedman. The period that began at the end of World War II was a freak, he says. \"We're returning to a more normal structure in which the nation-state is dominant, international trade is intense but managed by states for their own benefit, and where this idea that the nation-state is obsolete goes away.\" And find out why he's bullish on Japan and thinks we overestimate China. (Asia Dialogues, podcast with transcript, July 2017) 6) Marlene Laruelle on Europe's Far-Right Political Movements[22] What has led to the rise of far-right parties across Europe and how have they evolved over time? Is immigration really the main issue, or is there a more complex set of problems that vary from nation to nation? What are the ideological and practical connections between the far right and Russia? Carnegie Council Senior Fellow Marlene Laruelle is an expert on Europe, Russia, Eurasia, and Europe's far right. Don't miss her analysis. With French text translation. (Ethics Matter Interview Series/U.S. Global Engagement Program, podcast with transcript and video, November 2017) 7) Humanitarian Ethics and the Red Cross, with Hugo Slim[23] \"I would say that the principle of humanity, and humanity in war even, is a global ethic. We can trace it through human history,\" says ICRC's Hugo Slim. An in-depth discussion about the work of the Red Cross and its core humanitarian ethics as laid out in the Geneva Convention: humanity and compassion; the principal of a clear distinction between combatants and noncombatants; and proportionality in the weapons and the force used. (Devin Stewart podcast with transcript, December 2017) 8) Liberals' Lament? A Conversation between Joel Rosenthal and Devin Stewart[24] Carnegie Council President Joel Rosenthal and Senior Fellow Devin Stewart discuss the challenges to liberalism, in the United States and on the international stage, and explain today's debates through a historical context. (Podcast, audio only, October 2017) 9)To Fight Against This Age: On Fascism and Humanism, with Rob Riemen[25]      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/studio/multimedia/20180201-to-fight-against-this-age-fascism-humanism-rob-riemen\">https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/studio/multimedia/20180201-to-fight-against-this-age-fascism-humanism-rob-riemen</url> For description, see #9 top video. (Public Affairs Program, podcast with transcript and video, February 2018) 10)Joshua Eisenman on \"Chinese National Socialism\"[26] Under Xi Jinping, China is stepping up a crackdown on freedom of expression, including in universities, reports China expert Joshua Eisenman. Is this the beginning of a new Cultural Revolution, as some people fear? If so, we need to understand that this time it will be a Cultural Revolution of the political right, not the left, says Eisenman. \"The tactics that they're using are neo-Maoist tactics, but the ideas are neo-fascist.\" (Asia Dialogues, podcast with transcript, August 2017) [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url

Fear of SARS chilled manufacturing in Asia. The imminent war in Iraq left investors and tech executives jittery. And businesses kept purse strings tight, putting off big tech projects.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the picture brightened as the year wore on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tech spending picked up -- among consumers and businesses -- fueling stock market gains. By year-end, investors were mulling a new era of tech initial public offerings, with Google.com Inc. taking center stage.</p><p>The tech recovery isn't likely to bring back the excesses of the late 1990s. Tech jobs aren't growing like they used to, thanks in part to offshore outsourcing of labor and manufacturing. China, in fact, may be the big star of the next tech boom.</p><p>As we look back at 2003, these were the year's big stories:</p><p>** 1. Tech stocks rebound. After three straight years of heavy declines, tech stocks finished 2003 with strong gains.</p><p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq rebounded 50% for the year. That put it well ahead of the S&amp;P 500's 26.4% advance, though it didn't come close to the Nasdaq's record 86% gain in 1999.</p><p>The Philly Semiconductor index rocketed 76% after falling 45% in 2002. By industry, wireless telecom gear, Internet, electronics, chip and contract manufacturing stocks racked up the biggest gains.</p><p>Leading tech stocks in 2003 included eBay Inc., NetEase.com Inc., OmniVision Technologies Inc., Yahoo Inc., SanDisk Corp., Nam Tai Electronics Inc., Altiris Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc. and Foundry Networks Inc.</p><p>A number of medical technology firms also broke out of solid bases and notched double- to triple-digit gains. And former tech leaders Cisco Systems Inc., Intel Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. scored respectable returns, though they still lie well below their peaks during the Internet bubble era.</p><p>** 2. Offshore outsourcing grows. The practice of offshore outsourcing went mainstream in 2003. More U.S. companies tapped the low cost of foreign labor to staff call centers, process transactions, provide tech support and write software.</p><p>By delivering these services from other parts of the world, executives found they could cut costs by up to 50%. They also sped up the development of products and cut risk.</p><p>Much of this work is being sent to India, which has a huge population of English-speaking workers with high-tech degrees. Other prime outsourcing locations include Ireland, Israel, the Philippines and Russia.</p><p>Research firm Gartner Inc. estimates that one of every 10 jobs at U.S. tech firms will be sent offshore by the end of 2004. The resulting backlash could be a hot political issue in the presidential election.</p><p>** 3. China's rise. China's stature in the tech world grew in two ways in 2003. First, more manufacturing shifted to the country, which has quickly emerged as a chip and electronics powerhouse.</p><p>Second, China's consumers are making their presence known. The country stands to become the biggest market for personal computers and cellular phones.</p><p>The number of Internet users in China remained small compared with the U.S. But their ranks are growing fast. The country has 78 million Net users, up from 68 million a few months ago. With a population of 1.3 billion, China's potential as a market seems limitless.</p><p>** 4. Crackdown on unsolicited marketing. The year saw federal action against a swelling tide of junk e-mail known as spam, and against telemarketing phone calls.</p><p>In December, President Bush signed the Can Spam Act, which makes many misleading spammer tricks illegal, such as faking the sender's address. The law also aims to help consumers opt out of getting unwanted mail.</p><p>Critics say it's easy for spammers to stay anonymous and the measure will do little to fix the huge spam problem. Unsolicited bulk e-mail accounts for over half of e-mail, Internet service providers say.</p><p>Three months ago, Bush also signed the Do Not Call Registry measure, which still faces court challenges. It aims to let Americans avoid telemarketing calls.</p><p>** 5. Wi-Fi spreads. Wireless-fidelity hot spots, which let users access the Internet and send e-mail without plugging in, weren't new in 2003. But they seemed to spread to every coffee shop, hotel and airport.</p><p>Intel Corp. endorsed the technology in March when it released its Centrino chip, which brought Wi-Fi capabilities to mainstream laptops.</p><p>Now new flavors of Wi-Fi aim to further broaden the market by boosting speed and range.</p><p>The Wi-Fi industry still has to work out some kinks, such as finding the optimum price for their services and beefing up security, but clearly Wi-Fi has legs.</p><p>** 6. Businesses spend again. The event every technology executive had been waiting for since the tech bubble burst in 2000 finally arrived. Business spending on technology rose for the year, 6.4% above spending levels in 2002, according to the Commerce Department.</p><p>The increase followed two years of no growth, which was a monumental slowdown for tech firms, given that spending budgets had grown at double-digit rates for years.</p><p>Most polls expect tech spending in 2004 to be as good or better than in '03. Business spending on tech accounts for two-thirds of the industry's revenue.</p><p>** 7. Chip industry recovers. 2001 and 2002 were the worst ever for semiconductor makers. And 2003 started out looking like it would be more of the same.</p><p>But light began to show through around the middle of the year. The Semiconductor Industry Association says chip sales rose 15.8% in 2003 and should jump 20% in 2004 to $195.6 billion.</p><p>China continues to be a hot market. And sales in the U.S. and Japan have picked up. There are even signs, some analysts say, of a resurgence in Europe.</p><p>** 8. Number portability arrives. After a fierce lobbying fight, federal regulators ordered wireless firms to provide number portability starting Nov. 24. The rule lets consumers and business users of mobile phones switch wireless firms without having to change their phone number.</p><p>The rules are expected to increase customer turnover, or churn. One-quarter of mobile phone users already change wireless carriers annually. Many Wall Street analysts say it'll take a few quarters for the impact of new rules to show up in company financial results.</p><p>One reason is that wireless firms took steps to protect their best customers.</p><p>In addition, business users may wait to see how smoothly phone numbers are transferred to new carriers.</p><p>** 9. Emergence of VoIP. The concept of Internet phone calling could save consumers and businesses lots of money. For telecom companies, though, voice over Internet protocol, or VoIP, spells more competition and price deflation.</p><p>Until recently, consumers and companies had to accept lower voice quality and reliability in order to get savings from VoIP.</p><p>No longer. Internet calling has improved, thanks to a new generation of Internet protocol-based network switches and call-routing software.</p><p>Such calls aren't always routed over the public Internet anymore. Instead, they're whisked over private data networks and, increasingly, over the public phone network.</p><p>** 10. Information technology as a commodity. Makers of information technology saw their wares becomes more like commodities in 2003, as business buyers scooped up cheap Intel-type machines and embraced the Linux operating system.</p><p>Despite threatened lawsuits and license fees from SCO Group Inc., which calls Linux an illegal copy of its Unix software, the renegade software got big backing from IBM Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and others.</p><p>Best known as a network software firm, Novell Inc. made a big bet on Linux by buying Ximian Inc. and Germany's SuSE.</p><p>Even Sun Microsystems Inc., hit hard by the shift away from pricier Unix systems, took a stab at the lower end. It announced systems that use x86-type chips from Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</p><p>Two developments may hasten the trend.</p><p>Virtualization promises to make it easier to manage groups of computers as if they were one big machine. The concept pools computing power, storage and other resources. That squeezes more power from hardware and makes it easier to add more capacity as needed.</p><p>And blade servers caught on to become the industry's fastest growing segment. These superthin, modular systems can fit more computing power into standard IT cabinets. This saves power and space. Most blades use Linux, and many run with virtualization software.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-929546</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2004</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4BCY-8HX0-01J8-W1PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1383\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Investor's Business Daily</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2004 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. \u00a0  www.investors.com</copyright><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2004\"><dateText>January 2, 2004 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>\u00a0SYMANTEC CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>\u00a0YAHOO!

Young CAs(SA), you make us proud! We are never ceased to be amazed at the caliber, both locally and globally, of these youngsters who areoflf4fl?r? achieving the incredible with their qualification. With so many outstanding performers to consider, we had to go through a grueling 10 rounds of fine sifting before the Top 35 finalists were finally selected. And as you will read, these 35 youngsters are indeed shining stars who deserve to be recognized for their achievements, and most of all their passion to help others shine too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ADAM KAJEE (33)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chief Financial Officer, Evergreen Lifestyle</p><p>Adam Kajee has always strived to be the best - from his early years as a top South African swimmer through to representing the South African men's water polo team. Today, his career in finance is no exception.</p><p>Adam's interest in investments initially led him to Coronation Fund Managers and to completing his chartered financial analyst (CFA) designation. From there, his passion for private equity and actively growing businesses landed him the position of executive assistant (and investment analyst) to both Jannie and Piet Mouton of PSG Group. The position was part of PSG's mentoring programme and allowed Adam access to the engine room of PSG, where he attended all board and executive meetings.</p><p>He also formed part of the PSG Alpha team (Private Equity Division) where, alongside the PSG Alpha CEO, he spearheaded the industry research, due diligence and eventual transaction of PSG's largest initial investment of R675 million for a 50% equity stake in the premium retirement lifestyle brand Evergreen Lifestyle. Upon conclusion of the transaction, Adam was offered the position of CFO at Evergreen from October 2017.</p><p>Evergreen is changing the way people retire in South Africa, and Adam's financial innovation is offering more South Africans the opportunity of a dignified retirement lifestyle. He has been instrumental in the growth of the business, which has seen assets grow threefold in two years. However, even more rewarding for Adam is the thousands of lives he has influenced through the job opportunities created over this period. Adam is convinced that job creation is a key ingredient of South Africa's future prosperity.</p><p>Adam believes that true success in life is measured by one's positive influence on others' lives, and he has had the opportunity to influence lives through his involvement as a founding trustee of the Ruta Sechaba Foundation (established in 2016). The foundation provides academic-and sport-related scholarships, bursaries and awards to qualifying black learners at Curro and Curro-managed schools. Adam has served as chairman since its inception, and over time the foundation provided more than 1 300 bursaries to previously disadvantaged learners. The foundation, and what it provides, is something that brings Adam great pride - it embodies his own life experience by giving other previously disadvantaged leaners access to a life-changing scholarship opportunity.</p><p>Adam s passion for private equity and influencing lives through job creation and transformation has culminated in him founding ThembiSA Equity Investments (Pty) Ltd. This is a B-BBEE private equity company focused on building, transforming and empowering South Africa's businesses of tomorrow.</p><p>Watch Adam's entry video here</p><p>ANDREA KLASSEN (30)</p><p>Reporting Manager, Bayport Financial Services 2010 (Pty) Ltd</p><p>Andrea was bom in Port Elizabeth and moved to Pretoria to pursue the CA(SA) dream. She went on to do her master's degree in tax at the University ofPretoria as tax is a significant line item of the business. Upon passing her master's she was invited to become a Golden Key International Honour Society member. While doing her master's, she mentored individuals to become chartered accountants and participated in community projects such as the Circle ofLife (an organisation that supports those affected and infected by HIV/Aids). She then went on to win the New Member Golden Key Chapter Award for her commitment to her academic studies, leadership skills, involvement in extracurricular activities and participation in community projects.</p><p>However, she realised she had much more to leam and to give back to those who were striving to become CAs(SA). She started her career at Bayport Financial Services 2010 (Pty) Ltd where she learnt the ropes of the financial services industry and shared her story of what it took to become a CA(SA). She was then voted one of the top 10 Phenomenal Women ofthe organisation. She loves teaching finance or tax to those who want to leam and is patient enough to help others understand the world of finance.</p><p>She wanted to make a difference in the lives of others by providing a health and fitness club in promoting positive mental health amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The club provides weekly healthy habit and aerobics classes through Zoom that are realistic for people with busy lifestyles.</p><p>She loves the John Quincy Adam's quote, 'If your actions inspire others to dream more, leam more, do more and become more, you are a leader.' She feels that one does not have to make a difference in people's lives when one is at the top of the ladder - start by impacting one person's life and your work ethic will speak for itself.</p><p>Watch Andrea's entry video here</p><p>ANGELLA MAKOWE MUTONHORA (35)</p><p>Technical Director Crowe, Co-founder Nutralife Africa / Nutrilife ZW, and Founder Busy Bees</p><p>After completing her tertiary education in Zimbabwe, Angella relocated to South Africa in 2009 to pursue her dream of qualifying as a chartered accountant. This was not a seamless process, as she spent two years working as a bar waitress and part-time lecturer to raise funds for her CTA and attempting to secure a training contract.</p><p>In 2011 she secured such a contract with BDO and after her articles, she moved to a national role as an audit technical facilitator. In 2016 she launched her Africa Project which saw her expand her technical expertise into BDO offices in East and West Africa and formalise and standardise BDO's framework across those regions.</p><p>She moved to Wconsulting as an audit technical consultant to audit firms and introduced a shared service IT audit role to mid-tier firms that did not necessarily have the technical expertise. This created efficiencies and audit compliance for firms and in the first year, revenue from this service line increased by over R1,5 million.</p><p>She is currently the technical director at Crowe SA in charge of all things technical at national level.</p><p>Having grown up with a mother who is a teacher, Angella has a passion for education and learning. This partially prompted her to launch a nursery school in Blairgowrie called Busy Bees that also runs a special programme for domestic workers in the area. The programme involves subsidising their children's fees allowing them access to a quality education, which Angella believes is a right for all children. Busy Bees is also designed to allow children with autism to attend classes and receive more blended learning whilst creating awareness. This allows autistic children to adapt to primary school foundation courses by helping them develop their social skills.</p><p>In her travels into Africa, as well as coming from Zimbabwe, Angella noted numerous forms of malnutrition across the continent, and particularly in Zimbabwe. This spurred her on to try and develop a solution for the problem and co-found Nutralife Africa with her sister, a registered pharmacist. This is a moringa project in Zimbabwe to grow moringa (a natural super plant with significant nutritional qualities) for export while utilising women as the majority of farmworkers. This allows women to gain skills as farm labourers and have their own subsistence plots, as well as utilise moringa in their daily diets. Nutrilife farmland has been audited and awarded organic status. To date, the founders have been bootstrapping and have invested over R500 000 into preparing 40 hectares of land. They foresee the first harvest in 2021.</p><p>Angella has achieved all of this while being a mother of three beautiful girls and being an avid gardener and furniture restorer in her spare time.</p><p>Angella's philosophy is continuous acceptance of things you cannot change and relentless optimism. In the six years from completing her articles, she managed to be recognised in the assurance field as a force to be reckoned with. She sat on the ISACA SA board from 2016 to 2018 and her presentation at the 2016 ISACA conference was considered one of the top five. She is the only enterprise risk management facilitator in South Africa recognised by the Institute of Risk Management in London and sits on various SAICA committees, including the Legal and Compliance Committee.</p><p>Watch Angela's entry video here</p><p>ARUN VARUGHESE (34)</p><p>Corporate Finance Executive, Rand Merchant Bank</p><p>A run's passion for finance and entrepreneurship started long before his professional career. He grew up in the Eastern Cape and his entrepreneurial spirit was harnessed at an early age working alongside his father in the family business. Arun has gravitated towards commercial ventures of all sizes ever since.</p><p>He obtained honours degrees in Finance and Accounting and a master's degree in Financial Management from the University of Cape Town (UCT). He is also a CFA charter holder.</p><p>His served a year of academic articles at UCT, where he lectured and tutored undergraduate students in taxation. During this time, Arun also lectured at the Raymond Ackerman school for entrepreneurs and at the Thuthuka Academy for aspiring black CA(SA) candidates. Post the completion of his articles at Deloitte, Arun joined Rand Merchant Bank (RMB), where he has spent almost a decade in investment banking.</p><p>He is at present a corporate finance executive in the Investment Banking Division of RMB, where he leads advisory teams and is actively involved in spearheading the bank's growth initiatives in the private equity and telecommunications media and technology (TMT) groups. Arun is one of the youngest members of the corporate finance executive committee at RMB and serves in various leadership roles at the bank.</p><p>He also spent a year and half in London building the RMB brand and strengthening relationships with key European clients by focusing on value-additive M&amp;A opportunities across Africa. During his career at RMB, he has advised and helped execute landmark transactions worth some US$15 billion, including the sale of Pepkor to Steinhoff, the acquisition of Clover by Milco, and the Tsogo Sun placement by SAB Miller.</p><p>Arun remains passionate about the progression of young talent and works actively towards developing the next generation of leaders in banking. He is also a seasoned member of the FirstRand CSI programme, mentoring aspiring entrepreneurs from historically disadvantaged backgrounds. He continues to showcase his passion for start-ups by investing in a variety of ventures such as e-commerce, property and hedge funds.</p><p>Arun feels honoured to be nominated for the SAICA Top 35-under-35 competition and hopes his journey will encourage young students from disadvantaged backgrounds to aspire to become chartered accountants and finance professionals.</p><p>Watch Arun's video here.</p><p>BABALWA GOVA (31)</p><p>Founder and CEO, MaJali Chartered Accountants</p><p>Babalwa is a highly motivated and strong-willed individual who is passionate about women empowerment and leadership and shares this with everyone she interacts with. This has formed her core values, as she embodies this thoroughly.</p><p>She began her career with the goal of being an exemplary figure for any young woman who sees herself redefining the norms centred on professional spaces and women. This was the motivation that made her start her company, MaJali Chartered Accountants, in 2017 after working for the Auditor-General since 2012. The CA(SA) profession has allowed her to use the skills she has obtained to develop the community she grew up in through various projects that have contributed and fostered financial growth and economic development in the community. Through a partnership with a local radio station, she shares baby steps to financial freedom with the community with an aim to equip people with the financial literacy they need to better manage their household finances and make better financial decisions.</p><p>Through Nalithemba farming, a company she started with the aim of empowering the community to use farming to alleviate difficulties and often extreme financial strain, she contributes to developing the community by creating economic activity that allows them to participate in commercial farming.</p><p>She is CEO at MaJali Chartered Accountants and senior audit and technical manager at Kopax Chartered Accountants. Both firms are involved in the training of future CAs(SA) by providing SAICA articles. These roles have not only offering her with an opportunity to lead but also an opportunity to influence and shape the minds of future CAs(SA) through the training programme, and especially understanding the impact it has on a young mind to see a reflection of yourself in a position you admire and aspire to be in. To her, this has been by far her greatest success.</p><p>Over the past four years she has successfully spearheaded small and major audits in both the private and public sectors. She always focuses on making every moment a success and a learning opportunity, thereby enforcing the culture of learning for trainees in both these firms.</p><p>As an entrepreneur, Babalwa is passionate about helping others to grow sustainable business and contribute meaningfully to the economy. She hosts several programmes within her organisation, which gave birth to 'SAY G (Share as you Grow) with MaJali'. This project serves as a free coaching platform for entrepreneurs and runs on the YouTube channel 'SAY G with MaJali'. She interviews business owners who have survived their first 1 000 day in business in different industries, in different age groups and with varying years of experience to share the knowledge they have acquired through their entrepreneurial journey and the tools they have used to build successful businesses.</p><p>Her passion for impact has led her on a path of seeking to influence and shape young minds. Since 2019, she has been a part of the UKZN ASI programme, which is aimed at empowering CTA students through mentoring, tutoring and coaching. It has been a satisfying journey for her to have a direct impact in helping others manoeuvre what she considers to be the hardest year of the CA(SA) journey, CTA.</p><p>In this world, not a lot of people have the fortune to live their dreams, and Babalwa has had the privilege of not only having the space to dream but the opportunity to fulfil her dreams at a young age.</p><p>Watch Babalwa's entry video here</p><p>BYRON DU PLESSIS (35)</p><p>Corporate CFO, MultiChoice Group</p><p>Byron du Plessis is currently the Corporate CFO ofMultiChoice Group Limited, having previously held various senior roles in the group including Head ofFinance for MultiChoice South Africa and Corporate Financial Director of MultiChoice Africa.

This single thought, lovingly instilled in Divyesh's mind -A_ by his grandmother from a young age, has been the core ofhis work ethic and ambition. Always driven to do more and do better, at the age of 27 Divyesh was among the youngest to be put into the partnership process at PwC. Taking a decision which others may have deemed insane, he decided to get some commercial experience andjoined MTN. A year later, at 28, he was the youngest general manager at MTN South Africa and the first recipient ofMTN SA CEO's Award for Aspirational Leadership. At the time he managed a team of some 15 functional areas and 500 staff members, and he credits the diverse skills one learns as a CA(SA) as being a major contributor to his success.</p><p>Listening to and understanding the perspectives of others and giving people the space to try are the qualities he learned from the life ofhis beloved guru, Pramukh Swami Maharaj. Divyesh applies these lessons daily in leading his teams at work as well as at the BAPS Swaminarayan temple where he chairs the temple management committee. The activities of the temple are a beacon of development, support and comfort to the community.

'It is my firm belief that there is no situation in which one cannot innovate. In my experience, it has not been the single billion-rand idea but the countless thousand-rand ideas that have made all the difference. And those are certainly not in short supply. If wejust nurture the talent around us, give them some time, and invest in the relationship, then there are very few stars that will not take the opportunity to shine.' With this philosophy, Divyesh drives his team to deliver solutions which have saved the company millions and inspire individuals' confidence in their own abilities.</p><p>Not only a student for life but also a passionate teacher, Divyesh takes every opportunity to lecture both academically and spiritually.</p><p>Watch Divysh's entry video here</p><p>EBRAHIM TOOTLA (29)</p><p>Head: Shari'ah Treasury and Finance, Standard Bank</p><p>Ebrahim's CA journey began at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) in2011, where he self-funded his studies. He completed both his \u0421\u0422\u0410 and board exams at his first attempt.</p><p>In 2015, hejoined Standard Bank on a training contract. During his formative rotations, he stumbled across his passions of treasury management and Islamic banking and managed to negotiate a role which interlinked these two passions.</p><p>Shari'ah banking was only at the business concept stage then and he was the second person tojoin the team. They took the business concept through many approval processes and dedicated themselves to developing products which are both Shari'ah compliant and align to Standard Bank's values.</p><p>After four years of perseverance, their financial position has surpassed competitors who have been in the market much longer than them. They are pioneering the market with South African, African and world firsts. Ebrahim feels that his skills and knowledge as a CA(SA) allowed him to place himself strategically at the heart of Shari'ah banking in Standard Bank. Their team has grown in skills and personnel leading them hiring newly qualified graduates. The skills he gained through his training programme and as a registered assessor have assisted him to equip them with the skills they needed to transition into the workplace.</p><p>In addition to being instrumental in the success of Standard Bank's Shari'ah division, Ebrahim has developed the treasury function with its associated risk management mechanisms and frameworks, proposed tax amendments to National Treasury, was one of 50 people globally awarded a scholarship to complete CIPA at AAOIFI, and assisted in structuring Shari'ah-compliant investment banking and global markets deals.</p><p>He is dedicated to making his passions assist the less fortunate. He was part of a CSI project where they adopted a creche and transformed it from an informal building to a permanent structure with toilets and fridges in such a way that ongoing costs would be minimal. He also assists NPOs to manage their cash flow in order to maximise their charity work.</p><p>Ebrahim is governed by the maxim, 'There are no problems in life, only opportunities.' Hard work and a never-give-up attitude have allowed him to merge a formally excluded part of the financial sector into the formal economy. This solution not only touches South Africa but has the potential to reach deep into unbanked Africa - which is where his next challenge lies.</p><p>Watch Ebrahim's entry video here</p><p>FULUFHELO SIPHUMA (32)</p><p>Director and Founder, Fulu Fitness, and Audit Manager at EY</p><p>Fulufhelo Siphuma is an audit manager in banking and capital markets at Ernest &amp; Young and a member of the Institute of Directors in South Africa.

Their design, performance and the excitement they evoke in him is one .of his earliest memories. Thus when he had the opportunity to join BMW Supertech after he completed his articles in 2012 after a six-month overseas secondment with PwC in Indianapolis USA, it felt to him like the perfect match.</p><p>At that time Supertech was a single, small, privately owned dealership based at an old facility in Durban South where it had been operating under several owners since 1983. But in the dynamic company owner, Mr Shabir Tayob, Mahomed found someone with extraordinary drive and ambition which he wanted to be a part of.</p><p>Mahomed joined Supertech Durban in 2012 as the financial manager. In early 2013, the dealership moved to a much larger purpose-built R100-million facility. The new facility and improved results allowed the business to grow and create a sound base on which to expand by acquiring additional dealerships in strategic areas. Mahomed was promoted to the Exco board in the role of CFO in late 2013 and to financial director a year later, at the age of 27.</p><p>In 2015, BMW Newcastle joined the group. Mahomed was involved in all aspects of this and future acquisitions. Within two years, the dealership was turned around from being the lowest ranked dealer in the country to winning the prestigious BMW National Dealer of the Year award.</p><p>In 2016 Supertech Pinetown was taken over from Bidvest McCarthy and not long after that the local private BMW bike dealership was also absorbed into the operation. In 2017 the PMB &amp; Shelly Beach BMW dealerships joined the growing group as well, while 2019 saw the latest BMW dealership acquisition from a private owner in East London - the first dealership for the group outside KZN. Mahomed's latest project that he ran start to finish is a new R160-million state-of-the-art flagship dealership in Pinetown which opened in 2019.</p><p>Mahomed has also led several other unique projects such as acquiring the coveted BMW 'M' high-performance and 'i' electric vehicle approvals, as well as rolling out the new BMW 'future retail' model across all dealers. In 2015 he also led a pilot project allowing Supertech Durban to become the first dealership in Africa to obtain a four-star Green Building Association accreditation for environmental sustainability.</p><p>All told, between 2015 and 2019 the company has expanded from being a single dealership to boasting six BMW dealerships and three panel shops. Mahomed has been at the heart of this rapid expansion from the outset. The number of staff employed during this time has also grown from 84 to over 450, including five CAs(SA) that Mahomed has developed and trained. Group revenues have grown in this period from R426 million to over R2,6 billion.</p><p>The group runs several charitable projects each year such as the Winter Warmth and Toy-drive campaigns, as well as local school feeding initiatives which have been very successful and are close to Mahomed's heart.</p><p>Watch Mahomed's entry video here.</p><p>MANDY MUCHNICK (32)</p><p>Private Equity Transactor and Africa Chair for One Young World and Co-founder of imagine.nation</p><p>While Mandy is a transactor in the private equity industry, she spends a significant amount of time investing in the future of the continent through her role as the Africa Chair for One Young World (OYW), her non-profit imagine.nation, and as the co-chair of the FinBiz2030 Task Force.</p><p>OYW is the leading global forum for young leaders. The annual summit convenes the brightest talent from over 190 countries across every sector, working to accelerate social impact. Delegates are counselled by some of the most influential political, business and humanitarian figures such as the late Kofi Annan, Dr Jane Goodall, Paul Polman and Professor Muhammad Yunus.</p><p>Mandy's passion for not only contributing to society through her own work - she has built and supported two creches providing a safe learning environment for over 100 children annually and reaching over 20 000 vulnerable children together with her team through initiatives such as their annual Winter Warmer since 2014 - but for wanting others to be given the opportunity she had to attend OYW and gain access to the platform led her to becoming a formidable asset to the OYW organisation since she first attended a summit in 2015. She was selected to be the coordinating ambassador for Southern Africa, a role that requires holding the community together and acting as the linchpin between OYW HQ in London and ambassadors. Under Mandy's leadership, the region went from being relatively fragmented to a highly connected, constantly engaged community of over 500 ambassadors who are delivering results on the ground. In OYW co-founder Kate Robertson's words: 'We always knew Southern Africa had the potential to be a leading hub globally and it had now not only been done, but the pace had been set for the continent. Since her tenure, the cohorts of coordinating ambassadors throughout the continent turn to her for guidance and support and we continue to see Africa move from strength to strength.'</p><p>Mandy loves investing in people, and this is at the centre of her investment philosophy at work and in her upliftment initiatives. She feels strongly about identifying and nurturing talent in others, believing that maximising individual growth is not only core to a meaningful life, but also critical to solving the world's main challenges. As the chair for OYW in Africa, she has the ability to do just that as she seeks out organisations and individuals across the continent who share the values of OYW, guides their talent to the annual summit, and most importantly, beyond into solving the goals as set out by the SDGs from within their companies.</p><p>Mandy explains that at OYW they ask themselves, 'What would the world look like today if global leaders had been friends when they were 25?' For that reason, they are working towards a dream where the heads of government in every African country and the African conglomerate CEOs are OYW ambassadors.</p><p>Mandy has played an integral role launching FinBiz2030 and establishing a task force committed to tackling our most pressing issues. She has proven that one does not need to quit one's job to make a difference and that working in a corporate provides a strong platform from which to effect societal change.</p><p>Watch Mandy's entry video here</p><p>MANQOBA KUBHEKA (32)</p><p>General Manager: Licensing, SAMRO</p><p>\"anqoba Kubheka is a chartered accountant on a quest to make his mark in the development of .internationally competitive African businesses. He began his career as a trainee accountant at SizweNtsalubaGobodo (now SNG Grant Thornton) and left the firm as assurance audit manager, having been the only manager in his year to be promoted to second-level manager in a single year.</p><p>In 2017, he joined SAMRO as manager in the office of the CEO. His impact and involvement during a turbulent turnaround period at SAMRO enabled him to swiftly grasp the inner workings of collective management organisations and the music industry's eco-system in general. Finding the company on the brink of a reportable irregularity and qualified audit report, he steered the company to an unqualified report after having developed and implemented process and reporting changes in the finance department. He also initiated and was the front liaison for a forensic audit carried out against the impaired international investments and had the findings of the report presented to the SAMRO AGM in October 2018. Having taken on demanding challenges such as acting CFO only five months into his time at the organisation, Kubheka's contribution was widely noted.</p><p>In February 2019, he became interim general manager in the Licensing Division of SAMRO, which is the revenue-generation core of the organisation. He was appointed permanently in June 2019 and has since led the entity to revenues exceeding R500 million for the first time since its inception in 1962. As a key driver of change and a firm believer in recognising and empowering women, he has placed young black females in all four managerial positions reporting to him, which has contributed to his department's outstanding achievements.</p><p>Kubheka also serves on the board of the Arts and Culture Trust (an NPO focusing on enriching talent and arts organisations through funding and skills development programmes) and chairs its audit and risk committee. He is also a member of the management committee. His philosophy is to shoulder the primary responsibility of managing all operational aspects from strategy formulation and planning to business development, analysis and key decision-making.</p><p>As custodian of SAMRO members' interests, he faces the challenge of improving their earnings through being directly involved in revenue-generation activities.

He obtained both his law degree and CTA cum laude and was placed among the Top 10 in his ITC board exam. He became a managing director at Escolha Do Povo (EDP) at the age of 29. Today, he is a partner and director at Matswani Capital, a venture capital firm with widespread investments across various industries ranging from agro processing and underground coal mining to bulk fuel distribution across Africa.</p><p>At Matswani Capital, Manuel is strategic in the outlook of the business. He not only heads up the finance function for the entire Africa region but is also responsible for operations in the Mozambican EDP project.</p><p>'Escolha Do Povo' (EDP) means 'The People's Choice' in Portuguese. This was a brown fields project and he often expresses his pride on what they were able to build in a space where there was nothing, raised all the necessary funding, obtained government support and approvals, and put in place the necessary infrastructure for a commercial hatchery, maize and feed milling operation.</p><p>The infrastructure allows for the maximum production of half a million day-old chicks per month which are distributed into the local market along with a chicken feed that EDP produces. This enhances the livelihood of small-scale farmers, as they grow the birds under the supervision of EDPs training and continuous development programme. The grown birds are sold by the small-scale farmers in the market, thereby yielding a return on investment every 35 days. There is always a conundrum between the bottom line and community development, and Manuel has cracked the code to achieve both.</p><p>This project has a wide-scale and growing social impact on:</p><p>* 55 000 regional maize farmers - EDP buys millions of kilograms of maize from these farmers each year.</p><p>* 14 000 soya bean farmers - EDP has been financing the fertilizers and seeds and providing training to those farmers. The product is also purchased from the farmers and used in EDP's feed production.</p><p>* 7 000 families to whom EDP provides technical support in rearing chickens. The grown birds are then sold in the market.</p><p>EDP has partnered with the government in this initiative, as food security and the need to increase production of food within the borders, as well as the nutritional intake of the average Mozambican, are major concerns. They are proud of the fact that this project fortifies some staple foods (maize meal) with added vitamins and makes those available at affordable prices while providing a cost-effective protein source to the local population which improves the quality of food the people consume.</p><p>In 2017, EDP received a government grant amounting to $1,5 million to install a new soya extrusion plant with a capacity of processing 2 million kilograms of product per month. This created a natural offtake for the soya beans grown by the 14 000 farmers mentioned above. The product of this plant is used as the protein source for the chicken feed.</p><p>An untapped market coupled with a destitute but willing community created the perfect opportunity for social enterprise to meet with commercial enterprise.</p><p>Watch Manuel's entry video heere</p><p>MBALENHLE ZULU (32)</p><p>Associate Professor, College of Accounting Sciences, Unisa</p><p>Mbalenhle is an associate professor and a PhD candidate at the University of South Africa.

She wanted to be a CA(SA) to change lives, and this is a role she plays excellently as a businesswoman and an education activist.</p><p>Being a CA(SA) empowered her to take a brave decision and start her own consulting firm.

The business is proudly part of building the economy of South Africa by working with SMMEs driving employment creation.</p><p>Highly passionate about women empowerment, Millycent started a mentorship programme for the advancement of women in business. Being an entrepreneur, she has identified a need for a focused empowerment towards women. Women face unique challenges when in business, because of the historical nature of business. She provides mentorship, financial literacy training and business support to women in rural communities and says that it is such joy to experience the impact of these businesses on the community.</p><p>She has trained numerous students as a lecturer at Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), but her responsibility as an educator goes beyond the classroom, providing mentorship and coaching to young professionals that aspire to become CAs(SA).</p><p>As a village girl herself, education is a tool she uses to inspire village girls and boys to believe in their dreams, work hard and use the power of education to change their lives, regardless of their background.

Petri has spoken about this topic at multiple international conferences including the Cayman Islands Digital Economy Conference (2018), Blockchain Training Conference (2019), Delta Summit (2019) and Consensus (2020). He has also presented training sessions to individuals working in finance, legal and many other professions to help them understand how these assets work and how they can use them. He is also spreading his educational outreach to children and has presented at schools to teach kids about the new technology, and recently helped organise an event where children were given free access to online blockchain basics courses and those in need received devices through donations from multiple parties.</p><p>Petri is also leading the development of the space as chairman of the Blockchain Association of the Cayman Islands (BACI) and sits on the steering committee for Digital Cayman.

She was drawn to the public sector because she wanted to be a representation of service excellence in public sector, particularly because of the far-reaching developmental impact in contrast to corporate. She worked in male-dominated industries such as mining, automotive and financial services for both SMEs and JSE-listed companies, providing interventions that require disruptive innovation and strategic thinking. Her life ideology is to strive for excellence and with a particular focus on making a developmental impact; given the IDC's mandate, it was a perfect fit.</p><p>She used her time at IDC to train and mentor CA(SA) trainees with an emphasis on excellence and leadership through servitude. Her contribution to CA(SA) training resulted in being nominated for the IDC award for mentorship. She extended her CA(SA) skills to the corporate sphere through her seat on the board of two venture capital companies, one of which is at research phase for nano technology. 'I am proud to be a black female representative on these predominantly male boards and my aim is to further illustrate that women are formidable corporate participants and have both the intellectual and leadership qualities to contribute,' says Precious.</p><p>'My contribution to the growth of my peers in the GIBS MBA 2017 cohort was just as fulfilling as my own personal growth,' she continuous. 'I was able to engage with people of different backgrounds showing that the transition from interacting with blue-collar workers to CEO of a JSE-listed business comes naturally.' She completed the first year of the MBA cum laude and won the award for the best overall student for customer-centric strategy. 'This specific award is in line with my passion for service excellence and innovative strategic thinking for business solutions.'</p><p>While completing her MBA, she started an online bookstore with a group of four inspirational women. The bookstore is the first of its kind in South Africa; they showcase books with protagonists of colour in all 11 official languages. The focus on protagonists of colour is to expand the current children's book offering to ensure that diversity prevails. Their goal was to make reading an integral part of early childhood development in order to improve self-esteem, tolerance of diversity and literacy. They have collaborated on a project with the Otto Foundation to source books for the Sunflower Learning Centre for the children of Zonnebloem Girls' and Boys' Primary schools. They also collaborated with the National Arts Council to bring authors to the townships across Gauteng for book-reading sessions.</p><p>'My life has been a conscious pursuit of purpose and excellence,' she says.</p><p>Watch Precious' entry video here</p><p>RICARDO MANTOVANI (34)</p><p>CFO, BNP Paribas Personal Finance UK</p><p>Ricardo Mantovani regards himself as fortunate to have had so many opportunities in life. Despite having grown up under the shadow of a learning disability he believes that with the right mind set and determination, anyone can achieve great things. The experience he gained through his CA programme has allowed him to develop both himself and the businesses he has worked in.</p><p>As a newly qualified CA(SA), he was given the opportunity to go on a secondment to the USA, to the KPMG North Carolina office. There he gained the confidence to conduct business across different approaches and got his first insight into the high level of regard with which the international community hold the SAICA programme. On his return, he was promoted to a manager at KPMG Cape Town and held this role for a year before being approached by RCS Financial Services to become their financial manager.</p><p>During his time at RCS he was responsible for developing the finance department. He then had the opportunity to play an integral part in the acquisition by BNP Paribas Group into Africa. This experience was crucial to his development and resulted in him being promoted to the Head ofFinance role in BNP Paribas Personal Finance United Kingdom.</p><p>Here, he has been able to achieve more than he could have ever imagined. He led the first unsecured loans securitisation transaction totalling \u00a3570 million for BNP Paribas Personal Finance UK. He has overseen the restructuring of the finance function in the UK and the implementation of new, innovate ways of working to ensure that the finance department remains key to adding value to the company.

Her decade-long experience at Mazars has seen her seconded to William Buck NSW in Sydney, Australia, and being promoted to equity partner in 2019 at the young age of 32.</p><p>Rochelle's belief in meaningful transformation and her desire to positively shape others' future made her the perfect candidate to head up Mazars' Graduate Recruitment Programme in Gauteng. Having been able to connect with young female graduates during her involvement in recruitment, she recognised the need for empowering young women.</p><p>She is a founding member of Mazars' Women Empowerment Programme, which started in Gauteng. The programme is open to all 179 women across Mazars' service lines and focuses on identifying, appreciating, growing and retaining women within the organisation. The programme is focused on equipping young professional women with critical skills to get them ready not just to occupy leadership positions but to be able to lead regardless of job title. This is being achieved through leadership branding and public speaking workshops, book club events and fitness classes, all of which come together to facilitate each woman's personal growth. In addition, the programme is dedicated to the SHE (Shape Her Essence) project which collects sanitary pads for delivery to young school-going girls, as well as a project to gather basic necessities for underprivileged children in the El-Shammah Home for Abandoned Babies.</p><p>The impact has been so phenomenal that this programme is planned to be launched nationally across Mazars' 11 offices throughout South Africa within the next year.</p><p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic Rochelle has ensured that the programme's objectives continue to be fulfilled through virtual platforms.</p><p>Key traits that have contributed to Rochelle's success are confidence, coupled with humility, empathy and the desire to make an impact. She fervently believes that an organisation's people are its most valued asset and that leaders are distinguished by the impact they have on individuals that surround them, especially when they empower others to function in their absence. Importantly, Rochelle is aware that she takes up a valuable amount of space in her capacity as a leader and is passionate about creating more space for other impactful leaders.</p><p>Watch Rochelle's entry video here</p><p>ROLIHLAHLA VUZANE (34)</p><p>Senior Lecturer, Walter Sisulu University (NMD)</p><p>After attaining his CA(SA) in2015, Rolihlahla left hisjob at the Financial Services Board and returned to Mthatha to become a lecturer at Walter Sisulu University. He wanted to make a positive contribution to an existence that could be discouraging and devastating - the fact that he could obtain his CA(SA) was an inspiration to many who had given up on their dream and motivated them to return to their studies.</p><p>Remembering how difficult it was to get practical training in accounting, Rolihlahla and his wife decided to convert a bigger part of their company profits towards training students that were locked up by the TVET system. In 2017 they started training four students and despite the demands ofhis lecturing position, the lack of office accommodation, and their family commitments, they succeeded in graduating two of these students. They currently train 44 students from various groups (Financial, Fasset, Office and PR Management) and intend to recruit a further 12 students from the Human Relations Group.</p><p>In addition, they have developed an online training platform to assist N6 students who cannot go to Mthatha. The programme starts in October 2020 and they anticipate that it will attract about 100 students in the first year, which will bring their training and impact footprint to 200 students.</p><p>This would not have been possible if Rolihlahla were not a CA(SA). Training a student gives hope not only to the student and their families and civil communities, but also to the business community. They couple feel that they are making a serious impact in changing and improving lives and opening opportunities, and they feel strongly that their purpose has been validated.</p><p>In addition, they are first employers of those they have trained. They hope to employ the five students graduating this year in their two new branches. Currently they employ six staff members and plan to employ 15 permanent staff in their new branches. By providing employment, they have reduced crime and brought hope to many.</p><p>At present, Rolihlahla has the following qualifications: BAcc, Postgraduate Diploma in Accounting, Postgraduate Diploma in Accounting Sciences, Postgraduate Diploma in Taxation, BCom Law (passed but not yet graduated) and MCom (Accounting) (passed but not graduated).</p><p>Current positions include managing director and CEO of Kunokhar Chartered Accountants and Tax Practitioners (Pty) Ltd and chief investment/financial officer of Kunokhar Capital (Pty) Ltd and Kunokhar Properties (Pty) Ltd.</p><p>Watch Rolihlahla's entry video here</p><p>SCOTT NEEDHAM (29)</p><p>Head of Alternative Investments, AlphaWealth</p><p>Scott Needham is an alternative investment specialist at AlphaWealth, a multi-family office boutique advisory and wealth management firm.

He has spoken at numerous global conferences about this new age of work and the new digital world.</p><p>Tramayne's goal has always been to use his platform and the company he works for as a springboard to do good. He has been a part of numerous bursary campaigns through the brands he represents: VOOV, JOOX and PUBG Mobile. Education is important to him, so he drives this narrative internally.</p><p>He drives an internal culture of leadership growth through an internal accelerated leadership plan that includes mentorship and learning.

I am outspoken on development areas for high performances including meditation, breathing techniques and owning your power,' says Tramayne.</p><p>'My ethos is simple: we are all leaders and I will only be judged on how I grow those around me. But I am also open and authentic about my own struggles. These have resulted in my driving harder to be a young leader and to show others the path is there with the right work ethic and, more importantly, with the right mindset. I use my platforms to drive a change in thinking and challenge the status quo. I believe the world is non-linear. I believe that the greatest asset we can acquire is asking why.'</p><p>Tramayne has been a digital mentor to young CAs(SA) through SAICA's mentorship projects. He currently mentors three digital businesses as he drives to lead, share and influence.</p><p>'I have driven my brand of \"non-traditional\" CA for years now', says Tramayne. 'I have created paths outside of finance to achieve success at a young age. Finance was my one tool, but I have built a repertoire to which I think young CAs(SA) can aspire. I speak about humanity and a love for growth; I want the world of young CAs(SA) to enhance the environment around them. My dream is to create a young leader that transcends their story and develop one that puts them into the news for the good they will do.'</p><p>According to Tramayne, the profession needs a voice that outlines change. The profession needs to see the value that can be placed outside of debits and credits. 'I will never stop developing my narrative on what a CA(SA) should be.

The fund provides exposure to a popular mid-cap market at a low cost of 0.1 per cent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With \u00a31.6bn in assets, it is much larger than both an equally cheap Xtrackers product and an iShares ETF that was once superior in terms of size.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                     New: <url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">SPDR S&amp;P UK Dividend Aristocrats</url> (UKDV)                   </p><p>Some on the panel wanted to avoid UK dividend ETFs outright, but the sheer popularity of such strategies means we have instead looked for the most defensive option available.</p><p>One name that stood out here was SPDR's S&amp;P UK Dividend Aristocrats ETF. Rather than simply targeting the highest-yielding companies, this ETF invests in companies with a long record of dividend increases. This adds a level of security to some of the dividends the ETF is exposed to, as businesses with a reputation based on longstanding payments could prove more hesitant to make cuts.</p><p>However, we would stress that this approach is not a silver bullet. The fact that even some well-financed names with long track records are cutting dividends out of prudence means that this ETF could still take some pain, but it looks less risky than IUKD's approach at this point. This is also a reasonably large ETF with a lower fee than the iShares product.</p><p>                     Dropped from the 2019 selection:                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">iShares UK Dividend UCITS ETF</url> (IUKD)                   </p><p>Favoured by many investors for its attractive level of equity income, the UK market has run into trouble amid a slew of dividend cuts and suspensions. Link Asset Services has predicted that UK dividend payouts for 2020 could be down by between 27 and 51 per cent from 2019's total of \u00a398.5bn.</p><p>In this context, our panellists have grown concerned about the focus of this ETF, which invests in 50 higher-yielding companies from the FTSE 350. Because dividend yields move inversely to share prices, it may well find itself exposed to companies that are cheaply priced either because they are struggling or because investors fear they will cut their dividends. These troubles are evident from some of its recent holdings: on 28 May the ETF's 20 biggest positions included Royal Dutch Shell, which has cut its dividend for the first time since the second world war, and insurer Aviva, which recently announced a suspension of its payouts.</p><p>Because retail investors are so enthusiastic about equity income, we have continued to include what we judge to be the best dividend ETFs in the list. But in recognition of the elevated risks in the equity income space, we have moved all dividend ETFs into our satellite category, as well as replacing riskier plays like this with more defensive products.</p><p>                     US EQUITIES                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">iShares S&amp;P SmallCap 600 UCITS ETF</url>                      (ISP6)                   </p><p>Smaller companies were hit harder in the coronavirus sell-off than their large-cap peers, but it is worth looking down the market cap scale for the sake of both diversification and growth potential. And when it comes to US smaller companies, this option continues to stand out because of its underlying index. The S&amp;P SmallCap 600 is designed to ensure stocks are liquid enough to be held within an ETF.</p><p>As we discussed last year, this ETF is not the cheapest, with a 0.4 per cent charge. But its robust methodology, combined with the ETF's scale, continue to impress us.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">Invesco EQQQ NASDAQ-100 UCITS ETF</url>                      (EQQQ)                   </p><p>At a time when big tech companies appear to be consolidating their position as market leaders, this ETF retains its appeal as a play on high-growth businesses. The Nasdaq 100 index tracks the biggest non-financial US stocks, leading it to big allocations in the technology, telecommunications and consumer discretionary sectors. The FAANG stocks, Microsoft (US:MSFT), Intel (US:INTC) and Cisco Systems (US:CSCO) were among the ETF's top 10 holdings at the end of April.</p><p>iShares continues to offer a larger rival product, but the Invesco ETF charges slightly less and has more than ample assets and liquidity. Investors may also like the chance to diversify in terms of which ETF providers they use.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">iShares Edge S&amp;P 500 Minimum Volatility UCITS ETF</url>                      (MVUS)                   </p><p>This ETF has not covered itself in glory, falling roughly in line with the main S&amp;P 500 index during the sell-off and slightly lagging behind as prices have recovered. However, its characteristics may still appeal to some.</p><p>As we noted, the biggest US tech companies have held up relatively well in the crisis, and have led the recent market recovery. But their shares could be vulnerable to any resumption of volatility, while some of the FAANG companies themselves remain exposed to regulatory pressures in future.</p><p>This minimum volatility ETF has less exposure to the likes of the FAANGs than the main index, which in part explains its underwhelming performance. Investors looking to take a slightly contrarian position by underweighting these leading stocks within their US exposure may still be tempted to use this fund.</p><p>                     New: <url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">Fidelity US Quality Income</url> (FUSD)                   </p><p>This ETF stood out as an equity income option because of its conservative methodology. Rather than just chasing high yields or seeking out businesses with the longest dividend track records, Fidelity US Quality Income focuses on large- and mid-cap dividend-paying companies with robust fundamental characteristics.</p><p>Index constituents are screened using metrics such as free-cash-flow margins, the return on invested capital and free-cash-flow stability. As such, investors are getting some benefit from dividends, but also enjoy a more defensive, total return approach.</p><p>We would add a note of caution that some robust companies could (and have) cut dividends out of prudence, so this ETF is not entirely shielded from coronavirus-induced troubles.</p><p>                     Dropped from the 2019 selection:                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">SPDR S&amp;P US Dividend Aristocrats UCITS ETF</url>                      (USDV)                   </p><p>Dividend pressures are less of a concern in the US than they are closer to home. US equities have traditionally offered a much lower yield than other markets, and those dividends that are on offer look safer than those in the UK. Janus Henderson's Global Dividend Index for May 2020 notes that 79 per cent of US payouts should be safe this year, although companies may carry out fewer share buybacks as they move through the coronavirus crisis.</p><p>However, risks do exist. And while this ETF arguably has a more defensive approach than those that invest based purely on high yields, some on the panel worried its methodology may not prove as robust as others available in this category. It focuses on companies that have increased dividends every year for at least two decades - but as we noted, even those with such an impressive record could be caught out by the challenges of the coronavirus crisis.</p><p>                     GLOBAL EQUITIES (FOUR ETFs)                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">iShares MSCI World Small Cap UCITS ETF</url>                      (WLDS)                   </p><p>Our panel had no complaints about this ETF, which remains an attractive prospect when it comes to cost and liquidity. It has a charge of 0.35 per cent and the fund has more than $1bn in assets across its various share classes. Small-cap investing can often mean elevated risks, so the fact that the underlying index is diversified across more than 3,000 holdings will come as a relief to some.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">iShares Edge MSCI World Minimum Volatility UCITS ETF</url>                      (MINV)                   </p><p>This ETF's strategy has held up better than its US counterpart's this year, registering less of a loss than the mainstream MSCI World index. Cautious investors, and those with a slightly contrarian bent, may again be tempted by a satellite position with less of a focus on the current market leaders. This ETF, for example, has slightly less exposure to the US than a regular MSCI World tracker.</p><p>Investors will pay extra for this differentiation, with the 0.3 per cent charge making this product more expensive than a vanilla global equity ETF. But in uncertain times, you may be willing to pay up for something different.</p><p>As with other global products, do remember the risk that you might be duplicating positions held via regional funds.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">Vanguard Global Value Factor UCITS ETF</url>                      (VVAL)                   </p><p>The value investment style has continued to take a drubbing this year, with few obvious signs of a decisive comeback. But the need for diversification, and the fact that some investors will feel doubtful of the recent market rally and wish to go against the grain, has compelled us to stick with last year's value ETF picks for the time being.</p><p>This ETF continues to stand out on some of the usual metrics, given its low cost and good levels of liquidity. But eagle-eyed readers will note that this is, in fact, an actively managed fund. Vanguard uses quantitative analysis to pick stocks based on criteria such as their prices and estimated future earnings.</p><p>                     New: <url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">Fidelity Global Quality Income UCITS ETF</url> (FGQI)                   </p><p>Taking a global approach to dividend investing is a good way to mitigate some of the challenges that have become most obvious in the UK market, but no region is entirely safe from the pressures of the coronavirus crisis. As such, we have again erred on the side of caution here, replacing a Dividend Aristocrats ETF with the quality-biased Fidelity product.</p><p>The composition of global indices means that investors will get hefty exposure to the lower-yielding but better-performing US equity market, but the ETF takes in plenty of other markets, from Japan to the UK, Europe and Australia. The fund has a decent level of assets and a 0.4 per cent charge.</p><p>                     Dropped from the 2019 selection:                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">SPDR S&amp;P Global Dividend Aristocrats UCITS ETF</url> (GBDV)                   </p><p>In keeping with our thinking for regional dividend ETFs, we have opted to back what we deem to be the most defensive global option available. And while the Dividend Aristocrats focus on track records may provide one level of safety around certain payouts, we believe a better choice exists in these uncertain times.</p><p>                     JAPANESE EQUITIES (ONE ETF)                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">iShares MSCI Japan Small Cap UCITS ETF</url>                      (ISJP)                   </p><p>The panel still views this as a standout product when it comes to tracking Japanese smaller companies - although this in part relates to a lack of competitive alternatives. WisdomTree, for example, offers a Japanese small-cap ETF, but this has much less in the way of assets.</p><p>The iShares offering is large and liquid, with a broad underlying index that tracks nearly 1,000 companies. However, this ETF still looks far from cheap, with a 0.58 per cent charge.</p><p>                     EUROPEAN EQUITIES (TWO ETFS)                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">iShares Edge MSCI Europe Value Factor UCITS ETF</url>                      (IEFV)                   </p><p>The usual caveats about value investing apply to this pick, but it continues to stand out in its field because of the exposures investors are getting. Unlike many European equity funds and ETFs, this product includes an allocation to the UK - important because, as we noted last year, getting exposure to UK value stocks via an ETF can be a difficult task. This ETF's index also offers a reasonably wide range of different geographical exposures. It charges 0.25 per cent - not unreasonable for a factor ETF - and has significant assets.</p><p>                     New: <url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">Fidelity Europe Quality Income UCITS ETF</url> (FEUI)                   </p><p>We have again opted for a dividend strategy that seeks out financially robust companies to provide a layer of protection for equity income investors. Like the other offerings in this product range, Fidelity Europe Quality Income has an attractive 0.3 per cent fee.</p><p>This is arguably the Fidelity dividend ETF that may raise the most questions, because it has a limited level of assets under management so far. But it could well take on more money if dividend investors look for a more cautious approach, and benefits from being part of a wider product range that has fared well.</p><p>                     ASIA PACIFIC EX JAPAN EQUITIES (ONE ETF)                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">SPDR S&amp;P Pan Asia Dividend Aristocrats UCITS ETF</url>                      (PADV)                   </p><p>This ETF remains the most attractive prospect in its field, in part because of a lack of alternatives. A lack of competition has also meant little pressure on prices, with this product charging a fairly high 0.55 per cent fee.</p><p>However, it may still be worth considering as a satellite income play: Asia could well bounce back from the current crisis quicker than other regions, while economic growth and corporate improvements could result in a rosy outlook for dividends. And as we noted, a focus on companies with a good track record of increasing dividends does add a level of reassurance, even if it is no guarantee that payouts will keep rising.</p><p>                     EMERGING MARKET EQUITIES (THREE ETFS)                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">iShares Edge MSCI Emerging Markets Minimum Volatility UCITS ETF</url>                      (EMV)                   </p><p>Unlike some other minimum volatility ETFs, this product has fared well versus the mainstream market in what has been a turbulent year. And investors may be especially tempted to take a minimum volatility approach here, given that emerging markets can be a racier investment than other regions.</p><p>This iShares product takes the same approach as the others in the same range. It does charge a slightly higher fee than the others, but investors may value such an approach here.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">SPDR MSCI Emerging Markets Small Cap UCITS ETF</url>                      (EMSM)                   </p><p>A high-octane option, this may nevertheless appeal to those with a long-term mindset and an appetite for risk. The fund is not huge in size, but does offer exposure to a very broad range of companies, with 1,517 holdings in the underlying index towards the end of May. The 0.55 per cent charge means this is not the cheapest ETF, but some of this is understandable given the specialist area it focuses on.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">Xtrackers Harvest CSI300 UCITS ETF</url>                      (RQFI)                   </p><p>A promising but risky play, this ETF stands out because it grants investors access to Chinese mainland stocks (A Shares), which were only recently included in MSCI indices. The CSI 300 ETF index includes businesses from the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, with a focus on the biggest and most liquid equities in these markets.</p><p>The specialist nature of this ETF, combined with its good liquidity, goes some way toward justifying the steep 0.65 per cent ongoing charge. But the risky nature of the market in question means investors should not overlook active funds, or funds that allocate to China as part of a more diversified approach, as an alternative option.</p><p>                     BONDS (THREE ETFS)                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">Invesco US Treasury Bond 7-10 Year UCITS ETF</url>                      (TRXG)                   </p><p>Investors looking to diversify their government bond exposure beyond the UK can also turn to US Treasuries, which generally held up well in this year's sell-off. This ETF, which focuses on one of the most popular parts of the Treasury market, stands out both in terms of its significant scale and a very attractive price of just 0.06 per cent.</p><p>As with some of our satellite options, you should remember the risk of overlap with the core ETFs. AGBP has a good chunk of its assets in the US government bond market. This satellite option, instead, gives more targeted exposure.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">iShares Fallen Angels High Yield Corp Bond UCITS ETF</url>                      (RISE)                   </p><p>The ETF that generated the most enthusiasm among this year's panel, this product looks to generate yield and returns from 'fallen angel' bonds, which have been downgraded from investment-grade to high-yield status. Such bonds tend to be oversold as a result of their downgrade, but often retain an element of quality.</p><p>With many well-known companies, from Ford (US:F) to Kraft Heinz (US:KHC), seeing their debt downgraded amid the coronavirus crisis, the fallen angel market has grown markedly and could offer plenty of opportunities. It is not without risks - some downgrades may well prove to be justified, while fallen angel bonds tend to have longer maturities, and thus could be more sensitive to moves in interest rates. But investing in line with this theme in a diversified way could pay off.</p><p>This iShares ETF continues to appeal on various fronts. It is large and liquid, has a broad array of bonds, with around 460 bonds in early June, and recently offered a yield of around 4.5 per cent. The 0.5 per cent charge makes sense, given the specialist nature of this offering.</p><p>                     New: <url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">iShares JPMorgan $ EM Bond UCITS ETF</url> (EMHG)                   </p><p>At a time when 'safe' bond yields have collapsed, interest rates have been slashed and equity dividends are coming under pressure, brave income investors might find themselves turning to riskier parts of the market. Emerging market debt is one option, but the uncertainties of the Covid-19 era could mean the risks are especially elevated.</p><p>While no guarantee of safety, emerging market debt denominated in 'hard' currencies has tended to be less volatile than local currency bonds. This iShares ETF stood out as a route to hard currency exposure, given its substantial assets and broad focus. The fund's underlying index has around 500 bonds and can hold both government and corporate debt, although it recently had a heavy skew towards the former. The 0.5 per cent charge makes this product slightly cheaper than the emerging market debt ETF included in last year's list.</p><p>                     Dropped from 2019 selection:                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://markets.investorschronicle.co.uk/data/etfs/tearsheet/summary?s=VMID:LSE:GBP\">SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Emerging Markets Local Bond UCITS ETF</url>                      (EMDL)                   </p><p>This ETF still does its job, but we are dropping it in favour of a product that focuses instead on hard currency emerging market debt.

That's the grand experiment that we are living with. The thing is, we don't know what the right balance of regulation versus economic enablement is.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hopkins, whose clients have included the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Federal Reserve, said the scale and speed of the big tech companies, which constitute \"FAANG\" (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) plus Microsoft, are going beyond what regulators can keep up with.</p><p>\"Regulators move too slowly, and the tech giants are one or two steps ahead,\" said Hopkins. \"The answer is you have to learn how to be flexible. That's difficult to do and some of these decisions will be hard to make.\"</p><p>Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau was in Chantilly, France, last week meeting with his G7 counterparts to talk about how to tax and regulate big technology companies.</p><p>A Canadian federal legislative review panel struck under the heritage and innovation departments is also working on that very question. And what they determine will have an impact on whether future generations of Canadians sink or swim in the digital economy.</p><p>There have been particular concerns with Facebook from government regulators. MPs earlier this year voted unanimously to issue a standing summons for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg after they refused to testify before an Ottawa committee on digital regulation. The privacy commissioner is also suing the company over data-related breaches. And in the U.S., the company was fined a record $5 billion this month over privacy violations.</p><p>There is also concern over foreign influence in the upcoming federal election using social media. Facebook has said it will regulate itself and take down any accounts that try to interfere.</p><p>\"So much of public opinion is now shaped, not by curated trusted news sources, but the stuff that gets posted on Facebook, and that's powerful when you have 2.7 billion users of their apps,\" Hopkins said. \"Facebook has more of a reach on what we think and the implications are huge.\"</p><p>Another issue is that much of the \"news,\" or what comes onto newsfeeds on social media platforms, is developed by artificial intelligence.</p><p>\"Do you want what you know about the world to be based on what an algorithm thinks you should see?\" Algorithms are developed by humans who have inherent biases, Hopkins said.</p><p>Still, he insists the tech giants are \"not evil. They are simply forcing us to rethink what the digital ethics of the 21st century should be.\"</p><p>One big discussion currently is whether Toronto should give the go-ahead to an ambitious plan by Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google's parent company, to build a new smart city on the Toronto waterfront. The company has committed $1.3 billion to the project, but critics say the collection of data and how it will be used is concerning.</p><p>\"I think it's easy for us to villainize these companies, but ultimately I believe they are good for us,\" Hopkins said. \"Money is certainly at stake, but most of these companies have a socially progressive west coast ethic, and at some level aren't purely corporate profiteers. But they are certainly pushing the bounds of digital ethics and the notions of what is public and what is private. And that's what we have to figure out: How do we let them innovate, but without surrendering the rights we hold dear?\"</p><p>Canada and other western democracies are being leapfrogged by former developing countries as the new technologies are being implemented, Hopkins says.</p><p>Part of the issue, he argues, is political and cultural. That's where the debate over regulation gets murkier. And that has implications for projects such as Sidewalk Labs in Toronto.</p><p>\"China is doing surveillance in a way that is not acceptable to western democracies. Are we disadvantaged because of that, and will it hold back economic development? There are sets of values that we hold dear while other countries are accelerating and growing economically because they violate our norms. We have to decide how to maintain that balance.\"</p><p>In reality, Hopkins said Canada has no choice but to let tech giants self-regulate since government doesn't have the tools to \"work at their scale and speed.\"</p><p>\"You have to essentially put in checks and balances that ensure that Facebook is regulating itself properly. The stick is that as a country you can cut Facebook off if they don't abide by those rules,\" Hopkins said. \"But to actually do the policing and regulation for them would be very tough.\"</p><p>Facebook, meanwhile, announced recently that it is looking at launching its own cryptocurrency called Libra, which Hopkins said is both \"brilliant\" and dangerous at the same time.</p><p>\"It's a brilliant move because they already have such a big reach, but now they would be in charge of a system that will turn them into a bank with responsibility for potentially billions of dollars worth of payments. Look at the requirements and scrutiny that banks have to go through. We would have to rethink the rules once again.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019072255128772</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMH-9XY1-DY91-K1X5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"936\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 22, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001QLL</classCode><className>FORRESTER RESEARCH INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000D9JR</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Conduct that could raise red flags include signs of collusion, exclusive arrangements, and certain mergers and acquisitions, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said. Taking issue with the notion that the antitrust laws are inadequate to deal with the tech giants, Delrahim cited numerous examples of how the DOJ has targeted anticompetitive practices in the industry in the past. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. The Justice Department's top antitrust official on Tuesday laid out the types of behavior the agency's going to be looking for as it scrutinizes the big tech companies for antitrust concerns. </p><p>The department will be looking for signs of three broad categories of potentially anticompetitive behavior, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim said in a speech[2] at a conference[3] in Tel Aviv, Israel. Those categories include collusion among particular companies; exclusivity arrangements; and acquisitions, particularly of nascent competitors, he said. \"As we think about antitrust enforcement in the digital economy, the key issues that antitrust enforcers must untangle are whether a company is growing due to superior price, quality, and innovation, or whether some transaction or business practice is, on balance, anticompetitive in purpose and effect,\" Delrahim said in his speech, which CNBC previously reported[4]. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have agreed to divvy up responsibility[5] for the big tech companies, according to recent reports. The DOJ will oversee antitrust scrutiny of Google[6] and Apple[7], while the FTC will look into Amazon[8] and Facebook, according to the reports.The DOJ has targeted tech beforeDelrahim did not discuss the current inquiries into those companies. But he did dispute claims by some critics that the current antitrust laws either can't be applied or would be difficult to use against today's tech giants, citing numerous examples of how enforcement officials have taken action to stop anticompetitive behavior in the tech industry.  Companies can violate antitrust laws when they coordinate with other companies to fix prices or dominate markets. In 2008, the DOJ quashed Google's planned deal with Yahoo to take over the sale of search ads on Yahoo's sites, Delrahim noted. It also filed a series of complaints between 2010 and 2012 against a collection of tech companies, including Apple, Intel, and Google, alleging that they had conspired to artificial keep salaries of tech workers in check by agreeing not to poach each other's employees, he said. \"The [DOJ's] Antitrust Division may look askance at coordinated conduct that creates or enhances market power,\" he said. Corporations have also gotten into trouble over exclusivity deals, which can bar partners from offering customers competing products or suppliers from dealing with rival firms. The Microsoft antitrust trial was largely about its effort to bar computer makers from pre-installing any web browser on their devices other than its Internet Explorer software, Delrahim noted. \"The Microsoft case ... is a useful illustration of how problematic exclusive tying arrangements may occur in technology markets,\" he said. \"This theory is broadly applicable to other technology markets,\" he continued. Read this: Here's why the failed attempt to break up Microsoft will make or break the crackdown on Facebook, Amazon, and Google, according to 2 top lawyers in the Microsoft case[9] The other area Delrahim discussed where companies can run afoul of antitrust law is through mergers and acquisitions. Acquisitions can be beneficial for competition in certain cases, he said. But in other cases it can serve to throttle competition and stymie innovation, he said.Standard Oil and AT...how how mergers can hurt competitionStandard Oil, the archetype of the early 19th and 20th-century monopolist, amassed its power in part through acquiring rivals, Delrahim noted. So too did AT...the once-dominant telephone company, he said. \"It is not possible to describe here each way that a transaction may harm competition in a digital market,\" he said, \"but I will note the potential for mischief if the purpose and effect of an acquisition is to block potential competitors, protect a monopoly, or otherwise harm competition by reducing consumer choice, increasing prices, diminishing or slowing innovation, or reducing quality.\" At least on the face of things, the big tech companies would seem to be most vulnerable on the exclusivity and acquisition fronts. Google already was fined $5 billion by the European Union[10] for requiring phone makers that wanted to use its version of the Android operating system and its Google Play store to include with them its search and Chrome browser apps. Apple is under fire for its control of the iOS App Store[11], which is the only authorized way to get applications on iPhones and iPads. Meanwhile, there have been growing calls[12] for Facebook to be forced to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, which some have argued were represented potential competitors to the social-networking giant.

'The dominance is stifling competition,' the media firm said. </p><p>'Television advertisers are competing at an inherent disadvantage to online advertisers due to the regulatory imbalance between the two sectors.</p><p>'This is allowing bad practice and unscrupulous behaviour to take place and is putting consumers and advertisers at risk.'</p><p>In its response to the review, Facebook said: 'It is wholly artificial to isolate Facebook and Google in a manner which overlooks the fact that they compete vigorously with each other and with other market players.'</p><p>A Google spokesman said: 'We continue to work with the CMA to provide more information on how we operate and the value we provide consumers and industry in the UK.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-56102771</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X26-VW81-F021-62VB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"579\"/><timeReceived>GENERAL_EDIT_CORRECTION ERROR Document ID 103 Has error Validate old format failed - Input Date Invalid - 0022: Unparseable date: \"0022\"GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

nitf:lede=\"true\">A crucial online data arrangement between Europe and the US was invalidated on Thursday, as a top EU court decision over Facebook threw trans-Atlantic big tech into legal limbo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The decision stemmed from a legal complaint by Austrian activist Max Schrems, who in 2015 scuppered a previous EU-US deal on which tech giants depended to do business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It seems we scored a 100 percent win,\" Schrems said on Twitter.</p><p>\"For our privacy, the US will have to engage in serious surveillance reform to get back to a 'privileged' status for US companies,\" he said.</p><p>The setback comes a day after another European court invalidated a landmark tax bill from the EU against Apple, raising questions over the bloc's long-running leadership on regulating big tech.</p><p>While disappointed, the US and the EU said they would work closely to find a solution and give companies the legal certainty they need.</p><p>Schrems' legal assault began after revelations by Edward Snowden of mass digital spying by US agencies, which the EU court at the time said were incompatible with European norms on privacy.</p><p>The previous decision struck down a deal called \"Safe Harbour\" that allowed for data transfers between Europe and US servers, throwing transatlantic business into chaos. </p><p>EU and US officials swiftly drew up its replacement, \"Privacy Shield\", which is currently used by thousands of US companies, but has now been invalidated as well.</p><p>The judges at the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, said that provisions of the pact \"do not grant Europeans actionable rights before the courts against the US authorities\".</p><p>The court said, however, that another arrangement known as standard contractual clauses, could stand, giving companies an alternative framework.</p><p>The case decided on Thursday originally focused on these complex clauses, an EU invention by which companies outside Europe commit to meeting EU laws on data and privacy.</p><p>The court said these were backed up by GDPR, the EU's strict rules on data privacy that can result in massive fines to companies.</p><p>These clauses are however far more legally cumbersome for companies than a bilateral deal such as \"Privacy Shield\" that the EU has agreed with only 11 countries, including Japan.</p><p>During the hearings, judges turned their focus to \"Privacy Shield\" and a legal advisor to the court warned that it was illegal and not compliant with GDPR.</p><p>- 'Sustainable solution' -</p><p>Schrems' latest case began in Ireland, the hub for Facebook's activities in the European Union. </p><p>The Irish Data Protection Commission referred the complaint to Ireland's top court, which turned it over to the judges in Luxembourg.</p><p>Facebook said it welcomed the decision on the clauses and was taking a closer look at the ban on \"Privacy Shield\".</p><p>\"We look forward to regulatory guidance in this regard,\" said Eva Nagle, the company's Associate General Counsel.</p><p>A top Brussels official told AFP that the EU and US would work \"very closely\" on next steps, though he did not say whether this would mean a third attempt towards a full fledged pact.</p><p>\"Our ambition is to respond together and figure out ways we can adapt to the decision,\" the EU's Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said.</p><p>US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that while Washington was \"deeply disappointed\", the US and Europe would try to \"limit the negative consequences\".</p><p>CCIA, the lobby for US big tech, criticised the decision for sowing legal uncertainty.</p><p>\"We trust that EU and US decision-makers will swiftly develop a sustainable solution, in line with EU law, to ensure the continuation of data flows which underpins the transatlantic economy,\" CCIA added.</p><p>Lawyers and companies said that immediate effects on online business would be limited, given that the contractual clauses had survived the ruling.</p><p>\"We want to be clear: if you are a commercial customer, you can continue to use Microsoft services in compliance with European law,\" said Julie Brill, a vice president at the US software giant.</p><p>She said Microsoft servers held \"overlapping protections\" using both the clauses and Privacy Shield.</p><p>FACEBOOK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFP-Top court

The decision st...</p><p>Brussels, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 16th Jul, 2020 ) :A crucial online data arrangement between Europe and the US was invalidated on Thursday, as a top EU court decision over Facebook threw trans-Atlantic big tech into legal limbo.   The decision stemmed from a legal complaint by Austrian activist Max Schrems, who in 2015 scuppered a previous EU-US deal on which tech giants depended to do business .   \"It seems we scored a 100 percent win,\" Schrems said on Twitter .   \"For our privacy, the US will have to engage in serious surveillance reform to get back to a 'privileged' status for US companies,\" he said.   The setback comes a day after another European court invalidated a landmark tax bill from the EU against Apple , raising questions over the bloc's long-running leadership on regulating big tech.   While disappointed, the US and the EU said they would work closely to find a solution and give companies the legal certainty they need.   Schrems' legal assault began after revelations by Edward Snowden of mass digital spying by US agencies, which the EU court at the time said were incompatible with European norms on privacy.   The previous decision struck down a deal called \"Safe Harbour\" that allowed for data transfers between Europe and US servers, throwing transatlantic business into chaos.   EU and US officials swiftly drew up its replacement, \"Privacy Shield\", which is currently used by thousands of US companies, but has now been invalidated as well.   The judges at the European Court of Justice, the EU's top  court , said that provisions of the pact \"do not grant Europeans actionable rights before the courts against the US authorities\".   The court said, however, that another arrangement known as standard contractual clauses, could stand, giving companies an alternative framework.   The case decided on Thursday originally focused on these complex clauses, an EU invention by which companies outside Europe commit to meeting EU laws on data and privacy.   The court said these were backed up by GDPR, the EU's strict rules on data privacy that can result in massive fines to companies.        These clauses are however far more legally cumbersome for companies than a bilateral deal such as \"Privacy Shield\" that the EU has agreed with only 11 countries, including Japan .   During the hearings, judges turned their focus to \"Privacy Shield\" and a legal advisor to the court warned that it was illegal and not compliant with GDPR.   - 'Sustainable solution' - Schrems' latest case began in Ireland , the hub for Facebook 's activities in the European Union .   The Irish Data Protection Commission referred the complaint to Ireland 's top  court , which turned it over to the judges in Luxembourg .   Facebook said it welcomed the decision on the clauses and was taking a closer look at the ban on \"Privacy Shield\".   \"We look forward to regulatory guidance in this regard,\" said Eva Nagle, the company 's Associate General Counsel.   A top  Brussels official told AFP that the EU and US would work \"very closely\" on next steps, though he did not say whether this would mean a third attempt towards a full fledged pact.   \"Our ambition is to respond together and figure out ways we can adapt to the decision,\" the EU's Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said.   US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that while Washington was \"deeply disappointed\", the US and Europe would try to \"limit the negative consequences\".   CCIA, the lobby for US big tech, criticised the decision for sowing legal uncertainty.   \"We trust that EU and US decision-makers will swiftly develop a sustainable solution, in line with EU law, to ensure the continuation of data flows which underpins the transatlantic economy,\" CCIA added.   Lawyers and companies said that immediate effects on online business would be limited, given that the contractual clauses had survived the ruling.   \"We want to be clear: if you are a commercial customer, you can continue to use microsoft services in compliance with European law,\" said Julie Brill, a vice president at the US software giant.   She said Microsoft servers held \"overlapping protections\" using both the clauses and Privacy Shield.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42612787048</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C9-W5G1-JCSC-J3F7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"743\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>UrduPoint.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The decision stemmed from a legal complaint by Austrian activist Max Schrems, who in 2015 scuppered a previous EU-US deal on which tech giants depended to do business .   \"It seems we scored a 100 percent win,\" Schrems said on Twitter .   \"For our privacy, the US will have to engage in serious surveillance reform to get back to a 'privileged' status for US companies,\" he said.   The setback comes a day after another European court invalidated a landmark tax bill from the EU against Apple , raising questions over the bloc's long-running leadership on regulating big tech.   While disappointed, the US and the EU said they would work closely to find a solution and give companies the legal certainty they need.   Schrems' legal assault began after revelations by Edward Snowden of mass digital spying by US agencies, which the EU court at the time said were incompatible with European norms on privacy.   The previous decision struck down a deal called \"Safe Harbour\" that allowed for data transfers between Europe and US servers, throwing transatlantic business into chaos.   EU and US officials swiftly drew up its replacement, \"Privacy Shield\", which is currently used by thousands of US companies, but has now been invalidated as well.   The judges at the European Court of Justice, the EU's top  court , said that provisions of the pact \"do not grant Europeans actionable rights before the courts against the US authorities.\" The court said, however, that another arrangement known as standard contractual clauses, could stand, giving companies an alternative framework.   The case decided on Thursday originally focused on these complex clauses, an EU invention in which companies outside Europe commit to meeting EU laws on data and privacy.   The court said these were backed up by GDPR, the EU's strict rules on data privacy that can result in massive fines to companies.        These clauses are however far more legally cumbersome for companies than a bilateral deal such as \"Privacy Shield\" that the EU has agreed with only 11 countries, including Japan .   During the hearings, judges turned their focus to \"Privacy Shield\" and a legal advisor to the court warned that it was illegal and not compliant with GDPR.   - 'Sustainable solution' - Schrems' latest case began in Ireland , the hub for Facebook 's activities in the European Union . The Irish Data Protection Commission referred the complaint to Ireland 's top  court , which turned it over to the judges in Luxembourg .   A top  Brussels official told AFP that the EU and US would work \"very closely\" on trying to agree on next steps, though he did not say whether this would mean a third attempt at agreeing a pact.   \"Our ambition is to respond together and figure out ways we can adapt to the decision,\" the EU's Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said.   US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that while Washington was \"deeply disappointed\" by the court 's decision, the US was in close contact with the Europe to \"limit the negative consequences\".   CCIA, the lobby for US big tech, criticised the decision, \"which creates legal uncertainty for the thousands of large and small companies on both sides of the Atlantic\".   \"We trust that EU and US decision-makers will swiftly develop a sustainable solution, in line with EU law, to ensure the continuation of data flows which underpins the transatlantic economy,\" CCIA added.   Lawyers and companies said that the effects on online business would be limited, given that the contractual clauses had survived the court 's ruling.   \"We want to be clear: if you are a commercial customer, you can continue to use microsoft services in compliance with European law,\" said Julie Brill, a vice president at the US software giant.

The decision stemmed from a legal complaint by Austrian activist Max Schrems, who in 2015 scuppered a previous EU-US deal on which tech giants depended to do business. \"It seems we scored a 100 percent win,\" Schrems said on Twitter. </p><p>\"For our privacy, the US will have to engage in serious surveillance reform to get back to a 'privileged' status for US companies,\" he said. The setback comes a day after another European court invalidated a landmark tax bill from the EU against Apple, raising questions over the bloc's long-running leadership on regulating big tech. While disappointed, the US and the EU said they would work closely to find a solution and give companies the legal certainty they need. Schrems' legal assault began after revelations by Edward Snowden of mass digital spying by US agencies, which the EU court at the time said were incompatible with European norms on privacy. The previous decision struck down a deal called \"Safe Harbour\" that allowed for data transfers between Europe and US servers, throwing transatlantic business into chaos.  EU and US officials swiftly drew up its replacement, \"Privacy Shield\", which is currently used by thousands of US companies, but has now been invalidated as well. The judges at the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, said that provisions of the pact \"do not grant Europeans actionable rights before the courts against the US authorities\". The court said, however, that another arrangement known as standard contractual clauses, could stand, giving companies an alternative framework. The case decided on Thursday originally focused on these complex clauses, an EU invention by which companies outside Europe commit to meeting EU laws on data and privacy. The court said these were backed up by GDPR, the EU's strict rules on data privacy that can result in massive fines to companies. These clauses are however far more legally cumbersome for companies than a bilateral deal such as \"Privacy Shield\" that the EU has agreed with only 11 countries, including Japan.During the hearings, judges turned their focus to \"Privacy Shield\" and a legal advisor to the court warned that it was illegal and not compliant with GDPR.Schrems' latest case began in Ireland, the hub for Facebook's activities in the European Union.  The Irish Data Protection Commission referred the complaint to Ireland's top court, which turned it over to the judges in Luxembourg. Facebook said it welcomed the decision on the clauses and was taking a closer look at the ban on \"Privacy Shield\". \"We look forward to regulatory guidance in this regard,\" said Eva Nagle, the company's Associate General Counsel. A top Brussels official told AFP that the EU and US would work \"very closely\" on next steps, though he did not say whether this would mean a third attempt towards a full fledged pact. \"Our ambition is to respond together and figure out ways we can adapt to the decision,\" the EU's Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said.

The previous decision struck down a deal called \"Safe Harbour\" that allowed for data transfers between Europe and US servers, throwing transatlantic business into chaos.EU and US officials swiftly drew up its replacement, \"Privacy Shield\", which is currently used by thousands of US companies, but has now been invalidated as well.The judges at the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, said that provisions of the pact \"do not grant Europeans actionable rights before the courts against the US authorities.\"The court said, however, that another arrangement known as standard contractual clauses, could stand, giving companies an alternative framework.The case decided on Thursday originally focused on these complex clauses, an EU invention in which companies outside Europe commit to meeting EU laws on data and privacy.The court said these were backed up by GDPR, the EU's strict rules on data privacy that can result in massive fines to companies. </p><p>The ruling puts data transfers from the EU to the US by Facebook and many other US tech firms into legal limbo Photo: AFP / Olivier DOULIERY These clauses are however far more legally cumbersome for companies than a bilateral deal such as \"Privacy Shield\" that the EU has agreed with only 11 countries, including Japan.During the hearings, judges turned their focus to \"Privacy Shield\" and a legal advisor to the court warned that it was illegal and not compliant with GDPR.Schrems' latest case began in Ireland, the hub for Facebook's activities in the European Union. The Irish Data Protection Commission referred the complaint to Ireland's top court, which turned it over to the judges in Luxembourg.A top Brussels official told AFP that the EU and US would work \"very closely\" on trying to agree on next steps, though he did not say whether this would mean a third attempt at agreeing a pact.\"Our ambition is to respond together and figure out ways we can adapt to the decision,\" the EU's Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said.US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that while Washington was \"deeply disappointed\" by the court's decision, the US was in close contact with the Europe to \"limit the negative consequences\".CCIA, the lobby for US big tech, criticised the decision, \"which creates legal uncertainty for the thousands of large and small companies on both sides of the Atlantic\".\"We trust that EU and US decision-makers will swiftly develop a sustainable solution, in line with EU law, to ensure the continuation of data flows which underpins the transatlantic economy,\" CCIA added.Lawyers and companies said that the effects on online business would be limited, given that the contractual clauses had survived the court's ruling.\"We want to be clear: if you are a commercial customer, you can continue to use Microsoft services in compliance with European law,\" said Julie Brill, a vice president at the US software giant.She said Microsoft servers held \"overlapping protections\" using both the clauses and Privacy Shield. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767159489994674225876100131</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CB-N881-F03R-N1TS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"694\"/><timeReceived>11:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The decision stemmed from a legal complaint by Austrian activist Max Schrems, who in 2015 scuppered a previous EU-US deal on which tech giants depended to do business.    \"It seems we scored a 100 percent win,\" Schrems said on Twitter.    \"For our privacy, the US will have to engage in serious surveillance reform to get back to a 'privileged' status for US companies,\" he said.    The setback comes a day after another European court invalidated a landmark tax bill from the EU against Apple, raising questions over the bloc's long-running leadership on regulating big tech.       While disappointed, the US and the EU said they would work closely to find a solution and give companies the legal certainty they need.    Schrems' legal assault began after revelations by Edward Snowden of mass digital spying by US agencies, which the EU court at the time said were incompatible with European norms on privacy.    The previous decision struck down a deal called \"Safe Harbour\" that allowed for data transfers between Europe and US servers, throwing transatlantic business into chaos.    EU and US officials swiftly drew up its replacement, \"Privacy Shield\", which is currently used by thousands of US companies, but has now been invalidated as well.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42615221786</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CF-C0T1-JCSC-J3Y3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"281\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Bangladesh Daily Star</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 16, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Under the new framework agreed upon by Senate Committee on Commerce Ranking Member Maria Cantwell, Senate Committee on the Judiciary Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Ranking Member Sherrod Brown, and Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Ranking Member Patty Murray, consumers would be able to control their personal information, and corporations, non-profits, and political entities would be held to higher standards for when and how they collect, use, share and protect consumer data.</p><p>Specifically, the privacy principles strengthen individual consumer and civil rights protections, including for children and teens, invigorate competition by increasing consumer choice, establish data safeguards to ensure use abides by consumer expectations and increase accountability over data practices by those at the highest levels of organizations. The principles also put more teeth into enforcement by ensuring that both regulators and individuals have the tools they need to aggressively identify harmful or invasive privacy practices and pursue legal remedies.</p><p>The group of Senate Democratic Ranking Members first came together after Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer tasked the committees of primary jurisdiction over various privacy and data protection issues, like data security and civil rights, with developing principles to fill in the serious gaps in consumer protection not currently covered by existing federal laws and provide a strong nationwide foundation for comprehensive federal legislation. Senators Ron Wyden, Richard Blumenthal, Brian Schatz and Ed Markey, four of the Senate\u2019s leading advocates for comprehensive privacy protections, were also consulted and support the new principles.</p><p>Currently, there are a number of laws that are designed to protect privacy, however these laws provide specific privacy protections and are limited in scope by data types such as credit information protected by the Financial Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), protected health information created and maintained by payers and providers of healthcare, as is governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or safeguards afforded to children\u2019s data by the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The newly unveiled principles should not be interpreted to change or displace existing privacy laws, or privacy laws scheduled to go into effect.</p><p>The Senate Democrats\u2019 privacy principles can be found here.</p><p>'In an ever-evolving information age, consumers deserve to have protections from websites and online services harvesting their personal data. They deserve to have privacy rights and have those rights protected,\u201d said Senator Cantwell.</p><p>\u201cIndividuals should have the ability to control their personal data, period. To prevent companies from abusing our personal data, we need to create more transparency and accountability and allow individuals to determine how their data is used. That is what we hope to accomplish with this framework,\u201d said Senator Feinstein.</p><p>\u201cToo many corporations require Americans to sacrifice their privacy and share the most intimate details of their lives just to visit a website or to receive and use services,\u201d said Senator Brown. \u201cWe must establish rules that take the power away from companies like Facebook, Equifax, and others to violate Americans\u2019 privacy for profits and give it back to hardworking Americans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs data continues to play an important new role in families\u2019 lives in the 21st century, we need to make sure the constant development of new technology is matched by the development of new best practices and protections that speak to the needs for security, privacy, and good data stewardship,\u201d said Senator Murray. \u201cPeople should be able to expect tech companies are going to treat their most sensitive information responsibly, and give them the tools they need to be able to control how and when their information is disclosed. Our objective should be to make sure tech companies are putting people in the driver\u2019s seat, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI applaud my colleagues for their great work and am proud to support these strong principles,\u201d said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said for more than a year now that corporations need to mind their own business when it comes to misusing Americans\u2019 private information. These principles make clear that Democrats support strong new protections for Americans\u2019 data, unprecedented transparency over how our information is used, and new enforcement with teeth that will hold corporations accountable,\u201d said Senator Wyden. \u201cLeader Schumer and Ranking Members Cantwell, Feinstein, Brown and Murray deserve enormous credit for putting together a tough, comprehensive list of principles to protect Americans\u2019 private data and put consumers back in control of their most sensitive information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know from having fought for stronger privacy protection over decades, federal action is woefully overdue and urgently necessary now. I will continue to work for bipartisan federal action because Americans absolutely want stronger privacy protection,\u201d said Senator Blumenthal. \u201cThey know from painful experience that the intimate details of our personal lives are used against us every day by unaccountable corporations and foreign actors, deeply endangering our safety and democracy. Americans deserve and rightly expect stronger privacy safeguards, regardless of their politics or their personal circumstance. I look forward to collaborating with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass\u2014as soon as possible\u2014new privacy laws that are as strong and comprehensive as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to update our privacy laws for the internet age.\u201d said Senator Schatz. \u201cWhen consumers let companies use their information they should be able to trust that it will be protected, used ethically, and won\u2019t be used to harm them. These principles provide a framework for clear rules of the road for companies, and would give prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe American people are overdue for a privacy bill of rights that puts consumers first and effectively protects our personal information. And any comprehensive privacy legislation must include heightened safeguards for children and teens, who are uniquely vulnerable in today\u2019s digital age,\u201d said Senator Markey. \u201cWe cannot afford to shrug off the daily data breaches and privacy invasions as a new normal.

Under the new framework agreed upon by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) consumers would be able to control their personal information, and corporations, non-profits, and political entities would be held to higher standards for when and how they collect, use, share and protect consumer data.</p><p>Specifically, the privacy principles strengthen individual consumer and civil rights protections, including for children and teens, invigorate competition by increasing consumer choice, establish data safeguards to ensure use abides by consumer expectations and increase accountability over data practices by those at the highest levels of organizations. The principles also put more teeth into enforcement by ensuring that both regulators and individuals have the tools they need to aggressively identify harmful or invasive privacy practices and pursue legal remedies.</p><p>The group of Senate Democratic ranking members first came together after Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y ) tasked the committees of primary jurisdiction over various privacy and data protection issues, like data security and civil rights, with developing principles to fill in the serious gaps in consumer protection not currently covered by existing federal laws and provide a strong nationwide foundation for comprehensive federal legislation. Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) were also consulted and support the new principles.</p><p>Currently, there are a number of laws that are designed to protect privacy, however these laws provide specific privacy protections and are limited in scope by data types such as credit information protected by the Financial Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), protected health information created and maintained by payers and providers of healthcare, as is governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or safeguards afforded to children\u2019s data by the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The newly unveiled principles should not be interpreted to change or displace existing privacy laws, or privacy laws scheduled to go into effect.</p><p>The Senate Democrats\u2019 privacy principles can be found here.</p><p>\u201cIndividuals should have the ability to control their personal data, period. To prevent companies from abusing our personal data, we need to create more transparency and accountability and allow individuals to determine how their data is used. That is what we hope to accomplish with this framework,\u201d said Senator Feinstein.</p><p>'In an ever-evolving information age, consumers deserve to have protections from websites and online services harvesting their personal data. They deserve to have privacy rights and have those rights protected,\u201d said Senator Cantwell.</p><p>\u201cToo many corporations require Americans to sacrifice their privacy and share the most intimate details of their lives just to visit a website or to receive and use services,\u201d said Senator Brown. \u201cWe must establish rules that take the power away from companies like Facebook, Equifax, and others to violate Americans\u2019 privacy for profits and give it back to hardworking Americans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs data continues to play an important new role in families\u2019 lives in the 21st century, we need to make sure the constant development of new technology is matched by the development of new best practices and protections that speak to the needs for security, privacy, and good data stewardship,\u201d said Senator Murray. \u201cPeople should be able to expect tech companies are going to treat their most sensitive information responsibly, and give them the tools they need to be able to control how and when their information is disclosed. Our objective should be to make sure tech companies are putting people in the driver\u2019s seat, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI applaud my colleagues for their great work and am proud to support these strong principles,\u201d said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said for more than a year now that corporations need to mind their own business when it comes to misusing Americans\u2019 private information. These principles make clear that Democrats support strong new protections for Americans\u2019 data, unprecedented transparency over how our information is used, and new enforcement with teeth that will hold corporations accountable,\u201d said Senator Wyden. \u201cLeader Schumer and Ranking Members Cantwell, Feinstein, Brown and Murray deserve enormous credit for putting together a tough, comprehensive list of principles to protect Americans\u2019 private data and put consumers back in control of their most sensitive information.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know from having fought for stronger privacy protection over decades, federal action is woefully overdue and urgently necessary now. I will continue to work for bipartisan federal action because Americans absolutely want stronger privacy protection,\u201d said Senator Blumenthal. \u201cThey know from painful experience that the intimate details of our personal lives are used against us every day by unaccountable corporations and foreign actors, deeply endangering our safety and democracy. Americans deserve and rightly expect stronger privacy safeguards, regardless of their politics or their personal circumstance. I look forward to collaborating with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass\u2014as soon as possible\u2014new privacy laws that are as strong and comprehensive as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to update our privacy laws for the internet age.\u201d said Senator Schatz. \u201cWhen consumers let companies use their information they should be able to trust that it will be protected, used ethically, and won\u2019t be used to harm them. These principles provide a framework for clear rules of the road for companies, and would give prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe American people are overdue for a privacy bill of rights that puts consumers first and effectively protects our personal information. And any comprehensive privacy legislation must include heightened safeguards for children and teens, who are uniquely vulnerable in today\u2019s digital age,\u201d said Senator Markey. \u201cWe cannot afford to shrug off the daily data breaches and privacy invasions as a new normal. I am pleased to work with my colleagues on this framework for comprehensive privacy legislation, and I look forward to continuing this important collaboration.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2627212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJC-71T1-JDG9-Y12W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1129\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Under the new framework agreed upon by Senate Committee on Commerce Ranking Member Maria Cantwell, Senate Committee on the Judiciary Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Ranking Member Sherrod Brown, and Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Ranking Member Patty Murray, consumers would be able to control their personal information, and corporations, non-profits, and political entities would be held to higher standards for when and how they collect, use, share and protect consumer data.</p><p>Specifically, the privacy principles strengthen individual consumer and civil rights protections, including for children and teens, invigorate competition by increasing consumer choice, establish data safeguards to ensure use abides by consumer expectations and increase accountability over data practices by those at the highest levels of organizations. The principles also put more teeth into enforcement by ensuring that both regulators and individuals have the tools they need to aggressively identify harmful or invasive privacy practices and pursue legal remedies.</p><p>The group of Senate Democratic Ranking Members first came together after Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer tasked the committees of primary jurisdiction over various privacy and data protection issues, like data security and civil rights, with developing principles to fill in the serious gaps in consumer protection not currently covered by existing federal laws and provide a strong nationwide foundation for comprehensive federal legislation. Senators Ron Wyden, Richard Blumenthal, Brian Schatz and Ed Markey, four of the Senate's leading advocates for comprehensive privacy protections, were also consulted and support the new principles.</p><p>Currently, there are a number of laws that are designed to protect privacy, however these laws provide specific privacy protections and are limited in scope by data types such as credit information protected by the Financial Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), protected health information created and maintained by payers and providers of healthcare, as is governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or safeguards afforded to children's data by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The newly unveiled principles should not be interpreted to change or displace existing privacy laws, or privacy laws scheduled to go into effect.</p><p>The Senate Democrats' privacy principles can be found at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FinalCMTE%20Privacy%20Principles11.14.19.pdf\">https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FinalCMTE%20Privacy%20Principles11.14.19.pdf</url>.</p><p>\"In an ever-evolving information age, consumers deserve to have protections from websites and online services harvesting their personal data. They deserve to have privacy rights and have those rights protected,\" said Senator Cantwell.</p><p>\"Individuals should have the ability to control their personal data, period. To prevent companies from abusing our personal data, we need to create more transparency and accountability and allow individuals to determine how their data is used. That is what we hope to accomplish with this framework,\" said Senator Feinstein.</p><p>\"Too many corporations require Americans to sacrifice their privacy and share the most intimate details of their lives just to visit a website or to receive and use services,\" said Senator Brown. \"We must establish rules that take the power away from companies like Facebook, Equifax, and others to violate Americans' privacy for profits and give it back to hardworking Americans.\"</p><p>\"As data continues to play an important new role in families' lives in the 21st century, we need to make sure the constant development of new technology is matched by the development of new best practices and protections that speak to the needs for security, privacy, and good data stewardship,\" said Senator Murray. \"People should be able to expect tech companies are going to treat their most sensitive information responsibly, and give them the tools they need to be able to control how and when their information is disclosed. Our objective should be to make sure tech companies are putting people in the driver's seat, not the other way around.\"</p><p>\"I applaud my colleagues for their great work and am proud to support these strong principles,\" said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.</p><p>\"I've said for more than a year now that corporations need to mind their own business when it comes to misusing Americans' private information. These principles make clear that Democrats support strong new protections for Americans' data, unprecedented transparency over how our information is used, and new enforcement with teeth that will hold corporations accountable,\" said Senator Wyden. \"Leader Schumer and Ranking Members Cantwell, Feinstein, Brown and Murray deserve enormous credit for putting together a tough, comprehensive list of principles to protect Americans' private data and put consumers back in control of their most sensitive information.\"</p><p>\"I know from having fought for stronger privacy protection over decades, federal action is woefully overdue and urgently necessary now. I will continue to work for bipartisan federal action because Americans absolutely want stronger privacy protection,\" said Senator Blumenthal. \"They know from painful experience that the intimate details of our personal lives are used against us every day by unaccountable corporations and foreign actors, deeply endangering our safety and democracy. Americans deserve and rightly expect stronger privacy safeguards, regardless of their politics or their personal circumstance. I look forward to collaborating with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass--as soon as possible--new privacy laws that are as strong and comprehensive as possible.\"</p><p>\"We need to update our privacy laws for the internet age.\" said Senator Schatz. \"When consumers let companies use their information they should be able to trust that it will be protected, used ethically, and won't be used to harm them. These principles provide a framework for clear rules of the road for companies, and would give prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.\"</p><p>\"The American people are overdue for a privacy bill of rights that puts consumers first and effectively protects our personal information. And any comprehensive privacy legislation must include heightened safeguards for children and teens, who are uniquely vulnerable in today's digital age,\" said Senator Markey. \"We cannot afford to shrug off the daily data breaches and privacy invasions as a new normal. I am pleased to work with my colleagues on this framework for comprehensive privacy legislation, and I look forward to continuing this important collaboration.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COS1F111182019</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ2-9F11-JCCP-02D3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1310\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 18, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Fair Credit Reporting</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTBENkY4NTNENTk0NEE0RUJBMDVBMTYyNjJBNjU2Njc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDIxRTY0QTMzQUVENDBEQjlDQTFBOTg1NzlFOEYzODk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Under the new framework agreed upon by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) consumers would be able to control their personal information, and corporations, non-profits, and political entities would be held to higher standards for when and how they collect, use, share and protect consumer data.</p><p>Specifically, the privacy principles strengthen individual consumer and civil rights protections, including for children and teens, invigorate competition by increasing consumer choice, establish data safeguards to ensure use abides by consumer expectations and increase accountability over data practices by those at the highest levels of organizations. The principles also put more teeth into enforcement by ensuring that both regulators and individuals have the tools they need to aggressively identify harmful or invasive privacy practices and pursue legal remedies.</p><p>The group of Senate Democratic ranking members first came together after Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) tasked the committees of primary jurisdiction over various privacy and data protection issues, like data security and civil rights, with developing principles to fill in the serious gaps in consumer protection not currently covered by existing federal laws and provide a strong nationwide foundation for comprehensive federal legislation. Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) were also consulted and support the new principles.</p><p>Currently, there are a number of laws that are designed to protect privacy, however these laws provide specific privacy protections and are limited in scope by data types such as credit information protected by the Financial Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), protected health information created and maintained by payers and providers of healthcare, as is governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or safeguards afforded to childrens data by the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The newly unveiled principles should not be interpreted to change or displace existing privacy laws, or privacy laws scheduled to go into effect.</p><p>The Senate Democrats privacy principles can be found here .</p><p>Individuals should have the ability to control their personal data, period. To prevent companies from abusing our personal data, we need to create more transparency and accountability and allow individuals to determine how their data is used. That is what we hope to accomplish with this framework, said Senator Feinstein.</p><p>\"In an ever-evolving information age, consumers deserve to have protections from websites and online services harvesting their personal data. They deserve to have privacy rights and have those rights protected, said Senator Cantwell.</p><p>Too many corporations require Americans to sacrifice their privacy and share the most intimate details of their lives just to visit a website or to receive and use services, said Senator Brown. We must establish rules that take the power away from companies like Facebook, Equifax, and others to violate Americans privacy for profits and give it back to hardworking Americans.</p><p>As data continues to play an important new role in families lives in the 21st century, we need to make sure the constant development of new technology is matched by the development of new best practices and protections that speak to the needs for security, privacy, and good data stewardship, said Senator Murray. People should be able to expect tech companies are going to treat their most sensitive information responsibly, and give them the tools they need to be able to control how and when their information is disclosed. Our objective should be to make sure tech companies are putting people in the drivers seat, not the other way around.</p><p>I applaud my colleagues for their great work and am proud to support these strong principles, said Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.</p><p>Ive said for more than a year now that corporations need to mind their own business when it comes to misusing Americans private information. These principles make clear that Democrats support strong new protections for Americans data, unprecedented transparency over how our information is used, and new enforcement with teeth that will hold corporations accountable, said Senator Wyden. Leader Schumer and Ranking Members Cantwell, Feinstein, Brown and Murray deserve enormous credit for putting together a tough, comprehensive list of principles to protect Americans private data and put consumers back in control of their most sensitive information.</p><p>I know from having fought for stronger privacy protection over decades, federal action is woefully overdue and urgently necessary now. I will continue to work for bipartisan federal action because Americans absolutely want stronger privacy protection, said Senator Blumenthal . They know from painful experience that the intimate details of our personal lives are used against us every day by unaccountable corporations and foreign actors, deeply endangering our safety and democracy. Americans deserve and rightly expect stronger privacy safeguards, regardless of their politics or their personal circumstance. I look forward to collaborating with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to passas soon as possiblenew privacy laws that are as strong and comprehensive as possible.</p><p>We need to update our privacy laws for the internet age. said Senator Schatz. When consumers let companies use their information they should be able to trust that it will be protected, used ethically, and wont be used to harm them. These principles provide a framework for clear rules of the road for companies, and would give prosecutors and consumers the tools they need to hold big tech companies accountable.</p><p>The American people are overdue for a privacy bill of rights that puts consumers first and effectively protects our personal information. And any comprehensive privacy legislation must include heightened safeguards for children and teens, who are uniquely vulnerable in todays digital age, said Senator Markey. We cannot afford to shrug off the daily data breaches and privacy invasions as a new normal.
