Now it faces a new one: proving to a grumpy public and a sceptical world that the answer to American capitalism's problems lies not in restraining business, but in liberating it. The unshackling comes courtesy of a Republican president and Congress. Its effects on investment for long-term growth and on increasing levels of competition, productivity and pay--the effects that would make America a better place for all--are still unfolding.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Leading executives know that the stakes are high. In his latest letter to the shareholders of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, the bank's boss, worries that \"Younger people in the United States, who are effectively going to inherit the wealthiest nation on the planet, seem to be pessimistic about our future and capitalism.\" Larry Fink, the boss of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, worries about \"popular frustration and apprehension about the future\".</p><p>That frustration is easily understood. The past decade was a great one for shareholders, but not for society. Comparing 2009-17 with an average of the past half-century, post-tax profits were 31% higher as a share of GDP. But they were spent on share buy-backs and cosy market-consolidating mergers rather than investment, which was 4% lower as a share of GDP than its 50-year average. Pay was 10% lower (see chart 1 on next page). Competition flagged, dragging down productivity growth, the driver of long-term living standards. In early 2016 labour-productivity growth, which was low across the developed world, was almost zero in America.</p><p>Faced with all that, some countries would have set about constraining and controlling what companies could do. America did the opposite. In November 2016 it elected a Republican Congress and president keen to provide USA Inc with a sumptuous pick-me-up of tax cuts and deregulation, along with an order of protectionism on the side. Not all in the party agree on all of this. But almost all believe in doing things they think will help business, not just because they have a natural sympathy with the people who own and run companies, but because they think they will ultimately benefit everyone.</p><p>Eighteen months on, business confidence has soared. However alarming or distasteful some of them may find President Donald Trump, most of America's chief executives are quietly appreciative of the Republican agenda. Shareholders have continued in clover. Earnings for firms in the S&amp;P 500 index rose by 22% in the first quarter compared with the previous year, or by 9% if you exclude the benefit of the recent tax cut. Growth is broadly based: 89% of S&amp;P 500 firms are enjoying rising sales, up from just 36% in 2009's nadir; the high in the previous cycle was 76% in 2008. Blackstone, a private-equity firm, says that the profits of its portfolio of companies are rising at double-digit rates; so does its rival, the Carlyle Group. Optimism among 29m small firms is near an all-time high.</p><p>Yet the test of capitalism is not just whether shareholders do well. It is whether everyone else benefits, too. To gauge if USA Inc is delivering, The Economist has taken its pulse in three ways: examining if investment is rising, whether employees are doing better and whether there is enough competition, which should cut prices and boost productivity.</p><h>There's something there</h><p>These are tricky questions. It is hard to untangle the effects of the recovery that had built up steam under Barack Obama, not to mention those of comparatively robust global growth, from those due to Republican policies. Nonetheless, our conclusion is that the government's new attitude to USA Inc is indeed delivering moderately better results for society than those seen for most of the previous dismal decade.</p><p>Yet this is hardly the sort of business boom that Mr Trump promised. The technology sector is dominating investment to an unprecedented degree. Patterns of competition are changing. Among industrial and small firms there is optimism, but little evidence of a big change in plans or prospects. And there is the prospect of a trade war to contend with--a threat Mr Trump escalated on May 23rd by setting the scene for tariffs on imports of cars and car parts.</p><p>The pre-Trump decade was in some ways yet more dire than the financial crisis and its aftermath might have led you to expect. Many explanations for this were offered. Lawrence Summers, a leading economist, worried about \"secular stagnation\", an excess of savings muffling growth. Robert Gordon, an economic historian, argued that today's innovations could never provide boosts to productivity like those from electrification, the internal-combustion engine and other breakthroughs of bygone years. Free marketeers, including this newspaper, fretted about a new age of monopolies. Regulation was held to blame by some, while others, including incumbent chief executives, blamed short-term investors. Plenty of ordinary Americans simply concluded that the system was \"rigged\".</p><p>However diverse the accounts of the problem, the Republican solution was simple: boost business confidence and get out of its way. Just 24 days after the election Mr Trump formed an advisory council stacked with corporate royalty. His inaugural address promised to \"harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.\" Mostly in concert, Congress and the White House prioritised tax cuts, deregulation, \"fair trade\", infrastructure and giving bosses access to Mr Trump, who imagines himself as the nation's chairman, banging heads together as appropriate.</p><p>The last two of these priorities have flopped. The federal government lacks the cash to rebuild crumbling roads, and while big investors pay lip service to creating new public-private partnerships, there is no sense of infrastructure being the real priority it should be. Mr Trump's business council, meanwhile, was disbanded after many members left, most notably when the president blamed both sides for clashes between the far-right and its opponents in Charlottesville last summer.</p><p>Seeking Mr Trump's personal patronage can be a precarious, humiliating affair. Hock Tan, the boss of Broadcom, a semiconductor firm then based in Singapore, appeared in the Oval Office on November 2nd, flattering the president. Mr Trump hugged him and called Broadcom \"really great\", but in March Broadcom's bid for Qualcomm, an all-American rival, was squelched on national-security grounds. What is more, given the president's continuing business interests and the behaviour of some of those around him, seeking his approval can lead to the whiff of corruption. In 2017 AT&amp;T, which is trying to buy Time Warner, paid Michael Cohen, Mr Trump's personal lawyer, $600,000 for advice. It now says it regrets this.</p><p>On tax, deregulation and trade, however, Congress and the administration have had an impact. The tax act passed in December lowered the headline corporate rate to average European levels, gave firms a temporary break on investments, limited taxes on new foreign profits and allowed firms to repatriate cash held in foreign subsidiaries at a low rate. The net saving for firms will be $100bn a year going forward, or 6% of 2017 pre-tax domestic profits. While deficit-hawks look on in disgust and tax experts grumble about fine print which is an utter mess, bosses are ecstatic.</p><p>On deregulation, the administration says that it enacted 60% less new economic regulation in its first year than the Obama administration did in 2009, and 38% less than George Bush's administration did in 2001. Bosses in some industries report that regulators are less abrasive, indeed amenable. For example the Treasury and financial supervisors have made the stress tests that banks face less elaborate, and on May 22nd the House passed a bill exempting banks with less than $250bn of assets from some rules (see Finance section).</p><p>The Federal Communications Commission has abandoned rules on cross-ownership of newspapers and broadcasters that it says were obsolete.Few firms talk much about the powerful Environmental Protection Agency: this may be because they are embarrassed to see any upside in the weakening of rules going on there, or because they are wary about exploiting them for fear they will be reimposed--or that the public will turn against them for doing so. With officials quitting regulatory agencies, funding drying up and lobbying rising, the quality of administration will in time almost certainly suffer. But it is pretty hard to find companies worried about that risk.</p><p>The last big policy change is trade. Many businessmen are not averse to a bit of protection if they can get it, especially when it comes to China. There are perhaps only a dozen American firms that make more than a billion dollars in annual profits from China each year. The members of this tiny club put on a brave face; Dennis Muilenburg, the head of Boeing, America's largest industrial exporter to China, has insisted that \"we have a seat at the table\".</p><p>More generally, most CEOs probably calculate that the costs of tariffs would mainly fall on consumers. A general lack of panic over the matter suggests that bosses mostly think the North American Free Trade Agreement will be renegotiated. One barometer is Kansas City Southern, a railway company that brings cars and parts across the Mexican border. After a slump in late 2016 its share price has recovered; its executives say there is little sign of big firms rejigging supply chains.</p><p>The Bank for International Settlements, a club of central banks, recently simulated the impact on the supply chains of 17 American industrial sectors of a 20% tariff on Chinese and Mexican goods. The median rise in costs was about 1%, and even the highest was just 2%--hardly fatal. And bear in mind that, over the 2010s, big American businesses became decreasingly global--at least as far as profits were concerned. Earnings from subsidiaries or sales abroad have barely grown since 2008, while margins have risen at home: foreign profits are now only 20% of the total, down from 32%.</p><h>Beyond shareholder value</h><p>So what of investment, competition and better pay? Consider business investment first. Economy-wide figures show an increase of 7% in the first quarter of 2018 compared with that of 2017. By historical standards, that is decent but not exceptional: investment grew at an average rate of 10% in the big surge of the mid-2000s. The real excitement comes from what big listed companies report. There, according to data from Bloomberg, total investment (capital spending and R&amp;D) rose by 19% in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the previous year (see chart 2). That is on a par with the giddy heights of 2007.</p><p>One quarter can be volatile. Another gauge is the budgets that big firms have set for 2018. For the largest 100 listed firms that have given public guidance, aggregate capital spending is set to rise by 10%. That would be on a par with the figures before the financial crisis.</p><p>At first glance the good newsappears broadly based, with almost two-thirds of the top 500 firms boosting their investment in the last quarter. Dig deeper, however, and you see that business investing has been transformed. Ten years ago the five largest spenders were old-economy stalwarts: AT&amp;T, Chevron, ExxonMobil, General Electric and Verizon (see chart 3). Now the top five are Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Intel and Microsoft. In the first quarter, tech firms accounted for 26% of the S&amp;P 500's market capitalisation, 31% of its investment and a staggering 47% of the absolute rise in that investment (see chart 4). Budgets for 2018 suggest a similar mix.</p><p>Tech firms don't just write code and hoard the proceeds. The share of their total gross cashflow that they reinvest has risen from 40% in 2010 to over 50%, similar to the level for non-tech firms. Almost half of their investment is in property, plant and equipment. Alphabet is pouring cash into data centres and a redevelopment of Chelsea Market in New York. Amazon is building out e-commerce fulfilment centres. Semiconductor firms are expanding plants that make chips for machine learning and autonomous cars. What's more, tech firms are also investing on behalf of ordinary companies by building cloud-computing capacity that is increasingly replacing other firms' in-house IT investments.</p><p>The picture for the economy as a whole--rather than just for listed companies--looks similar. Plenty of tech activity is not captured by the figures for investment in the accounts of listed tech firms, most notably venture-capital activity, capital spending done off-balance sheet by Amazon and Microsoft using leases and Netflix's relentless spending on its content library, which counts as an expense. Include all this and tech accounts for 20% of absolute business investment across the whole economy and 83% of the rise in the first quarter. Furthermore, some investment by non-tech firms is linked to the tech boom. FedEx and UPS, two distribution firms, are boosting investment at a double-digit rate, buying planes and building depots to cope with e-commerce.</p><p>Tech is not the only exceptional sector. Energy, too, is a special case, since spending tends to be influenced by the oil-price cycle, which has moved from despair in 2015 to optimism again this year and last. Though the oil majors are no longer in the investment top five, shale-energy firms are spending like billy-o.</p><p>Exclude the figures for tech and energy and \"traditional\" investment in the first quarter rose by 12%, with firms' budgets suggesting a rise of 5% for the whole of 2018--considerably less impressive. A typical example of restraint is Emerson, a big, 125-year-old industrial conglomerate. David Farr, its boss, has been an outspoken advocate of tax cuts as a way to revive manufacturing. Despite tax reform his company's capital spending budget in 2018 will be lower than in 2015, though higher than it was last year.</p><p>It is a similar story for investment by foreign firms: modest overall growth coupled with a big increase in sectoral specificity. Toyota and other companies eager to ingratiate themselves have advertised plans to build factories. But the overall picture is lukewarm. The number of foreign-backed greenfield projects (creating physical assets such as plants) announced in the first quarter of 2018 fell by 29% compared with 2017, according to fDi Markets, a data firm.</p><p>Inbound takeovers and venture-capital and private-equity investments, which ran at $6bn a week during Mr Obama's second term, picked up to $7bn a week after the election in 2016, and have risen as high as $10bn a week since the tax reform. However, the flow is heavily skewed towards intellectual-property-intensive industries such as tech and biotech. Five years ago these accounted for roughly a quarter of the total; now they are up to a half. Foreign firms are hot for America's ideas. They are tepid about its factory workers.</p><p>What is more, some foreign investors may find themselves shut out, as Broadcom was, as the government takes a new hard line on takeovers and investments in anything deemed strategic if there is Chinese money or influence involved.</p><p>The second big test for American business is dynamism: whether the pace of creative destruction is rising. The past two decades of profitable torpor have been an incumbent's paradise, with big firms getting bigger in two-thirds of industries and finding it easy to crank out high profits even in low-margin industries. This has discouraged investment and innovation, raised prices and squashed small firms.</p><p>Based on last year's data there is no evidence that this trend has reversed. Of the firms in the S&amp;P 500 with very high profits--which we define as a return on capital of over 20%, excluding goodwill--72% made similarly lavish returns ten years ago. But no one would expect such a trend to turn on a dime, and the picture going forward is a little more encouraging. This is probably thanks, in part, to the stiffening effect of Republican policy on animal spirits. But again it has more to do with a fundamental shift in the economy.</p><h>Not insane, just tech-centric</h><p>Various industries are being forced to change as digital competitors emerge, distribution and marketing shift online and price wars loom. Some companies will struggle. One way to judge how much there is to fight over is to look at firms which investors are worried about--those with market values at a low multiple of earnings, or that have seen their valuations drop a lot. Big food companies, asset managers, advertising agencies, broadcasters, drug distributors, telecoms firms and airlines fit this description. Together they account for about 10% of the total pool of abnormally high profits being made in America--a pool that increased competition would drain into more productive endeavours. Disruption could also spread into other cosy industries such as health care and credit cards.</p><p>Just as with investment, though, the nature of competition has changed, notes Hugo Scott-Gall, an investment strategist. Instead of a swarm of small firms attacking incumbents, the economy's main source of competition is less than a dozen tech firms. The most notable is Amazon; its boss, Jeff Bezos, says that \"your margin is my opportunity\". In that particular case, though, the government may be more hindrance than help; Mr Trump loathes Mr Bezos's Washington Post, and is apparently looking for ways to do him harm.</p><p>If rampant tech firms eat up all the abnormally high profits, they could drive margins down across the economy. But though the overall level of profits and investment might then look more normal than in the recent high-profit past, the economy producing those results would be very different. It would be based much more on the giant tech firms, increasingly dominant in terms of profitability as well as investment.</p><p>You would normally expect small firms to take some of the fight to big firms, especially when they are as confident as they tell market researchers that they are. But though the number of firms that are less than one year old has recovered from the lows it hit after the financial crisis, the latest figures (for the last quarter of 2017) show it no higher under Mr Trump than it was under Mr Obama. The mid-sized banks to which small firms tend to turn for money, and which have benefited from deregulation, show no signs of limbering up for a big burst of borrowing. A sample of ten such banks shows them budgeting average loan growth of just 5% in 2018. Tellingly, perhaps, the most prominent signs of vigour among small firms come via the tech giants: Amazon has over 1m small firms using its third-party sales platforms.</p><h>Not just growing, changing</h><p>What about the third test for American business under Trump: labour markets? The one-off bonuses for their staff that hundreds of firms announced in the weeks after the tax act did not even rise to the level of a statistical blip. But there are more reliable signs that the lot of the worker has been improving as the number of jobs rises and pay grows, especially in cyclical industries. The two industries where hourly pay rose fastest in April were construction and retail. The absolute pay bill for all firms rose by 5% in the first quarter compared with the previous year. The share of gross corporate profits that is paid to workers has risen to 78% from a low of 76% in 2014, which is something; but it is still below the 50-year average of 82%.</p><p>Although companies expect wages to continue to rise, there is no evidence that managers expect a big shift in the balance between capital and labour. Very few firms disclose their total wage bills, but the big ones that do seem relaxed about short-term pressure. Take Mr Dimon's firm, JPMorgan Chase. It employs a quarter of a million tellers, call-centre workers, administrators and bankers, and its pay bill had been flattish for the past six years. In the first quarter of 2018 it jumped by 7% compared with the previous year. Still, the bank recently told investors that overheads will fall relative to revenue in the medium term. Or consider UPS. Its pay bill rose by 9% in the first quarter, but sales rose faster. In April it introduced a voluntary retirement scheme to cap labour costs.</p><p>The tech-centricity of the investment uptick raises huge questions about how employees will fare. Tech investment could create, augment or substitute jobs. Some tech firms are labour-hungry; others are not. Amazon employs 11,000 staff per billion dollars of fixed capital, whereas for Facebook the figure is just 1,500.</p><p>For one possible future assume that the current shift in the mix of investment continues, with tech growing and some other firms shrinking, and that each firm keeps the same ratio of workers to capital. Over five years firms in the S&amp;P 500 would see total net fixed assets rise by 13% but payrolls shrink by 4%. A pessimistic scenario: not necessarily an outlandish one.</p><p>The biggest near-term worry is surely that the nine-year-old economic expansion has already lasted longer than most recoveries. Even without the threat of a trade war its days would be numbered. Chief executives hope that the Trump surge will last for at least a couple of years longer. That could see business investment rise to a share of GDP in line with the long-term average. But it would take ten years for wage bills to get back to normal on that basis, and 19-year recoveries do not happen in America.</p><p>There is also a worry that investors may decide they have overvalued tech, as they did at the turn of the century--though unlike 1999-2000 today's big tech firms are for the most part hugely profitable. Rising interest rates might dampen investment, too, although USA Inc's balance-sheet is in passable shape, as are its banks. Losing one or both houses of Congress in November is unlikely to prompt a spasm of re-regulation or tax increases.</p><p>For the moment, then, the Republicans have got something that looks like the surge they wanted. But the way investment and the power to disrupt are now concentrated makes it unlike any business boom before. And what those firms, and the technologies powering their success, will mean for employment, inequality and the shape of the economy remains opaque. It is far from clear that their impact will repair capitalism's legitimacy in the eyes of the American public. And it is certain that they will create a need for more thoughtful government policies than just \"Let business be business.\"</p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Retrieve Image</marker><locator><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-key\" value=\"vw201805260005\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"26393\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Retrieve Image</marker><locator><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-key\" value=\"vw201805260006\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"26393\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Retrieve Image</marker><locator><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-key\" value=\"vw201805260007\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"26393\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Retrieve Image</marker><locator><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-key\" value=\"vw201805260008\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"26393\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EIUVWS-vwvwmain20180526t1620000008xmlxml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EIUVWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SDC-X6J1-DYWT-T47K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253486</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3779\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2018 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.

The five biggest technology firms--Alphabet (Google's parent), Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft--have published financial results in recent weeks that put their combined quarterly revenues at $143bn. Yet this rude financial health conceals a more troubling long-term trend: governments, long willing to let internet firms act as they wish, are increasingly trying to tie them down.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This goes far beyond the latest row over sexism and tolerance of diverse political viewpoints in Silicon Valley, sparked by a memo written by a Google employee (see next article). Scarcely a week passes without a sign of the shift in attitudes. On August 1st Amber Rudd, Britain's home secretary, warned that unless the firms did more to block extremist content from their platforms, they would be forced to do so by new laws. Stephen Bannon, the chief strategist at the White House, reportedly wants to regulate Facebook and Google as utilities. Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary, has talked of taking action against Amazon because it allegedly does not pay its fair share of tax.</p><p>Under pressure from the Chinese government, Apple removed several \"virtual private networks\" (VPNs)--services that enable users to bypass China's censorship apparatus--from its local app store. In June Canada's Supreme Court ordered Google to stop its search engine returning a result advertising a product that infringed on a firm's intellectual property. And on August 9th it emerged that the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, which preserves old versions of edited web pages, has been blocked in India, apparently by order of the department of telecommunications.</p><p>The examples vary, but they amount to a significant change in the regulatory environment. When the internet went mainstream in the late 1990s, tech firms and most democratic governments embraced its global nature. Firms operated largely free from onerous rules (blocking pornography featuring children has been the main exception).</p><p>One reason is technological. It has become easier to enforce borders in cyberspace. Tools that use \"IP addresses\", the numbers that identify internet connections, have become much better at enabling online firms and regulators to work out where users are. The shift to smartphones has increased governments' power. App stores have local links, for example to payment services, which make it easier to monitor and control users' activity.</p><p>Meanwhile, as the internet has penetrated every aspect of life offline, incumbents from publishers to carmakers are coming to see the tech titans as a threat to their survival. Indeed, tech firms are easy targets for anyone worried about change. They employ relatively few people, and pay little tax. President Donald Trump does not see them as natural allies, as Barack Obama did. (Mr Obama's administration was packed with former Google employees.) Some governments are unsettled by the growing role in their national lives of firms whose values are distinctively American, in particular in their commitment to free speech ahead of privacy.</p><p>One consequence of governments' fading deference towards tech firms is a more muscular approach towards taxation. Apple is expected soon to put EUR13bn ($15.3bn) into an escrow account while courts consider its appeal against last year's ruling by the European Commission that the firm owed back taxes in Ireland, home to its European headquarters. Another consequence is public policies that pay little heed to their needs, for example on immigration. Mr Trump has complained that tech firms import foreign workers rather than hiring Americans, and has ordered a review of the rules governing work visas.</p><h>Shooting the messenger</h><p>For more than two decades internet platforms have largely been treated as intermediaries. They have been seen as more like telecom companies, which may transmit criminal material for which they are not liable, than media firms, which can be prosecuted or sued for what they publish. Now, governments in America and Europe are starting to hold them responsible for what their users do and say. Germany is the most striking example. From October 1st it will require social-media platforms to take down hate speech, such as Holocaust denial, within 24 hours or face fines of up to EUR50m.</p><p>Under Germany's law, the clock starts when firms are alerted by users or the authorities. But some governments are thinking of requiring firms to block some objectionable content as soon as it appears (as they already do with child porn). Britain's government, for example, wants them to block Islamist propaganda, such as videos of beheadings. It has ignored tech firms' complaints that this will be difficult and costly. Distinguishing such content from mainstream reporting on the war in Syria is harder than sifting out child porn. Automated techniques will block some legitimate content. Humans will often have to make the final decision.</p><h>Border control</h><p>Tech firms have been building barriers in cyberspace for some time. Their aim has been commercial: to keep users within \"walled gardens\" where it is easier to sell them services. But governments are also erecting borders--and theirs are more constraining. Like China, Russia plans to clamp down on VPNs. Both countries now require data on domestic users to be stored within their borders. Such data-localisation rules are a growing problem in democratic countries, too. In January the European Commission complained about \"unjustified restrictions on the free movement of data\" within the EU.</p><p>Even as the internet starts to fragment into local versions, some countries are trying to extend their legal reach beyond their borders. In the past internet firms would ignore requests from governments that sought to censor what people elsewhere saw online, for example requests originating in Thailand, with its stifling l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws that ban all criticism of its king. But now some democracies are passing extraterritorial laws that seek to regulate online content wherever it appears. \"We risk a heckler's veto, where any single country can get a piece of information removed not just within that country but anywhere around the world,\" says Alan Davidson, who served in Mr Obama's administration and is now a fellow at the New America Foundation, a think-tank.</p><p>The Canadian ruling against Google, which applies worldwide, could be just the start. Later this year the European Court of Justice will decide whether the EU's much-contested \"right to be forgotten\" applies not just to Google's European sites, but to all of them. This would mean that links to information about people that is deemed \"inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant\" in the EU will no longer be returned in response to any Google search anywhere. If the firm does not comply, it may face stiff fines.</p><p>The biggest long-term threat to tech firms is probably antitrust law. Regulators, particularly in America, have long held that online, competition is only a click away. But they are increasingly concluding that even in cyberspace competition can be restricted by dominant firms, for instance when the tech giants buy up smaller rivals before they mature into a threat, or discriminate against their offerings (for example, in search rankings). Governments have also started to fret about foreign data monopolies, which they think hoover up local information and turn it into valuable artificial-intelligence services.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given that Europe has produced no big digital platform of its own, such thinking is common in the EU. In June the European Commission hit Google with a EUR2.4bn fine for abusing its \"monopoly\" in online search. But elsewhere, too, regulators are becoming more active. In Japan the head of the Fair Trade Commission has warned that exclusive access to data could be used to restrict competition. Even in America, such thinking is gaining ground.</p><p>As tech giants build up their offline presence, they can expect regulatory scrutiny to increase still further. Though Amazon has so far got off lightly, its recent purchase of Whole Foods, an American grocer, is likely to change that. Amazon's fulfilment centres (warehouses from which products are shipped) have created hundreds of thousands of jobs; earlier this month it sought to hire 50,000 people across America in one day. That has given it brownie points with governments. But as more retail jobs are lost to e-commerce, and positions at Amazon become automated, the mood could shift. Amazon is not alone in venturing into the physical world. Google is experimenting with self-driving cars and Facebook with drones, which will bring new headaches and increased oversight.</p><p>The tech giants are not all equally vulnerable. As a legacy of the antitrust investigations it faced in the 2000s, Microsoft still has plenty of lawyers and lobbyists. It also comes under less scrutiny than Facebook and Google, which play a bigger role in consumers' daily lives. Both firms are now ramping up their lobbying operations, having seen how Microsoft only belatedly recognised the risks that accompany commercial dominance. Google, for example, has around 500 people in its public-affairs and regulatory team, only a handful of whom work from its headquarters in California. Many are based in Europe. \"Each company learns from the mistakes of those that went before,\" says Mr Davidson.</p><p>Complying with a proliferation of new laws means expanding local teams: Facebook is planning to have 650 \"moderators\" in Germany to enable it to respond to takedown requests within the stipulated 24 hours. Services and technical infrastructure are also becoming more fragmented. On August 4th it emerged that Google had agreed to tighten monitoring of terrorist and other offensive material on its YouTube video-sharing service in Indonesia. Amazon and Microsoft, for their part, have built data centres in certain jurisdictions, such as Germany, to be able to comply with data-protection rules.</p><p>The firms hope that funding local initiatives will help curb resentment. Google's \"Growth Engine for Europe\" aims, among other things, to help small businesses hone their digital skills. Facebook's \"Journalism Project\" will seek to fight fake news and to develop new subscription services with publishers, including Axel Springer, which played a big part in the campaign against Google in Europe. In October Microsoft published a book that could easily be mistaken for a political party's manifesto. It lists dozens of detailed public-policy recommendations, ranging from protecting privacy to fighting cybercrime. Amazon, which faced criticism a few years ago for its working conditions, has started offering public tours of its fulfilment centres in Europe.</p><h>Things fall apart</h><p>Governments sometimes have good reason to claim sovereignty over the digital realm. They are responsible for national security and elected to uphold national laws. But their regulatory push threatens to create a \"splinternet\", with national borders reproduced in cyberspace. That would harm the internet's function as an open forum where people can communicate freely and come up with new global products and services--which is precisely what made it great in the first place.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EIUVWS-vwvwmain20170812t1620000014xmlxml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EIUVWS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P76-84M1-DYWT-T0YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253486</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1890\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2017 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.

How the mighty have fallen</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Goldman Sachs's desire for a new identity captures the changes in global banking</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IN ITS PRIME Goldman Sachs was exceptional. Fifteen years ago, just before the global financial crisis, the bank easily outshone its Wall Street rivals--winning the most lucrative deals and making the most profitable trades. It printed money, both for shareholders and employees. Although the crisis imperilled the firm along with the rest of the banking industry, it navigated the chaos relatively well. Success allowed it to be haughty--while other banks engaged in the grubby game of sucking up to investors, Goldman remained secretive and enigmatic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How times have changed. This week the firm held its first investor day, led by David Solomon, who took over as chief executive last year. It comes after a long period of underperformance. A dollar invested in Goldman in 2010 would be worth just $1.60 today. A dollar wagered on the S&amp;P 500 would be worth $3.60, and on JPMorgan Chase, $4.10. Goldman has become a laggard.</p><p>Its predicament reflects two big changes in Western banking. One is the declining profitability of capital-markets activity, in large part the result of tighter rules, including higher capital requirements for riskier activity, penalties on lenders that rely on debt markets to fund themselves and tighter compliance regimes. The second is the rising importance of technology in the industry, as consumers and corporate borrowers shift to digital banking. This appears to give an immediate advantage to very large lenders that can support huge IT budgets, and to big tech platform firms that have vast numbers of customers who can be sold financial products, as is already the case in much of Asia.</p><p>Goldman has been on the wrong side of these trends. Consider its performance relative to JPMorgan Chase, a giant full-service firm. Goldman is still wrestling with past compliance mistakes--it is expected to pay billions of dollars in penalties for the 1MDB scandal in Malaysia. Its funding costs are higher than JPMorgan Chase's (1.95% compared with 1.25% in 2018). Its ratio of expenses to revenues is worse. Not surprisingly, its return on tangible equity, a measure of profitability, was just 11% in 2019, compared with 19% for its rival. For Goldman's shareholders the only consolation is that it has done better than Europe's flailing banks--in the most recently reported quarter Barclays managed 10%, Credit Suisse 9%, and Deutsche Bank made a loss.</p><p>Mr Solomon's new plan is, in part, to become more like JPMorgan Chase, with a broader range of services and funding. Goldman wants to expand Marcus, its fast-growing consumer arm, and also to build out its transaction-banking division that ships money around the world for companies. It plans to attract more deposits, which are typically the cheapest way to fund a bank. It has hired an army of tech experts. All this, Goldman hopes, will raise its return on tangible equity to 14%.</p><p>Goldman says it recognises the need for fundamental reform. It boasts of transforming its macho culture with a more diverse intake of recruits. But you can question how much it has really changed. It continues to allocate half its capital to its once-famed trading operation, despite its drab returns. And it still spends a lavish $12bn a year on rewarding its staff, even as the firm earned only $8bn for its shareholders in 2019. So far investors remain sceptical, with its shares priced at their book value.</p><p>If Goldman's reinvention fails it may ultimately have to do a deal. Uniting Wells Fargo and Goldman, for example, would create something more like JPMorgan Chase (and with a similar-sized balance-sheet). In America regulators and some politicians are sceptical about bigger banks. In Europe, where the industry is more desperate, the mood has already changed, with matchmaking now encouraged. At least Goldman's mergers-and-acquisitions advisers will be in on any action.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EIUVWS-vwvwmain20200201t1620000015xmlxml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EIUVWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3V-53T1-DYWT-T3JF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253486</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"662\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2020 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.

So --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CASONE:  You never are.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I got like four new bruises this morning.  Ladies, thank  you so much, great to see you both.  And I've already made James Freeman  laugh and it's 5:59 in the morning.</p><p>Hey everybody, I'm giving it away who's on the show this morning.  I'm  Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Thursday, August 30th.  Your  top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Looking good as we inch closer to the deadline tomorrow, officials from the  U.S. and Canada optimistic that a trade deal will be reached.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think Canada very much  wants to make the deal and I think it's going to be obviously very good for  Canada if they do and I think it's probably not going to be good at all if  they don't.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying a deal could be  reached only if it's good for Canada.  </p><p>Investors are still worried about trade but we have had day-after-day of  new all-time highs on the S&amp;P500, NASDAQ, and the Russell2000.  This  morning we have a picture that's lower to the downside, Dow Futures off by  844 points at the moment.</p><p>As I pointed out, we had record highs yesterday for your broad market  gauges hitting their fourth consecutive record close.</p><p>In Europe take a look at England, France, and Germany.  We have losses  across the board to tell you about.  The biggest loser at the moment is the  DAX in Germany, down about one percent.</p><p>Trade tensions between China and the U.S. weighing on the Asian markets, we  have slight gain on the Nikkei but Hong Kong, Shanghai and South Korea all  lower on the day.</p><p>A new round of U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods imported from  China set to hit later next month.  </p><p>Trump versus Google, the president of United States criticizing the search  giant for bias against conservative voices.  We'll show you the evidence  that Trump posted to back it up and we do have Google's response.</p><p>Salesforce selloff, shares of Salesforce sliding after the company's  earnings report we break down those numbers.  </p><p>And one for the books, the Green Bay Packers Quarterback Aaron Rodgers  signing a mega deal making him the highest paid NFL player.  We have the  details of the incredible deal.</p><p>Duck and cover, the world's biggest food fight, you won't believe how many  people were there to chuck tomatoes at one another.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning, National Security Analyst  Morgan Ortagus.  Borrowed Time Co-Author James Freeman.  Actually, that's  on my reading list.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I bought it on my Kindle.  And 32Advisors Founder and CEO, Fox  Business Contributor Robert Wolf.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Great.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Has clearly been on the golf course a lot.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  A little -- a little bit.  I mean, if you call my hacking  golf.  Yes. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well as much as your -- as much as you play, your game should be  good and better.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, it's not.  But I'm fun to play with.  I mean -- but the game is  not getting much better.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you were fun to spend a morning with us.</p><p>WOLF:  I'm glad to be here with James and Morgan and You.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And glad -- thanks for the --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Likewise.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thanks for the courtesy laugh at 5:58 in the morning.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I got to thank you for the book plug.  So you realize you don't  have to read it as long as you buy it.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  I'm reading it too.  I'm going to just say I'm reading it too  because I want to plug it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I am reading --</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I haven't bought it or read it but  I'll buy it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is about Citi Group.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is about the bubblelicious Citi Group, the rise and fall.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The rise and fall.</p><p>FREEMAN:  You're wondering their history and really strong bank before the  government was standing behind it.  Then once the government got behind it,  not such a good history.</p><p>WOLF:  Well as a former Salomon Brothers guy that was bought by Citi Group  that's now run by a former Salomon Brothers guy, I'm rooting for them.  So  I hope the book is rooting for them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well we're here --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, it's topped with fate.</p><p>WOLF:  How about that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As we will be all morning long and everything that we talk about  whether it's trade, the market, there was that debate last night between  the candidates for the governor of New York.</p><p>And also coming this morning, CFRA Investment -- Chief Investment  Strategist Sam Stovall.  Former White House Press Secretary, Fox News  Contributor, Ari Fleischer.  Senate Finance Committee Member, the Senator  one of two, from Pennsylvania, Pat Toomey.  Former Speaker of the House,  Fox News Contributor Newt Gingrich.  And SAPAmerica's President Jen  Morgan.</p><p>We have some incredible guests coming up.  But right here right now,  optimism on trade, both President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin  Trudeau sounding optimistic about reaching a trade agreement by tomorrow's  deadline.  The commander-in-chief commenting on the negotiation yesterday  at the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I think Canada very much wants to make the deal and I think it's  going to be obviously very good for Canada if they do and I think it's  probably not going to be good at all if they don't.  We have a very good  relationship.</p><p>They came yesterday to the White House and we negotiated late into the  evening, they're in the White House right now, we're negotiating with them  right now and they want to be part of a deal.  And we gave until Friday and  I think we're probably on track.  We'll see what happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do we get a deal by tomorrow James Freeman?  Here's my quote  that I wrote down from President Trump, \"I love Canada.  I love Mexico.\"   So there you go.  If he's sounding positive that way, it can't be bad.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  That is progress, isn't it?  And, yes, I think they get a  deal.  Remember, they don't have to agree on every phrase, every comma, and  period right now.  They just have to basically agree on where they're going  and they've got this timeline to move it through the various legislatures.  </p><p>But I think they will get a deal because although consumers aren't going to  necessarily like it to buy autos, the Canadian government likes what the  U.S. did with Mexico.  They liked these new efforts to keep manufacturing  in the U.S. and Canada versus Mexico.  So I think there's a lot of reason  for Canada to cut a deal and we buy 75 percent of their exports.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  To get into the ways because we love doing that Morgan, the two  sticking points for Canada -- the United States wants more access to the --  to selling dairy into Canada and then Canada wants to keep these existing  dispute resolution panels that are used to resolve conflicts about tariffs  among the three countries.</p><p>But that sounds like in the grand scheme of things, ideas that can be  resolved or problems that can be resolved.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I think you're right.  I think something else that this  administration has said that they want to resolve with Canada is I.P.  protections and that was -- that has been written into the new agreement,  the new proposed agreement with Mexico.</p><p>And the USTR has been actually quite tough on Canada's position on I.P. and  that's been a real sticking point for them in addition to dairy farmers.   The real challenge I see with all of this Dagen is that no matter what  comes -- no matter what happens whether it's just a deal with Mexico or  whether it's fully renegotiated NAFTA, this is going to slip into 2019.</p><p>For congressional approval you'll need -- they'll need approval from both  the House and the Senate.  Clearly there's a chance that we're looking at  least the Democrat House.  So the strategy there, you know, will the --  will the democrats especially someone like Bernie Sanders who supported a  trade agenda similar to the president, will they support this or leading up  to 2020?  Are they going to oppose this deal just simply because it's  something that Donald Trump negotiated?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well let's ask this big old democrat.</p><p>WOLF:  Well listen, I think I've been to the right of the conservative  party on trade because I've been for TPP, I've been for iterating NAFTA.   So I don't mind as a former advisor to the president on export counsel, I'm  a supporter of this.</p><p>I think the president trying to do NAFTA2.0 is a good thing.  If we can  iterate, OK, where there's better labor standards in Mexico that brings the  pricing up, so we're not -- cheap labor is not the beneficiary of kind of  the detriment to the U.S., those are good things.</p><p>That being said, whether it's tomorrow or a week from tomorrow, or a month  away, I think we should just make sure we get the best possible deal, OK,  for both sides.  That can, you know, stand the time.  That being said, we  should also, you know, make changes throughout.  </p><p>One of the problems with NAFTA1.0 is we haven't really changed it in over  two decades.  So this is important to have the right changes, it seems like  it's in the right trajectory, and it certainly seems with Chrystia Freeland  their trade minister flying back immediately to try to do something is a  good sign.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  She was scheduled to go to Europe to --</p><p>WOLF:  She -- right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- this week and she said, \"Hey, I'm staying in North America  and head south.\"</p><p>WOLF:  And as far as the dems, you know, what I would say is that if it's a  -- if it's a good agreement between Canada and Mexico, just not bilateral  with Mexico, I actually think it will pass both the House and the Senate.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well they need that for fast-track status.</p><p>WOLF:  I think it will pass the boat.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need that for fast-track status.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  In addition to what Robert said about labor, there's also new  rules on the environment, also on I.P. protection as we talked about.  So I  think there's some positive things that both parties could look to but the  Journal did criticize this as, you know, Dagen, they called it,  \"Politically managed trade.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  \"The economic logic is the opposite of Mr. Trump's domestic  deregulation agenda.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well the headline was --</p><p>FREEMAN:  True.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- it is notably worse than NAFTA, the original NAFTA in many  ways.  And you talk about the -- how they were court in the likes of  Sherrod Brown in Ohio and Sherrod up for re-election this year.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Again, that this reads like something that democrats wrote  or maybe even the auto unions, the original Mexico deal.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think it may be hard for people like Sherrod Brown to  turn this down because it does move in his direction.  And for that reason  I think that we should expect auto consumers are going to pay more.  </p><p>This is sand in the gears of the North American supply chains that have  made it much more competitive here.  It is -- it is not so great for Mexico  but good for Canada and the U.S. auto sector in terms of unionized labor  there.  </p><p>So that's -- look, but I -- there's no reason in the world the president if  he gets something on dairy should not give Canada what they want a dispute  resolution because once he gets the NAFTA he wants, he doesn't need to put  on any more tariffs.  So there's no reason he shouldn't be able to --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Give up -- give on them.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- give on that issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have $650 million dairy trade surplus with Canada.  So  there's -- you know, it's a great talking point on the campaign trail.  But  the fact is that we benefit mightily from imports into Canada --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  But we'd sell a lot more if they didn't have the barriers  they have.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very, very -- well, I want to move -- I want move along to  China.</p><p>WOLF:  Listen -- sorry, go ahead Dagen.  That's how (INAUDIBLE) move to.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  China's commerce ministry saying today that trade issues with  the U.S. can only be resolved through talks as equals.  So do we see China  getting ready for a drawn-out fight where certainly businesses in this  country that whether they export to China, whether they import goods from  China or watching that $200 billion mark that China -- that the United  States is talking about, additional tariffs on that.</p><p>As the Wall Street Journal Editorial Page today writes about how because of  retaliatory tariffs, the cherry farmers in the Pacific Northwest have lost  $86 million on sweet cherries just this summer, James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  This has cost.  I mean, I -- when we talk about optimism  for getting a deal here, it's not that I think these deals are all  wonderful.  Higher tariffs, more barriers are a negative as we're seeing in  NAFTA.</p><p>I hope he -- the president focuses on his message to the E.U. which is  let's take tariffs down to zero everywhere, that ought to be the goal.  I  think this is going to take a while with China to resolve it but I think if  he resolves NAFTA and he resolves it with Europe and you have them, the  whole world focused on China and its intellectual property theft, I think  China is eventually going to have to change.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick and then I'll get your comments on China and Europe  because you mentioned Europe yesterday because Harley-Davidson has been a  punching bag for the president.  It was celebrating its 115th anniversary  in Wisconsin yesterday.</p><p>The American motorcycle maker coming under fire from the president because  it said, \"Hey, we got retaliatory tariffs from Europe, we're going to move  some production overseas.  Harley owners and Trump supporters sounded off  at an event.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEANNA KYROLE, HARLEY-DAVIDSON SUPPORTER:  It is about bottom line and if  he was controlling his business he would be doing the same thing, if not  worst.  At least they're trying their best to keep everything at home.  </p><p>MARTY GERNOWSKI, TRUMP SUPPORTER:  I'm proud to have Harley here in  Milwaukee and if they have to do what they have to do for a profit and make  price in another country, then so be it.</p><p>DAVID GULOTTA, HARLEY-DAVIDSON &amp; TRUMP SUPPORTER:  Harley-Davidson has  survived for 115 years, you know.  Through a lot -- through a lot more  adverse situations than what they're dealing with right now, you know.  The  motor company will survive, I have faith in that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That just shows Robert that regular folks in this country voters  whether they're right, left, or center, they are connected to what's going  on with trade.</p><p>WOLF:  Listen, tariffs have unintended consequences.  The idea that we're  battling with Europe, OK, is absurd, OK?  The truth is and I think as James  pointed out and Morgan, our real concern is China.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>WOLF:  I brought it up earlier and you've been bringing it up for a year  now, we should stay in TPP and we should -- the best way to attack China is  to have trading agreements with the 11 countries around China, Australia,  New Zealand, Philippines.</p><p>The idea that we dropped TPP because it was an Obama-led trade agreement is  ridiculous, it's not the right thing.  And my gut tells me if you look at  what we're doing with Mexico and Canada, it actually is very similar to  TPP.  It's about labor standards, environmental standards.</p><p>My gut tells me that will be the next thing we go after because a bilateral  negotiation with China is not around the corner.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  Because it's all about -- as Morgan said it has to do with I.P.,  that's our biggest concern.  There is nothing in the trade agreement that's  going to withstand they are stealing our I.P.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Final word Morgan.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Well I think in addition to I.P. it's also about investment,  right?  And the type of restrictions on U.S. investment into China and what  has always been incredibly worrying to me, Dagen, is, you know, the amount  of Chinese communist propaganda that the regime makes American corporations  spew put out on their social media when they do business there and that  should be a concern for all American businesses.</p><p>And this -- also the shady nefarious tactics of the Chinese government in  the country, they'll put out misinformation about American companies that  are doing business there to turn people away from and they've done it --  done it before and there's a lot that we don't see in terms of them  retaliating against us, it's not just here on our shore.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you Morgan, James, Robert.  Oh boy, we've got so much to  talk about.  Salesforce sliding, shares of the business software maker  taking a hit after strong earnings but a weak outlook.  We'll tell you what  the company CEO had to say too about taxes.</p><p>And food fight, thousands turning out for Spain's massive tomato throwing  festival, we've got the incredible pictures and we demo in studio.   Straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  People in Arizona saying goodbye to the late Senator John McCain  at the State Capitol.  Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Dagen, good morning.  There were about 15,000 people came to  pay their respects to the late senator who served the state for 36 years in  Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JON KYL, FORMER ARIZONA SENATOR:  John's love for America and Arizona.  He  represented our values all over the world as senator from Arizona and  America is stronger for his fierce defense of our values.  We can be proud  he was our senator.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Today a memorial service will be held at the North Baptist Phoenix  Church where former -- North Phoenix Baptist Church, excuse me, where Vice  President Joe Biden is scheduled to speak and 24 sitting senators are going  to be attending as well.</p><p>Then his casket will depart Arizona and head for Washington.  More services  planned later this week.  </p><p>Well, Campbell Soup says that it plans to sell its international and  refrigerated food businesses which bring in about $2.1 billion, this  transaction will bring in that much.  And this move opens the door to an  outright sale of the company that sold possibility.  </p><p>Campbell Soup CEO Denise Morrison unexpectedly stepped down back in May,  there's been a lot of pressure from shareholders on Campbell to do  something.  They're also going to be reporting the -- excuse me, they did  beat on earnings and missed on revenue this morning.  Shares of Campbell  super low in the pre-markets.</p><p>You've got the breaking news and you've got the earnings as well pressuring  Campbell Soup.  The stock is down more than a four and a quarter percent  right now.  </p><p>Well, we're also watching Salesforce right now.  The company's results  coming in better than expected but the stock is under pressure this morning  after they issued a disappointing earnings outlook for the third quarter.</p><p>Co-CEO Mark Benioff also touting President Trump's tax cuts and  deregulation.  But the stock is down about three percent right now in the  pre-market.  This is the stock to watch today as well when the bells ring  at 9:30.  </p><p>And then there is this, 20,000 people hurling tomatoes at each other at  Spain's annual Tomatina Festival yesterday.  This is known as the world's  largest food fight.  More than 30,000 pounds of tomato were thrown.  For  one hour people tossing each other with all of those, by the way, overripe  tomatoes Dagen.  </p><p>And I like -- I like your thinking this morning that we should, you know,  try and replay this in studio, you know, do our own version of a food  fight.  I'll work on that for the next hour.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, that's a Tuesday afternoon at my place.</p><p>CASONE:  I think it looks fun.  I wish I'd do it.</p><p>WOLF:  A little animal house action.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>WOLF:  A little animal house action won't hurt anyone.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I'm not going to do Robert Wolf.  Guess what I am?  A  scene from animal house.  Cheryl, thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, slamming big tech, President Trump targeting Google.  Bernie  Sanders takes aim at Amazon.  We'll tell you about it ahead.  </p><p>Plus, Friends fashion.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOEY TRIBBIANI:  OK buddy boy, here it is.  You hide my clothes, I'm  wearing everything you own.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So did Balenciaga take a cue from Joey?  You won't believe how  much this layered look will cost you.  It is an eye-popping price tag,  that's ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wall Street rally, stocks surging.  The S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ  hitting all-time highs for the fourth day in a row.  The technology sector  and optimism over trade negotiations driving the major market gauges to  those new highs including the Russell2000.</p><p>Here now Sam Stovall, CFRA Research Chief Investment Strategist.  Sam, how  are you?</p><p>SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Good, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  Your reaction to this?  The question in every  investor's mind is can this market keep going?  What would get in the way?</p><p>STOVALL:  Oh, I think it can.  First though we have a trifecta of new  highs, the S&amp;P500, NASDAQ, Russell2000.  So when you've got that kind of  breath, when you have the widening out of the participation in this rally,  that tends to be pretty good.</p><p>We also recouped all that we lost in the correction from January 26th to  February 11th.  History basically says we go on to advance by almost nine  and a half percent on average and we don't stumble again for another four  months.  So not to say that that's exactly how it's going to play out this  time but usually when you hit a new all-time high that tends to add to  investor confidence.</p><p>WOLF:  So just to play devil's advocate, although I'm rooting for the bull  market, let's go back to our earlier years, you know, this reminds me a lot  of 2000.</p><p>STOVALL:  OK.</p><p>WOLF:  OK?  In 2000, we -- that was the last time -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yikes.</p><p>WOLF:  Are you saying yes?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I was saying yikes.  </p><p>WOLF:  OK.  You'll see where I'm going with it then.  In 2000 that was the  last time consumer confidence was this high, OK?  So we had the highest  since 2000 announced last week.</p><p>We were on the incredible trajectory and then all of a sudden 2000 comes  and we had a two-year down trade, you know, starting with the dot.com  bubble.  It was all kind of, you know, a one-way direction and then all of  a sudden we had the turn.</p><p>My question is, long-winded, do you think with the raising rate  environment, you know, fiscal deficit concerns and possibly based on where  the yield curve is, the possibility of a slowdown based on what, you know,  the yield curve's at least predicting for GDP.  Does that change kind of  your horizon and thoughts at all?</p><p>STOVALL:  I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hey, at least he admitted that.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I admitted it.</p><p>STOVALL:  I'm kidding you.  I'm kidding you.</p><p>WOLF:  Don't forget here because, you know, James caught me off track --</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm sorry I interrupted.  </p><p>WOLF:  -- with the yikes.  Did I talk about your book yet?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Go ahead.</p><p>STOVALL:  No, those are good questions.  First off, we're the second most  expensive bull markets since World War II with trailing earnings being, you  know, above the long-term average.  Also on an S&amp;P500 market cap to nominal  GDP, we're more than twice as high as the average over the past 50 years.</p><p>WOLF:  This is kind of like a softball for you right now.</p><p>STOVALL:  Well -- but then comma, I think that we probably could --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Semicolon, next thought.  Go ahead.</p><p>STOVALL:  Well I got good grammar than most but my punctuation is pretty  bad.  I think that we probably still have some life left because we have  never slipped into a bear market in the past 65 years when interest rates  were below inflation where they are today.</p><p>We'd have to see at least two more rate hikes before we even equal the  year-on-year change in core CPI.  And then we would have to have three more  rate hikes next year just to get close to that threshold at first we -- the  threat of falling into a bear market.</p><p>So I still think that monetary policy is quite simulative at this point and  with the Fed basically telling us what they're going to do, I'd like to say  that a boxer is rarely fell by the punch he expects and at least it's not  going to come from the Fed.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And I guess comparing the 2000 hoping maybe this isn't a reefed,  you don't really see this sort of peps.com phenomenon of lots of non- companies that are public even though they're not really businesses and  don't have real earnings.</p><p>STOVALL:  True.  You're not really seeing the exuberance that typically  bull markets look like incandescent light bulbs and tend to glow right just  before they go out.  So I'm not getting the questions from the newspaper  vendors as to, \"Gee, what stocks should I be buying or them telling me what  stocks to buy?\"</p><p>So I agree, it's still -- investors are very skeptical about this events.   And so as a result, it might have some life left.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they are willing to beat the, you know what, the stuffing  out of a stock like Facebook.  </p><p>STOVALL:  Oh sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But when it misses and gives guidance that investors were  shocked by, I know that Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft all hit new all-time  highs yesterday but they're not buying every tech stock hand-over fist to  your point.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And I wonder about the techs.  I mean I look at regulation as  probably good for the giants, they end up benefiting from it but do you  look at that as a negative?  Does that make you worried about these stocks  we're talking about, the fangs?</p><p>STOVALL:  Well the -- I mean the fangs in opinion are very difficult from  tech in general.  Typically, tech is the best performing sector in a rising  rate environment because they have the lowest dividend yields combined with  companies need to add to their technology to improve the productivity of  their -- of the employees that they're not going to be adding on to in the  future.</p><p>But I would say look toward the value side, if we see more gravitation,  more interest in value stocks that implies and investors think that there's  life and that they could actually sit with them for a little while while  they recover.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sam Stovall, great to see you.</p><p>STOVALL:  Thanks Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And thanks for the humor this morning before 6:30.  Coming up,  taking on technology, speaking of that, James mentioned more regulation or  even some regulation on technology companies.  President Trump renewing his  attacks on Google, why he says that the platform is biases.</p><p>And every day heroes, a police body camera capturing a dramatic rescue at  sea.  One of the rescued men refusing to leave his fishing rod behind, we  have that story coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Thursday, August 30th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>In looming deadline, trade talks with Canada, kicking off again, this  morning, President Trump expressing optimism that Canada will join the new  trade deal with Mexico before tomorrow's deadline.  </p><p>Checking the market action this morning, amid these trade talks, we have an  89-point loss on the Dow Futures right now, Futures are lower on the S&amp;P  and NASDAQ 100 as well, but yesterday, more records coming out of these  markets, the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, hitting all-time highs, along with the  Russell 2000.</p><p>In Europe, markets are lower this morning, losses in England, France and  Germany, to tell you about, the DAX down nearly one percent.</p><p>And then, also, let's check on Asian markets, losses across the board  except for a very, very slight gain on the Nikkei in Japan.</p><p>Slamming Silicon Valley, President Trump, calling out Google, saying that  the search giant promoted President Obama's State of the Union speeches on  the site, but not his own, the President, speaking out about the tech  company, yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat  Conservatives and Republicans very unfairly.  I think it's a very serious  problem because they're really trying to silence a very large part of this  country and those people don't want to be silenced.  It's not right.  It's  not fair.  It may not be legal.  But we'll see.  We just want fairness.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How Google is responding, that's next.  An incredible rescue,  more video of this police officer saving three men from the water after  their boat capsizes.  We will show you that.  </p><p>And one for the record books, we'll tell you about the jaw-dropping  contract extension for quarterback Aaron Rodgers, that will make him the  highest paid player in NFL history.</p><p>And please call the Fashion Police, where is Joan Rivers when you need her?   Balenciaga unveiling a jacket with -- well, that looks like this, it looks  like one shirt on top of a shirt, on top of a coat, on top of a sweatshirt,  and it costs thousands of dollars, literally.  We will tell you -- you have  to stay with us, why people are comparing this style to Joey from Friends.</p><p>But to our top story this half hour, Trump versus tech, the President  making it clear that he wants fairness for Conservatives from major  technology companies like Google and Facebook.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat  Conservatives and Republicans very unfairly.  I hear that they're holding  hearings in Congress over the next couple of weeks.  </p><p>And I think it's a very serious problem because they're really trying to  silence a very large part of this country and those people don't want to be  silenced.  It's not right.  It's not fair.  It may not be legal.  But we'll  see.  We just want fairness.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Google firing back after President Trump tweeted a video in  which he claims Google's homepage did not promote his State of the Union  Address, even though President Trump -- President Obama's was highlighted.</p><p>Here to discuss, Former White House Press Secretary, FOX News Contributor,  Ari Fleischer.  We talk about this on a business show because if this White  House is going to move to regulate the tech companies because of some of  its obvious bias, this is in dispute that would hurt business.  What do you  say, Ari?</p><p>ARI FLEISCHER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Look, I don't mind politicians who  occasionally throw high inside heat.  Sometimes you need to do a little bit  of that to make your people who oppose you in politics, back off a little  bit, give you more fair coverage.</p><p>But once it crosses the line with the government trying to regulate speech  or regulate private sectors right to publish things, that's where I draw a  line.  So if he's throwing inside heat, God bless him, have at it.  Don't  hit the batter, though, and don't regulate.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Morgan, you said the President, yesterday, did say he prefers  not to pursue regulation of the internet giant.  They're already -- it  would be the DOJ, the FTC or the FCC that could add additional regulation.</p><p>There are other things that the White House could do, but again, this at  the moment.  Just looks like a lot of talk.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I think where the tech companies are right now is similar to  where the banks were during the financial crisis, right?  In terms of a  complete --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Meaning a government bailout?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  No, no, no.  Not a government bailout, in terms of a regulatory  perspective, not understanding where the winds are turning from both  parties, right?  And not getting out ahead of a lot of these stories.  </p><p>And I think they continue to be the big media companies -- tech companies,  tend to be, especially social media, incredibly reactive still.  And I call  for them -- I know you, Dagen, have as well, to start enforcing more self- regulatory measures, because if they don't, the government will regulate  for them.</p><p>FLEISCHER:  But let me stipulate, the government has no idea how to get  this right (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>ORTAGUS:  That will stop them, Ar.</p><p>FLEISCHER:  Once you put a bunch of politicians in charge of speech in the  tech industry, Facebook, Twitter, Google, it's going to turn into a fight  over who gets the biggest political advantage as opposed to how to protect  the most free speech.  The cure for bad free speech is more free speech.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Can I -- can I just respond that --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Google did respond by saying and calling the President out that  he was actually inaccurate.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, here's what the Wall Street Journal writes today.  Looking  at the internet archive, this is that not -- non-profit that preserves  historical snap shots.  It appears to show that Google.com did promote  President Trump's State of the Union at certain points during this year's  speech and not at others.</p><p>There's several snapshots of the page that don't show promotion of the  speech.  But, again, there does appear to be some promotion of the State of  the Union.</p><p>FLEISCHER:  And I think it's fair, somebody needs to run it down to see  whether or not Google promoted Trump as much as they promoted Obama.  What  the President put on Twitter was very clever.  That video he had with  Google promoting Obama, Obama, Obama, no Trump, very well done.</p><p>But is it accurate?  Is it fully accurate?  I don't know that yet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get James in here real quick. </p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm wondering, sort of, what you're hearing in terms of  discussions within the administration.  Because I think President Trump  deserves a lot of credit for -- and his administration as appointees for  not letting the FCC become the internet regulator, the way they regulated  telephones.</p><p>Now, it seems this idea that oh, we'll have the FTC, another federal  bureaucracy become the internet regulators, kind of, gaining ground here.   I could see a lot of these big companies wanting to do a deal.  Are you --  how worried should we be about this?  Because I'm very concerned, I don't  know how fast you think this thing is coming down the pike.</p><p>FLEISCHER:  I think the true motivation for the White House is with all  things, is protecting the President and protecting his image, because when  you look at social media generally, Twitter, Facebook, it's biased against  Republicans, it's biased against the President.</p><p>Everybody sees it, and knows it, and feels it.  So, he's throwing back in  trying to get them to modify their behavior by dealing with Donald Trump.   Oh, it does, which is blowing the whistle in public.  </p><p>There's a big difference between a public official blowing a whistle and  signing a law.  And he's right to blow a whistle.  I don't want to see him  sign a law because the government will botch it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and also, we talked about -- there is obvious bias.  Some  of us have experienced or at least witnessed it in terms of Conservative  speech on the social media platforms in particular.  The bigger issue -- </p><p>And I've been warning these tech companies for literally, years, is the  reckless disregard for people's privacy and how these companies actually  make money off of our most personal information.  And how they have  essentially handed it off to companies and app developers, Facebook did for  years, we didn't even know about it.</p><p>FLEISCHER:  Anybody who is on those platforms and puts their personal  information on it and doesn't expect it to be shared is being naive.  Once  you tell everybody who your likes are, what your interests are, it's going  to be shared.  That's how they market it, that's how when you go on to  Amazon, your product that you want to buy is already pulled up for you.   There are also benefits to it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, so you can't claim ignorance.  You have to -- you have to  be aware of what -- if you're getting something for free, it's not for  free.  You just don't know how you're paying for it.</p><p>FLEISCHER:  You want privacy, don't go online.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Ari.  You know what, if you want  privacy, don't walk the city streets nowadays because everybody's got a  camera phone.  You better be careful about cursing at somebody.  Not you.   I'm just saying in general.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Are you serious, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can't yell, you can't -- you can't yell anymore, not in the  street.  Speaking of New York and people yelling at each other, there was  this bizarre back and forth between New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and  candidate Cynthia Nixon in the first New York gubernatorial debate, just  watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW CUOMO (D), GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK:  My opponent lives in the world of  fiction.  I live in the world of fact.  Can you stop interrupting?  Can you  stop interrupting?</p><p>CYNTHIA NIXON (D), GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, NEW YORK:  Can you stop lying?</p><p>CUOMO:  Yes, as soon as you do.</p><p>NIXON:  We already have a corrupt corporate Republican in the White House.   We don't need a corrupt corporate Democrat in Albany, as his main  opposition.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Cuomo also doubling down on the Democratic talking point of  abolishing immigration and customs enforcement, ICE.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CUOMO:  New York State is the state that is suing Donald Trump for ripping  babies from the arms of their mother.  New York State is the state that  says we will not cooperate with ICE, they're a bunch of thugs.  He  politicized ICE.  They're a bunch of thugs.  We said we will sue them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the left going further left, Ari.  What did you make of  that?</p><p>FLEISCHER:  I think if I'm a law enforcement officer anywhere, local cop,  sheriff, state police trooper, I'm offended, thugs, because they're  enforcing the law and doing their jobs?  I hate politicians who talk like  this.  It is so offensive to the people who protect us.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Cynthia Nixon has pushed him further left on this, don't you  think?</p><p>FLEISCHER:  Well, that's the problem, and he's caving.  Cynthia Nixon says  she wants to abolish ICE.  So, Cuomo has to act tough too, so he says  they're thugs, wrong.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Cynthia Nixon is right about one thing.  She said that air  conditioning is sexist.  And considering Dagen and I are always freezing  (INAUDIBLE) Cynthia Nixon is right, air conditioning is sexist.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Politics is local.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about a dose of what it's like to be in front of a live  audience and there were supporters of Cynthia Nixon when he was bringing up  like you live in the world of fiction, basically making fun of her  television and acting career, that they booed him.  You would hear it.</p><p>FLEISCHER:  Can I go back to what you said?  Can I make you wear this tie?   I mean, it's terrible.  We need a colder studio.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, and we need -- we need better leadership in New York State.   And I know -- we didn't see it last night.  Coming up -- thank you, Ari  Fleischer, thank you for the humor, so early in the morning.</p><p>We tell you which state may soon become the first to mandate women on  corporate boards.  </p><p>And then, this shirt on shirt on jacket on sweatshirt, how much it will  cost you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  California lawmakers taking a step to bring diversity to  boardrooms, more chicks, they say, they mandate by law.  Cheryl Casone has  more.  Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  You know, interesting -- I mean, certainly you may see more  females in the boardroom or CEO, but lawmakers in California is taking this  all a step further.  They may soon require major companies that are  headquartered in California have to put female directors on the board.   Under this proposed law, boards will need to have at least one woman by the  end of next year and at least two or three by the end of 2021.  Those who  don't will be fined.  The law recently passed the state assembly and now  heads back to the state senate and then the desk of Governor Jerry Brown.   We'll keep you posted.  </p><p>And then there is this, a dramatic rescue off of a Florida's coast.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is everybody accounted for?  I want to get everybody on  the boat.  Can you swim?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Grab the life ring.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, that boat capsized.  Police on Miami Beach released this body  cam footage that shows three brothers that were rescued after their boat  capsized.  They had no life jackets on, by the way.  Police believe that  the boat was flipped by rough waters.  </p><p>And then, a little n nostalgia for you, Dagen.  Remember this scene from  \"Friends\"\"  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK, buddy boy, here it is.  You hide my clothes, I'm  wearing everything you own.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Well, it seems that fashion designer Balenciaga has taken  inspiration from Joey of all people.  At Paris fashion week, the company  debuted this heavily layered jacket.  If it is for you, it's $9,000.  As  you can see, it's got an outer coat, it's got layers, it's got a hoodie,  it's like five different jackets.  And then they also released this, this  is kind of strange, red squared shoes.  So, people on social media say it  looks like a carton of McDonald's French fries.  These are $545.  I mean,  you can't make this stuff up.  That jacket reminds me, Dagen, of a guy that  tried to go through TSA security wearing all of these clothes so he  wouldn't have to check a bag.  Remember that?  This is what it reminds me  of.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But this is increasingly -- particularly what these fashion  houses and women's fashion designers, it's like they're playing a joke on  women.  They're trying to see how foolish people will be with their money.   It's literally $1,000 ripped gray sweatshirt.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Well, I was just thinking that because air conditioning is  sexist, I need this jacket.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I think they're playing a joke on men too, aren't they?  That  looks like the derelict campaign.  </p><p>WOLF:  Listen, Steve Bannon was wearing that outfit for a year and no one  said -- he had like four layers.  He had the shirt, the under shirt, the --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That officially -- you saying that will end that trend.  It  ended right now because -- </p><p>WOLF:  I'm telling you, Bannon was wearing five or six layers.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sister, sister.  Serena and Venus set to square off in round  three of the U.S. Open.  We've got the preview.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Green Bay Packers Quarterback Aaron Rodgers has a lot of green  coming his way.  Jared Max has information on a record-setting contract  extension.  Hey, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Dagen, suffice to day,  it's a beautiful day in Mr. Rodgers neighborhood.  Set to begin his 14th  season of the NFL.  Rodgers signs a four-year extension that reportedly  could be worth in the Mr. Rodgers neighborhood of $180 million.  The  breakdown, $134 million in base salary.  $103 million of which is  guaranteed an NFL record and a league high annual average of $33.5 million.  </p><p>We're going to see something tomorrow at the U.S. Open that we have not  seen in over 20 years.  Serena Williams won her second-round match at the  U.S. Open on Wednesday in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2.  Earlier, Serena's older  sister Venus won her second-round match also in straight sets.  And so, it  will be an all sister affair.  Tomorrow in flushing meadows not since  January of 98, had the Williams sisters met this early in a grand slam  tournament.  Serena has won 17 of her 29 head to head matchups.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Go, Williams sisters.  My favorite athletes of all time.   Continue.  </p><p>MAX:  Defending Champion Rafael Nadal moved into the third round with a  straight sets win, Wednesday night.  However, 2012 champ, Andy Murray is  done.  He was eliminated in four sets by Fernando Verdasco.  </p><p>All right, let's cycle over to Major League Baseball.  The operative word  here is \"cycle.\"  When a player hits for a single, a double, a triple and  home run of the same game, he hits for the cycle.  Which is what the  Brewers' Christian Yelich did against the Reds.  He homered for the sixth  time in his many games, and Milwaukee beat Cincinnati in 13 innings -- 13- 12 or 10 innings, I should say.  </p><p>Last in national league attendance for likely 13th time in 14 years, the  Miami Marlins promise more noise at games next season.  The team encourages  its fans to get loud, bring musical instruments, bells, and whistles, and  flags to games next year.  The team says it offers the region's diverse  Latin American culture to show pride, get loud an in one section of the  ballpark.  It will be called communidad tres, sero, cinco -- Community 305.  </p><p>Baseball and Budweiser, how about baseball and wine?  Yes.  Partnering with  City Winery, the New York Yankees have opened a wine bar at Yankee stadium,  which in addition to other wines and (INAUDIBLE) will offer Yankees'  branded wines.  City Winery's first permanent winery at sports stadium.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love it.  Jared, thank you so much.  And I'll shout out to the  Williams sisters again.  Jared Max with us.  Straight ahead, Uber now  looking to drone for food delivery.  We'll tell you about it.  That's on  the next hour of MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.

I'm Dagen  McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It is Thursday, August 30th.</p><p>Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Almost there as tomorrow's deadline looms.  President Trump optimistic that  the U.S. will reach a trade deal with Canada.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They want to be a part of  the deal, then we gave until Friday and I think we're probably on track.   We'll see what happens, but in any event things are working out very well.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau stressing that there will  only be a deal if it's good for Canada.  But Trump says \"I love Canada.  I  love Mexico.\"</p><p>Investors still showing concern over trade.  We have a 65-point loss on the  Dow futures.  Markets -- the gauges here lower across the board but  yesterday let us remind everybody, the Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 and Russell hit new  all-time highs for the fourth straight trading day.</p><p>In Europe we have some selling to tell you about in England, France and  Germany. But the DAX was down almost 1 percent earlier in the session.   Right now it's only off one-third of a percent.</p><p>Trade tensions between China and the U.S. weighing on Asian markets  overnight.  The major gauges there closing mostly lower.  A slight gain on  the Nikkei in Japan is the only upside.</p><p>There's a new round of U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods  that could hit later next month.</p><p>Easing exercises -- President Trump looking to get North Korea back on path  to denuclearization.  What the President is looking to do in South Korea.</p><p>A recall alert, a warning for those driving cars with Takata air bags.   Tens of millions of cars are under recall -- the danger under your steering  wheel, under your dashboard.</p><p>And look, up in the sky, Uber Eats looking to drones, Robert Wolf, to help  deliver food to your door.  Details coming up.  </p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I'm loving that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I gave it away here.</p><p>With us this morning, Robert Wolf obviously; national security analyst  Morgan Ortagus, (INAUDIBLE) co-author.  And Robert is 32Advisors founder  and CEO, a Fox Business contributor.  Good morning, sir.  Good morning,  lady.  Good morning, sir.</p><p>WOLF:  Good morning.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p>WOLF:  Great first hour.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Good morning.  Good to be here.  Thanks.</p><p>WOLF:  Great first hour.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was fun.  </p><p>WOLF:  It was fun.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have a lot to talk about.  </p><p>WOLF:  I want to make sure you guys aren't cold at all.  The air  conditioning is good.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Should we explain really quickly.  There was a fight before this  debate in New York between Cynthia Nixon and Governor Cuomo about the  temperature of the air conditioning.  And she was essentially asserting  that men always keep the rooms cold.  It makes the women uncomfortable.   Women don't like feeling so cold because there could be -- don't have  sleeves on their dress and so essentially Morgan has been saying that air  conditioning is sexist this morning.</p><p>So that's our joke for this morning.</p><p>We have so much more coming up -- we'll dick into that plus all the issues  that matter to people's pocketbooks and their wallets.</p><p>Former speaker of the house, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich is here;  SAP Americas and Asia Pacific president Jen Morgan is also here.</p><p>To our top story right here right now -- the looming deadline for a trade  deal.  The United States urging a Friday deadline for a new NAFTA deal as  pressure tightens for Canada to get on board.  President Trump saying he's  optimistic about a done deal by tomorrow but warns Canada not to miss the  train.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Right now we call it the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement.  And we'll  see whether or not Canada gets into it.  Otherwise we'll do something  separately or we won't do anything which is ok, too.</p><p>We're negotiating with them right now.  If they want to be a part of the  deal, we gave until Friday.  And I think we're probably on track.  We'll  see what happens.  But in any event, things are working out very well.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  James -- are you optimistic or not?  Because again -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  I am.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- the editorial page that you are an editor for did not like  the deal that we did with Mexico but what say you, sir?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I'm optimistic that we're on our way to resolving this  trade fight.  Is it a perfect deal?  No.  Does it impede trade in a number  of important ways?  Yes.</p><p>But if you want to think of it as could have been worse, could have gone  through more rounds of tariffs and counter-tariffs, I think everyone and  the world's investors would like to see this resolved and I think it is  going to be resolved.  </p><p>WOLF:  Or would you have preferred to just have kept it the same?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would have kept NAFTA.  Although I have to say, the  intellectual property stuff, better protection for copyrights and drugs is  a positive.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  But in the end when you look at it from like a digital  perspective and how much the economy has changed, the Internet of things,  block chain.</p><p>I mean this new deal is -- does have new rules on digital trade and it does  have provisions where it's going to have to be updated more frequently.  I  think that was definitely an error in the deal that you could go two  decades without an upgrade when there's so much -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, but I think that's one of the strengths is that it didn't  have an expiration date because that does allow people to plan and invest.   And this is one of the areas where we have moved in Canada's direction.  I  hope they appreciate that.</p><p>And I think ideally you would have no expiration date on it and you would  revisit it when you chose to.  But there's really very strong incentive on  both sides to get a deal here.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the deal, if you look at the details of this Canadian deal,  particularly on autos, that what, 75 percent of an automobile has to -- all  of it has to come from North America to get basically no tariff status.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The wage rule -- what is it -- almost half of the car has to be  made with $16 per hour labor.  That is a huge handout to the Democrats,  Robert Wolf.  </p><p>WOLF:  Well, I don't think it's a huge handout.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's left.  </p><p>WOLF:  Right, but I'm -- as someone who is a Democrat, I'm supportive of  that part of the iteration because really I think to James' point, it's  just going to be passed to the consumer.  These higher pricing of  everything being done kind of on this new equilibrium means we're going to  the highest cost provider as opposed to the lowest cost provider.</p><p>That being said, I'm happy that we're seeing a NAFTA 2.0.  I think to  Morgan's point it was time.  And I think we should iterate it, you know, as  we see, you know, dysfunctional or unfair trade situations and I'm kind of  glad we may not have to always go to the WTO for our disputes.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  What the administration is arguing, specifically as it relates to  the auto industry is that they're strengthening the definition of the rules  of origin or clarifying that.  That was one of the major, you know,  contingents is where is the auto made and what the administration is  arguing is you could say it's coming from Mexico, let's say, but actually  parts of it could be coming from Japan.</p><p>And so I think the administration was arguing the rules of origin are so  murky that that really needed to be clarified.  </p><p>WOLF:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But really, you don't want rules of origin, right.  </p><p>WOLF:  Right.  I agree with James.</p><p>In a country that's 73 percent consumer driven-like us, we want to find  parts that are safe but also the least expensive, ok.  If we can make a  part cheaper in Mexico, that works perfectly, ok.  We should continue to  make that part in Mexico that works perfectly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to this because this is good news on the trade  front.  There's a new report from \"Politico\" on the trade issues that we  have with Europe.  The European Union now saying it will be willing to  scrap auto tariffs.  How big of a deal is this -- James?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  It's huge.  I've heard from folks in the White House that  they're optimistic, just like with Canada.  We're moving toward resolution  with Europe.  So this is encouraging news along that path.</p><p>And this is the difference between what the President is saying for Europe  versus some of these other North American situation is he's saying zero  tariffs, lower barriers, more trade, better for the consumer.  And I hope  it's going that way in Europe.</p><p>It's sort of what he's doing in North America, but except for autos where  it's going the other way.  </p><p>WOLF:  I would caution that headline, because it will be interesting to see  what Germany says.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  Ok?  And so I think at the end of the day anything that has to do  with trade with respect to the E.U.  -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I will say -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  But they have been saying they like the zero tariff plan too.  So  I think this is -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know why?  Because we have a 25 percent import tariff on  light trucks in this country.  And the reason -- one of the reasons that I  have been so outspoken against these tariffs is because, well, one, they  are a tax.  They eventually get passed on to the consumers.  They make  doing business more difficult, disrupts supply chains.</p><p>But they will stick around a whole heck of a lot longer than you realize.   This 25 percent tariff that we hit light trucks with, which the U.S.  automakers love, it's because that's one of the reasons that they make and  sell so many pickup trucks here in the U.S. -- is it's been around since  the mid-60s.</p><p>People in the auto business call it the chicken tax.  It was a tax we  slapped on imports of light trucks because we got into a fight with Europe  about poultry exports out of the United States.</p><p>So these things can stick -- politicians love them.  President Trump has  bragged about these, paying down the debt and bringing the steel industry  back.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  The thing that I argue to my clients though when it comes to --  Robert and I agree, you know, on this.  However, I think that energy in  both parties of President Trump and the energy in the Democratic Party when  you look at Bernie Sanders; and even Hillary Clinton said that she was  going to withdraw from the TPP.</p><p>There's not an appetite in the base of both parties for the type of free  trade agreements that Robert and I are both probably are for.  So I think  when companies and businesses are looking at how they project their supply  chain, how they forecast investment over the next five to ten years, I  think that they should do it with the lens of a political appetite that no  matter who is in power -- we're not looking at, you know, 1990s free trade  style -- </p><p>WOLF:  Listen -- I think if we all shifted the word free trade to fair  trade, which includes labor standards and environmental standards -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's what President Trump -- that's very Trumpian.  That's  what President Trump has done.  That is exactly what he talked about.   Robert's going to die -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, that's why -- I know I'm going off on a tangent.  But  this is why it makes my head hurt so much when Democrats just -- they can  say nothing but hateful things about the President and I know -- we could  talk about his personality all day long.  </p><p>WOLF:  Did I say that?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But let's talk of -- no, I'm saying that there are a lot of  other Democrats who do.</p><p>Let's talk about policy instead of personality.</p><p>WOLF:  I'm with you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  You know what, there are policies -- there's a lot  of things that the President has done that are very, very -- a bit liberal.  </p><p>WOLF:  I said I like NAFTA 2.0.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>WOLF:  I've also said I think I'm to the right of the conservative party on  where they've been of trade and fiscal discipline.  We should get back to  where that party was.</p><p>We're going to have a trillion dollar deficit.  Who did that move to?  It  moves to our kids.  When we have these tariffs, who does it move to?  It  moves to the consumers.  That's us paying.  We should just get the GOP back  to where their roots were as well.</p><p>I agree that the Democrats have shifted too far left.  I'm not there  either.  But we should make sure that we're talking practically on both  sides.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  I would agree that the spending blow-out is the great failing of  this Republican congress and administration.  </p><p>WOLF:  Say that louder.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  It's true.  Not that the predecessor was -- was better but this  is -- this is the problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The debt for a number of reasons did -- the national debt  doubled under President Obama.  And that's why people find it rich when  Nancy Pelosi is wringing her hand about the debt and the deficit because  the Democrats didn't vote for any of the tax cuts which has given us at  least the fastest quarterly growth that we've gotten in this country in  four years.  </p><p>WOLF:  I've just got to go back to some Economics 101, ok.  Yes, the debt  increased because of wars and the recession.  But -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WOLF:  -- billion dollar stimulus.  </p><p>Let me just be clear though.  What we really need to focus on is not  necessarily debt because debt's based on a percent of GDP.  It's more the  deficit.  And the deficit came down under President Obama from double  digits to down to under 3 percent.  We should just be clear the deficit -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  You mean after he blew it out in year one, and it remained a  solid deficit.  </p><p>WOLF:  He did inherit the recession?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Nobody forced him to do the stimulus plan.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WOLF:  It was a unanimous plan.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But I think what we all agree on is that if we could get this  trade fight out of the way, we can allow this great economy to keep on  humming.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Great second quarter, looks like a great third quarter so far.   Profits up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Corporate profits were up more than 16 percent year over year.  </p><p>WOLF:  Love that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  15.1 percent -- we love that.  But again, it's the -- when  people on the left lose, it's when their manufactured outrage and the  sneering -- not you, others -- when it doesn't line up with reality, and  the reality is the economy is going great guns, people feel awesome.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  Partisan politics has been not a positive.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And President Trump, as much as people have tried to make him a  bigot and racist, which trade deal did he do first?  Mexico.  And he talks  about I love Mexico and I love Canada.</p><p>So again, it's the walk not the talk that we've got to pay attention to.   That's my final word.  </p><p>WOLF:  Well, you know, we could debate that.  But I'm going to let you end  with that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Thank you -- Robert because you've got one hour and 45  minutes left to push back.</p><p>A new warning for Takata air bags, the alarming concerns that the air bags  might explode in hot and humid conditions.</p><p>And sky high delivery, Uber Eats gearing up to send food to your doorstep  with a drone.  The details later this hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thousands of people in Arizona lining up in 100-degree  temperatures to say good-bye to the late Senator John McCain.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has the details.  Hey -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  An Arizona hero, a national hero  -- Dagen.  About 15,000 people came to pay their respects to the late  senator.  His children thanked folks who came to see their father as he  lied in state.  In fact his sons came back later in the day.</p><p>The Vietnam War hero served the state for 36 years in Washington.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. DOUG DUCEY (R), ARIZONA:  Like many of us here in Arizona, John McCain  was from somewhere else.  But his spirit, service and fierce independence  ultimately helped shape the state with which he became synonymous.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Today a memorial service is going to be held at the North Phoenix  Baptist Church where former vice president Joe Biden will speak and 24  sitting senators are going to attend that service.  Then his casket will  depart Arizona for Washington.</p><p>Well, Micron Technology announcing plans to expand a plant in Virginia.   The company going to invest $3 billion over the next 12 years to meet  growing demand for chips used in cars.  The move will create 1,100 jobs  over the next 10 years.  Shares of Micron lower, we should say, in the  premarket, but just fractionally here, folks.</p><p>And then check this out, an incredible photo of lightning striking Lake  Michigan is going viral.  I bet Maria would love this, actually.  You can  see the giant bolt light up the sky as it strikes the surface of the water.   It was taken by a crew member on board a freight ship as it was crossing  the lake in a big storm.  And get this -- he snapped this picture on his  Samsung phone.  The shipping company posted the photo to its Facebook page.   It's been seen and shared almost 7,000 times so far.  It's incredible.</p><p>All right.  Today is the day to celebrate a timeless toy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM CARREY, ACTOR:  It's going to be some kind of a record.  </p><p>Everyone loves a slinky.  You've got to get a slinky.  Slinky, slinky --  go, slinky, go.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  It is national slinky day, invented in 1943.  The slinky has  entertained generations of kids including most of the people on the set  today.  It's been inducted into the toy hall of fame.  It is on \"Time  Magazine's\" list of top 100 toys.  NASA even taking the slinky into space  for a zero gravity experiment.</p><p>Anyway -- all right, people time for our slink-off here on set.  I got --  actually mine matches your dress.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nicest piece of jewelry I've ever owned.  The slinky.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, yes, yes.  You got it, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm so glad it fits over my fat hand.</p><p>CASONE:  Oh, please.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What -- Robert Wolf, a slinky won't make you smile?  </p><p>WOLF:  I'm smiling.  I'm just actually focused on trying to break that  record that Jim Carrey is going for. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Any reason to show some \"Ace Ventura Pet Detective\" video.  </p><p>WOLF:  Classic.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you -- Cheryl.  Thank you for the slinkies.</p><p>Coming up, jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon, details on a new  cryptocurrency find.</p><p>And an easier way to order coffee, the changes heading to your Amazon Alexa  -- that's ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump just tweeting on these markets, writing this,  \"The news from the financial markets is even better than anticipated.  For  all of you that have made a fortune in the markets or seen your 401(k)s  rise beyond your wildest expectations more good news is coming.\"  That's a  big promise coming from the President.</p><p>Joining us now, Morgan Creek Capital Management CEO, chief investment  officer Mark Yusko.  Mark -- great to see you as always.</p><p>Do you expect, looking at just stocks, that this bull run that we've had  will continue?  </p><p>MARK YUSKO, CEO, MORGAN CREEK CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Look, I think, you know,  any time there's positive news, Dagen -- that markets will react,  particularly in these late stages of the summer, you know, when everybody  is away on vacation.</p><p>I think post Labor Day, it's going to be interesting to see when people  come back from vacation if they look at valuations and get a little  nervous.  But as long as they keep bringing us good news on trade, things I  think will be stable.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you would put new money to work in stocks right now?  </p><p>YUSKO:  No, I wouldn't do that at all.  You know, we think -- we think  stocks are very over-valued.  We've been lightening up and trying to get  hedged and focusing on different areas.  But, yes, I probably wouldn't put  new money.</p><p>But I, you know, wouldn't be so nervous if were to have any imminent  collapse or anything like that.  </p><p>WOLF:  And what if we saw -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mark -- this is Robert Wolf, by the way.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  Sorry -- Mark.  I'm looking at the wrong one.</p><p>YUSKO:  Hey, Robert.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  How are you?  Good to see you.</p><p>YUSKO:  Good.  </p><p>WOLF:  I'm kind of with you.  I'm a little cautious and a little more  defensive as well.  How do you see the environment going into rising rate  environment, you know, big discussions coming up on this fiscal discipline?   We have the budget coming up which obviously will be very interesting going  into, you know, the November elections.  And so are those causes for  concern as you come into the fall?  </p><p>YUSKO:  Robert -- you've hit all the list of things that people should be  thinking about and be concerned about.  You know, interest rates have  certainly risen and when you discount future streams of cash flows, which  is what stocks are at a higher discount rate, the value should go down, not  up.  And yet the PE ratios keep rising.</p><p>And that's because I think this passive wave of money -- you know, passive  investing is dumb.  And I don't mean unintelligent.  I mean it's rule- based.  And rule-based strategies, they can't think.  They can't say oh,  that valuation seems high to me.  They just have to buy what's on the list.</p><p>So you bring up another point about deficit spending.  You know, deficit  spending is basically a wealth tax on the middle class.  And that's why  income inequality is the highest it has ever been because we have been  deficit spending like crazy for the last two decades.</p><p>That's why we're so focused on block chain technology, bitcoin, crypto.   Those things solve the income inequality problem that we're all facing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Mark -- James Freeman here at \"The Wall Street Journal\".</p><p>YUSKO:  Hi -- James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  You talked about the downside and high valuations.  Is this  related in part to your expectations on the economy?  Are you thinking that  this second quarter number does not get repeated and things really slow  down?  Or do you think the economy's going to be great but stocks are just  priced too high?  </p><p>YUSKO:  No, James -- again, this is fun this morning.  You guys are  bringing up all the best points.  You know, look, the economy hasn't grown  above 2 percent for six years.  We had one quarter, that was juiced by the  tax deform act as I call it.  And it's not going to be repeated in the  third and fourth quarter.  It's just not.</p><p>You know, GDP, nominal GDP is really simple.  It's productivity plus  working age population growth.  We know working age population growth over  the next 10 years is going to be sub-1 percent.  We know productivity is  going to be sub-1 percent.</p><p>It turns out, 65 to 85-year-old people are not as productive as 45 to 65- year-old people.  Who would have thunk it.  So it's unlikely that -- </p><p>WOLF:  That's ageism.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mark -- I want to get to -- </p><p>YUSKO:  It doesn't mean they're not good people.  It just means that  productivity is -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I quickly want to get to this.  You joined forces with Bit  Wise, launching an institutional fund cryptocurrency.  Tell us about it.   And would you eventually launch something for retail?  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes, it's great.  Thank you -- Dagen.</p><p>So look, we started getting involved in the pick and shovels, in the  venture capital around providing the infrastructure for block chain  technology, cryptocurrency.  And we had institutional investors come to us  and saying we'd really like to get some exposure to crypto, that kind of  get off zero which is the allocation most people have.</p><p>So we went out and searched for a world class partner.  We found the Bit  Wise team out in California.  And we've come together to form this new  Digital Asset Index Fund that we think can solve the problem for  institutions that want to get exposure.</p><p>We've been around, doing institutional investing for decades.  And we think  their technology and their expertise in handling and managing the actual  crypto is a great combination.</p><p>In terms of a solution for retail, we clearly would like to move in that  direction as well.  We're going to work closely with regulators to try to  see if we can get that accredited investor standard to not apply only to  the sector of the market like other alternative investments.  Hopefully  we'll get there too.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mark Yusko -- thank you so much, Mark.  Great to see you, dear.   Mark Yusko -- </p><p>YUSKO:  Thanks -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- joining us.</p><p>YUSKO:  Thanks -- guys.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up -- the future of war games with South Korea.  The  details as President Trump says there's no reason to resume the joint  military exercises.</p><p>Plus, forget cars, why Uber Eats is looking to deliver food with drones.   That's ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DAGENMCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Thursday, August 30th.  Your top  stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  </p><p>Closing in, tomorrow, the deadline for a trade deal with Canada.  President  Trump optimistic we'll have a deal in time.  Canada's Prime Minister Justin  Trudeau says there will only be a deal if it's good for Canada.  </p><p>Investors are showing a little bit of concern.  We have a 61 point loss on  the Dow Futures right now but I'll tell you, Sam Stovall was here, we're  coming off a day where you had the NASDAQ, S&amp;P and Russell 2000 hitting new  all-time highs for the fourth day in a row.  And Sam Stovall told me  earlier that the fourth quarter of mid-term election years, the S&amp;P is up  7.5 percent in the fourth quarter and is up 90 percent of the time in mid- term election years, so maybe waiting for some uncertainty to be lifted.  </p><p>But markets hitting higher.  Not the story in Europe, England, France and  Germany, those gauges all heading lower and it was really the same story in  Asia Overnight.  The Nikkei managing to eke out a small gain.  Trade  tensions a concern there as well.  </p><p>Recall alert, Takata airbags could explode under pressure from heat and  humidity.  Tens of millions of cars under this recall.  </p><p>Taking to the skies, Uber Eats looking to deliver food to your door by  drone.  </p><p>And hey Alexa, order me a donut.  Amazon teaming up with a big name so you  can order tasty sweet treats using the digital assistant.  The details of  this delicious deal in a few minutes.  </p><p>And clear is cool, beverage maker seeing the future in clear cola and other  transparent tonics.  We will see if clear can lead to green.  </p><p>And now to this top story at the bottom of the hour, holding off for now,  the president issuing a White House statement yesterday about U.S.-South  Korean military exercises, tweeting this.  The president believes that his  relationship with Kim Jong-un is a very good one and warm one and there is  no reason at this time to be spending large amounts of money on joint U.S.- South Korea war games.  Besides the president can instantly start the joint  exercises again with South Korea and Japan if he so chooses.  This after  defense secretary -- Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said this earlier this  week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES MATTIS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  We took the step to  suspend several of the largest exercises at a good faith measure coming out  of the Singapore summit.  We will work very closely, as I said, with the  Secretary of State and what he needs done.  We will certainly do to  reinforce his effort.  But at this time, there is no discussion about  further suspensions.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining me now, former CIA trained intelligence operative,  former navy pilot, Fox News correspondent Lea Gabrielle.  Lea Gabrielle,  paint this picture for us.  What's going on? </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think what's going on is  there is -- as I've said so many times on this show before, there's always  public diplomacy and then there's private diplomacy.  And these  negotiations with North Korea, there are messages being sent, like  President Trump tweeting, that's public diplomacy.  A message that he wants  everyone to hear, saying, our relationship is warm, keeping that door open  to the North Korean leader.  </p><p>But then, there's also the private things that are going on.  And those are  the more detailed negotiations that are going on.  </p><p>Secretary Pompeo and his staff, he's got his newly -- he's got the new  negotiator Stephen Biegun who's going to be doing these negotiations.  So,  there's a lot going on behind the scenes between these public and these  private messages.  </p><p>Now, I think that people are trying to find space between President Trump,  Secretary Pompeo and Secretary Mattis.  I think that that's really -- it's  really kind of being over-played.  I think that the messages are actually  pretty much the same.  Secretary Mattis is basically saying, OK we've  canceled a couple exercises but as the military, we always continue to plan  and prepare because it's much easier to stop something and to cancel  something than to try to recreate everything if you haven't planned for it.  </p><p>So, they'll plan for exercises and we've been doing this for a long time  with South Korea.  And they'll keep those plans in place and then if they  want to, they can cancel them last minute.  </p><p>But I think that Secretary Pompeo and his folks at the State Department are  working very hard to keep these negotiations going.  A senior State  Department Official directly involved in negotiations has said that Kim  Jong-un is very intelligent and that -- you know, there's clearly a respect  there for who they're dealing with and the level of negotiations that are  going to have to take place.  </p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, I think Lea the fly in the  ointment in all of this placed in the administration is President Moon of  South Korea.  You know, because, we could talk about all we want about  resuming exercises or not.  The South Koreans are the ones that canceled --  that wanted to cancel the last exercises.  And when you look at Moon, he is  proceeding in trying to normalize relationships, the relationship between  North and South Korea.  And in a way that I think is disadvantageous to the  -- to the U.S. position, especially when you look at all the new economic  agreements that he's signing.  </p><p>So, the South Koreans, Moon specifically, are way far out in front of this  administration.  And I think they're making it more difficult for us to  have the leverage that we need in order to keep the North Korean leader's  feet to the fire.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think that's a good point but at the same time, I think when  you look at our relationship with South Korea over the long term, I think  if they have to decide between one -- between one country or the other,  they're going to lean more towards us.  I agree with you that they're  making it a little more difficult.  Because they really do want to come to  terms, they really do want to normalize those relationships.  And there may  be some naivete on the part of South Koreans in terms of what can actually  be accomplished.  </p><p>But I think this administration, is trying very hard to develop a  relationship, to show North Korea what can be done and how they can operate  economically.  How they can be brought into the fold of western  civilization into the better picture of life for them if they want to work  with us and trying very hard to show them that if they don't, that their  future is very dark and very bleak.  </p><p>So there's this public messaging.  There's the private communications.   Ultimately, I think that South Korea will always choose to work with us  because we've been their partner for so long.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  So, I guess we should be encouraged  that the president still thinks there's hope for a deal.  Stephen Biegun,  great hire to manage this relationship.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Absolutely.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But it -- I do wonder, given the pressure of sanctions, if North  Korea wanted to reform, why are they dragging this out?  I mean, wouldn't  they be -- you think they might be eager to get relief from those  sanctions?  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  It seems so simple when you look at it from the 20,000-foot  perspective like we do in the media, right?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  We look at the big picture and we're kind of like, this seems  so easy.  But when you get into the details, there's so much more that  they're dealing with.  You know, there's the relationship between North  Korea and China.  That they've been -- China has been North Korea's best  trading partner, best ally and now here we are in these negotiations with  China.  Where we're trying to get better trade deals.  President Trump is  trying to maintain a positive relationship with China.  But at the same  time, China has been backing up North Korea, continues to back up North  Korea and President Trump is calling them out.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Basically loosening their trade restrictions.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the Korea ignoring sanctions.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  They're giving them money, fuels, fertilizer.  Varies that our  commodities.  So, our sanctions -- you know, the sanctions don't work if  they're not imposed.  So, it's a challenge.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to this story it's about Iran, recently  declassified reports reviewed by the Wall Street Journal revealed the role  that Iran played in the Iraq war, specifically training and arming Iraqi  militias.  Lea, what are you seeing in this report?  I know you've looked  at them.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  So, yes.  These reports, I've got several of them right here  that I've been taking a look at.  And they have been recently declassified  by Central Command for the purposes of studying the history of the Iraq  war.  </p><p>But what we're really seeing here is the extreme influence that Iran had in  the Iraq war, how Iran has been jockeying for influence in Iraq during the  war, trying to get us to leave Iraq, and since then.  We know that that's  the case.  And these reports give some really good information from one of  the detainees about how Iran was providing weapons, was providing training,  was pushing Shia militias within Iraq to attack U.S. and British troops.  </p><p>Specifically, it talks about the Karbala attack in which five U.S. -- five  American soldiers were killed.  The detainee is somebody who is a leader of  a Shia militia group in Iraq.  </p><p>And so, it gives a lot of insight into how those groups were operating and  that influence.  And as we look at Iran, the nuclear deal, why Trump --  President Trump pulled out of it, a lot of that is because of how Iran is  meddling in the region and asserting its influence.  And I think that these  documents being released, and being able to see how Iran operates really  does kind of give some backing to that argument about the environment.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Iran made richer by the nuclear deal, that was cut by the  U.S., number one.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And funneling money to Hezbollah to rebels in Yemen, its  interference in Syria, its attacks -- you know, attacks on Israel.  And,  again, that money being used to basically spread terrorism throughout the  region.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  And now Iran is seeing the hit.  Because economically they're  not doing well.  Their unemployment rate is very high.  Their currency has  been taking a big hit.  Rouhani has been taking big hit politically right  now.  So, they're definitely feeling the squeeze when it comes to economic  pressure from pulling out of the deal.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lea, you hit -- you covered a lot of ground for us.  Thank you  so much. </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you as always.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Great to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Major concerns over Takata airbags, a new warning about the  airbags that they might explode in extreme heat.  </p><p>And jumping on the seltzer trend, how beverage companies are marketing  clear to customers, ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A new warning over exploding Takata airbags.  Cheryl Casone has  more, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, more troubles for this  airbags and this company, Dagen.  The National Highway Traffic Safety  Administrations says tens of millions of cars with Takata airbags face an  increased chance of exploding in hot and humid conditions.  New warning old  recall.  There's about 50 million defective Takata airbags in 37 million  vehicles in the United States right now.  Takata had already filed for  bankruptcy court protection last year.  They were eventually bought by U.S.  based Key Safety Systems but, again, this needs to be dealt with by  drivers.  </p><p>Uber is looking to spread its wings.  The company which already plans to  offer flying cars now wants to use drones to deliver food as part of Uber  Eats.  Uber making the announcement at its Uber Elevate conference out in  Tokyo.  The Uber Eats drone is still in the early stages obviously.   Amazon, Walmart, Google, are all working on the concept of delivery drones  and with delivery drones, not sure it's coming to New York any time soon.  </p><p>Then there's Amazon's Alexa which can now order you a fresh cup of coffee  every morning.  Dunkin' Donuts Perks Rewards members can link their  accounts to their Alexa and order breakfast before they leave their house.   Customers can log in -- you log in the app, you choose from the menu and  then you ask Alexa to place the order or they can just ask Alexa to order  their last saved favorite.  Pretty good, I like it.  If it gets you out the  door quicker, then it's a pretty good idea, right?  Dagen, so, there you  have it.  Alexa -- I don't have an Alexa, do you? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have everything.  </p><p>CASONE:  Everything.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Everything and I don't -- and I don't use them.  But you know  what?  On a morning that I bumped into more pieces of furniture than you  can imagine, bruises, I need a dodo, I need a dodo and it's not even 8:00  a.m.  </p><p>CASONE:  You've got to be careful, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is me not -- I know, this is me not doing my Homer Simpson  impression.  I will save that for later.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, don't judge a drink by its color, the details on clear beverages  companies are creating to woo new customers.  That's next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump just tweeting this, Ivanka Trump and Jared  Kushner had nothing to do with the so-called pushing out of Don McGahn.   The fake news media has it purposefully so wrong.  They love to portray  chaos in the White House when they know that chaos doesn't exist.  Just a  smooth running machine with changing parts.  </p><p>Switching some gears, in Japan a new trend is brewing, clear beer, that is.   Lauren Simonetti has more on this.  Hi, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, if it's clear,  it's healthier, right?  It's a mind game.  But it is an effective mind  game.  </p><p>So, check this out, in the U.S. and in Japan, clear anything is selling.   In fact, Americans rang up $2.7 billion in sparkling water and seltzer  sales in the past year.  That's more than juice.  And sales of flavored  bottled water have tripled in the past decade here in the U.S. and also in  Japan where they're even chugging clear beer -- yes, without the alcohol,  all free all-time from Suntory is selling this beer.  It is flying off  store shelves in Japan.  Clear coffee, clear tea also very popular.  </p><p>But clear drinks are nothing new.  PepsiCo. launched Crystal Pepsi that was  back in 1992.  You know, at the time we just couldn't wrap our minds around  cola that wasn't brown.  But then, this happened.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I thought they shut that division down decades ago.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We never shut down.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Party people!. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  PepsiCo relaunched Crystal Pepsi back in 2016.  It's sold out,  yes, it's nostalgia.  It's a liquid history of our youth.  And the clear  trend was reborn.  We bought into it.  Now, we have PepsiCo recently buying  SodaStream for $3.2 billion.  Hard seltzer like, White Claw extremely  popular.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's alcoholic seltzer.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, hard, right.  Mineral water like Topo Chico.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I love it.  I drink Topo Chico.  I love it, it's really good.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  OK.  That has a cult following.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And the list goes at La Croix. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  I buy all of these.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  La Croix.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  How do you say it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Isn't it La Croix?</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I'm the wrong guy to ask.   I drink it and I like it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's La Croix?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I thought it was La Croix.  </p><p>WOLF:  I have to ask my wife.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK, you're right, it's La Croix.  They told me in my ear.  I was  trying to be (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>WOLF:  I like the grapefruit La Croix and the lime La Croix.  There's a few  of them I can't stand.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  It prevents me from drinking coke or Pepsi.  The Topo Chico is  the best.  I buy it all the time now. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what's delicious? Thanks to Kevin Kelly, there is a --  it's basically an energy drink business called Hiball.  I think it was  bought by -- it's organic.  It was bought by Anheuser-Busch.  But they have  a clear seltzer that is caffeinated.  And it has a lot of caffeine in it.   It will blow your shoes off.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  What is it about clear that is attracting us right now.  It  didn't work back in the '90s.  But it's working now.  Why? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think the brain connection is that it's somehow more  refreshing.  </p><p>WOLF:  The clear soda, I don't -- I don't think that's something I'm going  to buy.  I like the -- I like the dark soda.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I like the bubbles.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's called -- well, it's called Sprite.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Or 7-up.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, but there's too much sugar.  </p><p>WOLF:  No, I'm talking about Coca-Cola -- Pepsi.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  No, there's too much sugar in Sprite.  You can drink the La  Croix, you get the bubble that feels like the soda but without all the  sugar.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's my only advice doing this early morning shift.  Getting  up at 02:00 a.m. for almost nine years running, the first thing you got to  do when you get out of bed -- </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Caffeinate.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, drink a giant --</p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, drink a giant glass of very, very cold seltzer water.   Because it really wakes you up more than caffeine.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Now I know.  </p><p>WOLF:  Topo Chico.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I can't believe you've heard of it.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, I love it.  I buy it all the time.  It's good.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lauren great to see you.

We have a very good relationship.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  The Trump administration set a deadline for Canada of Friday,  tomorrow to either come to some sort of a compromise with the U.S. or at  least show that they are willing to move forward so that the administration  can go to Congress here at home and say that things are moving in the right  direction with Canada.  The Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland saying  yesterday that she feels there is a spirit of compromise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRYSTIA FREELAND, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF CANADA:  I do.  I feel  that both parties are coming to this stage of the negotiations with a lot  of good will.  Certainly that is what Canada is bringing to the table.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Meantime, Dagen, the European Union's top trade rep this morning  saying that the E.U. would be willing to go to zero tariffs on autos, so  long as the United States do the same, if that were to happen and it is an  if at this point, that would no doubt be a major win for President Trump  and that statement today from the E.U. goes beyond the framework that the  U.S. and E.U. said that they would work upon when it was announced here at  the White House last month, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And maybe a win for people who would love a cheaper pickup  truck.</p><p>BURMAN:  Right, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because again we've got a 25 percent tariff on imported light  trucks in this country.  Good to see you, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  You too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Blake Burman live at the White House.  Joining me now, former  speaker of the house, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich.  Your current --  your take, Mr. Speaker, on the current trade negotiations.  </p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, things going very well for  Trump, and United States.  In fact there's lots of people thought he  couldn't get a deal with Mexico.  He clearly is going to have a deal with  Mexico.  That's a huge breakthrough.  And sets the stage for a much better  relationship with the incoming new Mexican President.  At the same time the  Canadians I think sort of thought they could sit it out for a while.</p><p>And now they're having to play catch-up, and United States is so key to the  Canadian economy that they have to get to an agreement.  The Canadians  cannot afford to have the U.S. start applying tariffs in other things that  would stop them.  So I think Trump is in a strong position, the only  question I would raise about the European offer are they going to continue  to value-added tax where they get to rebate for their autos.</p><p>And then apply the tax to our cars and isn't that in effect the same as  tariffs?  So, I think you've got to enter a European negotiation with a  full understanding of the different gimmicks they use to protect their  market.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Mr. Speaker, Newt, this is actually why I've been -- I've  been negative on the tariffs that the Trump administration has used because  it is essentially a value-added tax on imports in this country.  It's a tax  that ultimately would be passed on to consumers, but given this deal that  they've been able to negotiate with Mexico moving on to Canada, how quickly  do you think we could get a deal.</p><p>And actually get some concessions from China on the fact that that nation  steals our intellectual property trying to put a stop to that, trying to  put a stop to the forced surrender of our own technology.  Again, the  naysayers with this President often are wrong and I would admit that but  what about China?  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Well, China is a much harder case because you're now asking the  Chinese government to give up what the Chinese government is doing.  You  know, intellectual property theft in China is not random behavior, it's  actually a division of the people's liberation army based right outside of  Beijing.  And they do it as a deliberate act of government policy.  So  you're asking them to profoundly change how they've operated.</p><p>I think we ought to be very tough with them.  And I do think they are  rattled by the way in which Trump is marching down the road.  And the fact  the Trump understands, we, you know, the Chinese need us, 10 or 15 times  more than we need them.  And he is in a very strong position.  My guess is  that they'll turn to Europe next and then towards China just because  Europeans seem rattled and should have done the deal.</p><p>But Trump is beginning to prove that he can actually negotiate  international trade in a way that no so-called expert thought he could.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mr. Speaker, let's just talk about President Trump was tweeting  about the stock market promising more great things to come.  But there is  so little focus on the left by the Democrats on what is really going on in  this country on the ground in terms of this incredible economic growth that  we've seen.  In the quarter, the last quarter fastest pace in nearly four  years.</p><p>Estimates that are north of four percent at least for the current -- the  quarter that we are in wages fastest growth in a decade, optimism among  consumers highest it's been in 18 years.  New record-highs on the stock  market.  This is a huge opportunity for Republicans as we head into the  midterms to highlight this over and over and over and over again.  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Well, look, I think there is a huge opportunity here because as  the Democrats respond to Trump by going further and further to the left and  getting crazier and crazier, they're creating this huge gap, I mean, look  at the Florida outcome as an example, look what Gavin Newsom is promising  in California as the Democratic nominee who wants to apply universal  healthcare to people who are here illegally.</p><p>Which could make California the recipient of medical refugees from entire  planet.  You know, the message could be if you get sick go to California,  they want to take care of you.  These kind of ideas are permeating the  Democratic Party right now.  And the liberal media is not doing the  Democrats any favor by allowing them to get further and further and further  out of touch with reality.</p><p>And as you point, the reality is I believe the numbers that came out this  morning, we've had a bigger increase in the media and income in the last  year than in the eight years of Obama combined.  That's a remarkable  achievement by Trump.  And I think it will make him stronger and stronger. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's almost comical though that some of the Democrats are now  worried about the debt and deficits, these are Democrats who didn't vote  for the tax cuts, they don't believe in giving -- allowing individuals to  keep more of their money, allowing corporations to make decisions that are  in their best interests, interest of the company, interest of the employees  but now that they're -- one of the talking points I've actually heard more  than once from people, who come on our air is that they are now worried  about inflation.</p><p>That an -- oh, inflation is eating up more than the wage gains that we have  in this country and it is high comedy, Newt.  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Look, I think the Democrats have a huge problem.  They've never  gotten over Hillary Clinton losing.  That was a psychotic moment for them  would happen so suddenly.  And the result is, they wake up every morning  knowing Trump did something wrong, I wonder what it is.  And that's how  they spend all day every day, and so they can't -- they can't unlock, they  can't come to grips with what is a rapidly changing world.</p><p>Look, in Florida, a Democratic nominee for governor of Florida is promising  the highest business tax rate in the south.  Now, what's that going to do?   It's going to drive jobs out of Florida.  Gavin Newsom is campaigning in  favor of a higher gasoline tax in California.  Every time you turn around,  the Democrats shows up ask him, how much are they going to raise taxes to  pay for the government-run healthcare proposal?</p><p>Our estimate for California alone is maybe 4$0 billion a year in higher  taxes.  That's the kind of self-worth.  They're simply spinning out of  touch with reality and I think that will bite them very badly this fall.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This garbage, I never took math in school, Medicare for all  proposal that you hear some people on the left.  We would have to more than  double the amount of money that the Federal government takes in from  corporate and individual taxes in this country and it still wouldn't pay  for it over a 10-year period.  That's how the math doesn't add up.  At the  same time they don't -- you can't touch or even try to fix Medicare or  Social Security, Newt.</p><p>Again, it's just -- it's not living in a world of reality, a reality where  people have bigger paychecks, 90 percent of people have larger paychecks  this year and it's not Nancy Pelosi making decisions with your money, it's  you sitting at home whether you live in Iowa, Missouri, or Oregon.  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Well, look, I think it's pretty simple.  Medicare for all is  Medicare for none because the whole system would collapse.  The fact is  most Americans don't want government bureaucrats running their health  system.  I think all these big ideas collapse when you start looking at  them in the real world.  And that's why I think if the Republicans are  prepared to run an aggressive campaign of a big choice they may have a  surprising outcome this fall just as we did in 2016.</p><p>Remember, up until election night 2016, all of the experts thought Hillary  would win.  I think the same thing we may be about to face same reality  this year and suddenly have a huge Republican gain in the Senate and  potentially I think actually have the Republicans increase House seats  rather than losing.  If that happens, the level of shock on the left will  be unbelievable.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Newt, really quickly with the President taking on Google,  worried about conservative speech being suppressed by the social media  companies.  Do you think that he will regulate or is it just talk?  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Well, I think at a minimum, we need hearings to bring in, you  know, Twitter, Google, Facebook.  I mean, these large institutions are  really quasi public.  And you cannot have them dominating information space  only on behalf of left wingers.  I was frankly very surprised by how biased  they have been.  And I think you've got to look, and I don't know what  solution is yet but you at least got to get it out in the open.</p><p>And at the minimum places like Google and Facebook ought to have advisory  groups that are genuinely both liberal and conservative with real power to  supervise and to police it and make sure that every citizen has the real  fair opportunity to communicate.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amen, sir.  Amen.  Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.   Great to see you as always.  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Good to see you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  Augmented Apple.  The tech giant's ambitions with  A.R. glasses.  Plus, a new plan for PETA.  Why the animal rights group  wants to say good-bye to some lobsters in a very unusual way later this  hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump tweeting on.  Here is what the President just  said, I am very excited about the person who will be taking the place of  Don McGahn as White House Counsel.  I like Don but he was not responsible  for me not firing Bob Mueller or Jeff Sessions.  So much fake reporting and  fake news.  Yes.  Bob Mueller is still there, Jeff Sessions still there.   But -- we want to remember that was Robert Wolf, you want time to comment.  </p><p>WOLF:  Biting my tongue.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But right now we want to remember the maverick, a  political icon, war hero, the first of many memorials taking place  yesterday for the late Arizona Senator John McCain.  Thousands of people  lining up in 100 degree temperatures to pay their respects at the state's  Capitol.  Hillary Vaughn is in Phoenix with more details particularly on  that service that's going to happen later today.  I think it's at 1:00 East  Coast time.  Hillary?</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Dagen.  1:00 p.m.  East Coast Time.  The service will start here at the North Phoenix Baptist  Church.  But earlier yesterday thousands of people gathered in this triple- digit heat to pay their respects to Senator John McCain.  The last person  walking through the Capitol at 9:00 p.m. yesterday evening, some of the  McCain kids made a surprise visit to those late night visitors at the  Capitol.</p><p>Sidney, Jimmy, Jack, and Doug shaking hands and sharing touching moments  with supporters who wanted to pay their respects, the private ceremony  yesterday at the Capitol was the first of several events planned for the  remainder of this week to celebrate the life and legacy of John McCain.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GOV. DOUG DUCEY (R), ARIZONA:  He fought like hell for causes he believed  in.  He plowed through election after election with the energy and focus of  a warrior.  But along the way, he did it with humor and humanity.  And  without compromising the principles he healed so dear.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUGHN:  Senator McCain will be escorted by his family from the Capitol at  9:00 a.m. local time this morning.  They will make their way here to the  North Phoenix Baptist Church for memorial service.  Along the way they  expect thousands to stand along the motorcade route at the ceremony here.   Former Vice President Joe Biden will give an address along with Governor  Doug Ducey who will be in attendance.</p><p>Over 22 sitting Senators will also be here at the church for the memorial  service along with staff and players from the Arizona Cardinals and also  the Arizona Diamondbacks which McCain was a very big fan of, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was every person, every speaker, every song, every detail  planned over a period of several months by Senator John McCain.  And it's  an incredible way watching it yesterday, the people lining up to pay their  respects and look forward to watching it later today of what he meant to  the people of Arizona and how much that state and it's incredible  breathtaking beauty and the people how much it meant to him.  Thank you so  much, Hillary Vaughn.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Eyeing progress on trade.  The next round of talks with Canada,  they start in less than an hour.  The uncertainty over deals weighing on  business across industries.  Joining us now, SAP Americas and Asia Pacific  Japan President, Jennifer Morgan. Jennifer, SAP is one of the worldwide  leaders in business software applications clients in over 180 countries.   How are these trade disputes impacting customers and businesses as you see  it right now?  </p><p>JENNIFER MORGAN, PRESIDENT, SAP AMERICAS AND ASIA PACIFIC JAPAN:  What's  interesting, I was -- I was with a big CPG company yesterday, I was with an  aerospace company the day before and one of them said, every morning when I  wake up, I look at the news to understand what do I need to think about in  my supply chain.  How do I need to think differently and what do I need to  pivot?</p><p>And this is exactly what we do.  This is our bread and butter.  Helping  customers understand how to have most agile supply chain and how to pivot  and how use technology to your advantage.  So in times of uncertainty this  is where we can really help our customers.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you would actually benefiting from the uncertainty.</p><p>MORGAN:  We're helping customers work through it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But have you seen in terms of businesses making big changes or  holding off on investment decisions, holding off on decision-making because  they don't know what's going to happen with these trade negotiations? </p><p>MORGAN:  I see them really leaning into technology because the only way to  really cope with -- to cope with the change is through technology.  And  it's -- we're in a real time economy, and so these companies have to think  in very different ways.  So, now I see really leaning in.  </p><p>WOLF:  Jennifer you and your company had an amazing kind of past year.  </p><p>MORGAN:  Yes.  </p><p>WOLF:  Talk about, you know, the growth of your cloud business.  I heard  it's like up over 40 percent and what's making you grow, you know,  literally at a better pace in the market?</p><p>MORGAN:  Yes.  We had great growth in K2, we have 40 percent revenue growth  in the cloud.  Really (INAUDIBLE) across all of our regions and industries.   Digital transformation is obviously front and center.  A lot of M&amp;A  activity that we see out there, companies have to think about how they can  very quickly embrace those companies, get the synergies that they need.   I'd say the other trend is around companies thinking about the consumer  experience.</p><p>Companies right now, the companies that will really thrive are the ones who  are really thinking what is the experience that my consumer wants to have  with my brand.  It's not just about the buying experience but it's about  the entire experience and companies who want to get direct to the consumer  have to also make sure they got the right planning in place, supply chain,  inventory so that you get the experience that you want.</p><p>Not upfront but across the whole time for that customer.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  So you've been -- sounds like seeing good results everywhere but  the larger picture seems to be the U.S. doing really well, rest of the  world not so great.  Are you kind of thinking maybe the rest of the world  is perking up, going to be growing faster based on what you've seen?  </p><p>MORGAN:  Yes.  I was -- I spent most of summer in both Europe and Asia and  for us that's a really strong part of our business.  Europe is a big part  of our business.  We saw great growth in our European businesses and in  Asia you really -- the CEOs are leaning in, we had a big CEO event in Tokyo  and that was great because these CEOs are leaning into the direct to  consumer to really by the digital transformation.</p><p>So our business has done very, very well, you know, across all the  different regions.  Mexico last week interesting, I was down in Mexico  meeting with some of our largest retail customers as well.  Same thing,  same thing down there, moving to the cloud trying to get the cost down.</p><p>WOLF:  The President also said he loves Mexico.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  I heard a little bit about  that conversation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Canada.  He did not leave Canada out. </p><p>WOLF:  No.  I just want to give them those --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: -- Mexico to pay for.</p><p>MORGAN:  I didn't say that.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Really quickly I want to get your quick take.  We reported  earlier that California is considering mandating one woman being onboard,  you're a woman who clearly in a very high profile position in corporate  America.  Your take.  </p><p>MORGAN:  So, I would -- I think most women, I know myself included, I silt  onboard of Bank of New York Mellon.  I want to be recognized and put in  positions based on my accomplishments and I think most women, most  underrepresented minorities feel the same ways.  I think it comes down to  leadership, right?  CEOs have it in their power to put women and  underrepresented minorities in leadership positions.</p><p>Boards have the ability to do this.  I look at our board at the bank, we  got 25 percent women on that board.  It's a leadership issue.  I think it's  all of the above.  I don't think it can be solved with just a quota.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Promotion and reward based on merit.  </p><p>MORGAN:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Very interesting.  </p><p>MORGAN:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I think that that's what -- that's what we wish for  everybody.  </p><p>MORGAN:  Yes.  And we have great -- and we have to help people get there.   When you focus on people, the numbers follow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Jennifer.</p><p>MORGAN:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A pleasure to see you.</p><p>MORGAN:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jennifer Morgan.  A war of words between New York Governor Cuomo  and his primary rival Cynthia Nixon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK:  My opponent lives in world of fiction.  I  live in world of fact.  Can you stop interrupting?  Can you stop  interrupting?</p><p>CYNTHIA NIXON (D), GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, NEW YORK:  Can you stop lying?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, the other (INAUDIBLE) from last night's debate straight  ahead.  And President Trump heads to Indiana.  Jeff Flock is there and he's  going to talk to some real folks.  Hey, Jeff.  </p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Oh, you know, Dagen they  say the imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  I don't know.  The  person not supposed to be here for another 12 hours but he might already be  here.  We'll have an exclusive interview with that fellow right there in  just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Thursday, August 30th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Breaking  news, we just got initial jobless claims, they came in at 213,000.  We are  watching that -- we were expecting 214,000.  We also got a look at personal  income and spending for the month of July.  Personal spending up four- tenths of a percent in line with expectations.  Same story with personal  income, it was right in line with what economists were looking for, gaining  three-tenths of one percent.  We also look at these, the personals  consumption, expenditures.  This is the Federal Reserve's most important  gauge of inflation, gaining 2.3 percent.  The core there up two percent.   So, inflation based on that in check, wages still growing faster than  inflation.  </p><p>Futures are showing this this morning, 57-point gain -- no, excuse me, 57- point loss on the Dow Futures.  Losses in Europe, to tell you about, those  markets lower as well, ever so slightly looking at England, France, and  Germany down about half of one percent.  In Asia overnight, there was a  single gainer there, the Nikkei up not even one-tenth of a percent in  overnight trading.  </p><p>The deadline approaches, trade talks with Canada kicking off again this  morning, President Trump optimistic that Canada will join the new trade  deal with Mexico before tomorrow's deadline.</p><p>Spat in the city, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and primary rival Cynthia  Nixon kicking it up a notch in last night's gubernatorial debate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CUOMO:  My opponent lives in the world of fiction, I live in world of  facts.  Can you stop you interrupting?  Can you stop interrupting?</p><p>NIXON:  Can you stop lying?</p><p>CUOMO:  Yes.  As soon as you do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait until you hear what else they said to one another.   California Senate making it harder for young people to buy guns, we have  the latest details on the vote to change the legal age, coming up.</p><p>It's an Apple acquisition, the iPhone maker just bought a company that  makes lenses for augmented reality.  We'll find out what new device might  be coming out of the House of Jobs.  And tragedy on the highway, many  lobsters were killed in a truck cash in Maine.  Now, the seafaring victims  may get a memorial from their friends at PETA.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, President Trump heading to Evansville,  Indiana for a rally tonight.  Jeff Flock already on the ground this morning  where he's talking to diners at the Merry Go Round Restaurant ahead of the  President's visit.  Hey, Jeff.</p><p>FLOCK:  You can't make this stuff up, Dagen.  You know, if you don't wonder  whether this is Trump country or not, I don't know.  Maybe a picture tells  a thousand words here.  Although, I tell you, it's interesting, you know,  you talk to people, we sometimes come into town before these rallies just  to get a sense of the people of what they're about.  A lot of people like  the President's policies, not of them -- all of them are crazy about the  President himself, although this girl, I think is.  Now, you look like  somebody I might know. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, I'm going to be in town a little bit later in and  out of the Ford Center.</p><p>FLOCK:  There you go.  I don't know if that's real but there you go.  And  you're a supporter of the President.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>FLOCK:  A farmer?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>FLOCK:  Why?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I just believe that he's going to do good for the  markets eventually.  Going to take a while to get the instability out of  him, but --</p><p>FLOCK:  If he raising corn and soybeans, and of course, those prices are  pretty far down.  Yes, go ahead.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't think Indiana is no longer a flyover state  because Donald has been here twice down the last two years.  He cares about  Midwest.</p><p>FLOCK:  There you go.  I hear you, sir.  I hear you.  I want to represent  everything fair and balanced over there, I got a table full of Democrats,  too, and we want to get a sense from them, too.  These guys meet here  frequently -- boy, man, they can eat, too.  Hey, Larry, I'm sorry to  interrupt you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No problem.</p><p>FLOCK:  Lifelong democrat.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, sir.</p><p>FLOCK:  A schoolteacher, you support the President right now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  oh, I'm a convert, for sure.</p><p>FLOCK:  What happened?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, I saw back when Clinton was in office, and what  happened with the things he did in office, so a big change in the attitude  of kids.</p><p>FLOCK:  Teachers, school tearchers?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, I mean, when we catch somebody red-handed, they're  doing something they deny, deny, deny.</p><p>FLOCK:  But now, wait a minute, what about this president here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, I've changed my philosophy a little bit.  I'm  voting for policy not people.  And I -- I'm impressed with what Trump has  done and capable of doing with his hands tied.</p><p>FLOCK:  With the -- not so impressed with the tariffs?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, I'm not.  But if you look at history, there has  been a lot of Presidents have been questionable.</p><p>FLOCK:  I guess you're right on that one.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There it comes a point in time where, yes, you want  America to be better than it is, and I can't understand the Democrats --</p><p>FLOCK:  I got you --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Open walls and higher taxes.</p><p>FLOCK:  Larry, I appreciate it.  You can tell, Larry, is actually democrat,  because if you look down there, Kyl, he may be wearing overalls but he got  a pair of flip-flops on, that's a dead giveaway right there.  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is that how we judge somebody's political affiliation now, Jeff  Flock, I really don't think that's fair.  And those folks in Indiana sound  a lot like me.</p><p>FLOCK:  The father of superficiality.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I said those folks in --</p><p>FLOCK:  We're pretty far south here.  We're pretty far south.  You know,  these folks from Indiana, this is Southern Indiana, and we're south of  Louisville here, so pretty amazing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Pretty amazing.  You tell that fellow I said that on the air,  earlier, it's policy not personality, so you tell him I said that.</p><p>FLOCK:  I think it makes a lot of sense to a lot more people these days.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It does.  Jeff Flock, thank you so much for that.  James  Freeman, your reaction to what you heard.  I love that line about Indiana  is not a flyover state anymore because the President has been here twice  recently.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And I'm not sure how representative that crew is but suggests  maybe there are -- there is some patience on the part of farmers.  They  don't like these tariffs but they feel like we're generally heading in a  good direction, and I would say, Robert, you might have a better sense of  the incumbent Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly, looks like he's going to  have his hands full this November with Mike Braun.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, I think -- listen, Joe Donnelly is a -- you know, he's a blue  collar guy, he fits incredibly well with police and fire, and the farmers,  and a popular guy in Indiana.  That being said, Trump is incredibly popular  in Indiana and there's going to be a real battle on the swing states in the  Senate whether it's here or Montana, or Missouri, and there's a slew of  them where it's I think a strong Democratic incumbent who's good locally  against an incredibly popular national President in those -- in those  states.  And then also, that's why right now most of them are flipping.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Will he -- will he vote for Kavanaugh?</p><p>WOLF:  I think that -- my gut tells me that Kavanaugh will, you know, be on  the Supreme Court.  And that some of the swing state candidates will likely  vote for Kavanaugh.  You know, I can't say I love the process, obviously, I  think there's -- there was better ways to go about it, especially, based on  the past.  But I think right now, the Democratic Party has to realize that  they're in a battle in these swing states in the Senate. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are 10 -- there are 10 democratic senators who are up for  re-election in states that Trump won.  10.</p><p>WOLF:  And I would say some of them.  I look at someone like Manchin and  Casey (ph).  They're probably in pretty good shape in West Virginia and  Pennsylvania look at someone like Kyrsten Sinema and the fellow running,  Phil Bredesen in Tennessee and Arizona.  They probably have a better  chance.  And then, you have a real group of us toss-ups I think it's going  to be quite interesting, you know, what happens, and a lot will be based on  what the economy does, you know, right into the midterms. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, part of the problem for some Democrats and you'll -- we  can talk about the language that we used to describe them, was kind of  highlighted in New York.  Things got heated.  There was the gubernatorial  debate between Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Cynthia Nixo, the actresss  political new comment.  Just listed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CUOMO:  My opponent lives in a world of fiction, I live in the world of  fact.  Can you stop interrupting?  Can you stop interrupting?</p><p>NIXON:  Can you stop lying?</p><p>CUOMO:  Yes.  As soon as you do.</p><p>NIXON:  We already have a corrupt corporate Republican in the White House,  we don't need a corrupt corporate Democrat in Albany as his main  opposition.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A lot of what you heard when you talk about abolishing ICE, she  tosses that out there like it's a foregone conclusion, and what did the  governor call members of ICE?  He took a shot -- he took a shot at  basically members of law enforcement in this country.  This is -- these </p><p>WOLF:  Thugs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thugs -- these individuals are pushing people left.  Do you  agree or not?  You don't even want to call him Democrat.</p><p>WOLF:  Listen, I -- (INAUDIBLE) you know I'm not part of the populous left.   I'm definitely, you know, socially to the left and probably more physically  conservative than most Republicans are today.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's talking about trade.</p><p>FREEMAN:  When I -- when I look at that debate, that doesn't make me feel  good living in the State of New York.  I think actually Governor Cuomo will  do a really good job for the State of New York.  I think that when we're  debating whether ICE is important or not, I don't think that's a debate we  should be having.  I think the debate should be more about the economy and  what they can do policy, not whether the air condition should be at 76, 76  or 68.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how petty it is.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And so, you know, that's -- it is disappointing for me but as  someone in New York and as a Democrat, I think Governor Cuomo will be the  right guy, and I don't think we should be pushed left as a party.  I like  people like Tim Ryan out of Ohio who actually is a pro-growth democrat.   That's someone that's taking about not that $15.00 minimum wage is  important, but that a little wage is important.  There is -- sorry, go  ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, but I was going to say, here's the problem, that these  loudmouths in the major cities, in California and in New York, they drive  the messaging for a lot of Democrats and this is what people across the  country hear if they turn on other television networks.  And I've spend so  much time down helping taking care of my mother, down in Rural Virginia.   And people who live in these big cities, who live in these blue state bay  are missing what is going on in this country, and they are missing out  people feel about the economy and about President Trump, again, policy over  personality.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think a lot of people in Upstate New York watching that  debate were disappointed thinking it was like watching a fight for mayor of  New York City, where was -- they wanted to hear a lot more about how you  revive growth in the cities, outside of New York City, upstate New York,  and I don't think they got too much on that last night.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you know what, you loosen up those dairy restrictions of  exports going into Canada you know that helps upstate New York big time.   Coming up, eye on retail earnings we break down the numbers next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amazon may soon join the trillion-dollar club.  Gerri Willis on  the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more.  Hey, Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, Dagen, that's right.  So,  pretty exciting stuff.  We've been watching Amazon shares here all morning  trading just below that 2000, level 1997.50 not far to go from here, and,  of course, to join that 2,000 -- to join the trillion-dollar club with  Apple, they'd have to hit 2050.57.  So, that will be the benchmark for  that.  Very exciting stuff.  We'll keep an eye on it.  Meanwhile, if you  are getting used to these retailers coming back, the brick-and-mortar  retailers doing really well.  Think about it again, Abercrombie and Fitch  missing on same-store sales three percent versus 3.7.  A disappointment  there, the shares trading lower, as you can see, down 10 percent.  Also,  Dollar General same-store sales beat estimates 3.7 percent but the full- year profit outlook was disappointing.  Interesting there, mix of business,  went to low margin consumable items like toothpaste, not good, Dollar Tree  also missing same-store estimates.  That stock down as well.  So, these  brick-and-mortar stores, not doing so well here.  Back to you, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gerri, thank you so much for that.  Turning to politics, Newt  Gingrich was talking about this earlier, California Gubernatorial Candidate  Gavin Newsom is now backing universal health care for illegally immigrants.   Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GAVIN NEWSOM, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA:  I did universal health  care when I was mayor, fully implemented regardless of pre-existing  conditions (INAUDIBLE) and regardless of your immigration status.   (INAUDIBLE) is the only universal health care plan for all undocumented  residents very proud of that and we proved it can be done without  bankrupting the city.  I'd like to see that we can extend that to the rest  of the state.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mr. Varney, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\" </p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Forgive me for rolling my  eyes, but that is final lunacy.  It looks like, to me, the socialists are  having an increasingly important role to play within the Democrat Party.   Just put California aside for a moment, look at Florida, a socialist -- an  avowed socialist has made it to the gubernatorial final in Florida.  In New  York, last night, the avowed socialist Cynthia Nixon, I think she won the  debate against Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>And now, you've got California where Gavin Newsom as we just heard is going  for universal health care for all illegals in the state.  Who's going to  pay for that?  Well, business and the rich.  Can you imagine the exodus of  businesses and relatively wealthy people from California if they put this  kind of thing in place?  Can you imagine the welcome sign that he's hanging  out for everybody, anybody who's sick anywhere in the world, all you got to  do is get one foot in California and you are home free!  Financial lunacy!</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nine minutes away, more of Stuart.  We love you.  We'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CASONE:  -- sent to Democratic Governor Jerry Brown for his signature.   Well, Apple is setting its sights on Augmented Reality, the company  confirming it's acquired a Akonia Holographics, it's a start-up that makes  lenses for Augmented Reality glasses.  The term is not disclosed.  Apple  won't discuss what it plans to do with Akonia, but the deal could help the  company develop an augmented reality headset.  Apple shares are slightly  higher ahead of the opening bell.</p><p>And then, there is this, animal rights group PETA is trying to erect a 5- foot tall granite tombstone at the site of a lobster truck crash that  happened in Brunswick, Maine.  About 7,000 pounds of lobster were destroyed  last week in the wreck.  So, the average size for a lobster was a pound and  half, that means about 4500 lobsters died in this crash.  Well, I mean, it  died before but you know what I'm saying.  Maine's Department of  Transportation is currently reviewing the tombstone that PETA wants to put  up in their memory.  PETA says it hopes the tombstone will, quote, remind  everybody that the best way to prevent such tragedies is to go vegan.  Yes.   I will send that back to you.  You just chew on that one for a minute.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, rather than scolding people who choose to eat meat and  seafood, they're trying to use a little bit of humor and trying to be light  about it, PETA.  I would just -- James is still laughing, he's been  laughing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  That's what -- I wasn't sure if it was a gag from PETA or --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it's not really a -- it's sort of a gag -- no, I -- you  know what, I don't -- I'm not going to lecture anybody about what they eat,  but that means meat eaters shouldn't lecture me about eating vegetable.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Meantime, Jared Kushner arriving moments ago for the latest  round of trade talks with Canada.  Those talks set to begin in less than  four minutes.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Robert Wolf, James freeman, and Morgan  Ortagus.  You get five seconds Morgan, and you're the only other lady here,  so --</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Thank you.  I just want to say, Dagen, yesterday, you and I  watched the processional for Senator McCain.  We're all going to be  watching over the weekend and honoring a great man.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This afternoon, 1:00 p.m.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  I certainly will, and good morning, Dagen.  Good morning,  everyone. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

So --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CASONE: You got to get right in the spot Dagen, right on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MCDOWELL: It's one of those mornings and I wasn't even late. So --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CASONE: You never are.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. I got like four new bruises this morning. Ladies, thank you so much, great to see you both. And I've already made James Freeman laugh and it's 5:59 in the morning.</p><p>Hey everybody, I'm giving it away who's on the show this morning. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Thursday, August 30th. Your top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Looking good as we inch closer to the deadline tomorrow, officials from the U.S. and Canada optimistic that a trade deal will be reached.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think Canada very much wants to make the deal and I think it's going to be obviously very good for Canada if they do and I think it's probably not going to be good at all if they don't.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying a deal could be reached only if it's good for Canada.</p><p>Investors are still worried about trade but we have had day-after-day of new all-time highs on the S&amp;P500, NASDAQ, and the Russell2000. This morning we have a picture that's lower to the downside, Dow Futures off by 844 points at the moment.</p><p>As I pointed out, we had record highs yesterday for your broad market gauges hitting their fourth consecutive record close.</p><p>In Europe take a look at England, France, and Germany. We have losses across the board to tell you about. The biggest loser at the moment is the DAX in Germany, down about one percent.</p><p>Trade tensions between China and the U.S. weighing on the Asian markets, we have slight gain on the Nikkei but Hong Kong, Shanghai and South Korea all lower on the day.</p><p>A new round of U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods imported from China set to hit later next month.</p><p>Trump versus Google, the president of United States criticizing the search giant for bias against conservative voices. We'll show you the evidence that Trump posted to back it up and we do have Google's response.</p><p>Salesforce selloff, shares of Salesforce sliding after the company's earnings report we break down those numbers.</p><p>And one for the books, the Green Bay Packers Quarterback Aaron Rodgers signing a mega deal making him the highest paid NFL player. We have the details of the incredible deal.</p><p>Duck and cover, the world's biggest food fight, you won't believe how many people were there to chuck tomatoes at one another.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning, National Security Analyst Morgan Ortagus. Borrowed Time Co-Author James Freeman. Actually, that's on my reading list.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I bought it on my Kindle. And 32Advisors Founder and CEO, Fox Business Contributor Robert Wolf.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Great.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Has clearly been on the golf course a lot.</p><p>WOLF: Yes. A little -- a little bit. I mean, if you call my hacking golf. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well as much as your -- as much as you play, your game should be good and better.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, it's not. But I'm fun to play with. I mean -- but the game is not getting much better.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And you were fun to spend a morning with us.</p><p>WOLF: I'm glad to be here with James and Morgan and You.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And glad -- thanks for the --</p><p>FREEMAN: Likewise.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thanks for the courtesy laugh at 5:58 in the morning.</p><p>FREEMAN: I got to thank you for the book plug. So you realize you don't have to read it as long as you buy it.</p><p>WOLF: Yes. I'm reading it too. I'm going to just say I'm reading it too because I want to plug it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I am reading --</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I haven't bought it or read it but I'll buy it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is about Citi Group.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, that's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is about the bubblelicious Citi Group, the rise and fall.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The rise and fall.</p><p>FREEMAN: You're wondering their history and really strong bank before the government was standing behind it. Then once the government got behind it, not such a good history.</p><p>WOLF: Well as a former Salomon Brothers guy that was bought by Citi Group that's now run by a former Salomon Brothers guy, I'm rooting for them. So I hope the book is rooting for them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well we're here --</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, it's topped with fate.</p><p>WOLF: How about that?</p><p>MCDOWELL: As we will be all morning long and everything that we talk about whether it's trade, the market, there was that debate last night between the candidates for the governor of New York.</p><p>And also coming this morning, CFRA Investment -- Chief Investment Strategist Sam Stovall. Former White House Press Secretary, Fox News Contributor, Ari Fleischer. Senate Finance Committee Member, the Senator one of two, from Pennsylvania, Pat Toomey. Former Speaker of the House, Fox News Contributor Newt Gingrich. And SAPAmerica's President Jen Morgan.</p><p>We have some incredible guests coming up. But right here right now, optimism on trade, both President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sounding optimistic about reaching a trade agreement by tomorrow's deadline. The commander-in-chief commenting on the negotiation yesterday at the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think Canada very much wants to make the deal and I think it's going to be obviously very good for Canada if they do and I think it's probably not going to be good at all if they don't. We have a very good relationship.</p><p>They came yesterday to the White House and we negotiated late into the evening, they're in the White House right now, we're negotiating with them right now and they want to be part of a deal. And we gave until Friday and I think we're probably on track. We'll see what happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do we get a deal by tomorrow James Freeman? Here's my quote that I wrote down from President Trump, \"I love Canada. I love Mexico.\" So there you go. If he's sounding positive that way, it can't be bad.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. That is progress, isn't it? And, yes, I think they get a deal. Remember, they don't have to agree on every phrase, every comma, and period right now. They just have to basically agree on where they're going and they've got this timeline to move it through the various legislatures.</p><p>But I think they will get a deal because although consumers aren't going to necessarily like it to buy autos, the Canadian government likes what the U.S. did with Mexico. They liked these new efforts to keep manufacturing in the U.S. and Canada versus Mexico. So I think there's a lot of reason for Canada to cut a deal and we buy 75 percent of their exports.</p><p>MCDOWELL: To get into the ways because we love doing that Morgan, the two sticking points for Canada -- the United States wants more access to the -- to selling dairy into Canada and then Canada wants to keep these existing dispute resolution panels that are used to resolve conflicts about tariffs among the three countries.</p><p>But that sounds like in the grand scheme of things, ideas that can be resolved or problems that can be resolved.</p><p>ORTAGUS: I think you're right. I think something else that this administration has said that they want to resolve with Canada is I.P. protections and that was -- that has been written into the new agreement, the new proposed agreement with Mexico.</p><p>And the USTR has been actually quite tough on Canada's position on I.P. and that's been a real sticking point for them in addition to dairy farmers. The real challenge I see with all of this Dagen is that no matter what comes -- no matter what happens whether it's just a deal with Mexico or whether it's fully renegotiated NAFTA, this is going to slip into 2019.</p><p>For congressional approval you'll need -- they'll need approval from both the House and the Senate. Clearly there's a chance that we're looking at least the Democrat House. So the strategy there, you know, will the -- will the democrats especially someone like Bernie Sanders who supported a trade agenda similar to the president, will they support this or leading up to 2020? Are they going to oppose this deal just simply because it's something that Donald Trump negotiated?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well let's ask this big old democrat.</p><p>WOLF: Well listen, I think I've been to the right of the conservative party on trade because I've been for TPP, I've been for iterating NAFTA. So I don't mind as a former advisor to the president on export counsel, I'm a supporter of this.</p><p>I think the president trying to do NAFTA2.0 is a good thing. If we can iterate, OK, where there's better labor standards in Mexico that brings the pricing up, so we're not -- cheap labor is not the beneficiary of kind of the detriment to the U.S., those are good things.</p><p>That being said, whether it's tomorrow or a week from tomorrow, or a month away, I think we should just make sure we get the best possible deal, OK, for both sides. That can, you know, stand the time. That being said, we should also, you know, make changes throughout.</p><p>One of the problems with NAFTA1.0 is we haven't really changed it in over two decades. So this is important to have the right changes, it seems like it's in the right trajectory, and it certainly seems with Chrystia Freeland their trade minister flying back immediately to try to do something is a good sign.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. She was scheduled to go to Europe to --</p><p>WOLF: She -- right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- this week and she said, \"Hey, I'm staying in North America and head south.\"</p><p>WOLF: And as far as the dems, you know, what I would say is that if it's a -- if it's a good agreement between Canada and Mexico, just not bilateral with Mexico, I actually think it will pass both the House and the Senate.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well they need that for fast-track status.</p><p>WOLF: I think it will pass the boat.</p><p>ORTAGUS: That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They need that for fast-track status.</p><p>ORTAGUS: In addition to what Robert said about labor, there's also new rules on the environment, also on I.P. protection as we talked about. So I think there's some positive things that both parties could look to but the Journal did criticize this as, you know, Dagen, they called it, \"Politically managed trade.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, James.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS: \"The economic logic is the opposite of Mr. Trump's domestic deregulation agenda.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well the headline was --</p><p>FREEMAN: True. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- it is notably worse than NAFTA, the original NAFTA in many ways. And you talk about the -- how they were court in the likes of Sherrod Brown in Ohio and Sherrod up for re-election this year.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Again, that this reads like something that democrats wrote or maybe even the auto unions, the original Mexico deal.</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. I think it may be hard for people like Sherrod Brown to turn this down because it does move in his direction. And for that reason I think that we should expect auto consumers are going to pay more.</p><p>This is sand in the gears of the North American supply chains that have made it much more competitive here. It is -- it is not so great for Mexico but good for Canada and the U.S. auto sector in terms of unionized labor there.</p><p>So that's -- look, but I -- there's no reason in the world the president if he gets something on dairy should not give Canada what they want a dispute resolution because once he gets the NAFTA he wants, he doesn't need to put on any more tariffs. So there's no reason he shouldn't be able to --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Give up -- give on them.</p><p>FREEMAN: -- give on that issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We have $650 million dairy trade surplus with Canada. So there's -- you know, it's a great talking point on the campaign trail. But the fact is that we benefit mightily from imports into Canada --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. But we'd sell a lot more if they didn't have the barriers they have.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Very, very -- well, I want to move -- I want move along to China.</p><p>WOLF: Listen -- sorry, go ahead Dagen. That's how (INAUDIBLE) move to.</p><p>MCDOWELL: China's commerce ministry saying today that trade issues with the U.S. can only be resolved through talks as equals. So do we see China getting ready for a drawn-out fight where certainly businesses in this country that whether they export to China, whether they import goods from China or watching that $200 billion mark that China -- that the United States is talking about, additional tariffs on that.</p><p>As the Wall Street Journal Editorial Page today writes about how because of retaliatory tariffs, the cherry farmers in the Pacific Northwest have lost $86 million on sweet cherries just this summer, James?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes. This has cost. I mean, I -- when we talk about optimism for getting a deal here, it's not that I think these deals are all wonderful. Higher tariffs, more barriers are a negative as we're seeing in NAFTA.</p><p>I hope he -- the president focuses on his message to the E.U. which is let's take tariffs down to zero everywhere, that ought to be the goal. I think this is going to take a while with China to resolve it but I think if he resolves NAFTA and he resolves it with Europe and you have them, the whole world focused on China and its intellectual property theft, I think China is eventually going to have to change.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Real quick and then I'll get your comments on China and Europe because you mentioned Europe yesterday because Harley-Davidson has been a punching bag for the president. It was celebrating its 115th anniversary in Wisconsin yesterday.</p><p>The American motorcycle maker coming under fire from the president because it said, \"Hey, we got retaliatory tariffs from Europe, we're going to move some production overseas. Harley owners and Trump supporters sounded off at an event.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEANNA KYROLE, HARLEY-DAVIDSON SUPPORTER: It is about bottom line and if he was controlling his business he would be doing the same thing, if not worst. At least they're trying their best to keep everything at home.</p><p>MARTY GERNOWSKI, TRUMP SUPPORTER: I'm proud to have Harley here in Milwaukee and if they have to do what they have to do for a profit and make price in another country, then so be it.</p><p>DAVID GULOTTA, HARLEY-DAVIDSON &amp; TRUMP SUPPORTER: Harley-Davidson has survived for 115 years, you know. Through a lot -- through a lot more adverse situations than what they're dealing with right now, you know. The motor company will survive, I have faith in that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: That just shows Robert that regular folks in this country voters whether they're right, left, or center, they are connected to what's going on with trade.</p><p>WOLF: Listen, tariffs have unintended consequences. The idea that we're battling with Europe, OK, is absurd, OK? The truth is and I think as James pointed out and Morgan, our real concern is China.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.</p><p>WOLF: I brought it up earlier and you've been bringing it up for a year now, we should stay in TPP and we should -- the best way to attack China is to have trading agreements with the 11 countries around China, Australia, New Zealand, Philippines.</p><p>The idea that we dropped TPP because it was an Obama-led trade agreement is ridiculous, it's not the right thing. And my gut tells me if you look at what we're doing with Mexico and Canada, it actually is very similar to TPP. It's about labor standards, environmental standards.</p><p>My gut tells me that will be the next thing we go after because a bilateral negotiation with China is not around the corner.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Right.</p><p>WOLF: Because it's all about -- as Morgan said it has to do with I.P., that's our biggest concern. There is nothing in the trade agreement that's going to withstand they are stealing our I.P.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Final word Morgan.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Well I think in addition to I.P. it's also about investment, right? And the type of restrictions on U.S. investment into China and what has always been incredibly worrying to me, Dagen, is, you know, the amount of Chinese communist propaganda that the regime makes American corporations spew put out on their social media when they do business there and that should be a concern for all American businesses.</p><p>And this -- also the shady nefarious tactics of the Chinese government in the country, they'll put out misinformation about American companies that are doing business there to turn people away from and they've done it -- done it before and there's a lot that we don't see in terms of them retaliating against us, it's not just here on our shore.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you Morgan, James, Robert. Oh boy, we've got so much to talk about. Salesforce sliding, shares of the business software maker taking a hit after strong earnings but a weak outlook. We'll tell you what the company CEO had to say too about taxes.</p><p>And food fight, thousands turning out for Spain's massive tomato throwing festival, we've got the incredible pictures and we demo in studio. Straight ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: People in Arizona saying goodbye to the late Senator John McCain at the State Capitol. Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. Dagen, good morning. There were about 15,000 people came to pay their respects to the late senator who served the state for 36 years in Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JON KYL, FORMER ARIZONA SENATOR: John's love for America and Arizona. He represented our values all over the world as senator from Arizona and America is stronger for his fierce defense of our values. We can be proud he was our senator.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Today a memorial service will be held at the North Baptist Phoenix Church where former -- North Phoenix Baptist Church, excuse me, where Vice President Joe Biden is scheduled to speak and 24 sitting senators are going to be attending as well.</p><p>Then his casket will depart Arizona and head for Washington. More services planned later this week.</p><p>Well, Campbell Soup says that it plans to sell its international and refrigerated food businesses which bring in about $2.1 billion, this transaction will bring in that much. And this move opens the door to an outright sale of the company that sold possibility.</p><p>Campbell Soup CEO Denise Morrison unexpectedly stepped down back in May, there's been a lot of pressure from shareholders on Campbell to do something. They're also going to be reporting the -- excuse me, they did beat on earnings and missed on revenue this morning. Shares of Campbell super low in the pre-markets.</p><p>You've got the breaking news and you've got the earnings as well pressuring Campbell Soup. The stock is down more than a four and a quarter percent right now.</p><p>Well, we're also watching Salesforce right now. The company's results coming in better than expected but the stock is under pressure this morning after they issued a disappointing earnings outlook for the third quarter.</p><p>Co-CEO Mark Benioff also touting President Trump's tax cuts and deregulation. But the stock is down about three percent right now in the pre-market. This is the stock to watch today as well when the bells ring at 9:30.</p><p>And then there is this, 20,000 people hurling tomatoes at each other at Spain's annual Tomatina Festival yesterday. This is known as the world's largest food fight. More than 30,000 pounds of tomato were thrown. For one hour people tossing each other with all of those, by the way, overripe tomatoes Dagen.</p><p>And I like -- I like your thinking this morning that we should, you know, try and replay this in studio, you know, do our own version of a food fight. I'll work on that for the next hour.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, that's a Tuesday afternoon at my place.</p><p>CASONE: I think it looks fun. I wish I'd do it.</p><p>WOLF: A little animal house action.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, exactly.</p><p>WOLF: A little animal house action won't hurt anyone.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. I'm not going to do Robert Wolf. Guess what I am? A scene from animal house. Cheryl, thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, slamming big tech, President Trump targeting Google. Bernie Sanders takes aim at Amazon. We'll tell you about it ahead.</p><p>Plus, Friends fashion.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOEY TRIBBIANI: OK buddy boy, here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: So did Balenciaga take a cue from Joey? You won't believe how much this layered look will cost you. It is an eye-popping price tag, that's ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Wall Street rally, stocks surging. The S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ hitting all-time highs for the fourth day in a row. The technology sector and optimism over trade negotiations driving the major market gauges to those new highs including the Russell2000.</p><p>Here now Sam Stovall, CFRA Research Chief Investment Strategist. Sam, how are you?</p><p>SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: Good, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Great to see you. Your reaction to this? The question in every investor's mind is can this market keep going? What would get in the way?</p><p>STOVALL: Oh, I think it can. First though we have a trifecta of new highs, the S&amp;P500, NASDAQ, Russell2000. So when you've got that kind of breath, when you have the widening out of the participation in this rally, that tends to be pretty good.</p><p>We also recouped all that we lost in the correction from January 26th to February 11th. History basically says we go on to advance by almost nine and a half percent on average and we don't stumble again for another four months. So not to say that that's exactly how it's going to play out this time but usually when you hit a new all-time high that tends to add to investor confidence.</p><p>WOLF: So just to play devil's advocate, although I'm rooting for the bull market, let's go back to our earlier years, you know, this reminds me a lot of 2000.</p><p>STOVALL: OK.</p><p>WOLF: OK? In 2000, we -- that was the last time --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yikes.</p><p>WOLF: Are you saying yes?</p><p>FREEMAN: I was saying yikes.</p><p>WOLF: OK. You'll see where I'm going with it then. In 2000 that was the last time consumer confidence was this high, OK? So we had the highest since 2000 announced last week.</p><p>We were on the incredible trajectory and then all of a sudden 2000 comes and we had a two-year down trade, you know, starting with the dot.com bubble. It was all kind of, you know, a one-way direction and then all of a sudden we had the turn.</p><p>My question is, long-winded, do you think with the raising rate environment, you know, fiscal deficit concerns and possibly based on where the yield curve is, the possibility of a slowdown based on what, you know, the yield curve's at least predicting for GDP. Does that change kind of your horizon and thoughts at all?</p><p>STOVALL: I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hey, at least he admitted that.</p><p>FREEMAN: I admitted it.</p><p>STOVALL: I'm kidding you. I'm kidding you.</p><p>WOLF: Don't forget here because, you know, James caught me off track --</p><p>FREEMAN: I'm sorry I interrupted.</p><p>WOLF: -- with the yikes. Did I talk about your book yet?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Go ahead.</p><p>STOVALL: No, those are good questions. First off, we're the second most expensive bull markets since World War II with trailing earnings being, you know, above the long-term average. Also on an S&amp;P500 market cap to nominal GDP, we're more than twice as high as the average over the past 50 years.</p><p>WOLF: This is kind of like a softball for you right now.</p><p>STOVALL: Well -- but then comma, I think that we probably could --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Semicolon, next thought. Go ahead.</p><p>STOVALL: Well I got good grammar than most but my punctuation is pretty bad. I think that we probably still have some life left because we have never slipped into a bear market in the past 65 years when interest rates were below inflation where they are today.</p><p>We'd have to see at least two more rate hikes before we even equal the year-on-year change in core CPI. And then we would have to have three more rate hikes next year just to get close to that threshold at first we -- the threat of falling into a bear market.</p><p>So I still think that monetary policy is quite simulative at this point and with the Fed basically telling us what they're going to do, I'd like to say that a boxer is rarely fell by the punch he expects and at least it's not going to come from the Fed.</p><p>FREEMAN: And I guess comparing the 2000 hoping maybe this isn't a reefed, you don't really see this sort of peps.com phenomenon of lots of non- companies that are public even though they're not really businesses and don't have real earnings.</p><p>STOVALL: True. You're not really seeing the exuberance that typically bull markets look like incandescent light bulbs and tend to glow right just before they go out. So I'm not getting the questions from the newspaper vendors as to, \"Gee, what stocks should I be buying or them telling me what stocks to buy?\"</p><p>So I agree, it's still -- investors are very skeptical about this events. And so as a result, it might have some life left.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And they are willing to beat the, you know what, the stuffing out of a stock like Facebook.</p><p>STOVALL: Oh sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But when it misses and gives guidance that investors were shocked by, I know that Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft all hit new all-time highs yesterday but they're not buying every tech stock hand-over fist to your point.</p><p>FREEMAN: And I wonder about the techs. I mean I look at regulation as probably good for the giants, they end up benefiting from it but do you look at that as a negative? Does that make you worried about these stocks we're talking about, the fangs?</p><p>STOVALL: Well the -- I mean the fangs in opinion are very difficult from tech in general. Typically, tech is the best performing sector in a rising rate environment because they have the lowest dividend yields combined with companies need to add to their technology to improve the productivity of their -- of the employees that they're not going to be adding on to in the future.</p><p>But I would say look toward the value side, if we see more gravitation, more interest in value stocks that implies and investors think that there's life and that they could actually sit with them for a little while while they recover.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Sam Stovall, great to see you.</p><p>STOVALL: Thanks Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And thanks for the humor this morning before 6:30. Coming up, taking on technology, speaking of that, James mentioned more regulation or even some regulation on technology companies. President Trump renewing his attacks on Google, why he says that the platform is biases.</p><p>And every day heroes, a police body camera capturing a dramatic rescue at sea. One of the rescued men refusing to leave his fishing rod behind, we have that story coming up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Thursday, August 30th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>In looming deadline, trade talks with Canada, kicking off again, this morning, President Trump expressing optimism that Canada will join the new trade deal with Mexico before tomorrow's deadline.</p><p>Checking the market action this morning, amid these trade talks, we have an 89-point loss on the Dow Futures right now, Futures are lower on the S&amp;P and NASDAQ 100 as well, but yesterday, more records coming out of these markets, the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, hitting all-time highs, along with the Russell 2000.</p><p>In Europe, markets are lower this morning, losses in England, France and Germany, to tell you about, the DAX down nearly one percent.</p><p>And then, also, let's check on Asian markets, losses across the board except for a very, very slight gain on the Nikkei in Japan.</p><p>Slamming Silicon Valley, President Trump, calling out Google, saying that the search giant promoted President Obama's State of the Union speeches on the site, but not his own, the President, speaking out about the tech company, yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat Conservatives and Republicans very unfairly. I think it's a very serious problem because they're really trying to silence a very large part of this country and those people don't want to be silenced. It's not right. It's not fair. It may not be legal. But we'll see. We just want fairness.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: How Google is responding, that's next. An incredible rescue, more video of this police officer saving three men from the water after their boat capsizes. We will show you that.</p><p>And one for the record books, we'll tell you about the jaw-dropping contract extension for quarterback Aaron Rodgers, that will make him the highest paid player in NFL history.</p><p>And please call the Fashion Police, where is Joan Rivers when you need her? Balenciaga unveiling a jacket with -- well, that looks like this, it looks like one shirt on top of a shirt, on top of a coat, on top of a sweatshirt, and it costs thousands of dollars, literally. We will tell you -- you have to stay with us, why people are comparing this style to Joey from Friends.</p><p>But to our top story this half hour, Trump versus tech, the President making it clear that he wants fairness for Conservatives from major technology companies like Google and Facebook.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat Conservatives and Republicans very unfairly. I hear that they're holding hearings in Congress over the next couple of weeks.</p><p>And I think it's a very serious problem because they're really trying to silence a very large part of this country and those people don't want to be silenced. It's not right. It's not fair. It may not be legal. But we'll see. We just want fairness.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Google firing back after President Trump tweeted a video in which he claims Google's homepage did not promote his State of the Union Address, even though President Trump -- President Obama's was highlighted.</p><p>Here to discuss, Former White House Press Secretary, FOX News Contributor, Ari Fleischer. We talk about this on a business show because if this White House is going to move to regulate the tech companies because of some of its obvious bias, this is in dispute that would hurt business. What do you say, Ari?</p><p>ARI FLEISCHER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, I don't mind politicians who occasionally throw high inside heat. Sometimes you need to do a little bit of that to make your people who oppose you in politics, back off a little bit, give you more fair coverage.</p><p>But once it crosses the line with the government trying to regulate speech or regulate private sectors right to publish things, that's where I draw a line. So if he's throwing inside heat, God bless him, have at it. Don't hit the batter, though, and don't regulate.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Morgan, you said the President, yesterday, did say he prefers not to pursue regulation of the internet giant. They're already -- it would be the DOJ, the FTC or the FCC that could add additional regulation.</p><p>There are other things that the White House could do, but again, this at the moment. Just looks like a lot of talk.</p><p>ORTAGUS: I think where the tech companies are right now is similar to where the banks were during the financial crisis, right? In terms of a complete --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Meaning a government bailout?</p><p>ORTAGUS: No, no, no. Not a government bailout, in terms of a regulatory perspective, not understanding where the winds are turning from both parties, right? And not getting out ahead of a lot of these stories.</p><p>And I think they continue to be the big media companies -- tech companies, tend to be, especially social media, incredibly reactive still. And I call for them -- I know you, Dagen, have as well, to start enforcing more self- regulatory measures, because if they don't, the government will regulate for them.</p><p>FLEISCHER: But let me stipulate, the government has no idea how to get this right (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>ORTAGUS: That will stop them, Ar.</p><p>FLEISCHER: Once you put a bunch of politicians in charge of speech in the tech industry, Facebook, Twitter, Google, it's going to turn into a fight over who gets the biggest political advantage as opposed to how to protect the most free speech. The cure for bad free speech is more free speech.</p><p>FREEMAN: Can I -- can I just respond that --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Google did respond by saying and calling the President out that he was actually inaccurate.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, here's what the Wall Street Journal writes today. Looking at the internet archive, this is that not -- non-profit that preserves historical snap shots. It appears to show that Google.com did promote President Trump's State of the Union at certain points during this year's speech and not at others.</p><p>There's several snapshots of the page that don't show promotion of the speech. But, again, there does appear to be some promotion of the State of the Union.</p><p>FLEISCHER: And I think it's fair, somebody needs to run it down to see whether or not Google promoted Trump as much as they promoted Obama. What the President put on Twitter was very clever. That video he had with Google promoting Obama, Obama, Obama, no Trump, very well done.</p><p>But is it accurate? Is it fully accurate? I don't know that yet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to get James in here real quick.</p><p>FREEMAN: I'm wondering, sort of, what you're hearing in terms of discussions within the administration. Because I think President Trump deserves a lot of credit for -- and his administration as appointees for not letting the FCC become the internet regulator, the way they regulated telephones.</p><p>Now, it seems this idea that oh, we'll have the FTC, another federal bureaucracy become the internet regulators, kind of, gaining ground here. I could see a lot of these big companies wanting to do a deal. Are you -- how worried should we be about this? Because I'm very concerned, I don't know how fast you think this thing is coming down the pike.</p><p>FLEISCHER: I think the true motivation for the White House is with all things, is protecting the President and protecting his image, because when you look at social media generally, Twitter, Facebook, it's biased against Republicans, it's biased against the President.</p><p>Everybody sees it, and knows it, and feels it. So, he's throwing back in trying to get them to modify their behavior by dealing with Donald Trump. Oh, it does, which is blowing the whistle in public.</p><p>There's a big difference between a public official blowing a whistle and signing a law. And he's right to blow a whistle. I don't want to see him sign a law because the government will botch it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, and also, we talked about -- there is obvious bias. Some of us have experienced or at least witnessed it in terms of Conservative speech on the social media platforms in particular. The bigger issue --</p><p>And I've been warning these tech companies for literally, years, is the reckless disregard for people's privacy and how these companies actually make money off of our most personal information. And how they have essentially handed it off to companies and app developers, Facebook did for years, we didn't even know about it.</p><p>FLEISCHER: Anybody who is on those platforms and puts their personal information on it and doesn't expect it to be shared is being naive. Once you tell everybody who your likes are, what your interests are, it's going to be shared. That's how they market it, that's how when you go on to Amazon, your product that you want to buy is already pulled up for you. There are also benefits to it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, so you can't claim ignorance. You have to -- you have to be aware of what -- if you're getting something for free, it's not for free. You just don't know how you're paying for it.</p><p>FLEISCHER: You want privacy, don't go online.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Thank you. Thank you, Ari. You know what, if you want privacy, don't walk the city streets nowadays because everybody's got a camera phone. You better be careful about cursing at somebody. Not you. I'm just saying in general.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Are you serious, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: You can't yell, you can't -- you can't yell anymore, not in the street. Speaking of New York and people yelling at each other, there was this bizarre back and forth between New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and candidate Cynthia Nixon in the first New York gubernatorial debate, just watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW CUOMO (D), GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK: My opponent lives in the world of fiction. I live in the world of fact. Can you stop interrupting? Can you stop interrupting?</p><p>CYNTHIA NIXON (D), GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, NEW YORK: Can you stop lying?</p><p>CUOMO: Yes, as soon as you do.</p><p>NIXON: We already have a corrupt corporate Republican in the White House. We don't need a corrupt corporate Democrat in Albany, as his main opposition.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Cuomo also doubling down on the Democratic talking point of abolishing immigration and customs enforcement, ICE. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CUOMO: New York State is the state that is suing Donald Trump for ripping babies from the arms of their mother. New York State is the state that says we will not cooperate with ICE, they're a bunch of thugs. He politicized ICE. They're a bunch of thugs. We said we will sue them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's the left going further left, Ari. What did you make of that?</p><p>FLEISCHER: I think if I'm a law enforcement officer anywhere, local cop, sheriff, state police trooper, I'm offended, thugs, because they're enforcing the law and doing their jobs? I hate politicians who talk like this. It is so offensive to the people who protect us.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But Cynthia Nixon has pushed him further left on this, don't you think?</p><p>FLEISCHER: Well, that's the problem, and he's caving. Cynthia Nixon says she wants to abolish ICE. So, Cuomo has to act tough too, so he says they're thugs, wrong.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Cynthia Nixon is right about one thing. She said that air conditioning is sexist. And considering Dagen and I are always freezing (INAUDIBLE) Cynthia Nixon is right, air conditioning is sexist.</p><p>FREEMAN: Politics is local.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What about a dose of what it's like to be in front of a live audience and there were supporters of Cynthia Nixon when he was bringing up like you live in the world of fiction, basically making fun of her television and acting career, that they booed him. You would hear it.</p><p>FLEISCHER: Can I go back to what you said? Can I make you wear this tie? I mean, it's terrible. We need a colder studio.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, and we need -- we need better leadership in New York State. And I know -- we didn't see it last night. Coming up -- thank you, Ari Fleischer, thank you for the humor, so early in the morning.</p><p>We tell you which state may soon become the first to mandate women on corporate boards.</p><p>And then, this shirt on shirt on jacket on sweatshirt, how much it will cost you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: California lawmakers taking a step to bring diversity to boardrooms, more chicks, they say, they mandate by law. Cheryl Casone has more. Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. You know, interesting -- I mean, certainly you may see more females in the boardroom or CEO, but lawmakers in California is taking this all a step further. They may soon require major companies that are headquartered in California have to put female directors on the board. Under this proposed law, boards will need to have at least one woman by the end of next year and at least two or three by the end of 2021. Those who don't will be fined. The law recently passed the state assembly and now heads back to the state senate and then the desk of Governor Jerry Brown. We'll keep you posted.</p><p>And then there is this, a dramatic rescue off of a Florida's coast.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Is everybody accounted for? I want to get everybody on the boat. Can you swim?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Grab the life ring.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Yes, that boat capsized. Police on Miami Beach released this body cam footage that shows three brothers that were rescued after their boat capsized. They had no life jackets on, by the way. Police believe that the boat was flipped by rough waters.</p><p>And then, a little n nostalgia for you, Dagen. Remember this scene from \"Friends\"\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK, buddy boy, here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Yes. Well, it seems that fashion designer Balenciaga has taken inspiration from Joey of all people. At Paris fashion week, the company debuted this heavily layered jacket. If it is for you, it's $9,000. As you can see, it's got an outer coat, it's got layers, it's got a hoodie, it's like five different jackets. And then they also released this, this is kind of strange, red squared shoes. So, people on social media say it looks like a carton of McDonald's French fries. These are $545. I mean, you can't make this stuff up. That jacket reminds me, Dagen, of a guy that tried to go through TSA security wearing all of these clothes so he wouldn't have to check a bag. Remember that? This is what it reminds me of.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But this is increasingly -- particularly what these fashion houses and women's fashion designers, it's like they're playing a joke on women. They're trying to see how foolish people will be with their money. It's literally $1,000 ripped gray sweatshirt.</p><p>ORTAGUS: Well, I was just thinking that because air conditioning is sexist, I need this jacket.</p><p>FREEMAN: I think they're playing a joke on men too, aren't they? That looks like the derelict campaign.</p><p>WOLF: Listen, Steve Bannon was wearing that outfit for a year and no one said -- he had like four layers. He had the shirt, the under shirt, the --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That officially -- you saying that will end that trend. It ended right now because --</p><p>WOLF: I'm telling you, Bannon was wearing five or six layers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Sister, sister. Serena and Venus set to square off in round three of the U.S. Open. We've got the preview.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Green Bay Packers Quarterback Aaron Rodgers has a lot of green coming his way. Jared Max has information on a record-setting contract extension. Hey, Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER: Dagen, suffice to day, it's a beautiful day in Mr. Rodgers neighborhood. Set to begin his 14th season of the NFL. Rodgers signs a four-year extension that reportedly could be worth in the Mr. Rodgers neighborhood of $180 million. The breakdown, $134 million in base salary. $103 million of which is guaranteed an NFL record and a league high annual average of $33.5 million.</p><p>We're going to see something tomorrow at the U.S. Open that we have not seen in over 20 years. Serena Williams won her second-round match at the U.S. Open on Wednesday in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2. Earlier, Serena's older sister Venus won her second-round match also in straight sets. And so, it will be an all sister affair. Tomorrow in flushing meadows not since January of 98, had the Williams sisters met this early in a grand slam tournament. Serena has won 17 of her 29 head to head matchups.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Go, Williams sisters. My favorite athletes of all time. Continue.</p><p>MAX: Defending Champion Rafael Nadal moved into the third round with a straight sets win, Wednesday night. However, 2012 champ, Andy Murray is done. He was eliminated in four sets by Fernando Verdasco.</p><p>All right, let's cycle over to Major League Baseball. The operative word here is \"cycle.\" When a player hits for a single, a double, a triple and home run of the same game, he hits for the cycle. Which is what the Brewers' Christian Yelich did against the Reds. He homered for the sixth time in his many games, and Milwaukee beat Cincinnati in 13 innings -- 13- 12 or 10 innings, I should say.</p><p>Last in national league attendance for likely 13th time in 14 years, the Miami Marlins promise more noise at games next season. The team encourages its fans to get loud, bring musical instruments, bells, and whistles, and flags to games next year. The team says it offers the region's diverse Latin American culture to show pride, get loud an in one section of the ballpark. It will be called communidad tres, sero, cinco -- Community 305.</p><p>Baseball and Budweiser, how about baseball and wine? Yes. Partnering with City Winery, the New York Yankees have opened a wine bar at Yankee stadium, which in addition to other wines and (INAUDIBLE) will offer Yankees' branded wines. City Winery's first permanent winery at sports stadium.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love it. Jared, thank you so much. And I'll shout out to the Williams sisters again. Jared Max with us. Straight ahead, Uber now looking to drone for food delivery. We'll tell you about it. That's on the next hour of MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It is Thursday, August 30th, your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern. Almost there.

So --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CASONE:  You never are.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I got like four new bruises this morning.  Ladies, thank  you so much, great to see you both.  And I've already made James Freeman  laugh and it's 5:59 in the morning.</p><p>Hey everybody, I'm giving it away who's on the show this morning.  I'm  Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Thursday, August 30th.  Your  top stories at 6:00a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Looking good as we inch closer to the deadline tomorrow, officials from the  U.S. and Canada optimistic that a trade deal will be reached.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think Canada very much  wants to make the deal and I think it's going to be obviously very good for  Canada if they do and I think it's probably not going to be good at all if  they don't.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying a deal could be  reached only if it's good for Canada.  </p><p>Investors are still worried about trade but we have had day-after-day of  new all-time highs on the S&amp;P500, NASDAQ, and the Russell2000.  This  morning we have a picture that's lower to the downside, Dow Futures off by  844 points at the moment.</p><p>As I pointed out, we had record highs yesterday for your broad market  gauges hitting their fourth consecutive record close.</p><p>In Europe take a look at England, France, and Germany.  We have losses  across the board to tell you about.  The biggest loser at the moment is the  DAX in Germany, down about one percent.</p><p>Trade tensions between China and the U.S. weighing on the Asian markets, we  have slight gain on the Nikkei but Hong Kong, Shanghai and South Korea all  lower on the day.</p><p>A new round of U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods imported from  China set to hit later next month.  </p><p>Trump versus Google, the president of United States criticizing the search  giant for bias against conservative voices.  We'll show you the evidence  that Trump posted to back it up and we do have Google's response.</p><p>Salesforce selloff, shares of Salesforce sliding after the company's  earnings report we break down those numbers.  </p><p>And one for the books, the Green Bay Packers Quarterback Aaron Rodgers  signing a mega deal making him the highest paid NFL player.  We have the  details of the incredible deal.</p><p>Duck and cover, the world's biggest food fight, you won't believe how many  people were there to chuck tomatoes at one another.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning, National Security Analyst  Morgan Ortagus.  Borrowed Time Co-Author James Freeman.  Actually, that's  on my reading list.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I bought it on my Kindle.  And 32Advisors Founder and CEO, Fox  Business Contributor Robert Wolf.</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Great.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Has clearly been on the golf course a lot.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  A little -- a little bit.  I mean, if you call my hacking  golf.  Yes. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well as much as your -- as much as you play, your game should be  good and better.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, it's not.  But I'm fun to play with.  I mean -- but the game is  not getting much better.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you were fun to spend a morning with us.</p><p>WOLF:  I'm glad to be here with James and Morgan and You.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And glad -- thanks for the --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Likewise.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thanks for the courtesy laugh at 5:58 in the morning.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I got to thank you for the book plug.  So you realize you don't  have to read it as long as you buy it.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  I'm reading it too.  I'm going to just say I'm reading it too  because I want to plug it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I am reading --</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I haven't bought it or read it but  I'll buy it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is about Citi Group.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is about the bubblelicious Citi Group, the rise and fall.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The rise and fall.</p><p>FREEMAN:  You're wondering their history and really strong bank before the  government was standing behind it.  Then once the government got behind it,  not such a good history.</p><p>WOLF:  Well as a former Salomon Brothers guy that was bought by Citi Group  that's now run by a former Salomon Brothers guy, I'm rooting for them.  So  I hope the book is rooting for them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well we're here --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, it's topped with fate.</p><p>WOLF:  How about that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  As we will be all morning long and everything that we talk about  whether it's trade, the market, there was that debate last night between  the candidates for the governor of New York.</p><p>And also coming this morning, CFRA Investment -- Chief Investment  Strategist Sam Stovall.  Former White House Press Secretary, Fox News  Contributor, Ari Fleischer.  Senate Finance Committee Member, the Senator  one of two, from Pennsylvania, Pat Toomey.  Former Speaker of the House,  Fox News Contributor Newt Gingrich.  And SAPAmerica's President Jen  Morgan.</p><p>We have some incredible guests coming up.  But right here right now,  optimism on trade, both President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin  Trudeau sounding optimistic about reaching a trade agreement by tomorrow's  deadline.  The commander-in-chief commenting on the negotiation yesterday  at the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I think Canada very much wants to make the deal and I think it's  going to be obviously very good for Canada if they do and I think it's  probably not going to be good at all if they don't.  We have a very good  relationship.</p><p>They came yesterday to the White House and we negotiated late into the  evening, they're in the White House right now, we're negotiating with them  right now and they want to be part of a deal.  And we gave until Friday and  I think we're probably on track.  We'll see what happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do we get a deal by tomorrow James Freeman?  Here's my quote  that I wrote down from President Trump, \"I love Canada.  I love Mexico.\"   So there you go.  If he's sounding positive that way, it can't be bad.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  That is progress, isn't it?  And, yes, I think they get a  deal.  Remember, they don't have to agree on every phrase, every comma, and  period right now.  They just have to basically agree on where they're going  and they've got this timeline to move it through the various legislatures.  </p><p>But I think they will get a deal because although consumers aren't going to  necessarily like it to buy autos, the Canadian government likes what the  U.S. did with Mexico.  They liked these new efforts to keep manufacturing  in the U.S. and Canada versus Mexico.  So I think there's a lot of reason  for Canada to cut a deal and we buy 75 percent of their exports.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  To get into the ways because we love doing that Morgan, the two  sticking points for Canada -- the United States wants more access to the --  to selling dairy into Canada and then Canada wants to keep these existing  dispute resolution panels that are used to resolve conflicts about tariffs  among the three countries.</p><p>But that sounds like in the grand scheme of things, ideas that can be  resolved or problems that can be resolved.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I think you're right.  I think something else that this  administration has said that they want to resolve with Canada is I.P.  protections and that was -- that has been written into the new agreement,  the new proposed agreement with Mexico.</p><p>And the USTR has been actually quite tough on Canada's position on I.P. and  that's been a real sticking point for them in addition to dairy farmers.   The real challenge I see with all of this Dagen is that no matter what  comes -- no matter what happens whether it's just a deal with Mexico or  whether it's fully renegotiated NAFTA, this is going to slip into 2019.</p><p>For congressional approval you'll need -- they'll need approval from both  the House and the Senate.  Clearly there's a chance that we're looking at  least the Democrat House.  So the strategy there, you know, will the --  will the democrats especially someone like Bernie Sanders who supported a  trade agenda similar to the president, will they support this or leading up  to 2020?  Are they going to oppose this deal just simply because it's  something that Donald Trump negotiated?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well let's ask this big old democrat.</p><p>WOLF:  Well listen, I think I've been to the right of the conservative  party on trade because I've been for TPP, I've been for iterating NAFTA.   So I don't mind as a former advisor to the president on export counsel, I'm  a supporter of this.</p><p>I think the president trying to do NAFTA2.0 is a good thing.  If we can  iterate, OK, where there's better labor standards in Mexico that brings the  pricing up, so we're not -- cheap labor is not the beneficiary of kind of  the detriment to the U.S., those are good things.</p><p>That being said, whether it's tomorrow or a week from tomorrow, or a month  away, I think we should just make sure we get the best possible deal, OK,  for both sides.  That can, you know, stand the time.  That being said, we  should also, you know, make changes throughout.  </p><p>One of the problems with NAFTA1.0 is we haven't really changed it in over  two decades.  So this is important to have the right changes, it seems like  it's in the right trajectory, and it certainly seems with Chrystia Freeland  their trade minister flying back immediately to try to do something is a  good sign.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  She was scheduled to go to Europe to --</p><p>WOLF:  She -- right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- this week and she said, \"Hey, I'm staying in North America  and head south.\"</p><p>WOLF:  And as far as the dems, you know, what I would say is that if it's a  -- if it's a good agreement between Canada and Mexico, just not bilateral  with Mexico, I actually think it will pass both the House and the Senate.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well they need that for fast-track status.</p><p>WOLF:  I think it will pass the boat.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They need that for fast-track status.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  In addition to what Robert said about labor, there's also new  rules on the environment, also on I.P. protection as we talked about.  So I  think there's some positive things that both parties could look to but the  Journal did criticize this as, you know, Dagen, they called it,  \"Politically managed trade.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  \"The economic logic is the opposite of Mr. Trump's domestic  deregulation agenda.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well the headline was --</p><p>FREEMAN:  True.  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- it is notably worse than NAFTA, the original NAFTA in many  ways.  And you talk about the -- how they were court in the likes of  Sherrod Brown in Ohio and Sherrod up for re-election this year.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Again, that this reads like something that democrats wrote  or maybe even the auto unions, the original Mexico deal.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  I think it may be hard for people like Sherrod Brown to  turn this down because it does move in his direction.  And for that reason  I think that we should expect auto consumers are going to pay more.  </p><p>This is sand in the gears of the North American supply chains that have  made it much more competitive here.  It is -- it is not so great for Mexico  but good for Canada and the U.S. auto sector in terms of unionized labor  there.  </p><p>So that's -- look, but I -- there's no reason in the world the president if  he gets something on dairy should not give Canada what they want a dispute  resolution because once he gets the NAFTA he wants, he doesn't need to put  on any more tariffs.  So there's no reason he shouldn't be able to --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Give up -- give on them.</p><p>FREEMAN:  -- give on that issue.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have $650 million dairy trade surplus with Canada.  So  there's -- you know, it's a great talking point on the campaign trail.  But  the fact is that we benefit mightily from imports into Canada --</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  But we'd sell a lot more if they didn't have the barriers  they have.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Very, very -- well, I want to move -- I want move along to  China.</p><p>WOLF:  Listen -- sorry, go ahead Dagen.  That's how (INAUDIBLE) move to.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  China's commerce ministry saying today that trade issues with  the U.S. can only be resolved through talks as equals.  So do we see China  getting ready for a drawn-out fight where certainly businesses in this  country that whether they export to China, whether they import goods from  China or watching that $200 billion mark that China -- that the United  States is talking about, additional tariffs on that.</p><p>As the Wall Street Journal Editorial Page today writes about how because of  retaliatory tariffs, the cherry farmers in the Pacific Northwest have lost  $86 million on sweet cherries just this summer, James?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  This has cost.  I mean, I -- when we talk about optimism  for getting a deal here, it's not that I think these deals are all  wonderful.  Higher tariffs, more barriers are a negative as we're seeing in  NAFTA.</p><p>I hope he -- the president focuses on his message to the E.U. which is  let's take tariffs down to zero everywhere, that ought to be the goal.  I  think this is going to take a while with China to resolve it but I think if  he resolves NAFTA and he resolves it with Europe and you have them, the  whole world focused on China and its intellectual property theft, I think  China is eventually going to have to change.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Real quick and then I'll get your comments on China and Europe  because you mentioned Europe yesterday because Harley-Davidson has been a  punching bag for the president.  It was celebrating its 115th anniversary  in Wisconsin yesterday.</p><p>The American motorcycle maker coming under fire from the president because  it said, \"Hey, we got retaliatory tariffs from Europe, we're going to move  some production overseas.  Harley owners and Trump supporters sounded off  at an event.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEANNA KYROLE, HARLEY-DAVIDSON SUPPORTER:  It is about bottom line and if  he was controlling his business he would be doing the same thing, if not  worst.  At least they're trying their best to keep everything at home.  </p><p>MARTY GERNOWSKI, TRUMP SUPPORTER:  I'm proud to have Harley here in  Milwaukee and if they have to do what they have to do for a profit and make  price in another country, then so be it.</p><p>DAVID GULOTTA, HARLEY-DAVIDSON &amp; TRUMP SUPPORTER:  Harley-Davidson has  survived for 115 years, you know.  Through a lot -- through a lot more  adverse situations than what they're dealing with right now, you know.  The  motor company will survive, I have faith in that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That just shows Robert that regular folks in this country voters  whether they're right, left, or center, they are connected to what's going  on with trade.</p><p>WOLF:  Listen, tariffs have unintended consequences.  The idea that we're  battling with Europe, OK, is absurd, OK?  The truth is and I think as James  pointed out and Morgan, our real concern is China.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Uh-hmm.</p><p>WOLF:  I brought it up earlier and you've been bringing it up for a year  now, we should stay in TPP and we should -- the best way to attack China is  to have trading agreements with the 11 countries around China, Australia,  New Zealand, Philippines.</p><p>The idea that we dropped TPP because it was an Obama-led trade agreement is  ridiculous, it's not the right thing.  And my gut tells me if you look at  what we're doing with Mexico and Canada, it actually is very similar to  TPP.  It's about labor standards, environmental standards.</p><p>My gut tells me that will be the next thing we go after because a bilateral  negotiation with China is not around the corner.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  Because it's all about -- as Morgan said it has to do with I.P.,  that's our biggest concern.  There is nothing in the trade agreement that's  going to withstand they are stealing our I.P.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Final word Morgan.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Well I think in addition to I.P. it's also about investment,  right?  And the type of restrictions on U.S. investment into China and what  has always been incredibly worrying to me, Dagen, is, you know, the amount  of Chinese communist propaganda that the regime makes American corporations  spew put out on their social media when they do business there and that  should be a concern for all American businesses.</p><p>And this -- also the shady nefarious tactics of the Chinese government in  the country, they'll put out misinformation about American companies that  are doing business there to turn people away from and they've done it --  done it before and there's a lot that we don't see in terms of them  retaliating against us, it's not just here on our shore.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you Morgan, James, Robert.  Oh boy, we've got so much to  talk about.  Salesforce sliding, shares of the business software maker  taking a hit after strong earnings but a weak outlook.  We'll tell you what  the company CEO had to say too about taxes.</p><p>And food fight, thousands turning out for Spain's massive tomato throwing  festival, we've got the incredible pictures and we demo in studio.   Straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  People in Arizona saying goodbye to the late Senator John McCain  at the State Capitol.  Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Dagen, good morning.  There were about 15,000 people came to  pay their respects to the late senator who served the state for 36 years in  Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JON KYL, FORMER ARIZONA SENATOR:  John's love for America and Arizona.  He  represented our values all over the world as senator from Arizona and  America is stronger for his fierce defense of our values.  We can be proud  he was our senator.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Today a memorial service will be held at the North Baptist Phoenix  Church where former -- North Phoenix Baptist Church, excuse me, where Vice  President Joe Biden is scheduled to speak and 24 sitting senators are going  to be attending as well.</p><p>Then his casket will depart Arizona and head for Washington.  More services  planned later this week.  </p><p>Well, Campbell Soup says that it plans to sell its international and  refrigerated food businesses which bring in about $2.1 billion, this  transaction will bring in that much.  And this move opens the door to an  outright sale of the company that sold possibility.  </p><p>Campbell Soup CEO Denise Morrison unexpectedly stepped down back in May,  there's been a lot of pressure from shareholders on Campbell to do  something.  They're also going to be reporting the -- excuse me, they did  beat on earnings and missed on revenue this morning.  Shares of Campbell  super low in the pre-markets.</p><p>You've got the breaking news and you've got the earnings as well pressuring  Campbell Soup.  The stock is down more than a four and a quarter percent  right now.  </p><p>Well, we're also watching Salesforce right now.  The company's results  coming in better than expected but the stock is under pressure this morning  after they issued a disappointing earnings outlook for the third quarter.</p><p>Co-CEO Mark Benioff also touting President Trump's tax cuts and  deregulation.  But the stock is down about three percent right now in the  pre-market.  This is the stock to watch today as well when the bells ring  at 9:30.  </p><p>And then there is this, 20,000 people hurling tomatoes at each other at  Spain's annual Tomatina Festival yesterday.  This is known as the world's  largest food fight.  More than 30,000 pounds of tomato were thrown.  For  one hour people tossing each other with all of those, by the way, overripe  tomatoes Dagen.  </p><p>And I like -- I like your thinking this morning that we should, you know,  try and replay this in studio, you know, do our own version of a food  fight.  I'll work on that for the next hour.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, that's a Tuesday afternoon at my place.</p><p>CASONE:  I think it looks fun.  I wish I'd do it.</p><p>WOLF:  A little animal house action.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, exactly.</p><p>WOLF:  A little animal house action won't hurt anyone.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  I'm not going to do Robert Wolf.  Guess what I am?  A  scene from animal house.  Cheryl, thank you so much.</p><p>Coming up, slamming big tech, President Trump targeting Google.  Bernie  Sanders takes aim at Amazon.  We'll tell you about it ahead.  </p><p>Plus, Friends fashion.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOEY TRIBBIANI:  OK buddy boy, here it is.  You hide my clothes, I'm  wearing everything you own.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So did Balenciaga take a cue from Joey?  You won't believe how  much this layered look will cost you.  It is an eye-popping price tag,  that's ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wall Street rally, stocks surging.  The S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ  hitting all-time highs for the fourth day in a row.  The technology sector  and optimism over trade negotiations driving the major market gauges to  those new highs including the Russell2000.</p><p>Here now Sam Stovall, CFRA Research Chief Investment Strategist.  Sam, how  are you?</p><p>SAM STOVALL, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH:  Good, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  Your reaction to this?  The question in every  investor's mind is can this market keep going?  What would get in the way?</p><p>STOVALL:  Oh, I think it can.  First though we have a trifecta of new  highs, the S&amp;P500, NASDAQ, Russell2000.  So when you've got that kind of  breath, when you have the widening out of the participation in this rally,  that tends to be pretty good.</p><p>We also recouped all that we lost in the correction from January 26th to  February 11th.  History basically says we go on to advance by almost nine  and a half percent on average and we don't stumble again for another four  months.  So not to say that that's exactly how it's going to play out this  time but usually when you hit a new all-time high that tends to add to  investor confidence.</p><p>WOLF:  So just to play devil's advocate, although I'm rooting for the bull  market, let's go back to our earlier years, you know, this reminds me a lot  of 2000.</p><p>STOVALL:  OK.</p><p>WOLF:  OK?  In 2000, we -- that was the last time -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yikes.</p><p>WOLF:  Are you saying yes?</p><p>FREEMAN:  I was saying yikes.  </p><p>WOLF:  OK.  You'll see where I'm going with it then.  In 2000 that was the  last time consumer confidence was this high, OK?  So we had the highest  since 2000 announced last week.</p><p>We were on the incredible trajectory and then all of a sudden 2000 comes  and we had a two-year down trade, you know, starting with the dot.com  bubble.  It was all kind of, you know, a one-way direction and then all of  a sudden we had the turn.</p><p>My question is, long-winded, do you think with the raising rate  environment, you know, fiscal deficit concerns and possibly based on where  the yield curve is, the possibility of a slowdown based on what, you know,  the yield curve's at least predicting for GDP.  Does that change kind of  your horizon and thoughts at all?</p><p>STOVALL:  I'm sorry, could you repeat the question?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hey, at least he admitted that.</p><p>FREEMAN:  I admitted it.</p><p>STOVALL:  I'm kidding you.  I'm kidding you.</p><p>WOLF:  Don't forget here because, you know, James caught me off track --</p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm sorry I interrupted.  </p><p>WOLF:  -- with the yikes.  Did I talk about your book yet?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Go ahead.</p><p>STOVALL:  No, those are good questions.  First off, we're the second most  expensive bull markets since World War II with trailing earnings being, you  know, above the long-term average.  Also on an S&amp;P500 market cap to nominal  GDP, we're more than twice as high as the average over the past 50 years.</p><p>WOLF:  This is kind of like a softball for you right now.</p><p>STOVALL:  Well -- but then comma, I think that we probably could --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Semicolon, next thought.  Go ahead.</p><p>STOVALL:  Well I got good grammar than most but my punctuation is pretty  bad.  I think that we probably still have some life left because we have  never slipped into a bear market in the past 65 years when interest rates  were below inflation where they are today.</p><p>We'd have to see at least two more rate hikes before we even equal the  year-on-year change in core CPI.  And then we would have to have three more  rate hikes next year just to get close to that threshold at first we -- the  threat of falling into a bear market.</p><p>So I still think that monetary policy is quite simulative at this point and  with the Fed basically telling us what they're going to do, I'd like to say  that a boxer is rarely fell by the punch he expects and at least it's not  going to come from the Fed.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And I guess comparing the 2000 hoping maybe this isn't a reefed,  you don't really see this sort of peps.com phenomenon of lots of non- companies that are public even though they're not really businesses and  don't have real earnings.</p><p>STOVALL:  True.  You're not really seeing the exuberance that typically  bull markets look like incandescent light bulbs and tend to glow right just  before they go out.  So I'm not getting the questions from the newspaper  vendors as to, \"Gee, what stocks should I be buying or them telling me what  stocks to buy?\"</p><p>So I agree, it's still -- investors are very skeptical about this events.   And so as a result, it might have some life left.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they are willing to beat the, you know what, the stuffing  out of a stock like Facebook.  </p><p>STOVALL:  Oh sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But when it misses and gives guidance that investors were  shocked by, I know that Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft all hit new all-time  highs yesterday but they're not buying every tech stock hand-over fist to  your point.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And I wonder about the techs.  I mean I look at regulation as  probably good for the giants, they end up benefiting from it but do you  look at that as a negative?  Does that make you worried about these stocks  we're talking about, the fangs?</p><p>STOVALL:  Well the -- I mean the fangs in opinion are very difficult from  tech in general.  Typically, tech is the best performing sector in a rising  rate environment because they have the lowest dividend yields combined with  companies need to add to their technology to improve the productivity of  their -- of the employees that they're not going to be adding on to in the  future.</p><p>But I would say look toward the value side, if we see more gravitation,  more interest in value stocks that implies and investors think that there's  life and that they could actually sit with them for a little while while  they recover.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sam Stovall, great to see you.</p><p>STOVALL:  Thanks Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And thanks for the humor this morning before 6:30.  Coming up,  taking on technology, speaking of that, James mentioned more regulation or  even some regulation on technology companies.  President Trump renewing his  attacks on Google, why he says that the platform is biases.</p><p>And every day heroes, a police body camera capturing a dramatic rescue at  sea.  One of the rescued men refusing to leave his fishing rod behind, we  have that story coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning.  I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Thursday, August 30th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>In looming deadline, trade talks with Canada, kicking off again, this  morning, President Trump expressing optimism that Canada will join the new  trade deal with Mexico before tomorrow's deadline.  </p><p>Checking the market action this morning, amid these trade talks, we have an  89-point loss on the Dow Futures right now, Futures are lower on the S&amp;P  and NASDAQ 100 as well, but yesterday, more records coming out of these  markets, the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, hitting all-time highs, along with the  Russell 2000.</p><p>In Europe, markets are lower this morning, losses in England, France and  Germany, to tell you about, the DAX down nearly one percent.</p><p>And then, also, let's check on Asian markets, losses across the board  except for a very, very slight gain on the Nikkei in Japan.</p><p>Slamming Silicon Valley, President Trump, calling out Google, saying that  the search giant promoted President Obama's State of the Union speeches on  the site, but not his own, the President, speaking out about the tech  company, yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat  Conservatives and Republicans very unfairly.  I think it's a very serious  problem because they're really trying to silence a very large part of this  country and those people don't want to be silenced.  It's not right.  It's  not fair.  It may not be legal.  But we'll see.  We just want fairness.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  How Google is responding, that's next.  An incredible rescue,  more video of this police officer saving three men from the water after  their boat capsizes.  We will show you that.  </p><p>And one for the record books, we'll tell you about the jaw-dropping  contract extension for quarterback Aaron Rodgers, that will make him the  highest paid player in NFL history.</p><p>And please call the Fashion Police, where is Joan Rivers when you need her?   Balenciaga unveiling a jacket with -- well, that looks like this, it looks  like one shirt on top of a shirt, on top of a coat, on top of a sweatshirt,  and it costs thousands of dollars, literally.  We will tell you -- you have  to stay with us, why people are comparing this style to Joey from Friends.</p><p>But to our top story this half hour, Trump versus tech, the President  making it clear that he wants fairness for Conservatives from major  technology companies like Google and Facebook.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter, I think they treat  Conservatives and Republicans very unfairly.  I hear that they're holding  hearings in Congress over the next couple of weeks.  </p><p>And I think it's a very serious problem because they're really trying to  silence a very large part of this country and those people don't want to be  silenced.  It's not right.  It's not fair.  It may not be legal.  But we'll  see.  We just want fairness.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Google firing back after President Trump tweeted a video in  which he claims Google's homepage did not promote his State of the Union  Address, even though President Trump -- President Obama's was highlighted.</p><p>Here to discuss, Former White House Press Secretary, FOX News Contributor,  Ari Fleischer.  We talk about this on a business show because if this White  House is going to move to regulate the tech companies because of some of  its obvious bias, this is in dispute that would hurt business.  What do you  say, Ari?</p><p>ARI FLEISCHER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Look, I don't mind politicians who  occasionally throw high inside heat.  Sometimes you need to do a little bit  of that to make your people who oppose you in politics, back off a little  bit, give you more fair coverage.</p><p>But once it crosses the line with the government trying to regulate speech  or regulate private sectors right to publish things, that's where I draw a  line.  So if he's throwing inside heat, God bless him, have at it.  Don't  hit the batter, though, and don't regulate.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Morgan, you said the President, yesterday, did say he prefers  not to pursue regulation of the internet giant.  They're already -- it  would be the DOJ, the FTC or the FCC that could add additional regulation.</p><p>There are other things that the White House could do, but again, this at  the moment.  Just looks like a lot of talk.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I think where the tech companies are right now is similar to  where the banks were during the financial crisis, right?  In terms of a  complete --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Meaning a government bailout?</p><p>ORTAGUS:  No, no, no.  Not a government bailout, in terms of a regulatory  perspective, not understanding where the winds are turning from both  parties, right?  And not getting out ahead of a lot of these stories.  </p><p>And I think they continue to be the big media companies -- tech companies,  tend to be, especially social media, incredibly reactive still.  And I call  for them -- I know you, Dagen, have as well, to start enforcing more self- regulatory measures, because if they don't, the government will regulate  for them.</p><p>FLEISCHER:  But let me stipulate, the government has no idea how to get  this right (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>ORTAGUS:  That will stop them, Ar.</p><p>FLEISCHER:  Once you put a bunch of politicians in charge of speech in the  tech industry, Facebook, Twitter, Google, it's going to turn into a fight  over who gets the biggest political advantage as opposed to how to protect  the most free speech.  The cure for bad free speech is more free speech.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Can I -- can I just respond that --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Google did respond by saying and calling the President out that  he was actually inaccurate.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, here's what the Wall Street Journal writes today.  Looking  at the internet archive, this is that not -- non-profit that preserves  historical snap shots.  It appears to show that Google.com did promote  President Trump's State of the Union at certain points during this year's  speech and not at others.</p><p>There's several snapshots of the page that don't show promotion of the  speech.  But, again, there does appear to be some promotion of the State of  the Union.</p><p>FLEISCHER:  And I think it's fair, somebody needs to run it down to see  whether or not Google promoted Trump as much as they promoted Obama.  What  the President put on Twitter was very clever.  That video he had with  Google promoting Obama, Obama, Obama, no Trump, very well done.</p><p>But is it accurate?  Is it fully accurate?  I don't know that yet.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to get James in here real quick. </p><p>FREEMAN:  I'm wondering, sort of, what you're hearing in terms of  discussions within the administration.  Because I think President Trump  deserves a lot of credit for -- and his administration as appointees for  not letting the FCC become the internet regulator, the way they regulated  telephones.</p><p>Now, it seems this idea that oh, we'll have the FTC, another federal  bureaucracy become the internet regulators, kind of, gaining ground here.   I could see a lot of these big companies wanting to do a deal.  Are you --  how worried should we be about this?  Because I'm very concerned, I don't  know how fast you think this thing is coming down the pike.</p><p>FLEISCHER:  I think the true motivation for the White House is with all  things, is protecting the President and protecting his image, because when  you look at social media generally, Twitter, Facebook, it's biased against  Republicans, it's biased against the President.</p><p>Everybody sees it, and knows it, and feels it.  So, he's throwing back in  trying to get them to modify their behavior by dealing with Donald Trump.   Oh, it does, which is blowing the whistle in public.  </p><p>There's a big difference between a public official blowing a whistle and  signing a law.  And he's right to blow a whistle.  I don't want to see him  sign a law because the government will botch it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and also, we talked about -- there is obvious bias.  Some  of us have experienced or at least witnessed it in terms of Conservative  speech on the social media platforms in particular.  The bigger issue -- </p><p>And I've been warning these tech companies for literally, years, is the  reckless disregard for people's privacy and how these companies actually  make money off of our most personal information.  And how they have  essentially handed it off to companies and app developers, Facebook did for  years, we didn't even know about it.</p><p>FLEISCHER:  Anybody who is on those platforms and puts their personal  information on it and doesn't expect it to be shared is being naive.  Once  you tell everybody who your likes are, what your interests are, it's going  to be shared.  That's how they market it, that's how when you go on to  Amazon, your product that you want to buy is already pulled up for you.   There are also benefits to it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, so you can't claim ignorance.  You have to -- you have to  be aware of what -- if you're getting something for free, it's not for  free.  You just don't know how you're paying for it.</p><p>FLEISCHER:  You want privacy, don't go online.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Ari.  You know what, if you want  privacy, don't walk the city streets nowadays because everybody's got a  camera phone.  You better be careful about cursing at somebody.  Not you.   I'm just saying in general.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Are you serious, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can't yell, you can't -- you can't yell anymore, not in the  street.  Speaking of New York and people yelling at each other, there was  this bizarre back and forth between New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and  candidate Cynthia Nixon in the first New York gubernatorial debate, just  watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW CUOMO (D), GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK:  My opponent lives in the world of  fiction.  I live in the world of fact.  Can you stop interrupting?  Can you  stop interrupting?</p><p>CYNTHIA NIXON (D), GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE, NEW YORK:  Can you stop lying?</p><p>CUOMO:  Yes, as soon as you do.</p><p>NIXON:  We already have a corrupt corporate Republican in the White House.   We don't need a corrupt corporate Democrat in Albany, as his main  opposition.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Cuomo also doubling down on the Democratic talking point of  abolishing immigration and customs enforcement, ICE.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CUOMO:  New York State is the state that is suing Donald Trump for ripping  babies from the arms of their mother.  New York State is the state that  says we will not cooperate with ICE, they're a bunch of thugs.  He  politicized ICE.  They're a bunch of thugs.  We said we will sue them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's the left going further left, Ari.  What did you make of  that?</p><p>FLEISCHER:  I think if I'm a law enforcement officer anywhere, local cop,  sheriff, state police trooper, I'm offended, thugs, because they're  enforcing the law and doing their jobs?  I hate politicians who talk like  this.  It is so offensive to the people who protect us.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Cynthia Nixon has pushed him further left on this, don't you  think?</p><p>FLEISCHER:  Well, that's the problem, and he's caving.  Cynthia Nixon says  she wants to abolish ICE.  So, Cuomo has to act tough too, so he says  they're thugs, wrong.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Cynthia Nixon is right about one thing.  She said that air  conditioning is sexist.  And considering Dagen and I are always freezing  (INAUDIBLE) Cynthia Nixon is right, air conditioning is sexist.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Politics is local.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What about a dose of what it's like to be in front of a live  audience and there were supporters of Cynthia Nixon when he was bringing up  like you live in the world of fiction, basically making fun of her  television and acting career, that they booed him.  You would hear it.</p><p>FLEISCHER:  Can I go back to what you said?  Can I make you wear this tie?   I mean, it's terrible.  We need a colder studio.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, and we need -- we need better leadership in New York State.   And I know -- we didn't see it last night.  Coming up -- thank you, Ari  Fleischer, thank you for the humor, so early in the morning.</p><p>We tell you which state may soon become the first to mandate women on  corporate boards.  </p><p>And then, this shirt on shirt on jacket on sweatshirt, how much it will  cost you.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  California lawmakers taking a step to bring diversity to  boardrooms, more chicks, they say, they mandate by law.  Cheryl Casone has  more.  Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  You know, interesting -- I mean, certainly you may see more  females in the boardroom or CEO, but lawmakers in California is taking this  all a step further.  They may soon require major companies that are  headquartered in California have to put female directors on the board.   Under this proposed law, boards will need to have at least one woman by the  end of next year and at least two or three by the end of 2021.  Those who  don't will be fined.  The law recently passed the state assembly and now  heads back to the state senate and then the desk of Governor Jerry Brown.   We'll keep you posted.  </p><p>And then there is this, a dramatic rescue off of a Florida's coast.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Is everybody accounted for?  I want to get everybody on  the boat.  Can you swim?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Grab the life ring.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, that boat capsized.  Police on Miami Beach released this body  cam footage that shows three brothers that were rescued after their boat  capsized.  They had no life jackets on, by the way.  Police believe that  the boat was flipped by rough waters.  </p><p>And then, a little n nostalgia for you, Dagen.  Remember this scene from  \"Friends\"\"  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK, buddy boy, here it is.  You hide my clothes, I'm  wearing everything you own.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  Well, it seems that fashion designer Balenciaga has taken  inspiration from Joey of all people.  At Paris fashion week, the company  debuted this heavily layered jacket.  If it is for you, it's $9,000.  As  you can see, it's got an outer coat, it's got layers, it's got a hoodie,  it's like five different jackets.  And then they also released this, this  is kind of strange, red squared shoes.  So, people on social media say it  looks like a carton of McDonald's French fries.  These are $545.  I mean,  you can't make this stuff up.  That jacket reminds me, Dagen, of a guy that  tried to go through TSA security wearing all of these clothes so he  wouldn't have to check a bag.  Remember that?  This is what it reminds me  of.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But this is increasingly -- particularly what these fashion  houses and women's fashion designers, it's like they're playing a joke on  women.  They're trying to see how foolish people will be with their money.   It's literally $1,000 ripped gray sweatshirt.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Well, I was just thinking that because air conditioning is  sexist, I need this jacket.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I think they're playing a joke on men too, aren't they?  That  looks like the derelict campaign.  </p><p>WOLF:  Listen, Steve Bannon was wearing that outfit for a year and no one  said -- he had like four layers.  He had the shirt, the under shirt, the --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That officially -- you saying that will end that trend.  It  ended right now because -- </p><p>WOLF:  I'm telling you, Bannon was wearing five or six layers.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Sister, sister.  Serena and Venus set to square off in round  three of the U.S. Open.  We've got the preview.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Green Bay Packers Quarterback Aaron Rodgers has a lot of green  coming his way.  Jared Max has information on a record-setting contract  extension.  Hey, Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER:  Dagen, suffice to day,  it's a beautiful day in Mr. Rodgers neighborhood.  Set to begin his 14th  season of the NFL.  Rodgers signs a four-year extension that reportedly  could be worth in the Mr. Rodgers neighborhood of $180 million.  The  breakdown, $134 million in base salary.  $103 million of which is  guaranteed an NFL record and a league high annual average of $33.5 million.  </p><p>We're going to see something tomorrow at the U.S. Open that we have not  seen in over 20 years.  Serena Williams won her second-round match at the  U.S. Open on Wednesday in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2.  Earlier, Serena's older  sister Venus won her second-round match also in straight sets.  And so, it  will be an all sister affair.  Tomorrow in flushing meadows not since  January of 98, had the Williams sisters met this early in a grand slam  tournament.  Serena has won 17 of her 29 head to head matchups.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Go, Williams sisters.  My favorite athletes of all time.   Continue.  </p><p>MAX:  Defending Champion Rafael Nadal moved into the third round with a  straight sets win, Wednesday night.  However, 2012 champ, Andy Murray is  done.  He was eliminated in four sets by Fernando Verdasco.  </p><p>All right, let's cycle over to Major League Baseball.  The operative word  here is \"cycle.\"  When a player hits for a single, a double, a triple and  home run of the same game, he hits for the cycle.  Which is what the  Brewers' Christian Yelich did against the Reds.  He homered for the sixth  time in his many games, and Milwaukee beat Cincinnati in 13 innings -- 13- 12 or 10 innings, I should say.  </p><p>Last in national league attendance for likely 13th time in 14 years, the  Miami Marlins promise more noise at games next season.  The team encourages  its fans to get loud, bring musical instruments, bells, and whistles, and  flags to games next year.  The team says it offers the region's diverse  Latin American culture to show pride, get loud an in one section of the  ballpark.  It will be called communidad tres, sero, cinco -- Community 305.  </p><p>Baseball and Budweiser, how about baseball and wine?  Yes.  Partnering with  City Winery, the New York Yankees have opened a wine bar at Yankee stadium,  which in addition to other wines and (INAUDIBLE) will offer Yankees'  branded wines.  City Winery's first permanent winery at sports stadium.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love it.  Jared, thank you so much.  And I'll shout out to the  Williams sisters again.  Jared Max with us.

I'm Dagen  McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo.  It is Thursday, August 30th.</p><p>Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Almost there as tomorrow's deadline looms.  President Trump optimistic that  the U.S. will reach a trade deal with Canada.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  They want to be a part of  the deal, then we gave until Friday and I think we're probably on track.   We'll see what happens, but in any event things are working out very well.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Canada's prime minister Justin Trudeau stressing that there will  only be a deal if it's good for Canada.  But Trump says \"I love Canada.  I  love Mexico.\"</p><p>Investors still showing concern over trade.  We have a 65-point loss on the  Dow futures.  Markets -- the gauges here lower across the board but  yesterday let us remind everybody, the Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500 and Russell hit new  all-time highs for the fourth straight trading day.</p><p>In Europe we have some selling to tell you about in England, France and  Germany. But the DAX was down almost 1 percent earlier in the session.   Right now it's only off one-third of a percent.</p><p>Trade tensions between China and the U.S. weighing on Asian markets  overnight.  The major gauges there closing mostly lower.  A slight gain on  the Nikkei in Japan is the only upside.</p><p>There's a new round of U.S. tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods  that could hit later next month.</p><p>Easing exercises -- President Trump looking to get North Korea back on path  to denuclearization.

Details coming up.  </p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I'm loving that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I gave it away here.</p><p>With us this morning, Robert Wolf obviously; national security analyst  Morgan Ortagus, (INAUDIBLE) co-author.  And Robert is 32Advisors founder  and CEO, a Fox Business contributor.  Good morning, sir.  Good morning,  lady.  Good morning, sir.</p><p>WOLF:  Good morning.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST:  Good morning.</p><p>WOLF:  Great first hour.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\":   Good morning.  Good to be here.  Thanks.</p><p>WOLF:  Great first hour.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was fun.  </p><p>WOLF:  It was fun.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have a lot to talk about.  </p><p>WOLF:  I want to make sure you guys aren't cold at all.  The air  conditioning is good.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Should we explain really quickly.  There was a fight before this  debate in New York between Cynthia Nixon and Governor Cuomo about the  temperature of the air conditioning.  And she was essentially asserting  that men always keep the rooms cold.  It makes the women uncomfortable.   Women don't like feeling so cold because there could be -- don't have  sleeves on their dress and so essentially Morgan has been saying that air  conditioning is sexist this morning.</p><p>So that's our joke for this morning.</p><p>We have so much more coming up -- we'll dick into that plus all the issues  that matter to people's pocketbooks and their wallets.</p><p>Former speaker of the house, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich is here;  SAP Americas and Asia Pacific president Jen Morgan is also here.</p><p>To our top story right here right now -- the looming deadline for a trade  deal.  The United States urging a Friday deadline for a new NAFTA deal as  pressure tightens for Canada to get on board.  President Trump saying he's  optimistic about a done deal by tomorrow but warns Canada not to miss the  train.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Right now we call it the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement.  And we'll  see whether or not Canada gets into it.  Otherwise we'll do something  separately or we won't do anything which is ok, too.</p><p>We're negotiating with them right now.  If they want to be a part of the  deal, we gave until Friday.  And I think we're probably on track.  We'll  see what happens.  But in any event, things are working out very well.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  James -- are you optimistic or not?  Because again -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  I am.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- the editorial page that you are an editor for did not like  the deal that we did with Mexico but what say you, sir?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I'm optimistic that we're on our way to resolving this  trade fight.  Is it a perfect deal?  No.  Does it impede trade in a number  of important ways?  Yes.</p><p>But if you want to think of it as could have been worse, could have gone  through more rounds of tariffs and counter-tariffs, I think everyone and  the world's investors would like to see this resolved and I think it is  going to be resolved.  </p><p>WOLF:  Or would you have preferred to just have kept it the same?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  I would have kept NAFTA.  Although I have to say, the  intellectual property stuff, better protection for copyrights and drugs is  a positive.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  But in the end when you look at it from like a digital  perspective and how much the economy has changed, the Internet of things,  block chain.</p><p>I mean this new deal is -- does have new rules on digital trade and it does  have provisions where it's going to have to be updated more frequently.  I  think that was definitely an error in the deal that you could go two  decades without an upgrade when there's so much -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, but I think that's one of the strengths is that it didn't  have an expiration date because that does allow people to plan and invest.   And this is one of the areas where we have moved in Canada's direction.  I  hope they appreciate that.</p><p>And I think ideally you would have no expiration date on it and you would  revisit it when you chose to.  But there's really very strong incentive on  both sides to get a deal here.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And the deal, if you look at the details of this Canadian deal,  particularly on autos, that what, 75 percent of an automobile has to -- all  of it has to come from North America to get basically no tariff status.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The wage rule -- what is it -- almost half of the car has to be  made with $16 per hour labor.  That is a huge handout to the Democrats,  Robert Wolf.  </p><p>WOLF:  Well, I don't think it's a huge handout.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's left.  </p><p>WOLF:  Right, but I'm -- as someone who is a Democrat, I'm supportive of  that part of the iteration because really I think to James' point, it's  just going to be passed to the consumer.  These higher pricing of  everything being done kind of on this new equilibrium means we're going to  the highest cost provider as opposed to the lowest cost provider.</p><p>That being said, I'm happy that we're seeing a NAFTA 2.0.  I think to  Morgan's point it was time.  And I think we should iterate it, you know, as  we see, you know, dysfunctional or unfair trade situations and I'm kind of  glad we may not have to always go to the WTO for our disputes.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  What the administration is arguing, specifically as it relates to  the auto industry is that they're strengthening the definition of the rules  of origin or clarifying that.  That was one of the major, you know,  contingents is where is the auto made and what the administration is  arguing is you could say it's coming from Mexico, let's say, but actually  parts of it could be coming from Japan.</p><p>And so I think the administration was arguing the rules of origin are so  murky that that really needed to be clarified.  </p><p>WOLF:  Right.</p><p>FREEMAN:  But really, you don't want rules of origin, right.  </p><p>WOLF:  Right.  I agree with James.</p><p>In a country that's 73 percent consumer driven-like us, we want to find  parts that are safe but also the least expensive, ok.  If we can make a  part cheaper in Mexico, that works perfectly, ok.  We should continue to  make that part in Mexico that works perfectly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to this because this is good news on the trade  front.  There's a new report from \"Politico\" on the trade issues that we  have with Europe.  The European Union now saying it will be willing to  scrap auto tariffs.  How big of a deal is this -- James?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.  It's huge.  I've heard from folks in the White House that  they're optimistic, just like with Canada.  We're moving toward resolution  with Europe.  So this is encouraging news along that path.</p><p>And this is the difference between what the President is saying for Europe  versus some of these other North American situation is he's saying zero  tariffs, lower barriers, more trade, better for the consumer.  And I hope  it's going that way in Europe.</p><p>It's sort of what he's doing in North America, but except for autos where  it's going the other way.  </p><p>WOLF:  I would caution that headline, because it will be interesting to see  what Germany says.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  Ok?  And so I think at the end of the day anything that has to do  with trade with respect to the E.U.  -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I will say -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  But they have been saying they like the zero tariff plan too.  So  I think this is -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know why?  Because we have a 25 percent import tariff on  light trucks in this country.  And the reason -- one of the reasons that I  have been so outspoken against these tariffs is because, well, one, they  are a tax.  They eventually get passed on to the consumers.  They make  doing business more difficult, disrupts supply chains.</p><p>But they will stick around a whole heck of a lot longer than you realize.   This 25 percent tariff that we hit light trucks with, which the U.S.  automakers love, it's because that's one of the reasons that they make and  sell so many pickup trucks here in the U.S. -- is it's been around since  the mid-60s.</p><p>People in the auto business call it the chicken tax.  It was a tax we  slapped on imports of light trucks because we got into a fight with Europe  about poultry exports out of the United States.</p><p>So these things can stick -- politicians love them.  President Trump has  bragged about these, paying down the debt and bringing the steel industry  back.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  The thing that I argue to my clients though when it comes to --  Robert and I agree, you know, on this.  However, I think that energy in  both parties of President Trump and the energy in the Democratic Party when  you look at Bernie Sanders; and even Hillary Clinton said that she was  going to withdraw from the TPP.</p><p>There's not an appetite in the base of both parties for the type of free  trade agreements that Robert and I are both probably are for.  So I think  when companies and businesses are looking at how they project their supply  chain, how they forecast investment over the next five to ten years, I  think that they should do it with the lens of a political appetite that no  matter who is in power -- we're not looking at, you know, 1990s free trade  style -- </p><p>WOLF:  Listen -- I think if we all shifted the word free trade to fair  trade, which includes labor standards and environmental standards -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What's what President Trump -- that's very Trumpian.  That's  what President Trump has done.  That is exactly what he talked about.   Robert's going to die -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Again, that's why -- I know I'm going off on a tangent.  But  this is why it makes my head hurt so much when Democrats just -- they can  say nothing but hateful things about the President and I know -- we could  talk about his personality all day long.  </p><p>WOLF:  Did I say that?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But let's talk of -- no, I'm saying that there are a lot of  other Democrats who do.</p><p>Let's talk about policy instead of personality.</p><p>WOLF:  I'm with you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  You know what, there are policies -- there's a lot  of things that the President has done that are very, very -- a bit liberal.  </p><p>WOLF:  I said I like NAFTA 2.0.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>WOLF:  I've also said I think I'm to the right of the conservative party on  where they've been of trade and fiscal discipline.  We should get back to  where that party was.</p><p>We're going to have a trillion dollar deficit.  Who did that move to?  It  moves to our kids.  When we have these tariffs, who does it move to?  It  moves to the consumers.  That's us paying.  We should just get the GOP back  to where their roots were as well.</p><p>I agree that the Democrats have shifted too far left.  I'm not there  either.  But we should make sure that we're talking practically on both  sides.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  I would agree that the spending blow-out is the great failing of  this Republican congress and administration.  </p><p>WOLF:  Say that louder.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  It's true.  Not that the predecessor was -- was better but this  is -- this is the problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The debt for a number of reasons did -- the national debt  doubled under President Obama.  And that's why people find it rich when  Nancy Pelosi is wringing her hand about the debt and the deficit because  the Democrats didn't vote for any of the tax cuts which has given us at  least the fastest quarterly growth that we've gotten in this country in  four years.  </p><p>WOLF:  I've just got to go back to some Economics 101, ok.  Yes, the debt  increased because of wars and the recession.  But -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WOLF:  -- billion dollar stimulus.  </p><p>Let me just be clear though.  What we really need to focus on is not  necessarily debt because debt's based on a percent of GDP.  It's more the  deficit.  And the deficit came down under President Obama from double  digits to down to under 3 percent.  We should just be clear the deficit -- </p><p>FREEMAN:  You mean after he blew it out in year one, and it remained a  solid deficit.  </p><p>WOLF:  He did inherit the recession?  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Nobody forced him to do the stimulus plan.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WOLF:  It was a unanimous plan.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But I think what we all agree on is that if we could get this  trade fight out of the way, we can allow this great economy to keep on  humming.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN:  Great second quarter, looks like a great third quarter so far.   Profits up.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Corporate profits were up more than 16 percent year over year.  </p><p>WOLF:  Love that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  15.1 percent -- we love that.  But again, it's the -- when  people on the left lose, it's when their manufactured outrage and the  sneering -- not you, others -- when it doesn't line up with reality, and  the reality is the economy is going great guns, people feel awesome.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  Partisan politics has been not a positive.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And President Trump, as much as people have tried to make him a  bigot and racist, which trade deal did he do first?  Mexico.  And he talks  about I love Mexico and I love Canada.</p><p>So again, it's the walk not the talk that we've got to pay attention to.   That's my final word.  </p><p>WOLF:  Well, you know, we could debate that.  But I'm going to let you end  with that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  Thank you -- Robert because you've got one hour and 45  minutes left to push back.</p><p>A new warning for Takata air bags, the alarming concerns that the air bags  might explode in hot and humid conditions.</p><p>And sky high delivery, Uber Eats gearing up to send food to your doorstep  with a drone.

But his spirit, service and fierce independence  ultimately helped shape the state with which he became synonymous.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Today a memorial service is going to be held at the North Phoenix  Baptist Church where former vice president Joe Biden will speak and 24  sitting senators are going to attend that service.  Then his casket will  depart Arizona for Washington.</p><p>Well, Micron Technology announcing plans to expand a plant in Virginia.   The company going to invest $3 billion over the next 12 years to meet  growing demand for chips used in cars.  The move will create 1,100 jobs  over the next 10 years.  Shares of Micron lower, we should say, in the  premarket, but just fractionally here, folks.</p><p>And then check this out, an incredible photo of lightning striking Lake  Michigan is going viral.  I bet Maria would love this, actually.  You can  see the giant bolt light up the sky as it strikes the surface of the water.   It was taken by a crew member on board a freight ship as it was crossing  the lake in a big storm.  And get this -- he snapped this picture on his  Samsung phone.  The shipping company posted the photo to its Facebook page.   It's been seen and shared almost 7,000 times so far.  It's incredible.</p><p>All right.

You've got to get a slinky.  Slinky, slinky --  go, slinky, go.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  It is national slinky day, invented in 1943.  The slinky has  entertained generations of kids including most of the people on the set  today.  It's been inducted into the toy hall of fame.  It is on \"Time  Magazine's\" list of top 100 toys.  NASA even taking the slinky into space  for a zero gravity experiment.</p><p>Anyway -- all right, people time for our slink-off here on set.  I got --  actually mine matches your dress.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nicest piece of jewelry I've ever owned.  The slinky.</p><p>CASONE:  Yes, yes, yes.  You got it, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm so glad it fits over my fat hand.</p><p>CASONE:  Oh, please.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What -- Robert Wolf, a slinky won't make you smile?  </p><p>WOLF:  I'm smiling.  I'm just actually focused on trying to break that  record that Jim Carrey is going for. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Any reason to show some \"Ace Ventura Pet Detective\" video.  </p><p>WOLF:  Classic.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you -- Cheryl.  Thank you for the slinkies.</p><p>Coming up, jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon, details on a new  cryptocurrency find.</p><p>And an easier way to order coffee, the changes heading to your Amazon Alexa  -- that's ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump just tweeting on these markets, writing this,  \"The news from the financial markets is even better than anticipated.  For  all of you that have made a fortune in the markets or seen your 401(k)s  rise beyond your wildest expectations more good news is coming.\"  That's a  big promise coming from the President.</p><p>Joining us now, Morgan Creek Capital Management CEO, chief investment  officer Mark Yusko.  Mark -- great to see you as always.</p><p>Do you expect, looking at just stocks, that this bull run that we've had  will continue?  </p><p>MARK YUSKO, CEO, MORGAN CREEK CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Look, I think, you know,  any time there's positive news, Dagen -- that markets will react,  particularly in these late stages of the summer, you know, when everybody  is away on vacation.</p><p>I think post Labor Day, it's going to be interesting to see when people  come back from vacation if they look at valuations and get a little  nervous.  But as long as they keep bringing us good news on trade, things I  think will be stable.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you would put new money to work in stocks right now?  </p><p>YUSKO:  No, I wouldn't do that at all.  You know, we think -- we think  stocks are very over-valued.  We've been lightening up and trying to get  hedged and focusing on different areas.  But, yes, I probably wouldn't put  new money.</p><p>But I, you know, wouldn't be so nervous if were to have any imminent  collapse or anything like that.  </p><p>WOLF:  And what if we saw -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mark -- this is Robert Wolf, by the way.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  Sorry -- Mark.  I'm looking at the wrong one.</p><p>YUSKO:  Hey, Robert.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  How are you?  Good to see you.</p><p>YUSKO:  Good.  </p><p>WOLF:  I'm kind of with you.  I'm a little cautious and a little more  defensive as well.  How do you see the environment going into rising rate  environment, you know, big discussions coming up on this fiscal discipline?   We have the budget coming up which obviously will be very interesting going  into, you know, the November elections.  And so are those causes for  concern as you come into the fall?  </p><p>YUSKO:  Robert -- you've hit all the list of things that people should be  thinking about and be concerned about.  You know, interest rates have  certainly risen and when you discount future streams of cash flows, which  is what stocks are at a higher discount rate, the value should go down, not  up.  And yet the PE ratios keep rising.</p><p>And that's because I think this passive wave of money -- you know, passive  investing is dumb.  And I don't mean unintelligent.  I mean it's rule- based.  And rule-based strategies, they can't think.  They can't say oh,  that valuation seems high to me.  They just have to buy what's on the list.</p><p>So you bring up another point about deficit spending.  You know, deficit  spending is basically a wealth tax on the middle class.  And that's why  income inequality is the highest it has ever been because we have been  deficit spending like crazy for the last two decades.</p><p>That's why we're so focused on block chain technology, bitcoin, crypto.   Those things solve the income inequality problem that we're all facing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Mark -- James Freeman here at \"The Wall Street Journal\".</p><p>YUSKO:  Hi -- James.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Ok.  You talked about the downside and high valuations.  Is this  related in part to your expectations on the economy?  Are you thinking that  this second quarter number does not get repeated and things really slow  down?  Or do you think the economy's going to be great but stocks are just  priced too high?  </p><p>YUSKO:  No, James -- again, this is fun this morning.  You guys are  bringing up all the best points.  You know, look, the economy hasn't grown  above 2 percent for six years.  We had one quarter, that was juiced by the  tax deform act as I call it.  And it's not going to be repeated in the  third and fourth quarter.  It's just not.</p><p>You know, GDP, nominal GDP is really simple.  It's productivity plus  working age population growth.  We know working age population growth over  the next 10 years is going to be sub-1 percent.  We know productivity is  going to be sub-1 percent.</p><p>It turns out, 65 to 85-year-old people are not as productive as 45 to 65- year-old people.  Who would have thunk it.  So it's unlikely that -- </p><p>WOLF:  That's ageism.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mark -- I want to get to -- </p><p>YUSKO:  It doesn't mean they're not good people.  It just means that  productivity is -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I quickly want to get to this.  You joined forces with Bit  Wise, launching an institutional fund cryptocurrency.  Tell us about it.   And would you eventually launch something for retail?  </p><p>YUSKO:  Yes, it's great.  Thank you -- Dagen.</p><p>So look, we started getting involved in the pick and shovels, in the  venture capital around providing the infrastructure for block chain  technology, cryptocurrency.  And we had institutional investors come to us  and saying we'd really like to get some exposure to crypto, that kind of  get off zero which is the allocation most people have.</p><p>So we went out and searched for a world class partner.  We found the Bit  Wise team out in California.  And we've come together to form this new  Digital Asset Index Fund that we think can solve the problem for  institutions that want to get exposure.</p><p>We've been around, doing institutional investing for decades.  And we think  their technology and their expertise in handling and managing the actual  crypto is a great combination.</p><p>In terms of a solution for retail, we clearly would like to move in that  direction as well.  We're going to work closely with regulators to try to  see if we can get that accredited investor standard to not apply only to  the sector of the market like other alternative investments.  Hopefully  we'll get there too.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mark Yusko -- thank you so much, Mark.  Great to see you, dear.   Mark Yusko -- </p><p>YUSKO:  Thanks -- Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- joining us.</p><p>YUSKO:  Thanks -- guys.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up -- the future of war games with South Korea.  The  details as President Trump says there's no reason to resume the joint  military exercises.</p><p>Plus, forget cars, why Uber Eats is looking to deliver food with drones.   That's ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DAGENMCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Thursday, August 30th.  Your top  stories at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.  </p><p>Closing in, tomorrow, the deadline for a trade deal with Canada.  President  Trump optimistic we'll have a deal in time.  Canada's Prime Minister Justin  Trudeau says there will only be a deal if it's good for Canada.  </p><p>Investors are showing a little bit of concern.  We have a 61 point loss on  the Dow Futures right now but I'll tell you, Sam Stovall was here, we're  coming off a day where you had the NASDAQ, S&amp;P and Russell 2000 hitting new  all-time highs for the fourth day in a row.  And Sam Stovall told me  earlier that the fourth quarter of mid-term election years, the S&amp;P is up  7.5 percent in the fourth quarter and is up 90 percent of the time in mid- term election years, so maybe waiting for some uncertainty to be lifted.  </p><p>But markets hitting higher.  Not the story in Europe, England, France and  Germany, those gauges all heading lower and it was really the same story in  Asia Overnight.  The Nikkei managing to eke out a small gain.  Trade  tensions a concern there as well.  </p><p>Recall alert, Takata airbags could explode under pressure from heat and  humidity.  Tens of millions of cars under this recall.  </p><p>Taking to the skies, Uber Eats looking to deliver food to your door by  drone.  </p><p>And hey Alexa, order me a donut.  Amazon teaming up with a big name so you  can order tasty sweet treats using the digital assistant.  The details of  this delicious deal in a few minutes.  </p><p>And clear is cool, beverage maker seeing the future in clear cola and other  transparent tonics.  We will see if clear can lead to green.  </p><p>And now to this top story at the bottom of the hour, holding off for now,  the president issuing a White House statement yesterday about U.S.-South  Korean military exercises, tweeting this.  The president believes that his  relationship with Kim Jong-un is a very good one and warm one and there is  no reason at this time to be spending large amounts of money on joint U.S.- South Korea war games.  Besides the president can instantly start the joint  exercises again with South Korea and Japan if he so chooses.  This after  defense secretary -- Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said this earlier this  week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES MATTIS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  We took the step to  suspend several of the largest exercises at a good faith measure coming out  of the Singapore summit.  We will work very closely, as I said, with the  Secretary of State and what he needs done.  We will certainly do to  reinforce his effort.  But at this time, there is no discussion about  further suspensions.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining me now, former CIA trained intelligence operative,  former navy pilot, Fox News correspondent Lea Gabrielle.  Lea Gabrielle,  paint this picture for us.  What's going on? </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think what's going on is  there is -- as I've said so many times on this show before, there's always  public diplomacy and then there's private diplomacy.  And these  negotiations with North Korea, there are messages being sent, like  President Trump tweeting, that's public diplomacy.  A message that he wants  everyone to hear, saying, our relationship is warm, keeping that door open  to the North Korean leader.  </p><p>But then, there's also the private things that are going on.  And those are  the more detailed negotiations that are going on.  </p><p>Secretary Pompeo and his staff, he's got his newly -- he's got the new  negotiator Stephen Biegun who's going to be doing these negotiations.  So,  there's a lot going on behind the scenes between these public and these  private messages.  </p><p>Now, I think that people are trying to find space between President Trump,  Secretary Pompeo and Secretary Mattis.  I think that that's really -- it's  really kind of being over-played.  I think that the messages are actually  pretty much the same.  Secretary Mattis is basically saying, OK we've  canceled a couple exercises but as the military, we always continue to plan  and prepare because it's much easier to stop something and to cancel  something than to try to recreate everything if you haven't planned for it.  </p><p>So, they'll plan for exercises and we've been doing this for a long time  with South Korea.  And they'll keep those plans in place and then if they  want to, they can cancel them last minute.  </p><p>But I think that Secretary Pompeo and his folks at the State Department are  working very hard to keep these negotiations going.  A senior State  Department Official directly involved in negotiations has said that Kim  Jong-un is very intelligent and that -- you know, there's clearly a respect  there for who they're dealing with and the level of negotiations that are  going to have to take place.  </p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, I think Lea the fly in the  ointment in all of this placed in the administration is President Moon of  South Korea.  You know, because, we could talk about all we want about  resuming exercises or not.  The South Koreans are the ones that canceled --  that wanted to cancel the last exercises.  And when you look at Moon, he is  proceeding in trying to normalize relationships, the relationship between  North and South Korea.  And in a way that I think is disadvantageous to the  -- to the U.S. position, especially when you look at all the new economic  agreements that he's signing.  </p><p>So, the South Koreans, Moon specifically, are way far out in front of this  administration.  And I think they're making it more difficult for us to  have the leverage that we need in order to keep the North Korean leader's  feet to the fire.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  I think that's a good point but at the same time, I think when  you look at our relationship with South Korea over the long term, I think  if they have to decide between one -- between one country or the other,  they're going to lean more towards us.  I agree with you that they're  making it a little more difficult.  Because they really do want to come to  terms, they really do want to normalize those relationships.  And there may  be some naivete on the part of South Koreans in terms of what can actually  be accomplished.  </p><p>But I think this administration, is trying very hard to develop a  relationship, to show North Korea what can be done and how they can operate  economically.  How they can be brought into the fold of western  civilization into the better picture of life for them if they want to work  with us and trying very hard to show them that if they don't, that their  future is very dark and very bleak.  </p><p>So there's this public messaging.  There's the private communications.   Ultimately, I think that South Korea will always choose to work with us  because we've been their partner for so long.  </p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  So, I guess we should be encouraged  that the president still thinks there's hope for a deal.  Stephen Biegun,  great hire to manage this relationship.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Absolutely.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  But it -- I do wonder, given the pressure of sanctions, if North  Korea wanted to reform, why are they dragging this out?  I mean, wouldn't  they be -- you think they might be eager to get relief from those  sanctions?  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  It seems so simple when you look at it from the 20,000-foot  perspective like we do in the media, right?</p><p>FREEMAN:  Right.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  We look at the big picture and we're kind of like, this seems  so easy.  But when you get into the details, there's so much more that  they're dealing with.  You know, there's the relationship between North  Korea and China.  That they've been -- China has been North Korea's best  trading partner, best ally and now here we are in these negotiations with  China.  Where we're trying to get better trade deals.  President Trump is  trying to maintain a positive relationship with China.  But at the same  time, China has been backing up North Korea, continues to back up North  Korea and President Trump is calling them out.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Basically loosening their trade restrictions.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the Korea ignoring sanctions.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  They're giving them money, fuels, fertilizer.  Varies that our  commodities.  So, our sanctions -- you know, the sanctions don't work if  they're not imposed.  So, it's a challenge.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I want to move on to this story it's about Iran, recently  declassified reports reviewed by the Wall Street Journal revealed the role  that Iran played in the Iraq war, specifically training and arming Iraqi  militias.  Lea, what are you seeing in this report?  I know you've looked  at them.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  So, yes.  These reports, I've got several of them right here  that I've been taking a look at.  And they have been recently declassified  by Central Command for the purposes of studying the history of the Iraq  war.  </p><p>But what we're really seeing here is the extreme influence that Iran had in  the Iraq war, how Iran has been jockeying for influence in Iraq during the  war, trying to get us to leave Iraq, and since then.  We know that that's  the case.  And these reports give some really good information from one of  the detainees about how Iran was providing weapons, was providing training,  was pushing Shia militias within Iraq to attack U.S. and British troops.  </p><p>Specifically, it talks about the Karbala attack in which five U.S. -- five  American soldiers were killed.  The detainee is somebody who is a leader of  a Shia militia group in Iraq.  </p><p>And so, it gives a lot of insight into how those groups were operating and  that influence.  And as we look at Iran, the nuclear deal, why Trump --  President Trump pulled out of it, a lot of that is because of how Iran is  meddling in the region and asserting its influence.  And I think that these  documents being released, and being able to see how Iran operates really  does kind of give some backing to that argument about the environment.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Iran made richer by the nuclear deal, that was cut by the  U.S., number one.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And funneling money to Hezbollah to rebels in Yemen, its  interference in Syria, its attacks -- you know, attacks on Israel.  And,  again, that money being used to basically spread terrorism throughout the  region.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  And now Iran is seeing the hit.  Because economically they're  not doing well.  Their unemployment rate is very high.  Their currency has  been taking a big hit.  Rouhani has been taking big hit politically right  now.  So, they're definitely feeling the squeeze when it comes to economic  pressure from pulling out of the deal.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lea, you hit -- you covered a lot of ground for us.  Thank you  so much. </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you as always.  </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Great to see you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Major concerns over Takata airbags, a new warning about the  airbags that they might explode in extreme heat.  </p><p>And jumping on the seltzer trend, how beverage companies are marketing  clear to customers, ahead.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A new warning over exploding Takata airbags.  Cheryl Casone has  more, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, more troubles for this  airbags and this company, Dagen.  The National Highway Traffic Safety  Administrations says tens of millions of cars with Takata airbags face an  increased chance of exploding in hot and humid conditions.  New warning old  recall.  There's about 50 million defective Takata airbags in 37 million  vehicles in the United States right now.  Takata had already filed for  bankruptcy court protection last year.  They were eventually bought by U.S.  based Key Safety Systems but, again, this needs to be dealt with by  drivers.  </p><p>Uber is looking to spread its wings.  The company which already plans to  offer flying cars now wants to use drones to deliver food as part of Uber  Eats.  Uber making the announcement at its Uber Elevate conference out in  Tokyo.  The Uber Eats drone is still in the early stages obviously.   Amazon, Walmart, Google, are all working on the concept of delivery drones  and with delivery drones, not sure it's coming to New York any time soon.  </p><p>Then there's Amazon's Alexa which can now order you a fresh cup of coffee  every morning.  Dunkin' Donuts Perks Rewards members can link their  accounts to their Alexa and order breakfast before they leave their house.   Customers can log in -- you log in the app, you choose from the menu and  then you ask Alexa to place the order or they can just ask Alexa to order  their last saved favorite.  Pretty good, I like it.  If it gets you out the  door quicker, then it's a pretty good idea, right?  Dagen, so, there you  have it.  Alexa -- I don't have an Alexa, do you? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I have everything.  </p><p>CASONE:  Everything.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Everything and I don't -- and I don't use them.  But you know  what?  On a morning that I bumped into more pieces of furniture than you  can imagine, bruises, I need a dodo, I need a dodo and it's not even 8:00  a.m.  </p><p>CASONE:  You've got to be careful, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is me not -- I know, this is me not doing my Homer Simpson  impression.  I will save that for later.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, don't judge a drink by its color, the details on clear beverages  companies are creating to woo new customers.  That's next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump just tweeting this, Ivanka Trump and Jared  Kushner had nothing to do with the so-called pushing out of Don McGahn.   The fake news media has it purposefully so wrong.  They love to portray  chaos in the White House when they know that chaos doesn't exist.  Just a  smooth running machine with changing parts.  </p><p>Switching some gears, in Japan a new trend is brewing, clear beer, that is.   Lauren Simonetti has more on this.  Hi, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Well, if it's clear,  it's healthier, right?  It's a mind game.  But it is an effective mind  game.  </p><p>So, check this out, in the U.S. and in Japan, clear anything is selling.   In fact, Americans rang up $2.7 billion in sparkling water and seltzer  sales in the past year.  That's more than juice.  And sales of flavored  bottled water have tripled in the past decade here in the U.S. and also in  Japan where they're even chugging clear beer -- yes, without the alcohol,  all free all-time from Suntory is selling this beer.  It is flying off  store shelves in Japan.  Clear coffee, clear tea also very popular.  </p><p>But clear drinks are nothing new.  PepsiCo. launched Crystal Pepsi that was  back in 1992.  You know, at the time we just couldn't wrap our minds around  cola that wasn't brown.  But then, this happened.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I thought they shut that division down decades ago.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We never shut down.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Party people!. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  PepsiCo relaunched Crystal Pepsi back in 2016.  It's sold out,  yes, it's nostalgia.  It's a liquid history of our youth.  And the clear  trend was reborn.  We bought into it.  Now, we have PepsiCo recently buying  SodaStream for $3.2 billion.  Hard seltzer like, White Claw extremely  popular.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's alcoholic seltzer.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, hard, right.  Mineral water like Topo Chico.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  I love it.  I drink Topo Chico.  I love it, it's really good.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  OK.  That has a cult following.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And the list goes at La Croix. </p><p>ORTAGUS:  I buy all of these.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  La Croix.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  How do you say it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Isn't it La Croix?</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  I'm the wrong guy to ask.   I drink it and I like it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's La Croix?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I thought it was La Croix.  </p><p>WOLF:  I have to ask my wife.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK, you're right, it's La Croix.  They told me in my ear.  I was  trying to be (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>WOLF:  I like the grapefruit La Croix and the lime La Croix.  There's a few  of them I can't stand.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  It prevents me from drinking coke or Pepsi.  The Topo Chico is  the best.  I buy it all the time now. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what's delicious? Thanks to Kevin Kelly, there is a --  it's basically an energy drink business called Hiball.  I think it was  bought by -- it's organic.  It was bought by Anheuser-Busch.  But they have  a clear seltzer that is caffeinated.  And it has a lot of caffeine in it.   It will blow your shoes off.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  What is it about clear that is attracting us right now.  It  didn't work back in the '90s.  But it's working now.  Why? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think the brain connection is that it's somehow more  refreshing.  </p><p>WOLF:  The clear soda, I don't -- I don't think that's something I'm going  to buy.  I like the -- I like the dark soda.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I like the bubbles.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's called -- well, it's called Sprite.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Or 7-up.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, but there's too much sugar.  </p><p>WOLF:  No, I'm talking about Coca-Cola -- Pepsi.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  No, there's too much sugar in Sprite.  You can drink the La  Croix, you get the bubble that feels like the soda but without all the  sugar.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's my only advice doing this early morning shift.  Getting  up at 02:00 a.m. for almost nine years running, the first thing you got to  do when you get out of bed -- </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Caffeinate.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, drink a giant --</p><p>FREEMAN:  (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, drink a giant glass of very, very cold seltzer water.   Because it really wakes you up more than caffeine.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Now I know.  </p><p>WOLF:  Topo Chico.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I can't believe you've heard of it.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, I love it.  I buy it all the time.  It's good.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lauren great to see you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Still ahead, from iPhones to eye glasses, details on Apples new plans for  augmented reality glasses.

The European Union, the trade chief there saying  those countries are willing to cut car tariffs, get rid of them if the U.S.  will do the same.  We look at European markets losses across the board at  the moment although contained.  All three market gages there down about  half of one percent.  </p><p>In Asia overnight the major gages, closing mostly lower, the Nikkei eking  out a small gain to the upside.  Trump versus tech, the President going  toe-to-toe with Google accusing the search giant of bias against  conservative voices.  Google hitting back with its own evidence. Retail in  the red, we've got more retailers reporting earnings this morning.   Abercrombie and Fitch and Dollar General sliding ahead of the open.</p><p>Abercrombie and Fitch down almost 10 percent in premarket trading.  We  break down those numbers.  And an Apple acquisition, the iPhone maker just  bought a company that makes lenses for augmented reality.  We'll find out  what new device the house of jobs might be getting in to.</p><p>And then there's this.  Many lobsters were killed in a truck crash in  Maine.  Now PETA wants to   erect a memorial to the crustaceans that were lost.  Here to break it all  down, national security analyst Morgan Ortagus, Borrowed Time co-author,  James Freeman, and 32 Advisers founder and CEO, Fox Business contributor,  Robert Wolf.  Made you laugh.  I think that was the point.  I think that's  the point.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Sounds like one delicious memorial,  maybe we could have a separate ceremony at dinner one evening.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Growing up in the south, I would just say -- I asked 10 people  who were not above eating road kill, so I think you all could pull your  chairs up to the same table, James Freeman.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  That's some good road kill.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that PETA has a sense of humor.  There we go.  Good to  see you.  </p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you.  So we're -- we've got a lot more coming up in  this hour.  Former Speaker of the House, Fox News contributor Newt  Gingrich, SAP Americas and Asia-pacific Japan President, Jim Morgan is  here, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\", Stuart Varney.  All of those fine  folks coming up.</p><p>President Trump tweeted this morning once again this morning.  The only  thing James Comey ever got right was when he said that President Trump was  not under investigation.  Comey still on his mind.  And now onto our top  story this hour.  A trade deal on the horizon.  Growing optimism over U.S.  negotiations with Canada.  Blake Burman is on that story at the White House  live for us.  Blake, good morning.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there Dagen, good  morning to you as well.  Talks to set to resume between the United States  and Canada, Canada's minister of foreign affairs and top trade rep here in  the U.S.  About an hour from now at the top of the 9:00 hour, it has been  two days of intense negotiations at the highest levels and it appears as if  the United States and Canada are getting closer.</p><p>President Trump when asked about this yesterday said that things are going  \"really well.\"  And this was his responses when he was asked if he's  optimistic that the two sides can come to a deal.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think so.  I think Canada  very much wants to make a deal and I think it's going to be obviously very  goods for Canada if they do and I think it's probably not going to be good  at all if they don't.  We have a very good relationship.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  The Trump administration set a deadline for Canada of Friday,  tomorrow to either come to some sort of a compromise with the U.S. or at  least show that they are willing to move forward so that the administration  can go to Congress here at home and say that things are moving in the right  direction with Canada.  The Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland saying  yesterday that she feels there is a spirit of compromise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRYSTIA FREELAND, MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF CANADA:  I do.  I feel  that both parties are coming to this stage of the negotiations with a lot  of good will.  Certainly that is what Canada is bringing to the table.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Meantime, Dagen, the European Union's top trade rep this morning  saying that the E.U. would be willing to go to zero tariffs on autos, so  long as the United States do the same, if that were to happen and it is an  if at this point, that would no doubt be a major win for President Trump  and that statement today from the E.U. goes beyond the framework that the  U.S. and E.U. said that they would work upon when it was announced here at  the White House last month, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And maybe a win for people who would love a cheaper pickup  truck.</p><p>BURMAN:  Right, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because again we've got a 25 percent tariff on imported light  trucks in this country.  Good to see you, Blake.</p><p>BURMAN:  You too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Blake Burman live at the White House.  Joining me now, former  speaker of the house, Fox News contributor Newt Gingrich.  Your current --  your take, Mr. Speaker, on the current trade negotiations.  </p><p>NEWT GINGRICH, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, things going very well for  Trump, and United States.  In fact there's lots of people thought he  couldn't get a deal with Mexico.  He clearly is going to have a deal with  Mexico.  That's a huge breakthrough.  And sets the stage for a much better  relationship with the incoming new Mexican President.  At the same time the  Canadians I think sort of thought they could sit it out for a while.</p><p>And now they're having to play catch-up, and United States is so key to the  Canadian economy that they have to get to an agreement.  The Canadians  cannot afford to have the U.S. start applying tariffs in other things that  would stop them.  So I think Trump is in a strong position, the only  question I would raise about the European offer are they going to continue  to value-added tax where they get to rebate for their autos.</p><p>And then apply the tax to our cars and isn't that in effect the same as  tariffs?  So, I think you've got to enter a European negotiation with a  full understanding of the different gimmicks they use to protect their  market.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Mr. Speaker, Newt, this is actually why I've been -- I've  been negative on the tariffs that the Trump administration has used because  it is essentially a value-added tax on imports in this country.  It's a tax  that ultimately would be passed on to consumers, but given this deal that  they've been able to negotiate with Mexico moving on to Canada, how quickly  do you think we could get a deal.</p><p>And actually get some concessions from China on the fact that that nation  steals our intellectual property trying to put a stop to that, trying to  put a stop to the forced surrender of our own technology.  Again, the  naysayers with this President often are wrong and I would admit that but  what about China?  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Well, China is a much harder case because you're now asking the  Chinese government to give up what the Chinese government is doing.  You  know, intellectual property theft in China is not random behavior, it's  actually a division of the people's liberation army based right outside of  Beijing.  And they do it as a deliberate act of government policy.  So  you're asking them to profoundly change how they've operated.</p><p>I think we ought to be very tough with them.  And I do think they are  rattled by the way in which Trump is marching down the road.  And the fact  the Trump understands, we, you know, the Chinese need us, 10 or 15 times  more than we need them.  And he is in a very strong position.  My guess is  that they'll turn to Europe next and then towards China just because  Europeans seem rattled and should have done the deal.</p><p>But Trump is beginning to prove that he can actually negotiate  international trade in a way that no so-called expert thought he could.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mr. Speaker, let's just talk about President Trump was tweeting  about the stock market promising more great things to come.  But there is  so little focus on the left by the Democrats on what is really going on in  this country on the ground in terms of this incredible economic growth that  we've seen.  In the quarter, the last quarter fastest pace in nearly four  years.</p><p>Estimates that are north of four percent at least for the current -- the  quarter that we are in wages fastest growth in a decade, optimism among  consumers highest it's been in 18 years.  New record-highs on the stock  market.  This is a huge opportunity for Republicans as we head into the  midterms to highlight this over and over and over and over again.  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Well, look, I think there is a huge opportunity here because as  the Democrats respond to Trump by going further and further to the left and  getting crazier and crazier, they're creating this huge gap, I mean, look  at the Florida outcome as an example, look what Gavin Newsom is promising  in California as the Democratic nominee who wants to apply universal  healthcare to people who are here illegally.</p><p>Which could make California the recipient of medical refugees from entire  planet.  You know, the message could be if you get sick go to California,  they want to take care of you.  These kind of ideas are permeating the  Democratic Party right now.  And the liberal media is not doing the  Democrats any favor by allowing them to get further and further and further  out of touch with reality.</p><p>And as you point, the reality is I believe the numbers that came out this  morning, we've had a bigger increase in the media and income in the last  year than in the eight years of Obama combined.  That's a remarkable  achievement by Trump.  And I think it will make him stronger and stronger. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's almost comical though that some of the Democrats are now  worried about the debt and deficits, these are Democrats who didn't vote  for the tax cuts, they don't believe in giving -- allowing individuals to  keep more of their money, allowing corporations to make decisions that are  in their best interests, interest of the company, interest of the employees  but now that they're -- one of the talking points I've actually heard more  than once from people, who come on our air is that they are now worried  about inflation.</p><p>That an -- oh, inflation is eating up more than the wage gains that we have  in this country and it is high comedy, Newt.  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Look, I think the Democrats have a huge problem.  They've never  gotten over Hillary Clinton losing.  That was a psychotic moment for them  would happen so suddenly.  And the result is, they wake up every morning  knowing Trump did something wrong, I wonder what it is.  And that's how  they spend all day every day, and so they can't -- they can't unlock, they  can't come to grips with what is a rapidly changing world.</p><p>Look, in Florida, a Democratic nominee for governor of Florida is promising  the highest business tax rate in the south.  Now, what's that going to do?   It's going to drive jobs out of Florida.  Gavin Newsom is campaigning in  favor of a higher gasoline tax in California.  Every time you turn around,  the Democrats shows up ask him, how much are they going to raise taxes to  pay for the government-run healthcare proposal?</p><p>Our estimate for California alone is maybe 4$0 billion a year in higher  taxes.  That's the kind of self-worth.  They're simply spinning out of  touch with reality and I think that will bite them very badly this fall.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This garbage, I never took math in school, Medicare for all  proposal that you hear some people on the left.  We would have to more than  double the amount of money that the Federal government takes in from  corporate and individual taxes in this country and it still wouldn't pay  for it over a 10-year period.  That's how the math doesn't add up.  At the  same time they don't -- you can't touch or even try to fix Medicare or  Social Security, Newt.</p><p>Again, it's just -- it's not living in a world of reality, a reality where  people have bigger paychecks, 90 percent of people have larger paychecks  this year and it's not Nancy Pelosi making decisions with your money, it's  you sitting at home whether you live in Iowa, Missouri, or Oregon.  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Well, look, I think it's pretty simple.  Medicare for all is  Medicare for none because the whole system would collapse.  The fact is  most Americans don't want government bureaucrats running their health  system.  I think all these big ideas collapse when you start looking at  them in the real world.  And that's why I think if the Republicans are  prepared to run an aggressive campaign of a big choice they may have a  surprising outcome this fall just as we did in 2016.</p><p>Remember, up until election night 2016, all of the experts thought Hillary  would win.  I think the same thing we may be about to face same reality  this year and suddenly have a huge Republican gain in the Senate and  potentially I think actually have the Republicans increase House seats  rather than losing.  If that happens, the level of shock on the left will  be unbelievable.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Newt, really quickly with the President taking on Google,  worried about conservative speech being suppressed by the social media  companies.  Do you think that he will regulate or is it just talk?  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Well, I think at a minimum, we need hearings to bring in, you  know, Twitter, Google, Facebook.  I mean, these large institutions are  really quasi public.  And you cannot have them dominating information space  only on behalf of left wingers.  I was frankly very surprised by how biased  they have been.  And I think you've got to look, and I don't know what  solution is yet but you at least got to get it out in the open.</p><p>And at the minimum places like Google and Facebook ought to have advisory  groups that are genuinely both liberal and conservative with real power to  supervise and to police it and make sure that every citizen has the real  fair opportunity to communicate.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amen, sir.  Amen.  Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.   Great to see you as always.  </p><p>GINGRICH:  Good to see you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  Augmented Apple.  The tech giant's ambitions with  A.R. glasses.  Plus, a new plan for PETA.  Why the animal rights group  wants to say good-bye to some lobsters in a very unusual way later this  hour.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  President Trump tweeting on.  Here is what the President just  said, I am very excited about the person who will be taking the place of  Don McGahn as White House Counsel.  I like Don but he was not responsible  for me not firing Bob Mueller or Jeff Sessions.  So much fake reporting and  fake news.  Yes.  Bob Mueller is still there, Jeff Sessions still there.   But -- we want to remember that was Robert Wolf, you want time to comment.  </p><p>WOLF:  Biting my tongue.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But right now we want to remember the maverick, a  political icon, war hero, the first of many memorials taking place  yesterday for the late Arizona Senator John McCain.  Thousands of people  lining up in 100 degree temperatures to pay their respects at the state's  Capitol.  Hillary Vaughn is in Phoenix with more details particularly on  that service that's going to happen later today.  I think it's at 1:00 East  Coast time.  Hillary?</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Dagen.  1:00 p.m.  East Coast Time.  The service will start here at the North Phoenix Baptist  Church.  But earlier yesterday thousands of people gathered in this triple- digit heat to pay their respects to Senator John McCain.  The last person  walking through the Capitol at 9:00 p.m. yesterday evening, some of the  McCain kids made a surprise visit to those late night visitors at the  Capitol.</p><p>Sidney, Jimmy, Jack, and Doug shaking hands and sharing touching moments  with supporters who wanted to pay their respects, the private ceremony  yesterday at the Capitol was the first of several events planned for the  remainder of this week to celebrate the life and legacy of John McCain.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GOV. DOUG DUCEY (R), ARIZONA:  He fought like hell for causes he believed  in.  He plowed through election after election with the energy and focus of  a warrior.  But along the way, he did it with humor and humanity.  And  without compromising the principles he healed so dear.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUGHN:  Senator McCain will be escorted by his family from the Capitol at  9:00 a.m. local time this morning.  They will make their way here to the  North Phoenix Baptist Church for memorial service.  Along the way they  expect thousands to stand along the motorcade route at the ceremony here.   Former Vice President Joe Biden will give an address along with Governor  Doug Ducey who will be in attendance.</p><p>Over 22 sitting Senators will also be here at the church for the memorial  service along with staff and players from the Arizona Cardinals and also  the Arizona Diamondbacks which McCain was a very big fan of, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was every person, every speaker, every song, every detail  planned over a period of several months by Senator John McCain.  And it's  an incredible way watching it yesterday, the people lining up to pay their  respects and look forward to watching it later today of what he meant to  the people of Arizona and how much that state and it's incredible  breathtaking beauty and the people how much it meant to him.  Thank you so  much, Hillary Vaughn.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Eyeing progress on trade.  The next round of talks with Canada,  they start in less than an hour.  The uncertainty over deals weighing on  business across industries.  Joining us now, SAP Americas and Asia Pacific  Japan President, Jennifer Morgan. Jennifer, SAP is one of the worldwide  leaders in business software applications clients in over 180 countries.   How are these trade disputes impacting customers and businesses as you see  it right now?  </p><p>JENNIFER MORGAN, PRESIDENT, SAP AMERICAS AND ASIA PACIFIC JAPAN:  What's  interesting, I was -- I was with a big CPG company yesterday, I was with an  aerospace company the day before and one of them said, every morning when I  wake up, I look at the news to understand what do I need to think about in  my supply chain.  How do I need to think differently and what do I need to  pivot?</p><p>And this is exactly what we do.  This is our bread and butter.  Helping  customers understand how to have most agile supply chain and how to pivot  and how use technology to your advantage.  So in times of uncertainty this  is where we can really help our customers.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So you would actually benefiting from the uncertainty.</p><p>MORGAN:  We're helping customers work through it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But have you seen in terms of businesses making big changes or  holding off on investment decisions, holding off on decision-making because  they don't know what's going to happen with these trade negotiations? </p><p>MORGAN:  I see them really leaning into technology because the only way to  really cope with -- to cope with the change is through technology.  And  it's -- we're in a real time economy, and so these companies have to think  in very different ways.  So, now I see really leaning in.  </p><p>WOLF:  Jennifer you and your company had an amazing kind of past year.  </p><p>MORGAN:  Yes.  </p><p>WOLF:  Talk about, you know, the growth of your cloud business.  I heard  it's like up over 40 percent and what's making you grow, you know,  literally at a better pace in the market?</p><p>MORGAN:  Yes.  We had great growth in K2, we have 40 percent revenue growth  in the cloud.  Really (INAUDIBLE) across all of our regions and industries.   Digital transformation is obviously front and center.  A lot of M&amp;A  activity that we see out there, companies have to think about how they can  very quickly embrace those companies, get the synergies that they need.   I'd say the other trend is around companies thinking about the consumer  experience.</p><p>Companies right now, the companies that will really thrive are the ones who  are really thinking what is the experience that my consumer wants to have  with my brand.  It's not just about the buying experience but it's about  the entire experience and companies who want to get direct to the consumer  have to also make sure they got the right planning in place, supply chain,  inventory so that you get the experience that you want.</p><p>Not upfront but across the whole time for that customer.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  So you've been -- sounds like seeing good results everywhere but  the larger picture seems to be the U.S. doing really well, rest of the  world not so great.  Are you kind of thinking maybe the rest of the world  is perking up, going to be growing faster based on what you've seen?  </p><p>MORGAN:  Yes.  I was -- I spent most of summer in both Europe and Asia and  for us that's a really strong part of our business.  Europe is a big part  of our business.  We saw great growth in our European businesses and in  Asia you really -- the CEOs are leaning in, we had a big CEO event in Tokyo  and that was great because these CEOs are leaning into the direct to  consumer to really by the digital transformation.</p><p>So our business has done very, very well, you know, across all the  different regions.  Mexico last week interesting, I was down in Mexico  meeting with some of our largest retail customers as well.  Same thing,  same thing down there, moving to the cloud trying to get the cost down.</p><p>WOLF:  The President also said he loves Mexico.</p><p>MORGAN ORTAGUS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes.  I heard a little bit about  that conversation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Canada.  He did not leave Canada out. </p><p>WOLF:  No.  I just want to give them those --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FREEMAN: -- Mexico to pay for.</p><p>MORGAN:  I didn't say that.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Really quickly I want to get your quick take.  We reported  earlier that California is considering mandating one woman being onboard,  you're a woman who clearly in a very high profile position in corporate  America.  Your take.  </p><p>MORGAN:  So, I would -- I think most women, I know myself included, I silt  onboard of Bank of New York Mellon.  I want to be recognized and put in  positions based on my accomplishments and I think most women, most  underrepresented minorities feel the same ways.  I think it comes down to  leadership, right?  CEOs have it in their power to put women and  underrepresented minorities in leadership positions.</p><p>Boards have the ability to do this.  I look at our board at the bank, we  got 25 percent women on that board.  It's a leadership issue.  I think it's  all of the above.  I don't think it can be solved with just a quota.  </p><p>ORTAGUS:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Promotion and reward based on merit.  </p><p>MORGAN:  Yes.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Very interesting.  </p><p>MORGAN:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.  I think that that's what -- that's what we wish for  everybody.  </p><p>MORGAN:  Yes.  And we have great -- and we have to help people get there.   When you focus on people, the numbers follow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Jennifer.</p><p>MORGAN:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  A pleasure to see you.</p><p>MORGAN:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jennifer Morgan.  A war of words between New York Governor Cuomo  and his primary rival Cynthia Nixon.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), NEW YORK:  My opponent lives in world of fiction.

Hey, Jeff.  </p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Oh, you know, Dagen they  say the imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  I don't know.  The  person not supposed to be here for another 12 hours but he might already be  here.  We'll have an exclusive interview with that fellow right there in  just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Thursday, August 30th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Breaking  news, we just got initial jobless claims, they came in at 213,000.  We are  watching that -- we were expecting 214,000.  We also got a look at personal  income and spending for the month of July.  Personal spending up four- tenths of a percent in line with expectations.  Same story with personal  income, it was right in line with what economists were looking for, gaining  three-tenths of one percent.  We also look at these, the personals  consumption, expenditures.  This is the Federal Reserve's most important  gauge of inflation, gaining 2.3 percent.  The core there up two percent.   So, inflation based on that in check, wages still growing faster than  inflation.  </p><p>Futures are showing this this morning, 57-point gain -- no, excuse me, 57- point loss on the Dow Futures.  Losses in Europe, to tell you about, those  markets lower as well, ever so slightly looking at England, France, and  Germany down about half of one percent.  In Asia overnight, there was a  single gainer there, the Nikkei up not even one-tenth of a percent in  overnight trading.  </p><p>The deadline approaches, trade talks with Canada kicking off again this  morning, President Trump optimistic that Canada will join the new trade  deal with Mexico before tomorrow's deadline.</p><p>Spat in the city, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and primary rival Cynthia  Nixon kicking it up a notch in last night's gubernatorial debate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CUOMO:  My opponent lives in the world of fiction, I live in world of  facts.  Can you stop you interrupting?  Can you stop interrupting?</p><p>NIXON:  Can you stop lying?</p><p>CUOMO:  Yes.  As soon as you do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait until you hear what else they said to one another.   California Senate making it harder for young people to buy guns, we have  the latest details on the vote to change the legal age, coming up.</p><p>It's an Apple acquisition, the iPhone maker just bought a company that  makes lenses for augmented reality.  We'll find out what new device might  be coming out of the House of Jobs.  And tragedy on the highway, many  lobsters were killed in a truck cash in Maine.  Now, the seafaring victims  may get a memorial from their friends at PETA.</p><p>To our top story this half hour, President Trump heading to Evansville,  Indiana for a rally tonight.  Jeff Flock already on the ground this morning  where he's talking to diners at the Merry Go Round Restaurant ahead of the  President's visit.  Hey, Jeff.</p><p>FLOCK:  You can't make this stuff up, Dagen.  You know, if you don't wonder  whether this is Trump country or not, I don't know.  Maybe a picture tells  a thousand words here.  Although, I tell you, it's interesting, you know,  you talk to people, we sometimes come into town before these rallies just  to get a sense of the people of what they're about.  A lot of people like  the President's policies, not of them -- all of them are crazy about the  President himself, although this girl, I think is.  Now, you look like  somebody I might know. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, I'm going to be in town a little bit later in and  out of the Ford Center.</p><p>FLOCK:  There you go.  I don't know if that's real but there you go.  And  you're a supporter of the President.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>FLOCK:  A farmer?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.</p><p>FLOCK:  Why?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I just believe that he's going to do good for the  markets eventually.  Going to take a while to get the instability out of  him, but --</p><p>FLOCK:  If he raising corn and soybeans, and of course, those prices are  pretty far down.  Yes, go ahead.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't think Indiana is no longer a flyover state  because Donald has been here twice down the last two years.  He cares about  Midwest.</p><p>FLOCK:  There you go.  I hear you, sir.  I hear you.  I want to represent  everything fair and balanced over there, I got a table full of Democrats,  too, and we want to get a sense from them, too.  These guys meet here  frequently -- boy, man, they can eat, too.  Hey, Larry, I'm sorry to  interrupt you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No problem.</p><p>FLOCK:  Lifelong democrat.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, sir.</p><p>FLOCK:  A schoolteacher, you support the President right now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  oh, I'm a convert, for sure.</p><p>FLOCK:  What happened?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, I saw back when Clinton was in office, and what  happened with the things he did in office, so a big change in the attitude  of kids.</p><p>FLOCK:  Teachers, school tearchers?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, I mean, when we catch somebody red-handed, they're  doing something they deny, deny, deny.</p><p>FLOCK:  But now, wait a minute, what about this president here?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, I've changed my philosophy a little bit.  I'm  voting for policy not people.  And I -- I'm impressed with what Trump has  done and capable of doing with his hands tied.</p><p>FLOCK:  With the -- not so impressed with the tariffs?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, I'm not.  But if you look at history, there has  been a lot of Presidents have been questionable.</p><p>FLOCK:  I guess you're right on that one.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There it comes a point in time where, yes, you want  America to be better than it is, and I can't understand the Democrats --</p><p>FLOCK:  I got you --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Open walls and higher taxes.</p><p>FLOCK:  Larry, I appreciate it.  You can tell, Larry, is actually democrat,  because if you look down there, Kyl, he may be wearing overalls but he got  a pair of flip-flops on, that's a dead giveaway right there.  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is that how we judge somebody's political affiliation now, Jeff  Flock, I really don't think that's fair.  And those folks in Indiana sound  a lot like me.</p><p>FLOCK:  The father of superficiality.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I said those folks in --</p><p>FLOCK:  We're pretty far south here.  We're pretty far south.  You know,  these folks from Indiana, this is Southern Indiana, and we're south of  Louisville here, so pretty amazing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Pretty amazing.  You tell that fellow I said that on the air,  earlier, it's policy not personality, so you tell him I said that.</p><p>FLOCK:  I think it makes a lot of sense to a lot more people these days.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It does.  Jeff Flock, thank you so much for that.  James  Freeman, your reaction to what you heard.  I love that line about Indiana  is not a flyover state anymore because the President has been here twice  recently.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And I'm not sure how representative that crew is but suggests  maybe there are -- there is some patience on the part of farmers.  They  don't like these tariffs but they feel like we're generally heading in a  good direction, and I would say, Robert, you might have a better sense of  the incumbent Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly, looks like he's going to  have his hands full this November with Mike Braun.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes, I think -- listen, Joe Donnelly is a -- you know, he's a blue  collar guy, he fits incredibly well with police and fire, and the farmers,  and a popular guy in Indiana.  That being said, Trump is incredibly popular  in Indiana and there's going to be a real battle on the swing states in the  Senate whether it's here or Montana, or Missouri, and there's a slew of  them where it's I think a strong Democratic incumbent who's good locally  against an incredibly popular national President in those -- in those  states.  And then also, that's why right now most of them are flipping.</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Will he -- will he vote for Kavanaugh?</p><p>WOLF:  I think that -- my gut tells me that Kavanaugh will, you know, be on  the Supreme Court.  And that some of the swing state candidates will likely  vote for Kavanaugh.  You know, I can't say I love the process, obviously, I  think there's -- there was better ways to go about it, especially, based on  the past.  But I think right now, the Democratic Party has to realize that  they're in a battle in these swing states in the Senate. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There are 10 -- there are 10 democratic senators who are up for  re-election in states that Trump won.  10.</p><p>WOLF:  And I would say some of them.  I look at someone like Manchin and  Casey (ph).  They're probably in pretty good shape in West Virginia and  Pennsylvania look at someone like Kyrsten Sinema and the fellow running,  Phil Bredesen in Tennessee and Arizona.  They probably have a better  chance.  And then, you have a real group of us toss-ups I think it's going  to be quite interesting, you know, what happens, and a lot will be based on  what the economy does, you know, right into the midterms. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, part of the problem for some Democrats and you'll -- we  can talk about the language that we used to describe them, was kind of  highlighted in New York.  Things got heated.  There was the gubernatorial  debate between Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Cynthia Nixo, the actresss  political new comment.  Just listed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CUOMO:  My opponent lives in a world of fiction, I live in the world of  fact.  Can you stop interrupting?  Can you stop interrupting?</p><p>NIXON:  Can you stop lying?</p><p>CUOMO:  Yes.  As soon as you do.</p><p>NIXON:  We already have a corrupt corporate Republican in the White House,  we don't need a corrupt corporate Democrat in Albany as his main  opposition.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A lot of what you heard when you talk about abolishing ICE, she  tosses that out there like it's a foregone conclusion, and what did the  governor call members of ICE?  He took a shot -- he took a shot at  basically members of law enforcement in this country.  This is -- these </p><p>WOLF:  Thugs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thugs -- these individuals are pushing people left.  Do you  agree or not?  You don't even want to call him Democrat.</p><p>WOLF:  Listen, I -- (INAUDIBLE) you know I'm not part of the populous left.   I'm definitely, you know, socially to the left and probably more physically  conservative than most Republicans are today.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's talking about trade.</p><p>FREEMAN:  When I -- when I look at that debate, that doesn't make me feel  good living in the State of New York.  I think actually Governor Cuomo will  do a really good job for the State of New York.  I think that when we're  debating whether ICE is important or not, I don't think that's a debate we  should be having.  I think the debate should be more about the economy and  what they can do policy, not whether the air condition should be at 76, 76  or 68.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's how petty it is.</p><p>FREEMAN:  And so, you know, that's -- it is disappointing for me but as  someone in New York and as a Democrat, I think Governor Cuomo will be the  right guy, and I don't think we should be pushed left as a party.  I like  people like Tim Ryan out of Ohio who actually is a pro-growth democrat.   That's someone that's taking about not that $15.00 minimum wage is  important, but that a little wage is important.  There is -- sorry, go  ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, but I was going to say, here's the problem, that these  loudmouths in the major cities, in California and in New York, they drive  the messaging for a lot of Democrats and this is what people across the  country hear if they turn on other television networks.  And I've spend so  much time down helping taking care of my mother, down in Rural Virginia.   And people who live in these big cities, who live in these blue state bay  are missing what is going on in this country, and they are missing out  people feel about the economy and about President Trump, again, policy over  personality.  </p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, I think a lot of people in Upstate New York watching that  debate were disappointed thinking it was like watching a fight for mayor of  New York City, where was -- they wanted to hear a lot more about how you  revive growth in the cities, outside of New York City, upstate New York,  and I don't think they got too much on that last night.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And you know what, you loosen up those dairy restrictions of  exports going into Canada you know that helps upstate New York big time.   Coming up, eye on retail earnings we break down the numbers next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amazon may soon join the trillion-dollar club.  Gerri Willis on  the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with more.  Hey, Gerri.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, Dagen, that's right.  So,  pretty exciting stuff.  We've been watching Amazon shares here all morning  trading just below that 2000, level 1997.50 not far to go from here, and,  of course, to join that 2,000 -- to join the trillion-dollar club with  Apple, they'd have to hit 2050.57.  So, that will be the benchmark for  that.  Very exciting stuff.  We'll keep an eye on it.  Meanwhile, if you  are getting used to these retailers coming back, the brick-and-mortar  retailers doing really well.  Think about it again, Abercrombie and Fitch  missing on same-store sales three percent versus 3.7.  A disappointment  there, the shares trading lower, as you can see, down 10 percent.  Also,  Dollar General same-store sales beat estimates 3.7 percent but the full- year profit outlook was disappointing.  Interesting there, mix of business,  went to low margin consumable items like toothpaste, not good, Dollar Tree  also missing same-store estimates.  That stock down as well.  So, these  brick-and-mortar stores, not doing so well here.  Back to you, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gerri, thank you so much for that.  Turning to politics, Newt  Gingrich was talking about this earlier, California Gubernatorial Candidate  Gavin Newsom is now backing universal health care for illegally immigrants.   Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GAVIN NEWSOM, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA:  I did universal health  care when I was mayor, fully implemented regardless of pre-existing  conditions (INAUDIBLE) and regardless of your immigration status.   (INAUDIBLE) is the only universal health care plan for all undocumented  residents very proud of that and we proved it can be done without  bankrupting the city.  I'd like to see that we can extend that to the rest  of the state.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Mr. Varney, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\" </p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Forgive me for rolling my  eyes, but that is final lunacy.  It looks like, to me, the socialists are  having an increasingly important role to play within the Democrat Party.   Just put California aside for a moment, look at Florida, a socialist -- an  avowed socialist has made it to the gubernatorial final in Florida.  In New  York, last night, the avowed socialist Cynthia Nixon, I think she won the  debate against Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>And now, you've got California where Gavin Newsom as we just heard is going  for universal health care for all illegals in the state.  Who's going to  pay for that?  Well, business and the rich.  Can you imagine the exodus of  businesses and relatively wealthy people from California if they put this  kind of thing in place?  Can you imagine the welcome sign that he's hanging  out for everybody, anybody who's sick anywhere in the world, all you got to  do is get one foot in California and you are home free!  Financial lunacy!</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nine minutes away, more of Stuart.  We love you.  We'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>CASONE:  -- sent to Democratic Governor Jerry Brown for his signature.   Well, Apple is setting its sights on Augmented Reality, the company  confirming it's acquired a Akonia Holographics, it's a start-up that makes  lenses for Augmented Reality glasses.  The term is not disclosed.  Apple  won't discuss what it plans to do with Akonia, but the deal could help the  company develop an augmented reality headset.  Apple shares are slightly  higher ahead of the opening bell.</p><p>And then, there is this, animal rights group PETA is trying to erect a 5- foot tall granite tombstone at the site of a lobster truck crash that  happened in Brunswick, Maine.  About 7,000 pounds of lobster were destroyed  last week in the wreck.  So, the average size for a lobster was a pound and  half, that means about 4500 lobsters died in this crash.  Well, I mean, it  died before but you know what I'm saying.  Maine's Department of  Transportation is currently reviewing the tombstone that PETA wants to put  up in their memory.  PETA says it hopes the tombstone will, quote, remind  everybody that the best way to prevent such tragedies is to go vegan.  Yes.   I will send that back to you.  You just chew on that one for a minute.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, rather than scolding people who choose to eat meat and  seafood, they're trying to use a little bit of humor and trying to be light  about it, PETA.  I would just -- James is still laughing, he's been  laughing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FREEMAN:  That's what -- I wasn't sure if it was a gag from PETA or --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, it's not really a -- it's sort of a gag -- no, I -- you  know what, I don't -- I'm not going to lecture anybody about what they eat,  but that means meat eaters shouldn't lecture me about eating vegetable.</p><p>FREEMAN:  Well, OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Meantime, Jared Kushner arriving moments ago for the latest  round of trade talks with Canada.  Those talks set to begin in less than  four minutes.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you so much, Robert Wolf, James freeman, and Morgan  Ortagus.  You get five seconds Morgan, and you're the only other lady here,  so --</p><p>ORTAGUS:  Thank you.  I just want to say, Dagen, yesterday, you and I  watched the processional for Senator McCain.  We're all going to be  watching over the weekend and honoring a great man.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This afternoon, 1:00 p.m.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  I certainly will, and good morning, Dagen.  Good morning,  everyone. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

And right now, we are having a crisis of capitalism unlike anything experienced during the last four decades, if not longer. The evidence is everywhere - in rising inequality, in the division of fortunes between companies and workers, and in lethargic economic growth despite unprecedented infusions of monetary stimulus by the world's governments (a huge $29tn in total since 2008). Eight years on from the financial crisis and great recession, the US, UK and many other countries are still experiencing the longest, slowest economic recoveries in memory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This has, of course, diametrically shifted the political climate, creating a paradigm of insiders versus outsiders. In the US, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are different sides of the same coin; in Britain, <person><nameText>Jeremy Corbyn </nameText></person>is an equally dramatic response to establishment politics. The challenges to the political and economic status quo are not going away anytime soon. A recent Harvard study shows that only 19% of American millennials call themselves capitalist, and only 30% support the system as a whole. Perhaps more shocking, the numbers are not much better among the over-30 set. A mere half of Americans believe in the system of capitalism as practised today in the US, which is quite something for a nation that brought us the \"greed is good\" culture.</p><p>In some ways that is no surprise because, as I explore in my new book, Makers and Takers: The Rise of Finance and the Fall of American Business, the system of market capitalism as envisioned by Adam Smith is broken - the markets no longer support the economy, as a wealth of academic research shows. Market capitalism was set up to funnel worker savings into new businesses via the financial system. But only 15% of the capital in the financial institutions today goes towards that goal - the rest exists in a closed loop of trading and speculation.</p><p>The result is much slower than normal growth, which holds true not just in the US but in most advanced economies and many emerging ones. The politics of the day - populist, angry, divisive - reflect this, in the US, Europe and many parts of the developing world as well.</p><p>But the bifurcation of our economy and the resulting fractiousness in politics has become so extreme that we are now at a tipping point. And as a result, we have a rare, second chance to change the economic paradigm - to rewrite the rules of capitalism and create a more inclusive, sustainable economic growth.</p><p>Doing so will require a series of both technocratic and existential changes - everything from rethinking the nature of how companies are run (and for whom), crafting smarter national growth strategies and rewriting the narrative of trickle- down economics, which is now so clearly broken yet continues to guide the majority of economic policy decisions taken by our leaders.</p><p>But before we can do all these things, we need to understand where we are and how we got here. Our economic illness has a name: financialisation. It's a term for the trend by which Wall Street and its way of thinking have come to reign supreme in America, permeating not just Wall Street but all American business. It includes everything from the growth in size and scope of finance and financial activity in our economy to the rise of debt-fuelled speculation over productive lending, to the ascendancy of shareholder value as a model for corporate governance, to the proliferation of risky, selfish thinking in both our private and public sectors, to the increasing political power of financiers and the chief executives they enrich. All of which have led to a false sense of prosperity driven by market highs rather than real Main Street growth.</p><p>We speak about social \"capital\" and securitise everything from education to critical infrastructure to prison terms</p><p>It's a shift that has even affected our language, our civic life, and our way of relating to one another. We speak about human or social \"capital\" and securitise everything from education to critical infrastructure to prison terms, a mark of our burgeoning \"portfolio society\".</p><p>Although the American financial sector dwarfs any other by sheer size, the UK is in some ways even more financialised than America, given the City of London's outsized role in the national economy. It's perhaps no surprise then that much of the most cutting-edge thinking on the topic is being done by Britons such as Sir Paul Tucker, the former deputy governor of the Bank of England, the current Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane, and former FSA chair Lord (Adair) Turner. \"The trend varies slightly country by country but the broad direction is clear: across all advanced economies, and the US and the UK in particular, the role of the capital markets and the banking sector in funding new investment is decreasing. Most of the money in the system is being used for lending against existing assets,\" says Turner, whose recent book, Between Debt and the Devil, explains the phenomenon in detail.</p><p>In simple terms, what this means is that rather than funding the new ideas and projects that create jobs and raise wages, finance has shifted its attention to securitising existing assets (such as homes, stocks, bonds and such), turning them into tradeable products that can be spliced and diced and sold as many times as possible - that is, until things blow up, as they did in 2008. In the US, finance has doubled in size since the 1970s, and now makes up 7% of the economy and takes a quarter of all corporate profits, more than double what it did back then. Yet it creates only 4 % of all jobs. Similar numbers hold true in the UK.</p><p>How did this sector, which was once meant to merely facilitate business, manage to get such a stranglehold over it? Bankers themselves are often blamed but in truth the trend of financialisation was enabled by policymakers and the decisions they took from the 70s onwards, as postwar growth began to slow. In the US, interest rate deregulation under the Jimmy Carter administration, which was supported by a coalition of left and right political interests, led to the possibility of financial \"innovations\" such as the spliced and diced securities that blew up the world economy in 2008.</p><p>Reagan era shifts allowed banks and corporations alike to become larger and more financialised, and further Bill Clinton era deregulation threw kerosene on the fire. The legacy of her husband's laissez-faire economic policies is one reason Hillary Clinton isn't gaining more political traction. One of the most perverse effects of financialisation is that companies across all industries have come to emulate finance. It's no wonder - profit margins in finance tend to be much higher than in other industries, and the Copernican shift towards the markets has led us to revere the industry as the top of an economic hierarchy of services that we graduate to after passing through the lower phases of agrarian and manufacturing economies.</p><p>American corporations now get about five times as much of their revenue from financial activities such as offering credit to customers, tax \"optimisation,\" and trading, as they did in the 80s. Big tech companies underwrite corporate bond offerings the way banks do. Traditional hedging by energy and transport firms has been overtaken by profit-boosting speculation in oil futures, a shift that actually undermines their core business by creating more price volatility. The amount of trading done by these organisations now far exceeds the value of their own real-world investments, a sure sign of financialisation)</p><p>British firms are very much a part of this trend. The recent history of BP (British Petroleum) is a perfect example not only of the rise of financial activities as a percentage of business but also of the perverse effect that financialisation can have on corporate culture: a focus on trading can lead to excessive risk-taking, and an overemphasis on short-term profit can undermine a company's financial future. BP was, from the 90s, an extremely balance-sheet focused company, becoming one of the most aggressive corporate costcutters of the era. This ultimately led whistleblowers to accuse the company of skimping on maintenance and using outdated equipment, even as it encouraged traders in its burgeoning US office to take bigger risks in search of trading-desk profits.</p><p>The strategy exploded in 2005 and 2006 when BP suffered a number of back-to-back disasters, including a refinery explosion in Texas City, Texas, an oil spill at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, and accusations of manipulating energy markets via its US trading arm. In a move that echoed the manipulation of the California energy markets a few years earlier, Houston-based traders for BP US had used company resources to purchase a large quantity of propane gas, which they later sold to other market players for inflated prices, costing consumers $53m in overcharges. The company eventually had to pay back that amount, as well as a criminal penalty of $100m, and another $125m in civil charges to the CFTC (the Commodity Futures Trading Commission). The environmental disasters resulting from the explosion and Alaskan leaks cost tens of millions of dollars more in criminal and civil payments.</p><p>Since then, BP's Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 became the largest marine oil spill in the history of the world, costing the company more than $50bn in legal fees, penalties and cleanup charges. You would think that all of this would have caused a serious crisis of conscience within the company. Yet far from pulling back and focusing on the core business, BP has charged full steam ahead into trading, becoming one of the largest non-financial players in the field. The firm now obtains at least 20% of its income from dealing in swaps, futures, and other financial instruments, up from 10% in 2005, the last time it disclosed profitability figures for its trading division. So where do we go from here? How do we curb the 40-year trend of financialisation and its perverse effects on business and society? Some people, such as the British economic journalist Paul Mason, are relatively optimistic. His new book, Postcapitalism, argues that we are at a tipping point in the process of financialisation, which has allowed capitalism to grow, like a virus, beyond its useful life span. He thinks that the technology-driven \"sharing economy\" in which information is freer and capital is less important will empower workers to fight financial capitalists in a new and more powerful way.</p><p>I'm less optimistic. In my own reporting experience, I've found Silicon Valley titans at the heart of the technology revolution to be just as rapacious and arguably even more tribal than many financiers. Uber looks to outsource, downsize and liquidate formal employees as much as possible. Apple, once one of the most admired companies on earth, is now one of the most financialised - over the last few years, Apple has issued billions of debt and made commitments to issue nearly as much as it has sitting in overseas bank accounts (some $200bn) to avoid paying more US taxes, and used the money to do buybacks that artificially jack up the price of its sagging stock. I think that changes in our current dysfunctional economic paradigm won't just happen but will require several shifts, both practical and existential. There is plenty of low hanging fruit to be plucked in the form of tax code changes that would incentivise savings and investment rather than debt - which is the lifeblood of finance.</p><p>We should reform business education to focus more on industry rather than finance (amazingly, given what we have been through in the last eight years, \"efficient\" markets theory is still the core of most MBA curriculums). We should rethink for whom companies should be run - workers, consumers and civic society as well as shareholders (many top performing firms already have that mandate). And we should certainly reform the financial system itself, reducing leverage, increasing capital holdings, and ending the culture of \"experts\" in finance.</p><p>Indeed, we should open the conversation about how and for whom the financial system should work to a much broader group of people - far beyond the small priesthood of financiers, politicians, and regulators who tend to share the same finance-centric view of the economy. \"We need to stop treating banking as if it's a business unlike any other,\" says Stanford professor Anat Admati, whose book The Bankers' New Clothes, suggests a number of smart ways to reform and simplify the financial sector.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we need a new narrative about our financial system and its place in our economy and society. As the crisis of 2008 and its continuing aftermath have surely shown us, we are at the end of what financialisation can do for growth. We need a new model, one that will enrich the many rather than the few, in a more sustainable way. We need markets that are structured fairly, with the kind of equal access that Adam Smith described in The Wealth of Nations. We need a political economy that isn't captured by moneyed interests. And we need a financial sector that supports, rather than hinders, our economy.</p><p>Even if we don't understand the particulars of Wall Street, we all know at gut level that the current system isn't working. How could it be when 1% of the population takes most of the world's wealth, and a single industry that creates only 4% of jobs takes nearly 25% of US corporate profits? If we don't think hard about how to change things, the politics of the next four years may be far uglier than what we have seen so far.</p><p>                     Rana Foroohar is Time magazine's economic columnist, global economic analyst for CNN, and the author of Makers and Takers: The Rise of Finance and the Fall of American Business ( Crown Business )</p><p>How do we curb the 40-year trend of financialisation and its perverse effects on business and society?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBSRVR-41048567</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBSRVR2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JW3-HW61-JCJY-G2GJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2329\"/><timeReceived>11:35 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Guardian Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Observer (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>May 27, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Some clients already are gaming out a possible lame-duck session as well as a potentially revamped federal government in 2021.</p><p>\"The dynamics of the elections are likely, if not certain, to compel House Democrats to continue to act on legislation, like infrastructure,\" said lobbyist Stephanie Silverman of Venn Strategies.</p><p>Other hot issues this year may include discussions on cybersecurity and data privacy and trade matters, among others.</p><p>Loading...</p><p>Last year, Facebook, under pressure on the Hill and from the executive branch, spent more on federal lobbying, $16.7 million, than ever before -- more than 30 percent above 2018's $12.6 million. Ditto for Amazon, which increased its federal lobbying tab to $16.1 million in 2019, up from $14.2 million in 2018.</p><p>Major business lobbies, the Business Roundtable (whose members are corporate CEOs) and National Association of Manufacturers among them, reported big increases in federal lobbying expenditures in the last quarter of the year, fueled largely by trade matters including the renegotiated pact between the United States, Mexico, and Canada.</p><p>The roundtable disclosed spending $8.5 million, of its $20 million total, in just the fourth quarter. NAM, too, disclosed some $8.4 million on lobbying in October through December, more than it reported spending in the first three quarters of the year combined.</p><p>One outlier in the top spenders is the liberal organization Open Society Policy Center, which lobbies in its own right and also funds lobbying efforts by other groups. Open Society, which has ties to the liberal donor George Soros, disclosed spending more than $24 million on lobbying in the fourth quarter of 2019 on such issues as national defense, national security powers and appropriations.  </p><p>Groups representing hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical concerns also were among the biggest spenders in 2019, as lawmakers debated prescription drug pricing and surprise medical billing measures.</p><p>Trade policy and administration efforts to roll back environmental regulations were among some of the biggest issues, said lobbyist Rich Gold of Holland &amp; Knight. Those issues will continue to be front and center this year, he added.</p><p>The 2020 elections, and specifically the possible changes they may bring in 2021, already are fueling some business.</p><p>\"A lot of the business community is already doing active planning for some of the issues that would occur in a Democratic administration, like climate change and health care,\" said Gold, whose firm's lobbying revenue, as reported under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, was up slightly in 2019 to about $24.6 million. \"There are a lot of people that are spending money already on those activities.\"  </p><p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Realtors continued to outpace much of K Street but disclosed spending less in 2019 than in 2018. The chamber spent $76.1 million in 2019 and the realtors spent $41.1 million. A chamber spokeswoman declined comment. The Realtors' group spent last year lobbying for the elimination of the home loan cap for veterans' mortgages and the seven-year reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, among others.</p><p>\"In 2020 we are focused on working toward these and other policies that address housing affordability constraints plaguing markets across the country, secure needed infrastructure reforms and improve data privacy laws,\" said the group's president, Vince Malta, in a statement to CQ Roll Call.</p><p>Tech giant Google reported a 44 percent slide in its spending on federal lobbying, as it restructured its K Street operation, with $11.8 million in 2019, down from $21.2 million in 2018.</p><p>Still, big tech has supplanted the nation's largest defense and aviation contractors among the 10 largest spenders. Boeing Co. reported spending $13.8 million in 2019, a year of crisis for the company whose 737 Max jets remain grounded worldwide after high-profile crashes. Northrop Grumman disclosed spending $13.3 million, while Lockheed Martin reported shelling out $12.9 million on federal lobbying last year.</p><p>Source: CQ News<br/>Copyright 2020 Congressional Quarterly Inc.

Despite her release on bail, the arrest of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou has ratcheted up simmering tensions between China and the US in a global contest for technological supremacy between the leaders of competing and increasingly incompatible systems of governance. This quest for information dominance is a driver of global cyber conflict, a shadowy undeclared war that is intensifying and becoming a serious security concern for Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Control of three key enabling technologies - semiconductors, quantum computing and artificial intelligence - would give the pre-eminent cyber nation a decisive advantage in this high-stakes competition. Technological excellence has always underpinned economic and military capability and is a powerful catalyst for change in the international system. No longer is the internet dominated by the US and the West, as other states seek a more prominent role in shaping the rules of the digital age.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two other dimensions of the emerging tech wars have equally profound consequences. They are the growing tension between security and privacy in cyberspace, exemplified by the furious debate that accompanied the passage of encryption legislation, and protecting consumer and media rights from unethical practices by tech titans, recently highlighted by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission's warning about discriminatory conduct by Google and Facebook.</p><p>Few would dispute the need for security agencies to access the encrypted communications of suspected terrorists, criminals and paedophiles. But this is difficult to achieve in practice without undermining the same encryption systems that protect our personal data. It's unclear how technical assistance and technical capabilities notices can be made to work without technology companies having to modify their apps or systems to allow government agencies access to encrypted private data.</p><p>Finding the right regulatory balance in the coming crackdown on digital platforms won't be easy either. Corporations such as Google have resisted regulation, arguing they are technology, not media, companies and that protecting the security of their users \"has long been an essential part of our mission\" - claims disputed by their critics. Regulating the activities of Chinese digital giants Alibaba and Tencent is an even more challenging problem because of China's techno-nationalism.</p><p>These disagreements are unlikely to be resolved quickly because they are central to a more fundamental contest of ideas and beliefs about the rules and architecture of the information highway. This pits democrats against autocrats, big tech against government, big tech against consumers, and sometimes governments against their own people. It encompasses just about every aspect of modern life, from banking and health to industry, business, recreation and national security.</p><p>The internet was conceived in hope and optimism that it would create a better world. Established and championed by the US, the early internet was based on the principles of openness and self-regulation. That openness is being lost as authoritarian states impede or block the free flow of information in their own countries while exploiting the system's openness to weaken democracies. A report last year by Freedom House found that internet freedom had declined for seven consecutive years, largely because of restrictive practices by China, Russia and Middle Eastern autocracies. Their tools include outright censorship, proscribing virtual private networks and banning the use of encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram and WhatsApp.</p><p>For democracies, this raises the troubling question of what an internet dominated by China may look like as Beijing pulls out all stops to shape fifth-generation mobile network technology and its associated rules and architecture. Turbocharged by artificial intelligence, 5G promises to be transformational. The technology will incorporate the emerging internet of things, where machines can talk to one another, and will be critical to the development of smart utility grids, autonomous robots, drones and electric vehicles.</p><p>Countries that provide the technology and set global standards will reap enormous rewards in royalties, fees and innovation, giving them pole position in the race to develop the cyber-physical systems of the fourth industrial revolution.</p><p>In an insightful analysis for the US journal Foreign Affairs, Adam Segal argues that the US has ceded leadership in cyberspace to China. President Xi Jinping has set his country on the path to cyber dominance by integrating domestic regulations, tech-nological innovation and foreign policy. His aim is to build an \"impregnable\" cyber defence system, foster more world-class companies, lead the world in advanced technologies and give China a bigger voice in -internet governance. If this happens, says Segal, \"the internet will be less global and less open\". Xi promotes the virtues of cyber sovereignty as the primary organising principle of internet governance in direct opposition to US support for an open internet. Segal says the Xi era will be remembered for \"putting an end to the West's naive optimism about the liberalising potential of the internet\".</p><p>He may be right. Xi has moved resolutely to cocoon his people inside the \"great firewall of China\" and is busily constructing a comprehensive surveillance system that would be impossible in a democracy because of privacy provisions and human rights constraints. As a rule setter and key technology provider, Beijing would be well placed to bar un-approved content domestically while holding the master keys to foreign secrets and personal data.</p><p>China sees Huawei as the embodiment of its aspirations for technological leadership. But other countries see it as a stalking horse for the Chinese state.</p><p>The liberalising potential of the internet is also threatened by companies that have become the standard bearers of the information revolution and the darlings of tech-savvy millennials. Alphabet (Google's parent company), Amazon, Apple and Facebook have all been tarnished by revelations that they collected personal data without the knowledge of customers and sold it for commercial gain.</p><p>In arguing the Australian government's case for encryption legislation, national cyber security adviser Alastair MacGibbon effectively accused his big-tech critics of hypocrisy. He says smart home devices such as Google's Home and Amazon's Echo are \"always on, always listening, and unregulated international tech companies are hoovering up our personal data as they have done for years and will target advertising at us\". We \"are already their product\".</p><p>The threat to security is that tech giants have allowed their platforms and messaging apps to be manipulated by bad actors. Russia interfered in the 2016 US presidential election by creating an array of Twitter accounts of ostensible Trump supporters and went on a Facebook ad-buying spree. Islamic State pioneered online recruitment and propaganda outreach using YouTube, Telegram and WhatsApp. The digital platforms we use for news, information, shopping, social contact and entertainment also are being used to weaponise cyberspace.</p><p>To be fair, tech companies have begun to address these problems; Twitter deleted 70 million suspicious accounts between May and June. But they are still dragging their heels on transparency because their competitive edge derives from the personal databases they have compiled across many years, much of it without the knowledge or consent of users. Internal emails obtained by British parliamentarians show Facebook sought to collect the texts and calls of millions of users secretly, fearing that gathering the data openly would attract criticism.</p><p>American cryptographer and privacy specialist Bruce Schneier has a grim view of where all this is taking us. Technology \"is being used to control what we see, what we can do and, ultimately, what we say. It makes us less safe. It makes us less free.\" Others are more optimistic, but users are beginning to lose trust in an -internet that once seemed synonymous with freedom of expression, engagement and the search for unalloyed knowledge. Big tech and dictatorships are both complicit. In fact the internet can im-poverish as well as enrich lives. As digital policy expert Karen Kornbluh observes, a technology that \"promised to give power to the powerless has ended up hurting the very people it was supposed to help\".</p><p>In democracies the idealistic vis-ion of a free and open internet is giving way to acceptance that some regulation is necessary to protect human rights and personal data. The internet cannot fix itself as free marketers like to argue. \"There must be intervention on behalf of openness,\" says Kornbluh. But finding the right balance is difficult because of the rapidity of technological change, marked differences in attitudes to the use of encryption, and confusion over what constitutes personal data.</p><p>These problems are compounded by the lack of international agreement about the rules, standards and norms that will govern cyberspace and the possibility that the world could split into two separate information worlds, one led by the US and the other by China, if no consensus emerges, which seems likely.</p><p>Even on fundamental concepts such as the definition of cyberspace there are serious divisions. The US regards the domain as the technology (hardware, software) that enables free access. China and Russia define it as the content and interactions (speech, expression) between users, reflecting their determination to shield their netizens from information regarded as subversive, corrupting or inimical to national security.</p><p>Many countries are incorporating cyber tools into their military arsenals and strategies without clear rules governing their use or a full understanding of the consequences. Science commentator Anjana Ahuja characterises cyber conflict as \"a virtual free-for-all\" because there are no set rules. This free-for-all could become even more anarchical once AI becomes embedded in cyber weapons, cutting humans out of the decision-making loop and raising the possibility that machines could tip nations into a conflict that escalates into military confrontation.</p><p>The US military successfully has conducted field trials of micro drones that can attack their targets in autonomous swarms without the need for direct human control. Even the most carefully designed, modern weapons systems are vulnerable to hacking and sabotage. In October, the Pentagon tested computerised weapons systems by submitting them to hacking tests and found that many could be infiltrated and even taken over within hours. Some operators became aware their weapons had been compromised only when a screen pop-up instructed them to insert coins if they wished to continue.</p><p>In his book The Perfect Weapon: War, Sabotage, and Fear in the Cyber Age, veteran New York Times correspondent David E. Sanger concludes that \"no modern military can live without cyber capabilities just as no nation could imagine, after 1918, living without airpower\". Cyber weapons empower states to fight war by other means. And they are particularly suited to the grey zone between peace and war where much modern conflict plays out, because they are scalable, deniable and relatively cheap to develop.</p><p>Militaries are building up their offensive cyber capabilities at a rapid rate and testing them on adversaries in potentially dangerous ways. The best estimates are that there have been upward of 200 known state-on-state attacks during the past decade, including many that have targeted company secrets and critical infrastructure such as electricity grids, nuclear facilities and industrial operating systems. Civilians may be collateral damage or deliberately targeted, as they were when large numbers of Estonians were forced offline by patriotic Russian hackers in 2007.</p><p>There is no hard evidence that civilians have died from a cyber attack, but former US defence policymakers Michele Flournoy and Michael Sulmeyer contend this may change as our societies become increasingly wired. Cars are connecting to Wi-Fi and the internet of things is becoming more pervasive. The internet of bodies is next in line, with more medical devices being implanted and networked. These devices all risk becoming targets. US vice-president Dick Cheney had his heart defibrillator modified in 2007 so it couldn't be hacked by terrorists. Surgical robots were first hacked in 2015.</p><p>Without an international covenant and with AI on the threshold of automating computer weapons, chances are the next hot war will begin in cyberspace. A digital \"Pearl Harbor\" strike on a country's infrastructure is unlikely. The threat is \"more corrosive than explosive\", say Flournoy and Sulmeyer, but no less serious because cyber war is undermining the foundation of the internet: trust.</p><p>Restoring trust won't be possible without internationally agreed cyberspace rules. The challenges are formidable and many. China and Russia are reluctant to have their activities curtailed by international law, especially the laws of armed conflict. Smaller nations see cyberspace as an equalising and empowering domain where they can offset the inherent advantages enjoyed by more powerful countries. Big corporations and technology leaders don't want to cede their advantage. Terrorists and criminals thrive on anarchy and will exploit or ignore whatever rules are put in place.</p><p>To protect all states from cyber attack, reverse the steady erosion of privacy and prevent the misuse of data, enforceable norms and rules are essential, underpinned by two guiding principles: accountability and a light regulatory touch that preserves openness.</p><p>Australia should lend its diplomatic support to international efforts to outlaw cyber attacks aimed at sabotaging critical infrastructure and interfering in elections. Alliances should be broadened to include protection against digital attack. And consideration should be given to crafting mutual cyber defence pacts with other democracies in which members agree to assist each other in the event of a serious attack.</p><p>Domestically, the government should welcome and support a recommendation from the ACCC to establish a regulatory authority with the power of investigation to monitor the activities of tech companies. It also should explore laws that go beyond the recent encryption legislation to emulate the best aspects of Europe's General Data Protection Regulation. Although far from perfect, the GDPR is the first serious attempt to legislate a set of laws that pushes back against the steady erosion of privacy by powerful technology firms.</p><p>Our thinking must change, too. We live in a cyber realm that affects almost everything we do, touch and see. Soon it will be an inseparable physical part of us as the internet of the body becomes a wider reality. The approach of most governments has been grounded in the siloed, analog world of the 20th century and not the interconnected digital world of the present. Our laws, norms and governance arrangements need to be linked across portfolios.</p><p>And there must be a judicious balance between the legitimate needs of government, big tech and the fundamental right of individuals to protect their private data.Alan Dupont is chief executive of political and strategic risk consultancy the Cognoscenti Group and a non-resident fellow at the Lowy Institute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-7427f09efe5f11e89d9f6fee72665498ef022d50ae10aa6f2fcb775a7b7538a5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYN-5M91-F0JP-W1HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2584\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 15, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Averting a trade war.  The Wall Street Journal is reporting  that the White House and China have held behind-the-scenes negotiations in  an effort to ease rising tensions following the administration's move to  impose strict tariffs.  Futures are jumping on the story.  Take a look.   Dow Industrials up almost 300 points.

Not just here in America but around the world. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The news coming after a rough week for stocks.  The Dow closed  down yet again on Friday, capping a week which saw all three major indices  down about six percent.  In Europe this morning we're seeing gains across  the board even if just fractional.  FT-100, CAC quarante up a half of a  percent.  DAX Index up two-thirds of a percent.  And in Asia overnight,  stocks were mostly higher with the exception of China.  All the majors up  almost one percent.  Supporting history, new Fox polls say that the  majority of Americans are in favor of President Trump's plans to meet with  North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.  Netflix banned, the big blow to the  streaming service as it is told it cannot compete at the Cannes Film  Festival.  And another celebrity disappears from Snapchat.  The details as  model Chrissy Teigen becomes the latest to ditch the app.  Then Sister Jean  meets the Wolverines and number ones square off.  More on their road to the  final four coming up.</p><p>Plus, shifting gears, one student driver hits the gas straight into the  driving school.  Oh, we are breaking down that accident coming up this  morning.  Nobody was hurt.  Wow.  All those stories coming up this Monday  morning and joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen  McDowell, PwC Partner, Mitch Roschelle, and pollster and the President of  Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter is here.  Great to see you.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  That was a bad driving  test.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Full disclosure, not a  member of my family.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARTER:  Can you imagine that poor kid?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It's usually some old person  darting for the handicapped space in front of the golden corral.   (INAUDIBLE) it happens all the time.  My father saw a woman jump the  railroad tracks in her truck in a car once, an elderly woman, Mrs. (Niece),  may she rest in piece, jumped the railroad tracks right in the middle of  Brookneal, hitting the gas, rather than the brakes.  It was something from  a Steve McQueen movie.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, that's crazy.  We got a lot on top this morning.  Joining  the conversation, former U .S. Ambassador to China and former Commerce  Secretary Gary Locke is joining us momentarily.  The host of \"VARNEY &amp;  VARNEY\", Stuart Varney weighs in as well.  And then award-winning record  producer, Harvey Mason Jr. is here.  Wait until you see some of the shows  and music he has produced.  Big interview coming up.  And we kick it off  right here with this hour.  And a look at Futures, markets on a scare right  now, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that Washington and Beijing have  begun negotiations on improving U.S. access to Chinese market.  Adam  Shapiro has live at the White House right now with the details.  Adam, good  morning to you.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  And we know that whether the things the Trump administration wants  the Chinese to do is buy more semiconductors.  As well as the President  last week he said he wants reciprocal trades in which the tariffs against  U.S. autos exports which is 25 percent in China get dropped down to -- he  says the two percent it's about 2-1/2 percent when we import automobiles  from China into the United States.  But the President this morning also has  a bit of a victory because it's been announced that the United States in  its negotiations with South Korea have concluded and there are changes to  the trade agreement with South Korea.  So the President this morning has  tweeted \"The economy is looking really good, it has been many years that we  have -- that we have seen these kind of numbers.  The underlying strength  of companies has perhaps never been better.\"  And Steven Mnuchin, the  Treasury Secretary was on Fox News Sunday yesterday in which he talked  about the discussions with China and what the administration is trying to  you achieve.  Here is what he said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY:  We're working on  a pathway to see if we can reach an agreement as to what fair trade is for  them to open up their markets, reduce their tariffs, stop forced technology  transfer.  These are all the things we want to do.  But in a negotiation,  have you to be prepared to take action and that's President Trump is doing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAPIRO:  The administration not afraid of a trade war, nor are the Chinese  for that matter but as you pointed out, Maria, the markets are seeming to  be calmer and liking the fact that both sides are talking.  Real quick on  the South Korea deal, it will allow U.S. auto manufacturers to double the  number of cars they export to South Korea.  It will also make permanent,  the exemption for South Korea from the current steel tariff.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Adam, thank you.  Adam  Shapiro.  Joining me right now to talk more about it is former U.S.  ambassador to China, former Commerce Secretary, former governor of  Washington State, now senior advisor and consultant at Davis Wright  trimming, Gary Locke is with us right now.  Good to see you, sir.  Thanks  so much for joining us.  </p><p>GARY LOCKE, ADVISOR AND CONSULTANT, DAVIS WRIGHT TREMAINE:  Good to see  you, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think this is about?  How do you think the U.S. can  make a dent in that $375 billion deficit with the Chinese?  What would you  like to see?</p><p>LOCKE:  We certainly have legitimate concerns about China's trade  practices.  China requires technology transfer.  In many cases, so many  parts of the Chinese economy are off limits to foreign and U.S. investment  whereas there are virtually no impediments to Chinese investment here in  America.  So that's an unlevel playing field.  And when American companies  do invest in China oftentimes they have to have a local partner which means  transferring your knowledge, sharing your knowledge or intellectual  property or trade secrets with those partners which then ultimately  overtime will take it and run with it and hurt U.S. companies.  So there's  been for long an unlevel playing field against U.S. and foreign companies.   That's what we need to target.  I'm concerned that these tariffs, these  surcharges on Chinese goods coming into the United States will not help us  achieve that purpose of leveling the playing field.  Instead, it's just  going to raise the prices that American consumers pay, whether it's at  Target, Macy's, Costco, Home Depot, you name it.  And in many cases, mane  of these products that are coming from China, that's the only place where  you can get them.  I mean, no one in America makes microwave ovens anymore.   They're all coming from China.  Electronic goods, clothing, toys.  So,  ultimately it's just going to raise the price of -- that Americans face  which means less money in their pockets for buying a car, vacation, college  tuition.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I know.  I understand.  So then what is the answer, Gary?   I mean, you know, we know that China is trying to transfer technology from  the United States to China and they're doing it in the very industries that  are supposed to be the industries of tomorrow, like robotics, like A.I.,  biotech, all these very important leadership industries.  So, if it's not  tariffs, what other restrictions should be in place against China?  Because  I know like if you're a Ford motor, for example and you want to sell in  China to the 1.3 billion person population, the first thing you have to do  according to the Chinese government is give them all your technology.  You  have to basically say, OK, here's how we do the cars, here's how we have  inserted technology all over the cars and then maybe you can get a foothold  in China but you certainly won't get more than 49 percent of any joint  venture, even then.  </p><p>LOCKE:  Well, that's why I think that United States has to work with all of  our allies around the world and the E.U. and elsewhere that have been  subjected to these same unfair treatment and rules and regulations and  together we impose basically the same restrictions on China.  China very  much wants to invest and buy companies and partner with U.S. companies and  other foreign companies around the world.  We need to put restrictions on  their ability to invest and go abroad as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  How much of this is also about a national security  concern, Gary?  Because I think most people and certainly businesses in the  United States, big businesses who have tried to get a foothold in China,  they understand this.  They know that they haven't been given a fair shake.   They will only be allowed to own 49 percent of a joint venture.  They have  to give up all their technology secrets.  But in terms of national  security, the chairman of the House Intel Committee, Devin Nunes was with  me yesterday and he right now told me he's investigating Chinese practices  over intellectual property theft but he also says China's manipulation goes  beyond that to military and infrastructure.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NUNES:  The Chinese just opened up a base, a military base in Jaboti,  Jaboti is at the entrance of the Red Sea in the heart of the Middle East at  the -- at --in the Indian Ocean, a long way away from China.  We believe  that they are looking at investing in ports and infrastructure around the  globe, not just for military capabilities but also to control those  governments to have -- to have the ability to lobby and manipulate  governments.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a big deal, Ambassador.  </p><p>LOCKE:  It is.  And that's why you had so many members of the U.S. military  saying that the state department needs to invest more in terms of its soft  power, it's diplomatic outreach and programs all around the world so that  we build up the brand of America that we create allies and partners.  I  mean, China is really stepping into the vacuum created by the United  States.  And long ago we used to have programs to help people farm, to  bring water, clean water and hospitals and build bridges and roads.  We're  not doing that anymore.  Who is?  China.  And China's creating that  favorable political strategic climate all around the world to our  detriment.  Getting back to the issue of intellectual property and  technology, America really needs to put more money into supporting basic  R&amp;D in things like robotics and Artificial Intelligence.  China is throwing  billions of dollars at the world's premier foremost scientists and  researchers in this area, creating laboratories for them, paying for all  their staff.  They're enticing people from around the world to set up their  laboratories in China.  Where is America?  That's how we need to really  confront some of these technological challenges facing them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  These are -- these are big issues.  And by the way, the  President yesterday said that he wants to cut the trade imbalance by $100  billion.  Do you think he'll be able to do that?  Get it down to 275 versus  the current 375 billion?</p><p>LOCKE:  I don't know if he will or not.  I don't think that tariffs,  surcharges on taxes, imposed on Chinese goods coming into the United States  will do that because so much of what we're facing is as we said an unlevel  playing field for U.S. and foreign companies in China where they're limited  in what they can invest in, where they have to have a partner.  Raising the  prices of Chinese goods coming into the United States will slow down the  Chinese economy to a bit, not much, because so much of what we buy is only  made in China.  So, Americans are going to continue buying things from  China.  They're just going to pay more which means less money in their  pockets for other things.  So, we've got to stop this trade war.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want something done but you don't think the current tariff  story is the way to do it.  Let me get your take on North Korea because  then there's that as well.  The President made a surprise decision earlier  this month to accept an invitation to meet with North Korean leader, Kim  Jong-un in May.  Now a new Fox News poll finds a majority of voters approve  of that decision by a margin of 63 to 30 percent.  What are your thoughts  on this bilateral meeting and will China be involved?  </p><p>LOCKE:  Well, I think it's always good that we have talks as opposed to  confrontation and bluster and so we need to lower the temperature and get  the size sides talking.  And if the President is meeting with the North  Korean leader can help set the stage, start that process that's all well  and good.  But we need to be careful and we need to make sure that China is  involved because ultimately North Korea will not give up their nuclear  arsenal unless they have guarantees for their safety.  North Korea is  definitely afraid that the United States is somehow and North -- South  Korea and Japan will invade North Korea.  Topple the North Korean regime  which is why they have their nuclear arsenal, it's kind of their ace in the  hole, make sure that nobody crosses that border.  But if they do give up  their nukes, they're going to want to make sure that they have guarantees  for their security, that China and Russia will come to their rescue, will  defend them, will protect them.  That's why we need to be very, very  careful in our diplomacy and all of our negotiations with China and so many  other issues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So do you believe this is actually happening though, that  we are having these diplomatic talks?  I mean, the markets are rallying  today, Ambassador on the idea that China and the U.S. have been in talks  and they're going to make a change in terms of trade and some of these  issues.  Are you buying it?</p><p>LOCKE:  Well, I -- I'm not privy to those discussions or to the  intelligence.  Let's just hope that the talks are for real, that we're  starting and we're serious about it.  That both sides are serious.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Ambassador Gary Locke,  it's always a pleasure.  Thanks so much.  We appreciate it.</p><p>LOCKE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon, sir.  And we just showed the futures.   Let's show that again because we're at the highs of the morning right now  up better than 300 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average.  The NASDAQ  up better than 100 points.  We're talking about a gain of 1-1/3 percent on  the Dow and almost two percent on the NASDAQ at the start of trading in  about an hour.  Coming up.  Supermodel Chrissy Teigen ditching Snapchat.   The latest celebrity backlash for this social media company.  That's next.   And then a driver's exam coming to a crash and halt.  How a teenager  managed to slam into the local DMV during her test.  She didn't pass the  test.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Spotify issuing a revenue forecast ahead of next  week's initial public offering.  Cheryl Casone with the details now.   Cheryl?  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  More details for  Spotify.  They says that their -- they see a revenue growing by as much as  30 percent this year.  That works out to nearly $7 billion.  Although that  would be less than last year's 39 percent revenue increase for them.   Shares of Spotify set to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on  April 3rd.</p><p>OK.  Take a look at this historic touchdown.  This is the first direct  flight between Australia and the U.K.  .  It safely arrived at London's  Heathrow Airport overnight.  This is the Qantas flight that flew more than  9,000 miles in just over 17 hours.  There's a flight for you.  The plane  itself a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, had 200 passengers and 16 crew on-board.   By the way, the Dreamliner is twice as fuel efficient as the Boeing 747  Jumbo Jet which they've actually discontinued.</p><p>Chrissy Teigen the latest celebrity to dump Snapchat following the redesign  of the messaging app and a controversial ad about Rihanna and Chris Brown  that appeared to mock domestic violence.  Here's what she quoted, that's  what she said on Twitter.  I stopped using Snap, the update, the constant  complaints, the people not being able to find me plus the Rihanna poll, no  bueno.  Snapchat subsequently issued an apology but the stock tumbled  earlier this month after Rihanna criticized the ad Instagram.  Stocks to  watch today is certainly let's see if that has an effect, Snapchat shares  are higher in the premarket, up more --almost two percent as you can see  you on your screen.</p><p>And then here's a story for you that I'm sure parents are going to love.  A  Minnesota teenager crashed into the DMV office while she was taking her  driver's test.  Police say that she accidentally shifted into drive instead  of reverse and the adult tested that was with her had to be taken to the  hospital, just minor injuries.  The 17-year-old driver was not hurt either,  nor was anybody inside of the DMV.  No word , Maria, on when she's going to  take her test over.  If ever.  We'll see.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's scary.  </p><p>CASONE:  A parent's nightmare.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I would not take her to that location, that's for sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right in there.  Move.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Drive starts with a D, R stands for reverse.  It happens a lot.   Is it a Southern thing?  I don't know but I've actually seen this happened  where somebody drives right through the front of the convenient store by  accident.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Oh, god.</p><p>CARTER:  You've seen it happen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I've seen it happen.  Because people are --- it's a lot of  times it's elderly people like I said fighting for the handicap spot right  in front and they're like racing and they, you know, and rather than  hitting the brake, they push the accelerator down.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're going to love this next story coming up.  We're going to  take a break.  When we come back, Senator Claire McCaskill is calling out  Hillary Clinton for her comments attacking Trump voters.  What she said  coming up next.  And the final four, no one saw coming, we break down the  highlights from March madness.  Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  What a weekend in college basketball.  The final  four is set.  Jared Max has the details.  Jared?</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER:  Good morning, Maria.  Yesterday's game  between top-seed Kansas and number two Duke, the best of the tournament so  far.  11 ties, 18 lead changes, back and forth until overtime.  The Midwest  region final in Omaha tied at 72.  Final seconds regulation, Grayson Allen  a chance to win it for Duke, say good night, Graysee, no.  It doesn't get  the lucky bounce, so we go to overtime where it was time to say hello,  Newman.  Malik Newman of the Kansas Jayhawks delivered.  Newman, 32 points  of the game.  Newman scored all of Kansas' points in overtime.  Drained  five threes and all, Kansas in the final four for the first time in six  years.  85-81.  Second time in three years, Villanova going to the final  four, 2016 champions, scored their fourth straight win by double digits.   Wildcats beat Red Raiders of Texas Tech, 71-59 and a sense of a great  matchup in San Antonio next weekend.  Saturday night at the Alamodome.   First up, 6:09 Eastern, it will be the Cinderella Ramblers of Loyola- Chicago underdogs of five against Michigan.  And then 40 minutes after the  first game, top seeds Kansas and Villanova square off.  Nova, a five-point  favorite.  Loyola-Chicago has Sister Jean but Villanova has Father Rob.   Yes.  The priest is on the team bench who guard Dante DiVincenzo calls the  rock of the team.  Father Rob said he very much looks forward to meeting  Sister Jean.  Loyola Chicago's 98-year-old Chaplain and star of this  tournament, now she's been given her blessing for the school to market her.   Loyola Chicago's has reportedly approved in excess of 25 different Sister  Jean t-shirts for various companies like this one.</p><p>For the first time in 25 years, a NASCAR race was postponed by snow.  The  STP500 in Martinsville, Virginia had to get pushed back until today because  snowplows and emergency vehicles in the area were needed elsewhere, not at  the track.  So they will race today instead.  Two of the more colorful  figures in recent sports history have become a viral video tandem.  New  England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and Hall of Fame basketball star  Shaquille O'Neal, what happens when the two of these get involved?  Well,  Rob takes off his shirt and eventually Shaq would put off on his shoulders.   The video has gone viral receiving well over 1.5 million views.  How do you  get on somebody's shoulders if you're Gronk?  If you watch the final couple  minutes of an NBA game, you've seen it all, right?  Well, the league is now  offering fans the chance to spend 99 cents to stream just the fourth  quarter.  It's like buying the greatest hits album.  Oh, and speaking of  streaming live sports, did you hear baseball commissioner Rob Manfred told  Maria Bartiromo just 30 minutes ago?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's when you're at home.</p><p>ROB MANFRED, COMMISSIONER, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL:  Home.  And every one of  those breaks is an opportunity to tune away.  We pay a lot of attention to  what's going on in other sports.  We've been fortunate, however.  Our last  two World Series have been really successful in terms of our ratings.  And,  you know, during the summer in 25 of our markets on game days we're the  number one programming on television.  So we've been very fortunate.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  Major League Baseball season scheduled to get under way this  Thursday, all 30 teams scheduled to play.  Maria, I had an opportunity to  talk with the Commissioner Manfred before you did.  And I expressed to him  as a baseball fan, this pace of play deal as a baseball fan does not bother  me.  I like the slowness of it.  In fact, today's -- everything has to move  so quickly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MAX:  I'm even more enjoying the slowness of the game than ever before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it's a reaction to the streaming, right?  It's a reaction  to people watching at home on their phones, trying to make it quicker,  trying to get to a younger audience.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're an army of one.  You're an army of one.  I've got -- you  know, I've got some paint you can watch dry.  </p><p>MAX:  Listen, McDowell.  </p><p>CARTER:  I'm with Jared on this one.  It's an army of two.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  We're together.  It's two versus  --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nobody's watching it, it's like NASCAR's problem.  </p><p>MAX:  But it's a multitasking world, right?  We're doing a million things  at once.  So, I can have the game on and be doing whatever I want, even if  I want to watch paint dry and then I hear base hit up the middle and I go  and I look at the screen and then --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by -- and by the way, I'm a life-long ACC fan but man, it  feels so good to watch Duke lose.  </p><p>MAX:  Mich.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Michigan, since I went to that game against --</p><p>MAX:  Thirteen straight?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  That one 13 games and their good luck charm.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  My son keeps wearing the same thing over and over and over  again.  So, that man -- and we're going to go to the finals -- hopefully  he's not watching, we're going to get to the finals with Michigan.  </p><p>MAX:  You could score some good tickets for that, cheap, right?  Yes?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  Cheap tickets for the finals.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.  Jared, thank you.</p><p>MAX:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared Max.  Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines  24/7 or on radio, Sirius XM115.  Coming up.  Americans grade President  Trump on his handling on the economy.  We've got the latest Fox News polls  coming up.  And then Netflix reportedly getting the boost at a famous  French film festival.  Why the streaming company is no longer allowed to  compete there.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, March 26th.  Your  top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Easing fears of a trade  war this morning.  Futures are pointing to a big rally at the start of  trading, up better than 300 points after a new report from the Wall Street  Journal revealed that the U.S. and China have been holding behind the  scenes negotiations to solve trade concerns.  I spoke with Senator Lindsey  Graham about the concerns on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  The aluminum steel tariffs, I  think, were too broad.  The dumper is Canada, it's not Canada, it's not  Mexico, it's not Europe.  The idea that President Trump is going to hold  China accountable for dumping, for currency manipulation, intellectual  property theft, is long overdue.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The U.S. and China talks follow a brutal week for stocks on  Wall Street last week.  All three major indices were down about six  percent.  Global markets this morning look like this: European indices have  a firmer tone.  We are at the highs of the morning right here in Europe  right now.  FT-100 up 30 points; it's almost one-half of one percent.  CAC  Quarante, up 23, almost one-half of percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany  is up two-thirds of a percent, 72 points higher.  In Asia overnight, stocks  closed mostly higher with the exception of Shanghai in China.  </p><p>And Americans believe the economy is firing on all cylinders, thanks to  President Trump.  A new vote of confidence for the commander in chief  coming up.  </p><p>Democrats, turning up the heat on Hillary Clinton.  The former presidential  nominee is facing growing backlash from within her own party.  The tough  words from Democrat Senator Claire McCaskill coming up.  </p><p>Then, Netflix canned at Cannes.  Why the streaming giant was banned from  competing at the movie festival.  We'll tell you why.</p><p>And going beyond the music.  I'll talk to a producer from super stars like  Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears about his latest project, where the  thinks the industry goes next.</p><p>All that coming up this morning.  But first this, grading the president.  A  new Fox News poll shows that more than half of Americans think the  president is having a positive impact on the economy.  51 percent approve,  that's holding steady since January, it is up about four points from just  about this time last year.  Lee, your reaction to this?  We've seen a lot  of criticism about this administration's messaging.  Do you think this  tells a different story?  </p><p>CARTER:  I think it does.  I mean, there's a lot of criticism on the  messaging of the president, but I think that's because people are looking  at it in a very traditional way when this is a nontraditional president.  I  think the fact of the matter is that as erratic and difficult to follow as  the president's messaging is, the Democrat's messaging is that much worse.   And so, you're looking at it, you're saying OK, the president is getting  credit for the economy.  There's other things he's not getting credit for  and people are justifiably concerned, but when you have sound bites like  crumbs, you know, about tax reform, when you have sound bites about white  women are only voting the way they are because that's what their husbands  tell them to do, when you have comments like basketful full of deplorables,  who will get credit?  It's certainly not going to be the Democrats.  And  so, while the Democrats have an opportunity right now to really start  picking things up especially when you see some disapproval ratings out  there, they're not doing a good job doing it.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  My question to you, Lee, is can the democratic candidates  running in the mid-terms in a couple of months really sort of leverage the  -- what's going on here?  Because I'm looking at what happened in  Pennsylvania, it sort of went the opposite way.  You had a candidate who  sort of threw Nancy Pelosi under the bus and that was the entire campaign  strategy and it worked.  So, can Democrats want to sort of use that to  their favor, it could be sort of problematic for Republicans.  </p><p>CARTER:  It could be.  I mean, the bottom line is we're living in an anti- establishment world, whether you're on the right or the left.  People are  fed up with politics as usual.  So, the candidates are going to run on  something different, on something new, on the willingness to compromise, on  saying look, I might disagree with the president but I agree with him on  trade or whatever it is like they did in Pennsylvania.  You're going to  start seeing shifts in policy.  If the Democrats continue to run in many  places where they still are running against, you know, against the  president, against Trump supporters, I mean, really almost making fun of  them and being pejorative towards them, they're not going to win, there's  just not a chance.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But to point that out about the Pennsylvania election, that was  a Republican candidate, Saccone, that moved away from hammering Nancy  Pelosi.  So, it wasn't just the Democrats' strategy, it was Republican  strategy.  But he pivoted at the very end of the campaign toward the tariff  as if that was a good thing for those voters in Pennsylvania and it didn't  resonate, obviously.  </p><p>CARTER:  Well, he was a weak candidate to begin with.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just wanted to point that out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I think the Republicans knew that.  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes, absolutely.  When you see a candidate that keeps waffling on  message -- shifting directions -- you saw this with Ted Cruz, during the  presidential election.  When you see somebody continuously changing like  that, you know they're losing.  So, somebody need to stay on course, get in  touch with the voting population which you are representing, and keep, you  know, keep on going with the president or without.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  People are confident and happy about the economy right now but  what will they say about the spending?  I mean, conservatives were very  upset about the spending plan last week, but Lindsey Graham, Senator Graham  had some comments about this and here's what he said, and he said the  president -- listen up to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GRAHAM:  We're not in debt because of discretionary spending.  We're in  debt because Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security are just exploding in cost  at 2/3 of the federal budget is entitlement spending, plus interest on the  debt.  So, if you want to get out of debt, let's do entitlement reform.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're not going to get that this year, Dagen, you've been a  critic of this; you've been talking about this for a long time.  You're not  going to get any proposal on this this year in an election year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't think that you'll get it for a year -- I don't believe  that anybody in Congress and anybody in the White House, regardless of  party, will act on this until it's too late, until interest rates are at a  point that the interest that we're paying on our debt is swamping all other  spending, that it's putting constraints on the economy.  Again, it's less  than a decade that very interest payment is going to top what we spend on  our military every year.  You've got the hospital trust fund and Medicare  goes broke in 11 years where it's going to pay out, I say this all the  time, $0.88 on the dollar in benefits.  I don't think that anybody in  Washington is going to act until, quite frankly, it's too late.  </p><p>CARTER:  I mean, the issue about this is almost like the toothpaste is out  of the tube, because you're looking at it, the issue has become social  security, Medicare, Medicaid, all of these are human fundamental rights in  the opinion of most Americans.  So, how do you take away a right to health  care, a right to your money?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they don't call them entitlements.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Look, I paid in.  I paid in.  It's not an entitlement.  Well,  here's the newsflash, when you have a $60 trillion hole in Medicare and  Social Security, that means that people are taking out more than they ever  paid in.  That is a fact.  It is a fact, particularly with Medicare.  So,  you are now -- you didn't pay in what you're getting back in terms of  health care in your retirement.  So, I tell my parents that all the time.   I'm like, I'm paying for your health care.  Stop telling me that you pay  for it.  You've taken way more than you ever paid in.  </p><p>CARTER:  The bottom line, though, is voters are hearing this and it's so  hard for people to get their arms around.  It's a scary thing so people  avoid it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, they deny it.  They're in denial.  </p><p>CARTER:  Well, of course they do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's not so hard to take something back that was given to  you.</p><p>CARTER:  That's absolutely right.  So, the question is: what do we do about  it?  I mean, even if there's a think tank on the side that's giving us some  kind of pragmatic solution that people can get their arms around, that's  not happening.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE), you don't think it's going to happen for years?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that you literally will have a 10 percent interest on --  a 10 percent yield on the 10-year.  And then, all of a sudden, people are  like, wait a minute, our national debt is how our interest on the national  debt is how much every year?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Guys, we got to get to this because another Democrat is coming  out against Hillary Clinton and her recent comments about the 2016  election.  Remember what she said in India?  Missouri Senator, Claire  McCaskill, now says that the former presidential candidate needs to stop  being disrespectful to the Americans who elected President Trump because  Trump won her state.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), MISSOURI:  For those of us that are in states  that Trump won, we would appreciate if she would be more careful and show  respect to every American voter and not just the ones who voted for her.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, McCaskill has to say something.  She's running for re- election and she says she disagrees with the president on many things but  her entire agenda is not just about being against this president.  </p><p>CARTER:  Thank god.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  You've got to be for something.  You can't entirely be against  something.  </p><p>CARTER:  That's right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And what's happening right now is a massive blame game.  We've  been talking about the spending bill for a while.  The reality is, the  president's blaming Congress, the House is blaming the Senate, and the  blame game's not going to play well with voters.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Hillary Clinton is blaming everybody else for losing the  election.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  It's everybody else's fault.</p><p>CARTER:  Blame the policies, not the people.  This is a really, really  important lesson.  People look at things, it is not helping them to blame  the voters and the people who they say are ignorant or the people who  caused this mess.  You know, the issue is the policy, and that's what  people need to focus on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But this has come up to bite her.  I mean, you know, she said  in India anybody who voted for Trump did so because their husband told them  to do it, remember that comment? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, she has an open disdain for any woman who doesn't agree  with her.  It's not just Republican --</p><p>CARTER:  And it's not just Hillary Clinton.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's Nancy Pelosi.  You hear the same underlying rhetoric from  all of these women that if you -- you are nothing unless you agree with  them.  You don't have a mind of your own.  You can't think for yourself.  I  mean, says a woman who took up for her husband who was basically having an  affair in the White House in the oval office with a woman and she went out  on national T.V. and lied repeatedly for him.  I'm not some Tammy Wynett,  stand by your man, she said during the first campaign.  So, I just think  that women are sick of this individual talking down to them.  </p><p>CARTER:  Of course, they are now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the other thing is, I don't know what she was talking  about.  She said things like, well, you know how it is, you hate women, you  don't want women to get ahead, you hate Indian-Americans who are getting  ahead.  I'm like, what?  I have no idea what she's talking about.  </p><p>CARTER:  This is how bad it is.  I was speaking at a women's event.  And I  said, I'm going to say something shocking thing to all of you that you're  going to hear today, is that I am a conservative woman and I'm here  speaking at a woman's event and there was like a gasp in the audience.  And  then afterwards, they were like, how can you be a conservative and a woman,  and think for yourself?  I'm like, how has this gotten to the point where  people -- people actually believe that?  But you can't be -- it's true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.  That's crazy.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  It's an echo chamber.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is crazy.  All right.  So, the president is tweeting right  now, I want to get to it, and here's what he said just a moment ago: \"So  much fake news, never been more voluminous or more inaccurate.  But through  it all, our country is doing great.\"  Country is doing well, economically  speaking.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that we would like to see the market turn around after  that, it fell of last week.  But one thing I'll point out about women on  some of the other networks, I didn't realize that sneering was a job  requirement.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh yes, let's talk about that.  Are you talking about MSNBC?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm talking about MSNBC, because I didn't bring this up.  I'm  talking about Larry Kudlow, he said, you know, if god-willing or something  like that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She made fun of his face.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE), she made fun of his face, she did apologize.  But  I'll say one thing that struck me, for somebody who has openly talked about  his recovery and the process of that, basically looking toward a higher  power is a critical element of the recovery process, and your faith in  something higher than you and greater than you.  For you to sneer at that,  I'm sneering back because I find that utterly appalling.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, she apologized.  It didn't seem like an apology.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it's that kind of women, it's that -- I don't think that  women are helping women point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Coming up, the Trump administration is reportedly seeking  a trade solution with China following the threat of hefty tariffs on  imports.  Stuart Varney has something to say about that, he'll weigh in  next.  And then, Dropbox shares up in the premarket following the public  debut last week.  The IPO went well; how the data storage company sacks up  against other technology rivals next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stocks are on a tear this morning.  Take a look, Dow  Industrials expected to be up better than 300 points at the open, better  than 100 points on the DASDAQ.  Dropbox is also watching a strong day after  a good IPO performance on Friday.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the  New York Stock Exchange, watching all the action.  Nic, good morning.  </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.   Bring it on for the bulls this morning.  As you noted, 316 points for Dow  Futures, and Dropbox which was the large tech IPO late last week on Friday  which soared at the market open, did great on Friday.  It's looking higher  once again today with a number that was raised for their IPO, it was a  $21.00 IPO.  It traded over 30 bucks.  And you could see here, this  morning, $30.09.  The high was 31.60 on Friday.  We'll see if we can break  through that for the folks who are bullish on tech.  It was the largest IPO  certainly of the year and since Snap.  </p><p>I wanted to move onto Netflix, also looking to the upside this morning,  Maria.  Well, this one obviously it's been a winner this year, up 56  percent.  But here's the thing, Cannes says Netflix, you're out.  Last  year, they brought Netflix in with two films, but with that, they thought  that those films were going into the cinemas.  There were unions,  filmmakers, protesters, saying that the concept of Netflix streaming does  not correlate with everything else that goes on in Cannes.  And now, Cannes  basically saying that they're barred from entering the palm door which is  the -- which is the golden palm, that is the highest honor.  Netflix looks  like they're going to be out on this one.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic, thank you so much.  We'll be watching that big  rally at the open.  Futures indicating a gain of better than 300 points due  to easing fears about a trade war with China.  The Wall Street Journal is  reporting that the U.S. and Beijing are in talks to curb trade concerns on  both sides.  Joining us now to weigh in is host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\"  Stuart Varney.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  I  actually want to talk about Zuckerberg and Facebook if that's OK with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p>VARNEY:  I do agree with you that the two sides of the China trade dispute  talking to each other, quietly as the Wall Street Journal says, that's why  we're going to get a big rally at the open today.  But look at Facebook.   Now, that's a bit of a comeback, up a buck 80 at $1.61.  But it sure ain't  much when Facebook was all the way up into the high 180s at one stage a  couple weeks ago.  I think Zuckerberg is the problem.  He's not doing well.   He doesn't appear in public very well.  On television, it's just not  convincing, and those apologies that were published in newspapers over the  weekend were kind of not that much.  I don't think he'll do very well if  he's hold before Congress and I don't think he'll do very well if he's hold  before the British Parliament either.  And yet, Facebook is stuck with  Zuckerberg as its leader.  They're stuck with a leadership problem because  Zuckerberg, what, he controls 75 percent of the voting stock.  His board is  his board.  Nobody is going to raise an eyebrow to him.  I think Facebook  is stuck with Zuckerberg and I think that will hurt the stock in the long  run.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he's got voting control.  You know, investors need to  better understand when investing in companies that have no voting  independence at all when you -- when you have a voting in control situation  like you do at Facebook and other media companies, by the way.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, because there's no response on the part of leadership.  They  don't have to respond to the pressures bubbling up from underneath.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Stu, you're right, they're stuck with him.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's Zuckerberg.  Yes, I think so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stu, thank you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Sure thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will see you in a few minutes.  I know you'll have a lot  more on that.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. Eastern  right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart and his great team, next.   But first, coming up, the man behind the hits, award-winning record  producer Harvey Mason, Jr. will be joining us to talk about the  collaborations with the music industry's biggest stars and his latest  project, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was the song \"The Living Proof\" from the film \"The Help\"  just one of the many Golden Globe nominated pieces produced by or next  guest, Harvey Mason, Jr., he's a six-time Grammy winner, who is now taking  his talent to live T.V.  Great to see you, Harvey, thank you so much for  joining us.</p><p>HARVEY MASON, JR., RECORD PRODUCER:  Thank you.  It's good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we want to talk about so much because you're also serving  as music producer for NBC's \"Jesus Christ Superstar Live\" which airs  Sunday.  Let's take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In three days, I shall return.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This endeavor is unique.  It's a broadway show, it's a  concert, it's a television show, it's kind of the best of all of these  worlds.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is awesome.  I can't wait to see that one.  Tell us why,  what attracted you to that project?</p><p>MASON:  Well, the story, the music, the cast.  It's just this -- it's an  epic story and we've got an incredible cast.  The music is amazing.  Andrew  Lloyd Webber, iconic music, iconic story so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.  But does -- did the challenges change with live T.V.?</p><p>MASON:  Totally.  We've got over 30-piece band and orchestra, full strings,  and everybody is singing live.  Nothing is recorded, nothing is pre-done,  all the musicians are playing.  So, it's going to be exciting.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Have you worked with Lloyd Webber, has he been involved in this  production at all?</p><p>MASON:  He has.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And how has he contributed?  Because I know that having met him  before, he is so focused on the music and the musicians, like he is a  composer's composer.</p><p>MASON:  He is.  And it's amazing music.  So, he's handling it in very, very  great -- it's a great way that he approaches his music and he interacts  with the cast, and working with me, a lot of details, specifics, this  baseline, this vocal part.  But I mean, it's iconic music.  You can't go  the wrong way with it.  You have to address it very carefully.</p><p>CARTER:  Do you have one piece in the show that you're most excited about?</p><p>MASON:  Sara Bareilles and John Legend sing a couple things where they're  interacting on a couple numbers that are really special and both of them  have such great voices.  So, it's really hard to hard to pick one but those  two going back and forth is special.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I followed both of them on Instagram -- </p><p>MASON:  So, do I.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, there's an array of talent, right?  There's John Legend  is out, Alice Cooper.  So, what it's like working with such a wide-ranging  cast?</p><p>MASON:  It's great.  But that's what makes it so special is the variety and  different genres they all come from and the different skillsets they bring  to the table.  But I've been doing that my whole career and I've been  fortunate to work with some great, great people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I bet.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Do you think having contemporary performers performing  something that's I guess from the 70s, Jesus Christ Superstar, can sort of  bring some of that sort of classic broadway to a younger demographic?</p><p>MASON:  Yes.  And I think that's the goal with casting the right people,  you want people who can obviously carry the songs and really pull it off,  but you're using some great music along with these new talents to bring the  audiences together.  And that's what we're trying to do with the music, we  try and present it in a new and fresh way, but we're very respectful of the  way that it was originally conceived.  You don't want to offend the  original fans.  We want to reintroduce it to new --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you -- how do you carry the songs from Aretha Franklin?   I mean, you're also producing the upcoming Aretha Franklin biopic called  \"Respect\" starting Jennifer Hudson.  That's going to be hot.</p><p>MASON:  It is.  That's another amazing project.  Again, I'm very fortunate  I'm working on some great things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about Jennifer Hudson, how she -- how she's doing for,  you know --</p><p>MASON:  Well, that project is early on.  We haven't moved past the script  yet but we do have her excited about the project and we've been working  together for almost 11 years on different projects.  We did \"Dreamgirls\"  together, so I'm a huge Jennifer Hudson fan.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the idea of it gives me chills.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know, it's great.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thinking about just Aretha and her catalog and her voice and her  achievements and Jennifer, too.</p><p>MASON:  And it's a great story.  A lot of people don't know the story and  the depth of the things that went on with her, so it's going to be really  an empowering story.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I'll be there watching that one.  Harvey, great to see you.</p><p>MASON:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Best of luck with all of these projects.   Harvey Mason, Jr.  Stay with us.  More MORNINGS WITH MARIA, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show, everybody, thank you.

Good Monday morning everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Monday to you.  And it is Monday, March 26.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Averting a trade war -- \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning is reporting  that the White House and China have held behind the scenes negotiations in  an effort to ease rising tensions following the administration's move to  impose strict tariffs.</p><p>As a result markets are rallying.  Dow industrials expected to be up almost  300 points right at the start of trading this morning.  That's better than  1 percent.  Nasdaq up 1.5 percent right now, 97 points higher.  And the S&amp;P  is up 31; that's 1.25 percent.</p><p>The news comes after a rough week at the office last week.  Dow Industrials  down yet again Friday capping a week which saw all three major indices fall  roughly 6 percent.</p><p>In Europe this morning, slight gains across the board -- take a look.  The  FT 100 is up half a percent.  The CAC 40 up a third of a percent.  And the  DAX index up two thirds of 1 percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks were mostly higher with the exception of China.

Is it enough?  The very latest and the new  questions over the company's access to your data.</p><p>And then gaining ground, new Fox News poll show Republicans are tightening  the gap with Democrats.

Why he plans to build on the  company's flame thrower success.  </p><p>All those stories this morning coming up and joining me to talk all about  it -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; PWC partner Mitch Roschelle;  and pollster and the president of Maslansky and Partners Lee Carter.</p><p>Great to see everybody.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning -- every Monday.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNERS:  We've got a lot of news.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we do.  We see a market that's completely turning around  this morning.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And the market did a complete reversal from where it was  Thursday and Friday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  No, it's so interesting.  Last week initially we were talking  about the China tariffs.  We're saying I wonder if this is a negotiating  strategy, if he's going to throw this out and then China connects on the  cable and that's what we are seeing maybe it's happening.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And trying to maybe into the table the whole time but backdoor  negotiations.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll tell you -- after looking at this subject I have learned  so much about what China is doing.  It's not just about transferring  technology to China and acquiring some of the best and most important  sectors that we are or trying to acquire, the most important sectors like  robotics and AI that China is doing.</p><p>They are also trying hard to be number one in terms of military.  They're  acquiring infrastructure all across the world, owning that infrastructure  and then getting a spot on the sea level -- on the sea lane in different  parts of the world and setting up military bases there.</p><p>Very interesting.  That's what Devin Nunes from the intel committee told me  yesterday.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  But that's one of the reasons that the spending  bill in the runaway spending and the debt dovetails with what we're trying  to do with China because we lose some valuable ammunition the more that we  run up our national debt and the more that we basically are running $1  trillion budget deficits every year because then we have to lien on China  even more to continue to buy that debt.  And surely not sell what they  already own being the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why every time we hear a rumor that China's starting  to sell treasuries or buying lesser than what people expect -- you see  massive selloff in the stock market.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And quite -- my opinion, but if you wanted to really have your  allies lock arms with you to take on in China, it's not just the United  States intellectual property and abuse and its motives.  We need to lock  arms with our allies so then you don't throw on those steel and aluminum  tariffs and basically kind of shock those very allies ahead of wanting to  take a harder stance with China.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The 10 industries that they want to, by 2025 be the world  leader in -- </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  -- aerospace, next gen technology, robotics, agriculture, rail  advancements -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- shipping and bio-tech.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  These are things that we also want to be leaders in.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that list and I will focus on that list.  We're going to  talk about that list coming up this morning.</p><p>And joining the conversation Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew  Napolitano is here; Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred making  an appearance today, he will be in studio with us; former U.S. Ambassador  to China and former Commerce Secretary Gary Locke is with us as well.  A  lot to talk about with him.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off right now with this.  Markets -- futures are indicating  a big rally at the start of trading this morning.  Markets are on a tear as  \"The Journal\" is reporting that Washington and Beijing has begun  negotiations on improving U.S. access to Chinese markets.</p><p>This comes as House intel committee chairman Devin Nunes told me yesterday  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\", \"congressional investigators have been looking  into Chinese practices.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  They are stealing  our intellectual property.  So either it's through the internet or it's  through investing in educational systems here or think tanks.  They are  bringing people here.  I believe that they are still in Silicon Valley  blind.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is the chairman of the Republican Study  Committee and North Carolina Congressman Mark Walker.  Chairman Walker --  good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.  </p><p>REP. MARK WALKER (R-NC), REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE:  Thanks-- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Devin Nunes just said that his committee is investigating  this.  What should be investigated?  </p><p>WALKER:  Well, if you look, my first two years in Congress, it was an eye- opener for me serving on the homeland security, realizing how many times  per day, tens of thousands of times per day that China literally hacks  every industry that we have.  They are the biggest stealers of our  intellectual property and have been doing it for decades.</p><p>So the Trump body language and the movement to throw down some for warning  shots I think is very important and sends a very clear message.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you like what the President has done here then?  </p><p>WALKER:  I do.  Obviously we want to make sure that the tariffs ultimately  do not get to the place where there is an increase in consumer costs or  ultimately even jobs.  But I believe going after bad actors and  communicating very clearly what the Chinese have been doing, specifically  their leadership, I think is a very educational moment for Americans.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- it's Dagen McDowell -- though if China  retaliates, they've already started talking about tariffs on pork but then  what about hogs.  That would hammer the very people in your state.  And if  they do retaliate, they will go after those states in those places who  voted for President Trump.  </p><p>WALKER:  Absolutely.  There's no question.  And this will just impact  theirs, even has ties to the E.U. the F Corp located here in Greensboro,  very concerned, even things about Wrangler jeans -- a 25 percent hike  across Europe.</p><p>This -- ultimately we know that free trade is very important.  We have to  be careful here but sending a shot across the bow, I am glad to see that  these -- what we thought was very wide scope tariffs have been narrowing.   And we want to make sure that it doesn't unroll or disembark the good work  from regulatory relief and tax reform that we've seen already.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I mean do you think that $3 billion in tariffs that China  has promised last week -- was that just a gesture?  I mean obviously it's  not commensurate with $60 billion in tariffs that the U.S. is talking  about.  It's $3 billion.  </p><p>So is China just saying we are not rolling over, but we're also not going  to do anything to mess with this $375 billion surplus that we have?  </p><p>WALKER:  I think at this point, Maria, that is correct.  Maybe more a  gesture than anything else but ultimately, as most of your panelists would  know, we certainly don't want to let it devolve into a trade war.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>WALKER:  So one of the reasons that the spending bill is so important that  we make sure -- I think Dagen hit it out of the park just a few minutes  ago, breaking that down.  It's very important that we keep our fiscal house  in order as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, ok.  You said that.  That's what we were talking about  all morning but fiscal has an order $1.3 trillion spending bill, I don't  know.  It doesn't add up, sir.</p><p>You know, we've got brand new Fox News polls show this morning that  Republicans are narrowing the gap with Democrats ahead of the 2018 midterm  elections.  Democrats had have a five-point lead over the GOP but this  comes as Republican Pennsylvania Congressman Ryan Costello confirmed  yesterday that he will drop his bid for reelection and retire at the end of  his term.</p><p>So Chairman Walker -- are you worried that the Republicans are going to  lose the majority in the House and how does the spending bill play into  that?  </p><p>WALKER:  Well, I think that is secondary.  I think ultimately what we need  to be doing as members of Congress is fulfilling our promises and let the  chips fall where they may.  Do I believe that we have much to run off in  2017?  We do -- ANWR, regulatory relief, tax reform, pro-life legislation.   But if Republicans get to the mindset that we can spend like the Democrats  do and not doing anything from here to November, I think that would be  cataclysmic.</p><p>I think it's very important to continue to build on those promises.  The  Republican Study Committee is coming back with the great fervor pushing for  a balanced budget amendment.  We'll also develop our own Republican Study  Committee budget that's going to be much more in tune in balancing intense  come elected and very important we communicate.  Hopefully in 10 and 11 --  at the most 12 years, it's very important that we communicate these  principles to the American public -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WALKER:  -- if Republicans want to keep the majority.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we want to talk about this because we all have problems  with the spending bill -- sir.  I mean the economy will obviously be a big  issue in the midterms and the President is tweeting about this, this  morning. </p><p>Here's what the President said just a few minutes ago.  \"The economy is  looking really good.  It has been many years that we have seen these kinds  of numbers.  The underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been  better.\"</p><p>Do you agree with that?  And do you believe that if we keep running up all  of this deficit, that that is going to cut into the growth?  </p><p>WALKER:  I believe temporarily we are seeing some wonderful economic  recovery news.  However, if you look out just a few years, our mandatory  spending had gone from about a third of our budget to closing in to 75  percent, 76 percent of our budget.  We simply can't sustain that.</p><p>In this specific omnibus, it increased nondiscretionary spending -- or  discretionary spending 13 percent in one year.  As a fiscal conservative,  some people like to say a fiscal hawk.  Sometimes we feel like we're the  adults in the room trying to say or trying to put out some warning signs.   We are the only group that doesn't have a special interest that we are  advocating for.</p><p>Where Defense needs massive, they were out, stood in the empty silos in  Alaska where this previous administration depleted our military defense.   But at the same time we have to understand that unless we're willing to go  after this mandatory reforms, we will not leave the next generation very  much to work with.  </p><p>CARTER:  So Congressman -- you guys have the House, you have the Senate,  you have the White House.  And if you can't get this through now, when are  you going to get it through and how is it going to be different eight  months from now than it is right now.</p><p>Because it seems to me, that if you couldn't have gotten it done this time,  how are you going to get it done?  </p><p>WALKER:  That's a very fair question.  I remember sitting in the room with  the Majority Leader when Congressman Tom Graves came up with the idea  almost a year ago that we would get all 12 appropriations bills done  through the house for the first time in 13 years. </p><p>We have met that goal, sent it to the Senate.  The senate never took up a  single appropriation.  We then tried again in package 4 props bills,  budgetary bills and put into one particular piece of legislation.  They  still didn't take it up.</p><p>So there has been some talk.  Does the Senate eventually move to a 51  simple majority when it comes to any kind of budgeting idea or  appropriations?  I don't know the solution, but we're going to keep the  pressure, keep the press on, really exposing those who are putting a stop  in the progress.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And clearly there's some politicking going on with the pushback  on President Trump signing the spending bill on Friday because Secretary  Mnuchin of the Treasury Department was on with Chris Wallace yesterday.   And Chris Wallace had to remind him when he brought up the idea of a line- item veto, he wanted Congress to pass the rule for a line-item veto so the  President could go through and veto line items in the spending bill.</p><p>And Chris Wallace had to remind him well, that was ruled some years ago  unconstitutional.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There will be a constitutional amendment.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So again, you know, you can pass a constitutional amendment but  that requires a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate.  </p><p>WALKER:  It does -- Dagen.  But let's not just talk about the policy.   Let's talk about the process of getting a nearly 2,300 page bill on the  evening of the next day you're supposed to be voting for it.</p><p>We have eight full-time people, staffers on the Republican Study Committee.   Two stayed up all night, trying to get through the bill.  They weren't able  to complete.  I think it is preposterous to ask us to vote on something so  lengthy with the amount of pork and level that was in the specific piece of  legislation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But YOU did it.</p><p>WALKER:  No, I didn't.  I was one of 90 that voted against it.  And we're  going to continue to rule against it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, this is an important point that you bring up.  You  voted against it so you weren't one of those people who said all right,  look, I'm just going to throw in the towel here just to get the spending  for the military.</p><p>What are you supposed to do the next time?  The President said he's never  spending something like this -- he's never signing something like this  again.  </p><p>WALKER:  Well, this bill should've never reached the President's desk.  It  did not even have some of the specifics that he had asked for, for wall  funding.  I think we acquiesced a little bit too much.  I've got to give  the speaker a little bit of props here because I understood some of the  talks and some of the battles that he was facing trying to get at least  some of the things across the finish line.</p><p>But this bill is really not good.  You're talking about an increase of 13  percent in one year in discretionary funding.  That is ridiculous.</p><p>I believe it's very important that not just 90 of us but more and more  members of Congress have to draw the line somewhere when it comes to being  fiscally conscious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WALKER:  This is preposterous that we would increase this kind of debt.  We  are now matching levels -- think about this - -we are now matching levels  if not even more of a deficit than Obama's last three, maybe four years in  office.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>WALKER:  We promise to do better and I hope that -- I hope more members  will wake up to that cause.  </p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. Chairman -- thank you.  Thanks so much.  Mark Walker joining  us there.</p><p>WALKER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Dozens of people including children killed in a fire in a Russian mall.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right -- Maria.  </p><p>Reports say at least 64 people been killed, another 16 are still missing --  dozens of children are among the victims.  The blaze started on the upper  floor of the Winter Cherry Complex in Siberia while many of the victims  were at the movies.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation.</p><p>The shopping mall which opened in 2013 has a cinema, a petting zoo, a  children's center and a bowling alley.</p><p>Well, America's oldest gun maker is filing for bankruptcy protection.   Remington -- taking that step due to a heavy debt load, falling sales and  lawsuits following the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012.</p><p>Under the bankruptcy plan, control of Remington would shift to its  creditors which include Franklin Resources and JPMorgan Chase.  Much of the  company's debt will be erased and its filing also means that Surplus  Capital Management will no longer own Remington.</p><p>Elon Musk unveiling his plan to sell rocks that are carved out by his  tunneling venture.  Here is his tweet and how he announced it.  \"New boring  company merch\" -- which is merchandise\" -- \"coming soon.  Life-size Lego- like interlocking bricks made from tunneling rock that you can use to  create sculptures and buildings.  Rated for California seismic loads, so  super strong, but bored -- like an aircraft wing span so not heavy.\"</p><p>The boring company's main (INAUDIBLE) project is a network of tunnels under  the city of Los Angeles.  Of course, Maria, this is Elon Musk's big, you  know, dream to make these hyper loops so that we can get from city to city  a lot quicker.  That's the idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good stuff.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up -- Facebook is saying sorry again.  The reaction to the social  media company's new apology in print, following its breach of trust, next.</p><p>And then Uber selling its Southeast Asia business to a rival company -- we  break down that deal coming up.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Facebook's mea culpa -- CEO Mark Zuckerberg is apologizing for the  company's breach of trust in a full-page ad in six U.K. and three U.S.  newspapers following the scandal.  Facebook shares are looking like this,  this morning after a tough week last week where the company gave up more  then 10 percent of its value.  That stock is up fractionally right now.</p><p>Joining us right now is Gabelli multimedia trust portfolio manager Larry  Haverty who owns Facebook and many other companies.  </p><p>Do you think it's done enough -- Larry?  Good to see you.</p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, GABELLI MULTIMEDIA TRUST PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Yes, I think  basically, Maria, the crisis could have been addressed earlier by  Zuckerberg.  My big rant on the company, if you will, is that Zuckerberg is  the captain of the ship and he should have been at that all-hands meeting  that they had on Tuesday rather than sending a lawyer.</p><p>But after Wednesday, I think somebody got into his ear or there are a lot  of smart people at Facebook and since then in my opinion they've done all  the right things.  They've hit all the boxes including the advertisement,  which I think should've been earlier but in my opinion was very effective.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Larry -- looking more broadly at the tech sector and the fact  that the big run-up in the market, a lot of it was the big tech names in  terms of the S&amp;P.  How -- does this really impact the broader technology  sector, investors are going to start shying away a bit?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I don't really think so.  I look at the tech sector versus other  consumer equities.  And you look at the tech company like Google or  Facebook on current cash flow around 17 times and you look at a consumer  product company that has maybe a 1 percent growth rate and it's 12 times.</p><p>So tech is really very, very underpriced.  The only reason that tech would  I think have big problems is if you had a very significant increase in  interest rates and/or an acceleration in inflation and that would have to  be energy driven and I don't see any chance of that.  It's going to happen  any time soon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about an increase in regulation?  What if we have a whole  new rule book now for Facebook and all of these other companies that have  an incredible amount of data?  Does that cut into earnings and change the  reason to own these stocks?  </p><p>Haverty:  I think for sure it does and for sure we're going to see  something like that particularly in Europe and the U.K. where the new  regulations are really pretty stringent on what they can do.  And the U.K.  people are very, very conservative about this, at least as far as my  understanding is.</p><p>And you know, what you're looking at is a slowing in the rate of birth.   Say, if you thought Google was going to grow at 20 percent.  Maybe it's  growing at 18.  If you thought Facebook was growing at 30 percent.  May be  it's 25.  I don't really think it's any lower than that Maria, because you  have so much growth in, you know, -- I was just in Australia and New  Zealand last week and they are growing like weed over there.</p><p>I think with this it's unlikely that they are going to get into China.   That would be the big bonanza.  But there's a lot of growth in the world  and the thing about these companies is at the end of the day they don't  give you anything.  They are not giving you Colgate toothpaste; they're not  giving you soap.  Their cost to good sold is virtually nothing.  So if they  get any revenue, they can't spend the money really fast enough so it goes  to free clash flow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But with Facebook, we talked about regulation and the addict  calls.  And even if they choose, even if it's not through regulation, is  they choose to dial their business back -- that potentially reduces revenue  and profit.</p><p>However, you do have a rising tide to people basically getting rid of their  Facebook account.  And it might -- maybe it's temporary.  Maybe it's not  but which companies also benefit from this backlash like an Apple -- again,  you can use Apple messenger, you can use your iCloud e-mail because they  certainly are more principled and their primary source of revenue and  income is not selling people's data unbeknownst to them.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, I think one of the beneficiaries is maybe what we now call  old media.  And you look at one of the companies in the news, Unilever.   And Unilever is apparently very irritated at Facebook.  And of course,  Unilever is a British and a Dutch company and that goes in line with what I  was saying about the regulation over there.</p><p>Well, Unilever is not going to stop advertising so some of some of it is  probably going to filter down to the old guys.  But importantly, my  training as in economics; and in economics, you learn to talk and think  about the margin.</p><p>And what you're talking about is the margin, it's not the mass.  Could they  lose three, four, five percent of their subscribers?  Absolutely.  Do I  expect that they're going to lose that?  Absolutely I do.</p><p>Is it discounted in the market?  I think a lot of it is discounted because  Facebook already lost -- pick a number -- $60 billion, $70 billion in  market value.  That's not a casual number.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They could maintain their profit margin by laying people off.</p><p>HAVERTY:  You are talking about a 40 percent profit margin.  This isn't a  supermarket company with a 6 percent margin.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  What's their annual income, net income -- $50 billion?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I look at in on operating cash flows so it's $23 billion.   Google's around $32 billion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  It's their income number, not revenue --  that's incredible.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The numbers are really staggering -- yes, sir.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't think we'll look at those numbers and realize that  they're your personal information that they were basically not protecting  and handing off to other companies.  That's how they make that much.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And monetizing it -- right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>CARTER:  I'm curious though because it used to be that Facebook was like  the thing in town.  And now there's so many alternatives.  You've got  Snapshot, you've got Instagram.  There's all these other things that are  rising in popularity.  So if Facebook doesn't do the right thing, don't you  think they could go the way of Kodak and Blackberry?  And these other -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  Oh, no, no, no.</p><p>CARTER:  We don't.  Tell me why.  Tell me why.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Because basically these applications have really changed your  life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY:  No one in our business can get along without Google.  I mean I  can't tell you how many times -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there's a prize to be paid -- Larry.</p><p>HAVERTY:  of course there is, and that's -- you know, that's for the market  -- that's for the market to decide.  And the market sets its price, I  think, based upon interest rates and alternatives.  And if interest rates  stay anywhere near where they are and I think that is the best bet, the  price is not unreasonable.</p><p>You're paying -- For Google, 17 times cash flow.  That's a six percent  return.  Google is growing 20 percent.  You get 3 percent if you invest  with the government for 30 years; 6 percent from Google versus 3 percent  from the government, I'm going to go with Google.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's Facebook trading out right now?</p><p>HAVERTY:  Facebook right now is about 18 times -- running rate casual.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Amazon?</p><p>HAVERTY:  Amazon -- that's another story.  On operating cash flow it's  around 34.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.</p><p>HAVERTY:  But the reality is -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But next year's earning is the a hundred.  There's really  virtually no earnings and with what he's planning to do.  I can see that  there's going to be any earnings any time soon.</p><p>I have a lot of trouble with Amazon -- Maria.  I think it's going to sooner  or later run into the antitrust people.  I don't know when or why or how,  but I've been reading about Rockefeller.  Amazon to me looks an awful lot  like standard oil and Standard Doyle who got broken up into many, many  pieces.  So you think they're going to break it up.</p><p>HAVERTY:  I think they will break up Amazon web services and that other  Amazon businesses; and the other Amazon businesses then will not have any  cash flow to support them (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ways to watch Amazon try to buy Microsoft and then all of a  sudden Washington wakes up.  He said wait a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  No, I think they are on tour right now.  I think  they're on tour right now, you know, even without a big acquisition like  that.  But we will see.  That's a big statement you just made.  You think  Amazon Web services gets broken up.   </p><p>HAVERTY:  I think that it's the fuel for anti-social behavior.  The  parallels to standard oil are pretty strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right.  We're going to look at that.  Larry -- thank  you.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry Haverty joining us from Gabelli. </p><p>Coming up -- the House Judiciary committee has subpoenaed the Justice  Department for records tied to Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server.   Now the House intelligence committee is looking to raise the stakes.  What  Chairman Nunes has to say on the issue -- next.</p><p>And then Disney World says kids will eat for free.  How the company will  help you save at the happiest place on earth.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is Monday, March 26th, the stories right now 7:30 a.m. on  the east coast.  Easing fears of a trade war this morning, we've got a big  really underway right now.  Futures indicating big gains at the start of  trading after a new report from the Wall Street journal this morning,  reviles that the US and China have been holding behind the scenes  negotiations to solve trade concerns.</p><p>The talks follow a brutal week for stocks last.  All three major industries  down about six percent on the week as you can see right there, looking at  the global markets this morning, taking a queue from the US's rally.  Most  of the major industries in Europe are higher across the board.  The F2 100  up a half of a percent,(CAX) and Paris up a third of a percent, DAX index  in German up two thirds of a percent.</p><p>And overnight in Asia most agencies we're higher with the exception of  Shanghai Composite in China, Nikkei average in Japan up three quarters of  one percent.  Digging into the DOJ, the House Judiciary Committee  subpoenaed the Department Of Justice for all the documents regarding the  Clinton e-mail scandal and more, the very latest twist in this search for  answers coming up.  </p><p>And Uber puts South East Asia in the rearview mirror.  Why the ride sharing  giant is selling its entire business for that region.  Plus the happiest  meal on earth, how your kids can eat for free at Disney World this summer.   And then pack - back in the swing of things.  Get excited baseball fans  opening day is this Thursday.  I'm talking to MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred  about the big changes coming this season both on and off the field.  Yes it  is baseball season once again.</p><p>But first our top story this half hour investigating the investigators,  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte sent a subpoena to the  Department Of Justice last week as you know.  Demanding all the documents  related to the Clinton e-mail scandal.  The Subpoena also seeks access to  any files on alleged abuses to the foreign intelligence surveillance act,  the FISA Court.  I spoke about that with House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes  yesterday on Sunday morning Futures.  </p><p>DEVIN NUNES, HOUSE INTEL CHAIRMAN:  As we're still looking into FISA abuse  and other matters, we still  have a lot of witnesses to bring in from the  State Department and from the FBI and DOJ.  To try to get to the bottom of,  was there a conspiracy to go after the Trump Campaign?  Did people  purposely obstruct Congresses investigation? We still need to get those  answers that what we continue to look at.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He said if all of the documents requested are not on his desk  and Bob Goodlatte's by the time they get back from their Easter break which  is in two weeks.  He is going to call them in contempt of Congress.   Joining us right now is FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew  Napolitano, Judge good to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANAYLST:  Good Morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is the fall out of contempt of Congress?  What is the fall  out if the Department Of Justice doesn't turn over these documents?   Because we know they've been stonewalled for six months already.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well former Attorney General Eric Holder was personally held  in contempt of Congress and nothing happened.  They didn't prosecute it.   They didn't sue him.  It didn't affect his license to practice law.   Absolutely nothing happened.  So it depends upon how serious they want to  be.  They obviously were not serious with Eric Holder.</p><p>Now a couple of basics, you can't hold the FBI in contempt.  You can hold  the Custodian of Documents, who's refusing to surrender them in contempt.   You can hold the Director of the FBI, who's stonewalling the surrender,  same thing with the DOJ.  So we have a Republican Congress now trying to  examine what a Democratic DOJ, Department Of Justice did in the  investigation of Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Was there a conspiracy to exonerate her no matter what the evidence said?   And those documents and that information is now in the hands of a  Republican DOJ, which is resisting cooperating with a Republican congress.   Why would Republicans in the  Department Of Justice resist cooperating with  Republicans in the House of Representatives about how Democrats in the  Department Of Justice, follow me here, exonerated Mrs. Clinton? </p><p>Because there is an institutional attitude, if we don't defend our  predecessors, who will defend us when someone is examining why we're making  our decisions now? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's not a reason to blow off the law.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Absolutely.  My view is if you have that attitude you don't  belong in the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:   Because the government's job especially the Department Of  Justice is to find crimes, examine them, and prosecute them.  Not look the  other way.  So I don't know where this is going to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why so many people are calling for a second Special  Counsel, just as Lindsey Graham did yesterday, watch this.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LINDSEY GRAHAM, US SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLIA:  Well I want more  information.  I want to be able to prove that the FBI investigation of the  Clinton e-mail scandal was a sham.  That the lead investigator, the lead  FBI agent hated Trump, supportive of Clinton, they whitewashed the e-mail  scandal.  If you had done what she had done you'd probably be in jail now,  and to hold the FBI accountable for not doing their job correctly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I could not agree more.  I don't agree on calling for a  special counsel.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  But I agree on everything he just said.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't like special counsels.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  No I don't like special counsels for a couple of reasons.  One  they tend to go off course in order to justify their existence.  They've  invited our prosecuting manifest for events that occurred - financial  events as we all know that occurred long before Donald Trump was running.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And which have nothing to do with any collusion?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct, correct.  But second, think about this.  Bob Mueller  is the Special Council.  Who works for him?  13 lawyers from the Justice  Department, 2000 --excuse me two dozen, three dozen FBI agents.  So it's  basically the same people in a revolving door.  If you picked the most  perfect special council, if you let Lindsey Graham pick the person he  wanted to be Special Council.  Let Trey Gowdy when he leaves Congress  become Special Council.  </p><p>His prosecutors will come from the DOJ.  His investigators will come from  the FBI.  It's basically the same thing as if the DOJ investigated.  And  then you have this institutional reluctance about people that don't want to  investigate their predecessors.  I think it's a conundrum.  But I do  believe that we need to get to the truth.  The evidence of Mrs. Clinton's  guilt.  Forget about Republican or Democrat.  The evidence of her guilt was  overwhelming.   </p><p>Did they even present it to a Grand Jury?  No.  Did Senior and people in  the DOJ make an evaluation of it?  No.  Jim Comey the day after the Fourth  of July held a press conference that said I've decided that no rational  prosecutor, no reasonable prosecutor would take the case.  There for no  one's going to take the case.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And a statement that was drafted even before they  interview her.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  A statement that was authored in part or vetted  verbally by Peter Strzok, the conflicted FBI agent that we only know is  conflicted.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  One of the reasons --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way no notes.  No notes from that FBI interview.  No  notes from any meetings with Hillary Clinton.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There we're so many absurdities.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No notes.  Only notes on Donald Trump.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They permitted her former lawyer who was a - herself a target  of the investigation to be there and whisper in her ear to help her answer  their questions.

Saudi Arabia says that it has shot down seven ballistic  missiles fired by Yemen's Houthis milita.  Three missiles were aimed at the  Saudi capital of Riyadh.  Officials say the debris from the incoming  missiles killed one man in what was the first death in Riyadh during the  Saudi led three year war in Yemen.  </p><p>Well, Uber is getting our of Southeast Asia.

And those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl.  Thank you so much.  Coming up, Major League  Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred in the studio here.  I had him Opening  Day.  He'll weigh in on Thursday's big day, big changes coming on and off  the field.  That's next.  </p><p>(COMMERICAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  All right it is that time of the year.   America's favorite pastime back.  Thursday is Opening Day for baseball.   For the first time in 50 years every single MLB team will play on Opening  Day.  All 30 clubs.  It is also the earliest Opening Day in league history.   Kicking off with the Cubs versus the Marlins on Thursday.</p><p>Other must watch games include defending champs the Astros facing off  against the Rangers and the Yankees will take on the Blue Jays in Toronto.   Joining me right now and a first on Fox Business Interview MLB Commissioner  Rob Manfred.  Commissioner, it's great to see you.  </p><p>ROB MANFRED, MLB COMMISSIONER:  Great to see you, too, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  I got to tell you, I've seen  a lot and done a lot of stuff over my career.  The most exciting day of my  life was when I threw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium.  I mean, it's  incredible.  Baseball really is exciting and what do you think about this  Opening Day with all 30 clubs opening at once?</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, we're thrilled about the idea.  We think getting back to  the tradition of everybody playing on Opening Day is an exciting thing for  the sport. I think it give and opportunity to own Thursday, make opening  day into the national holiday that it should be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can the Astro's do a repeat?</p><p>MANFRED:  Hey, look.  The Astro's are really talented, but there are a lot  of good teams out there, a lot of buzz around the one team here in New  York, the Yankees.  Same thing with the Cubs.  The Dodgers were great last  year, so I think we're going to have a really competitive season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you've got a competitive season, but also because of all  of these new rule changes, right?  Let's talk about that.  Speeding up the  game is one of them.  You're testing new pace of play rules in the minor  leagues teams.  You'll start with a runner on second base if the game goes  into extra innings. Does this expand to the major leagues, and tell me  about the rule changes and the impact.</p><p>MANFRED:  Well the rule changes in the major leagues this year are really  speeding up inning breaks.  There's a clock.  Batters have to be ready to  go at 2:05.  That should save us about 25 seconds on every inning break,  which adds up to be a lot of time.  We're limiting mound visits, six per  game.  The idea there is to take dead time out of the game.  We're trying  to proceed slowly at the major league level.</p><p>We've been more aggressive in the minor leagues.  We have pitch clocks.   We've had them for a number of years.  We feel like they're successful.   Those could come to the major leagues.  The extra inning rule, I don't see  that at the major league level.  Some people really like it.  It does make  for excitement, but I think breaking the tradition of the extra inning game  at the big league level is not likely to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the whole idea of speeding up the game and pacing  differently, is that to make sure that it doesn't impact engagement, get  the engagement (inaudible) because we've watched what has happened at the  NFL.  The NFL has been seeing a drop in viewership over the last couple of  years.  Are you watching this?  What are doing in terms of game viewership  and is that part of it?</p><p>MANFRED:  Oh, it's a huge issue.  In the ballpark, pace of game is not a  big issue because during the breaks there's a lot going on, there's  entertainment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>MANFRED:  . there's things to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's when you're at home watching.</p><p>MANFRED:  Home, and every one of those breaks is an opportunity to tune  away.  We pay a lot of attention to what's going on in other sports.  We've  been fortunate, however.  Our last two World Series have been really  successful in terms of our ratings.  And during the summer in 25 markets on  game days, we're the number one programming on television, so we've been.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still?</p><p>MANFRED:  . very fortunate in that regard.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>MANFRED:  Yes, it's - look, in the summer time, people remember that  baseball is a national pastime and they tune into their local team.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.  So a lot of big moves there.  The  big Yankees move, obviously, the off season.  Tell me about that because  you've got the Yankees acquiring arguably the two best sluggers, right,  Judge and Stanton.  How were they able to pull off that trade?</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, it was, I think, one of those things where the Marlins felt  that, with their new ownership, they wanted to go down a slightly different  path.  The Yankees were there as willing buyers on what's a very large  contract, but it's exciting in New York.  The two players together last  year hit 111 home runs.  I think it's only four short of what Mantle and  Maris did in their historic season, so a lot of buzz around that team this  year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I'm glad you mentioned the Marlins because you've got the  former shortstop, Derek Jeter, now owning the Marlins or part of the  Marlins.  What does that do for the game?  Are former players becoming  office executives good for the sport?  What's the impact?</p><p>MANFRED:  Oh, I think it's great for the sport.  I'll tell you, it's  difficult at the beginning, you take over a team, you haven't been an owner  before, it's obviously difficult to get your footing, but I was down and  saw an Marlins spring training game recently, talked to a bunch of people  in the organization.  Derek's done a phenomenal job.  The organization is  very positive.  They've got a lot of great, young talent that they brought  back in these trades, and I have every, every expectation that Derek's  going to be really successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I would imagine when somebody who knows the games, knows  the tricks, just knows how to get around the field as an owner, it could be  real positive.</p><p>MANFRED:  Look, I think it's a huge positive to have former players,  particularly a player of Derek's stature, involved on the ownership side of  the game.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the new tax law because we were talking  about this earlier.  The new tax law seems to be throwing some of the  players and owners a curve ball, if you will.  It could make it so that  clubs face higher capital gains taxes for trading highly paid players.   This is something that I didn't think about initially when we were looking  at the tax plan, but how does this impact the teams and the players?</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, it could really be an impediment to trades taking place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>MANFRED:  . particularly trades that happened quickly because of the  requirement evaluation.  We think it was a mistake, that it really was not  intended to apply to trades of baseball players, and we're hopeful that  when things get clarified in the technical corrections that we'll deal with  that issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because it's not - I mean, you don't think of a trade of a  player being the same as capital gains trading stocks.</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, if you think about the economics of it, right, I'm trading  you something in return for something else.  There's a very good argument  that they should be treated of equal value, otherwise somebody's not acting  rationally, which I don't think is the case with most of our clubs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you been in touch with lawmakers on this issue?</p><p>MANFRED:  We have.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MANFRED:  We have.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they're looking at it.  They're aware that maybe there were  unintended consequences.</p><p>MANFRED:  Yes, there's a large list of things.  Obviously, we have a couple  of issues in the tax bill that we have been in touch with lawmakers about  and hope they get clarified.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rob, the league is working to finalize a two-game series  between the Yankees and the Red Sox at London's Olympic Stadium.  Let's  talk about that.  This would be the American baseball's first regular  season games in Europe.  Pretty exciting stuff.</p><p>MANFRED:  Very exciting for us.  We feel that Europe's a frontier that we  need to get to.  We want to get there with our very best.  We think a  Yankee-Red Sox series will be very exciting and give us a foothold in  Europe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the streaming deals?  This is an important piece of  business right now for the league.  You've got streaming deals with  Twitter, ESPN, Intel, YouTube, Facebook Watch also stepping up to the plate  with a deal with the league.  The exclusive stream, 25 games.  Tell us  about this.</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, being on the cutting edge of technology has been really  good for our business on the development of Bantech (ph), the sale of that  asset to Disney, and we feel that these streaming deals are really  important in terms of capturing the next generation of fans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have to because that's where a lot of people watch the  game, on their phone.</p><p>MANFRED:  Absolutely.  Look, the next generation wants to see their  favorite sport, and we hope it's baseball, on a variety of different  platforms, and our strategy has been to make the game available on those  platforms.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but you said it earlier, you see more people in the stands  that before, right?  Are you having a hard time getting people in their  seats because they're watching it on streaming?</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, it's amazing.  We had 114 million people went to see  baseball live last year, minor league and major league baseball.  That's a  phenomenal number for us.  Our ballpark experience is a little different  than our broadcast experience.  There's a certain commradery to it.   There's all the entertainment that goes on in the ballpark, and fortunately  our attendance has remained really stable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And lots of giveaways when you're in the field.</p><p>MANFRED:  That's right.  Those promotional nights are very popular with our  fans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rob, it's great to see you.  Thanks so much.</p><p>MANFRED:  It's great to see you, too, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good luck with opening day.  We will be watching.</p><p>MANFRED:  All right, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  MLB Commissioner, Rob Manfred, there.  We'll be right back.

What he's trying to bring about is a  fundamental reordering of the global trading system in a way which focuses  on free markets, fair trade, and reciprocal trade.  </p><p>It's really important to understand that everything the president does,  every morning that he goes to work is all centered around driving economic  growth and creating jobs, not just here in America, but all around the  world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Up comes after a week -- a rough week for stocks, meanwhile   Dow Industrials last week down 5 and two-thirds percent yet again on  Friday, capping a week which saw all three major indices fall.  As you see  there roughly six percent on the week.  In Europe this morning, take a  look, Futures indicating a big rally in the U.S. and the European markets  are also higher.  FT-100 up a quarter percent.  The Cot Con is up a third  of a percent and the DAX Index in Germany up two thirds of one percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, stocks were mixed mostly higher.

The movie that dethroned  Black Panther over the weekend. Ending its five-week winning streak.  All  those stories coming up this Monday morning.  And joining me to talk all  about it, Fox Business Networks, Dagen McDowell.  PWC Partner, Mitch  Roschelle.  And Pollster and the President of Maslasnky Partners, Lee  Carter is here.  Lee, Great to see you.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLASNKY + PARTNERS:  Great to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning everybody.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy Monday.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Happy Monday, Trump  supporters are angry about him signing that spending bill.  So, we're going  to spend the next week and the next year and the next almost three years  trying to explain why he signed it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lindsey Graham had a lot of good comments on this, this  weekend.  And let me tell you, he made a really important point which you  make over and over again.  We're not in debt because of domestic spending.   We are in debt because the entitlements and the growth of things like  Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.  So, until we get some real  feasible program or a proposal to actually rein this programs in, as if,  there's no sign that these changes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  People talk including the President about the importance of  increasing military spending.  But with -- in less than 10 years, I was e- mailing with Douglas Holtz Eakin about this on Friday.  In less than 10  years our interest on the existing national debt is going to top what we  spend every year on our defense and on our military.  That's shocking.   It's not getting better.  It's getting worse.  It's got to stop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why he say, he'll never sign one of these things  again.  Just like this, he did sign (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>CARTER:  Listen, I think that the American people when I'm out there  talking to them, they're going to be glad that he signed it, overall.   Because now they want deals to get done.  They don't want this to be kick  down the road.  And I think the President's coming out and saying something  really strong saying, I'm not going to sign it again.  So, you can start  negotiating on things now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That, will you sign something that funds plan parenthood that  doesn't cut it, that doesn't fully funds the border wall, that doesn't put  any strings on sanctuary cities in terms of the money.  There's a lot in  there to hate and people are angry.  </p><p>CARTER:  So, mark my words, people are going to blame Congress for this.   Not the President.  They're going to blame them for not getting something  better done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're probably right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And Peter Strzok some of the blame on Congress too, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He sure did.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, his -- certainly his supporters on Twitter has something  different to say about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, look, we got a big rally underway right now.  The markets  are reacting to something different and that is apparently behind-the- scenes negotiations between China and the U.S. on trade.  Check out this  market here at 300 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Up a 100  points on the NASDAQ.  Quite the different scenario that we saw last week.   Coming up during the conversation this morning North Carolina, Congressman  Mark Walker is with us.  The cofounder and CEO of Handy, Oisin Hanrahan, is  here and Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano along  with former U.S. Ambassador to China, Gary Locke will weigh in as well.   So, don't miss the moments.  We got a big three hours coming up.  </p><p>And we kick it off right here with this, the Trump administration  reportedly seeking a trade solution with China following the threat of  hefty tariffs on imports last week.  According to The Journal this morning,  the Trump administration is requesting a reduction of Chinese tariffs on  American vehicles.  Additional Chinese purchases of U.S. semi-conductors  and better access to China's mainland markets.  House Intelligence  Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham  both weighed in on China's actions on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" with me  yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:   Well, China is a big problem.  We actually are running an investigation on  many aspects of China at the House Intelligence Committee.  And I think,  most Americans know that China is in fact stealing our intellectual  property.  They're spreading globally.  They continue to manipulate  currencies, so, China has to be taken on.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  The aluminum steel tariffs, I  think, were too broad.  The dumper is China, it's not -- it's not Canada,  it's not Mexico, it's not Europe.  The idea that President Trump is going  to hold China accountable for dumping, for currency manipulation and  intellectual property pit is long overdue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and that's what people are agreeing with.  Futures  pointing to a big rally on Wall Street today over the concerns easing over  a potential trade war.  Joining us right now, to talk more about market as  the President and chief investment also for Portfolio Wealth Advisors, Lee  Munson.  Lee, good to see you.  </p><p>LEE MUNSON, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT, PORTFOLIO WEALTH ADVISORS:  You  too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on this market here?  Big rally this morning  that's for sure.</p><p>MUNSON:  I mean, I knew, the gig was up on Friday when we closed seven  points above those lows early in February.  So, I knew that we had a rally  here.  You now, I think, if you look at Century Aluminum, that's the tell  of this market right now.  You saw how they punched that stock last week  because everybody in Wall Street knows this this is all bark, no bite.  I  think, we're going to see a lot more talk about these tariffs, but I would  have investors avoid any trade that have to do with the tariff plaque.   Because I don't think it's going to be what people think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you still like socks here?</p><p>MUNSON:  I do.  I think, you commit money right here, I think, this is your  second chance to get the low of February.  I went in there, about the  Thursday or Friday after that flash crash of February 5th.  I did my buying  -- I'm done buying for the year unless I see this market go down to 2500 on  the S&amp;P.  I think, this is the your only second or third chance you're  going to have for the year.  I would commit money the big long with the  stocks, I keep it smaller and nothing that has to do with the tariff.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Is there any specific sector, Lee, that is more interesting for  you for the balance of the year, recognizing that we're going to have more  volatility this year than we'd have in the -- since the president was  elected?</p><p>MUNSON:  Right, well, I would probably want to focus a little bit more on  old economy stocks if I want to look at the smaller capitalization stocks.   I would not be looking at tech right now.  Hey, you know, this reminds me a  lot of .com with the Facebook and the Googles.  You now, people are talking  about standard commerce and standard social and standard search meaning,  Amazon, Google, Facebook those type of things.  It's just, I don't want to  -- you know, this reminds me buying Cisco at the peak back in 2000.  It  reminds me of buying (INAUDIBLE), it reminds me of those Yahoo's.  So, I  think, you've got to stay away from the tech sectors.  Because, really,  every time we had these tariff problems, small caps pop up and it's the  large caps that are punished because that's where all that hot money is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But do you expect -- I think, what's interesting about  particularly what happened in the market last week is how much the markets  seem to be driven by headlines at the Washington D.C. and the volatility  that those create and when you have different people saying different  things who work in the White House, it really has, you could -- because a  lot of times people talk about it and you don't see it show up in the stock  market.  How is this different?  And is this going to be a problem for the  rest of the year?</p><p>MUNSON:  Problem, this is like -- this is a gift from the Gods.  I never  had something so immaterial as what happens at the White House affecting  markets.  I mean, this is what's giving this volatility.  Remember last  year?  I can get Trump to say anything to move a market.  And now, anything  that comes out of there were getting mark of volatility.  So, I think, the  investors need to look at this as a gift that's bringing down prices for  you to commit capital.  I don't want to see a redo of last year, were,  where I'm going to put my money?  It's just goes up every day with no, you  know, just unrelenting.</p><p>CARTER:  You know, one of the things that I think that's so interesting is  the markets seem to react so much to the President on the downside.  We see  this lately and there's this the new hysteria, I think in some ways.  But  when it starts to correct, we're not seen as much, you know, as much as the  positive side of things.  So, right now we're looking at things getting  better.  Does that mean that people aren't concerned about what's happening  with China, that things are going to get better, that maybe that the Trump  move was a smart one?</p><p>MUNSON:  Well, I think people are starting to realize, again, Century  Aluminum was the tell last week that shows us that if you're -- if you  really think the tariffs are going to be a problem, why is that stock  selling off?  Look at those steel companies.  I think, everybody knows that  Trump wants to negotiate.  I mean, look who we hired to replace Gary, you  know, Kudlow.  I mean, that guy is like a peers supply sider.  So, I think,  that when people have to realize, newsflash market goes down.  The only  thing that makes that market go up is slow and steady progress on profits,  corporate earnings.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you're still positive on earnings?</p><p>MUNSON:  I do think, I don't agree earnings --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>MUNSON:  I don't think we're going to have earnings profit problems for the  rest of the year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Well we're expecting 18 percent growth.  So, you're  expecting that.  The Federal Reserve is unwinding its balance sheet $4.5  trillion.  We see that the Fed had started to raise interest rates.  Any  worries there?</p><p>MUNSON:  Not particularly.  Because I don't see an (INAUDIBLE), I mean we  still have long rates, you know, more or less above the short rate.  I  think, the market has already come in to the reality that we're going to  get fewer for rate cuts, but you know, when you read into the notes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rate hikes.</p><p>MUNSON:  Rate hikes, I'm sorry.  You know, hope springs eternal, right? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we're talking about John Williams, President of the San  Francisco Fed taking over the New York Fed.</p><p>MUNSON:  Total status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>MUNSON:  Yes, total status quo.  So, I think, if that guy takes over, we're  not going to see anything shocking.  And by the way, when you look through  the notes, you know, most of the people on the Fed government -- on the  board are looking out less cuts, less hikes than those the wonder rates. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right we'll leave it there.  Lee, great to see you.  </p><p>MUNSON:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Lee Munson, joining us.  Coming up, we'll  take a break.  And then, two police officers are recovering this morning  after shooting in Austin, Texas late last night.  The investigation  underway.  We will have the very latest.  Facebook fallout continues as Mark Zuckerberg continues his apology tour.   The company is denying disturbing new reports that it tracks calls and text  of millions of people for years without permission.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, a police officer shot and injured enough in  Austin, Texas.  Cheryl Casone with the story this morning, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria. One  Austin officer was shot in the arm by gunmen.  Another officer injured  while responding to a 911 call last night.  Police shot and killed the  suspect as he tried to flee that scene.  Authorities say the injured  officers are both in stable condition at the hospital this morning.  </p><p>Well, SoftBank has started an investigation to find out who is behind the  smear campaign against two of its top executives.  Also, general reports  the plot was intended to oust the executives and involves sending letters  to shareholders, leaking personal financial information to the media and  filing a complaint with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.  Company  says the campaign was based on false allegations and a board member has now  called at sabotage.  </p><p>Well, Ford and Alibaba launching a new way for consumers in China to buy or  testing a car.  You now can pick the model you want by using an app on your  smartphone and then you go to a vending machine for cars.  Customers can  choose from dozens of four vehicles, it was then called the Super Test- Drive Center that the (INAUDIBLE) created following a partnership announced  by Ford and Alibaba two years ago.  We actually did the story at that time. </p><p>And then, there is the -- Black Panther finally got unseated as the top  film at the Box office by this:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JOHN BOYEGA, ACTOR:  There are pilots we remember as legends, but they  didn't start out that way.  They started out like us.  This is our time to  make a difference.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Pacific Rim Uprising, raking in $28 million in its opening weekend  and in its sixth weekend.  Black Panther took the number two spot, now  number two 17 million abroad and over the weekend.  The Marvel movie has  brought in $630 million so far, making it the fifth highest grossing movie  ever and those are just the U.S. numbers.  It's over a billion worldwide.  </p><p>Now, the faith-based, I Can Only Imagine came in at number three.  Rounding  out the top five, the animated comedy Sherlock Gnomes and Tomb Raider,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  You got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A vending machine to buy a car.  Would you do it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I thought.  I don't think I would ever.  It gives  me no information.  I wanted information on safety, I wanted information on  quality. It's a vending machine we're talking about.</p><p>CARTER:  And you want to drive it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that, too.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  That's the weird show room, you just stick your credit card in  and a car drops out?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Machines and more machines, guys.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or although, I would prefer talking to a machine than the phone  representative from Sprint who I had to talk to over the weekend.  Who  literally -- and this is -- this was a call center that clearly was not in  the United States, but you can't have someone answering calls from  Americans if they literally don't speak English and don't even understand  the syntax of the answers they're reading from a -- from an answer log.  It  was disastrous.  I got a little survey from Sprint saying, would you refer  Sprint service to anyone based on your call?  Zero, never.  I got a zero.   And I'm canceling my -- I'm cancelling my account as soon as it is -- as  possible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was that bad.  They've been a basically -- long story short,  couldn't answer a basic question about why there is a suspicious charge on  my account.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, machines are not always reliable.  But that's why it's so  much -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  More reliable than the humans employed by Sprint. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take a break.  When we come back, what will Jeff  Sessions do?  Calls by GOP leaders are getting louder for the Attorney  General to appoint a second special counsel.  To prove abuses by the FBI  and the Department of Justice.  We're on that next.</p><p>And then, we are looking at a rally in Wall Street this morning.  Concerns  over a trade war with China are fading as the two countries have been  negotiating behind the scenes.  The Dow Industrials set to open up, almost  300 points.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRAHAM:  I want to be able to prove that the FBI investigation of the  Clinton email scandal was a sham.  That the lead investigator, the lead FBI  agent, hated Trump, supportive of Clinton.  They whitewashed the e-mail  scandal.  If you had done what she had done you'd probably be in jail now,  and to hold the FBI accountable for not doing their job correctly.  That  Comey, I think the fix was in.  And when it comes to the dossier that was  used by the Department of Justice to get a warrant against Carter Page, it  was prepared by paid informant of the Democratic Party, a foreign agent  with ties to Russia.  It is completely unverified, and it should never have  been used as the basis for a FISA warrant and I want a special counsel to  look at all of this like Mueller's looking at Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was South Carolina, Senator Lindsey Graham with me  yesterday.  Making his case for the second special counsel to probe that  bias at the top of the FBI.  Joining us now to weigh in, is the editor-in- chief of The Daily Caller, Christopher Bedford.  Christopher, good to see  you.  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think Jeff Sessions says here?  Now, I understand  that I was told this weekend that there will be more text coming out this  weekend and the next week and they could have to do with some meeting at  the White House.  Is that going to be -- </p><p>BEDFORD:  There's so much --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you know what I'm talking about, Christopher?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  I do.  There's so much primary evidence that we haven't seen.   We've been going off of reports on reports on dossiers, on congressional  memos.  We've barely been able to scratch the surface of this primary  evidence.  And Jeff Sessions is not going to be able to scratch the surface  of any evidence he has available using simply an I.G.  Because we've talked  about on the show before, and I.G. can only talk to people who are  currently employed.  Comey, plays a huge part in this.  McCabe who's now  gone plays a big part.  People like Steele who probably won't want to talk  anyways, played massive parts in this investigation and you need to have a  men about special investigator come on to go after any of these people. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you think this additional text that will be made public  shortly will be (INAUDIBLE) the straw that breaks the camel's back in terms  of Jeff Sessions saying, yes, we need that second special counsel.  What's  it going to take for Sessions to move on this?  We're hearing these calls  get louder.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Sessions is probably one of the most careful people in the Trump  administration.  He's very calculating, he's very serious and he doesn't  move when it's not proper.  He waits for his own FBI to recommend firing  McCabe before he does it.  And he takes his time before he puts up together  a special counsel, does it by the book.  Some people got annoyed and say  that takes too long.  I'm not sure what's in this text yet.  So, I don't  know if that's going to push him, but I assume he knows just like any  prosecutor knows that if he wants to get to the bottom of this he's going  to needs to bring it in and a special investigator probably be named in the  next few weeks.</p><p>CARTER:  Yes, one of the things that I'm really curious about is on the  left there's so many arguments right now that all of this is an effort to  undermine our government, undermine institutions that keep us safe.  And  yet there's this evidence and all of this leaks that are coming out that  are making us question it, how we overcome the fact people are saying,  look, we've got to stop this because they're undermining the CIA, the FBI,  all of the, you know, Justice Department and yet this is something that  needs to be done.</p><p>BEDFORD:  It's so funny to see the Democratic Party become the party of  defending the FBI.  I mean, remember though the controversy two years ago  when a democratic Congressman wanted to paint -- hang a painting of police  officers with pigs on their heads, pig heads, in the U.S. Capitol.  That  was where they were just a few years ago.  Now they're the defenders of the  FBI.  The FBI's got a lot of great people, a lot of strong agents.  But  there are people at the top of it which we've seen are corrupt.  People who  are lacking candor.  And if you've read McCabe's op-ed this weekend in The  Washington Post which he tries to blame his firing on Donald Trump.  And  talking about his long-deserved retirement at 49, which he knew he was  doing early because he was in so much trouble for lacking candor.  They're  trying to push this on Donald Trump and make it not about them and someone  needs to look at them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And yes he has this op-ed in the Washington Post and he writes  this, I did not knowingly mislead or lied to investigators.  At worst, I  was not clear in my responses, and because of what was going on around me  may well have been confused and distracted and for that I take full  responsibility.  But that is not a lack of candor.  And under no  circumstances could it ever serve as the basis for the very public and  extended humiliation of my family and me that the administration, and the  president personally, have engaged in over the past year.  So, what was  going on around him?  He was covering for Hillary Clinton and enforcing an  investigation in to Donald Trump which had no merit.  I mean, what was  going on around him?  He was directing everything.</p><p>BEDFORD:  He is allowed to defend himself just like General Flynn is  allowed to say you know, I was confused when he's accused of the exact same  lack of candor that McCabe is.  But what McCabe is not allowed to do is  pretend that he didn't play politics.  He got involved at the head of the  FBI, he made decisions that field agent for questioning and now the  Congressional investigators are questioning and separating investigations  on his wife taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from a top Democrat for  a state race.  Very sketchy things and as a friend of mine who's a former  agent said, look, bottom line is he play politics and he lost.  And now,  he's going have to deal with that.  And it wasn't Donald Trump like he  says, the President who fired him.  It was Attorney General Jeff Sessions  by the book guide acting on the advice of the FBI itself to fire him.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, the Office of the Professional Responsibility.  So, what  do you think the stake is for these guys?  When you look at Andrew McCabe,  James Comey, Bruce Ohr, number three guy, the Department of Justice, Peter  Stzrok and Lisa Page, who he was texting with. What happens to these people  -- this people at the top of the FBI and the DOJ?  Will we see justice for  what looks like a massive abuse of power?</p><p>BEDFORD:  Well, James Comey seems to have morphed into some kind of  mindless platitude generating Twitter thing.  I mean, I get it by  notifications from him.  And it's like a cheesy motivational poster of him  staring at the sunset.  And his thing writing of -- he's going to write a  book that we're all going to talk about but no one's actually going buy or  read unless they're going to send to them by the publisher.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, let's be clear, this is the top of the bestseller list,  right now, isn't it?</p><p>BEDFORD:  It will do fine, it's a good time to release a book.  But it's  not going to do as well as of course, any of these political books do.  We  talk about them more than they sell.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, you know, Christopher, we haven't spoken about Clapper and  Brennan?  I mean, I don't know what their faith will be, but --</p><p>BEDFORD:  Oh my gosh.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- they're pushing back.  But obviously they were right in it  with the bias.</p><p>BEDFORD:  And they put out a lot of statements -- they put out statement  for Brennan specifically putting out statement before Congress in relation  to the dossier that now appear to potentially to be false.  And the idea --  I've heard people wondering about this since the very beginning with the  dossier and how it's handled if it was submitted to the president so that  it could be leaked to the press and then become a big public saying, a lot  of people here are dirty but the chances that any of them go to prison or  any of them are disliked by Democrats after this is all over is very low. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll see.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I mean, McCabe basically admitted in the op-ed on the Washington  Post over the weekend, yes I leaked, but I was authorized to and then he  admitted that he didn't tell the whole truth.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He was distracted around him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He was interviewed by the investigators.  And by the way, most  people -- he's lucky he's not going to prison for that.  Most people -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we're arguing over his pension.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- it's a felony and he still gets to keep his pension despite  the narrative that you hear from some members of the media. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Pensions are not going anywhere, let's face it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, it's -- it has to do what (INAUDIBLE) he might've gotten an  extra special bonus that maybe they can take away his health care for life  and we all love health care for life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, but for the most part he's going that pension,  Christopher so, </p><p>BEDFORD:  You're right and General Flynn would be very -- General Flynn  would be very envious of how McCabe is being treated for doing the exact  same thing that Flynn is facing years in prison for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, let's not forget that just the idea of revealing the fact  that Flynn had the phone call with the Russian ambassador, that was a  felony.  So, let's see if that's ever taken up as well by Jeff Sessions.   Christopher, good to see you sir.   </p><p>BEDFORD:  Have a good one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Christopher Bedford, Daily Caller there.  </p><p>Coming up, Apple Chief, Tim Cook weighing in on the Facebook fiasco.  He's  calling for more regulation for the industry.  More details coming up  there.  </p><p>And then ask and you shall receive, pray.com, bringing together faith and  technology.  Investors are believing, and that the company's CEO will be  here, next.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  Happy Monday, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, March  26th, your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Easing fears of a trade war now, Futures are reporting to a huge rally at  the start of trading, after a new report in the Journal this morning, is  revealing that the U.S. and China have been holding behind the scenes  negotiations to solve the trade concerns.  As a result, the market shot up  260 points on the Dow, the talk follow a brutal week, of course.  </p><p>The stock prices last week, all three major indices fell, just gave out six  percent on the week.  Global markets this morning, mixed, take a look at  European indices right now, and we do see some gains on the heels of the  big rally on Wall Street that we are expecting.  </p><p>The FT-100, up a third of a percent, 21 points higher, CAC Quarante, up a  quarter of a percent, 15 points higher, and the DAX Index, up one half of  one percent, 62 points higher.  In Asia overnight, stocks were mostly  higher, with the exception of China, Nikkei Average in Japan and the Hang  Seng in Hong Kong, up three-quarters of one percent.  </p><p>Working to remake friends, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, taking out a full- page ad in newspapers across the globe to apologize for the company's  Cambridge Analytica Scandal.  The move, coming amid growing calls for him  to testify before Congress.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK WARNER (D-VA), SENATOR OF THE UNITED STATES:  He needs to come  and testify before Congress, not just put an advertisement in newspaper.   He said he would if he was the right guy, he is the right guy.  He needs to  come, testify before Congress and explain how they are going to work with  us to both protect privacy to 50 million Facebook accounts that were used  by this sketchy firm Cambridge Analytica, and how we're going to make sure  it doesn't happen again in terms of weaponization of the social  media  platforms.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The very latest fallout for Facebook is, Apple CEO Tim Cook,  who's joining the push for new privacy regulations in the wake of the  scandal.  And then Wal-Mart, getting handy, the retail giant teams up with  a home services provider to take on the new kind of competition from  Amazon.  I'll talk with the company behind the new partnership as online  retail wars continue to heat up, Amazon up two and a quarter percent right  now.</p><p>Meanwhile, click here to pray, interfaith social network app, Pray.com,  giving faith communities a place to chat, virtually pray, and set up  charities.  Religious leaders are also privy to in-app analytics, to gauge  how many parishioners they reached through pray.com.  Joining us right now  is Pray.com Co-Founder and CEO, Steve Gatena.  Steve, good to see you,  thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>STEVE GATENA, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, PRAY.COM:  Thanks for having me on,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What a great idea.  Pray.com was initially created to give  worshipers an alternative to Facebook, right?</p><p>GATENA:  That's exactly right.  We're very excited to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Explain the company and how -- yes.</p><p>GATENA:  Yes.  So we are -- so we connect people around prayer and action.   We give churches a private social network so that they can connect with  their parishioners and take actions on the causes that they care about.</p><p>CARTER:  You know, I think it's a fascinating time to be in there when  there are so many attacks on thoughts and prayers right now.  When you are  seeing a -- are you seeing a lot more activity?  What's the -- how's your  business going?</p><p>GATENA:  We are, yes.  It's phenomenal.  We've been blessed with some  incredible investors who recently gave us $14 million for a series A round,  and we've got thousands of faith organizations all over the country using  the platform to connect over small groups and connect over mission groups  and every time there's any kind of major event around the country.  We see  peek prayers happen and it's been an incredible experience, really,  building out Pray.com.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Morning, Steve, Mitch Roschelle, how do you monetize the  interaction amongst the congregates, I guess, on Pray.com?</p><p>GATENA:  Yes.  So, we are not an ad-driven business, and we're not building  an advertising-driven model where we sell our consumers data to other  advertisers.  We are actually a transaction-driven business, so right now,  we offer the ability to make a donation to a 501(c)(3) of your choice, and  over time, we will build out a premium content market place, where you can  download audio books, music and other types of digital media.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know, Facebook has apologized for that data breach  which, of course, rocked the technology sector.  They are running full-page  newspaper ads today, apologizing.  Your take when you see what's gone on  with all of the abuses around people's data and information?</p><p>GATENA:  Yes.  So, we take data, very seriously, at Pray.com, you know, as  I said before, we're not an ad-driven business and I couldn't imagine the  challenges that Mark and Facebook have to deal with and we continuously  pray for them on a weekly basis.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but you have access to everybody's data.  The real  question is what are you doing with it?</p><p>GATENA:  So, Maria, we actually do not collect the type of data that  Facebook collects on their users, we don't even ask our users to self- identify with a faith.  We just simply give our members the opportunity to  connect with an organization that they care about, create a cause and we  keep their data private and secure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Steve, it's Dagen McDowell, but, are you a for-profit company?</p><p>GATENA:  We are a for-profit company.  At the moment, we do --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was just going to ask you, does that conflict, do you think,  with the way that some people would view their faith and company making  money off of their faith and worship online, if you will?</p><p>GATENA:  So, we do not charge people to pray.  We do not charge people to  use a platform.  The platform is completely free and our business model is  to build out a premium content marketplace over time that can allow people  to buy the types of digital media products that they currently buy from  desperate sources such as bookstores and other websites.</p><p>CARTER:  So Steve, you say you don't collect people's data, but do you know  what the most, you know, common things that people are asking for prayer  about right now are?</p><p>GATENA:  Yes.  On our platform, we've seen people ask for prayer for  illness.  We have a lot of cancer recovery groups.  We see a lot of people  ask for a prayer around causes like gun violence, people who have  experienced and been victims to gun violence.  We see a lot of people  asking for prayer to end human trafficking and we see a lot of groups being  created that allow people to take action, not just prayer, and we believe  in the power of prayer, but also to mobilize action and gather volunteers  to act on the causes that they really care about most.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there, Happy Holidays, Steve,  thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>GATENA:  Happy Holidays.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve Gatena, Happy Easter, there.  Coming up, retail wars  heating up, how the Startuphandy.com is teaming up with Wal-Mart, to hammer  away at Amazon.  And then Facebook, still feeling the heat this week, Mark  Zuckerberg continues his apology tour.  Now, he faces fury over new report,  the social network collected calls and text data from millions of people,  wait till you hear this, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  OK, new fallout for Facebook, the social media  giant taking out a full-page apology ad in major newspapers while calling  for regulation, that continues to mount, a lot of people are calling for  regulation.  Lauren Simonetti with the details now, and Lauren, he said it  in the interview last week, I think we should be more regulated.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  A lot of people are saying  that this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Including Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Including Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple and the CEO of IBM,  they're a t a conference in Beijing, and they said, look, change is needed.   I have so much to get to with you guys, today.  First, we'll tale about  this ad, nine major newspapers, have the Mark Zuckerberg apology,  basically.  This is his damage control and he is saying, we are sorry for  the breach of trust referencing Cambridge Analytica, and was using 50  million users' personal information.  </p><p>Going forward, as Zuckerberg says, we're going to limit the data that apps  get, and investigate all of these apps that get this large amount of data,  is damage control working?  Well, if you take a look at Facebook stock,  last week, $75 billion in market cap, wiped out.  This morning, it's doing  a little bit better but the broader market is up, as well.  So I think you  can argue the fallout continues this week even though that chart is looking  pretty good.  </p><p>There's another story that we saw over the weekend, it's Ars Technica  report saying that Facebook stored for android users, their call and their  text message logs.  Facebook denies that, but they did say something which  was interesting to me.  They said, well, we only had it when you, the  users, gave us your permission.  So, the onus is constantly on the user,  with all of these stories.  And, again, as we talk about regulation, there  are calls from many lawmakers for more practical regulation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WARNER:  All of these social media form companies have said they have no  responsibility for any of the content.  I think we have to relook at that.   I think in many ways for media companies.  I think we have to relook at the  fact that if you move one company to another, maybe you should be able to  move all your data.  I do want to out-regulate these companies into  oblivion, but I do think people need to have the ability to know where the  information they are receiving is honest, truthful or at least, originates  in this country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  And all this affects Facebook's bottom line, because the  advertisers are now questioning how they and how much they should  advertise, not only on Facebook, but on many of the social media companies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There should be some rules in terms of understanding where your  data goes, have some transparency in terms of understand who has access to  your data, I mean, that at a minimum.  But I don't know if you can  regulate.  Everything moves so fast.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They could make -- they could make all of this; if your data is  going to be used to make money, it could be an opt-in not an opt-out issue.   Meaning, that any time they're going to make money off of your information,  they have to ask for direct permission to do so rather than basically with  the apps, even since the changes in 2015, you still have to physically go - - it's not under your privacy settings, it is under app settings.  And I  just want to point something out that Facebook has misused people's data  and screwed up over and over and again, it's not Cambridge Analytica.  Now,  all of the sudden, the left and the liberals -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Trump might be involved.  So, then. it's a different  story.  It was different than when Barack Obama used all the data and mine  all the data to get election voters eight years ago.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It started in 2007, roughly 2010, using Facebook data to build  databases of personal user information then selling the data to political  advertisers, even transmitting I.D. numbers.  2011, social media start up  cloud-created profiles for minors without their knowledge.  And Facebook  over and over again has told these people who they're making money off of,  not the individuals but the companies, cut it out.  I mean, I do that over  and over again, but they don't do anything.  Again, there were -- Russians  were infiltrating the social network; they were manipulating people's news.   They watch Facebook live and were allowing people to murder others and kill  themselves on live video.  Time and again, you know what, they've got  enough passes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's so many abuses.  Remember during the election when you  would Google Hillary Clinton?  It was -- you would get stories Hillary  Clinton is great, everything is great.  Then you would Google and it's  like, Donald Trump investigation, Donald Trump is horrible, evil, even did  that on the search level for Google.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Google owns YouTube, and Proctor &amp; Gamble already told  Google because they were literally running Proctor &amp; Gamble ads doing  terrorist content.  It was, like, violent --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Murders.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- murders.  They were running Proctor &amp; Gamble ads.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  And if the advertisers step back in any way, this will affect  the company's bottom line.  But you are raising two key questions:  systematic mismanagement at Facebook, right, and can Facebook police its  size at this point and if it can, at what cost?  You need to hire more  people to look through everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How idiotic it is for them to take out ads and actual real paper  newspapers to apologize -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why not do it on Facebook?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- two billion users who don't read most of these publications.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The apology must be online as well.  But you're right, I mean,  why is Facebook taking ads out.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  But it's not the digital version of those publication.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I hope so.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  This is The Wall Street Journal.  I haven't seen -- I also  haven't looked forward it to be fair.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He wrote a Facebook post, I mean, obviously.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  But did you read the journal digitally, you don't see the ad?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, true.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And somebody needs to train media train him to say I'm sorry and  actually look like you're sorry, can you teach that?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, pivotal research -- suspending fish management, we'll see  if anything happens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that.  Lauren, thank you.  Lauren  Simonetti there.  Coming up, virtual handyman service, Handy, inking a dead  with Wal-Mart.  Why this pairing may hit the nail on the head in the battle  against Amazon, back in a minute.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, TENNIS CHANNEL PRESENTER:  Welcome back to another Tennis  Channel COURT REPORT, a special presentation for Fox Business, I'm Dani  Klupenger.  Venus Williams first listed the trophy at the Miami Open 20  years ago.  Sunday, she needed all of her experience to reach the round of  16.  </p><p>The three-time champion saved three match point against (INAUDIBLE) report,  eventually closing out the win 7-5 in the decider, after almost three hours  on court.  Venus, moving on to phase to defending champion, Johanna Konta  for a spot in the elite eight.  </p><p>On the men's side, the winner at Indian Wells, Juan Martinez, continued his  quest for back to back tour titles in style as he dispatched (INAUDIBLE) in  straight sets.  The popular Argentine has looked fit and sharp all week in  his game and is now on a 13-match win streak.  </p><p>And don't forget Tennis Channel's extensive live coverage of the Miami open  hits air daily at 10:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the handyman for digital age -- one  company is making it easier than ever to recruit help around the house  whether it's cleaning or putting together that new piece of furniture.   Handy, lets you book top-rated home service professional at touch of a  button.  And now, it is teaming up with Wal-Mart.  Joining us right now to  talk more about that and first on Fox Business interview is: Oisin  Hanrahan, he is Handy's Co-Founder and CEO.  Oishin, I love this idea.  </p><p>OISHIN HANRAHAN, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, HANDY'S:  It's great to be here.   Thank you so much. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic, thank you for joining us.  First, tell us how it  works and about your partnership for Wal-Mart?  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  So, Handy is the easiest ways to get things done inside your  home; you think about everything from cleaners, to handyman, plumbers,  electricians, and it's the easiest way to book services, you just go to  handy.com or Handy mobile app, put in a zip code, you put more you'd like  do.  You could instantly check out in about 30 seconds.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but how do we know these are reputable people that we want  inside the house?  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  So, we've got out and we've done a lot of work to background  check, social security screen, and put a lot of effort into screening every  professional we put in the platform.  We've had over two million people  apply to join the platform, we've had only about 100,000 of them activated  and doing work and that's why Wal-Mart decided to partner with us because  that's the experience they want to deliver to their customers.  </p><p>CARTER:  Now, are people rated?  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  Of course, yes, so we rate every professional that on the  platform.  And if you go to a Wal-Mart store, so we partner to do T.V.  mounting, and furniture assembling, today you can go to any 2,000 Wal- Mart's right there on the T.V. aisle or in a furniture assembly aisle, and  the furniture -- you can buy a cart right off the shelf to purchase in- store.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  What if not that this happens, but we've all had bad  experiences with contractors, what if there ends up a bad experience is  handy on the hook or get to deal with this privately with the contractors?  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  I think that's a great question because you're not going to get  services to the same level of perfection as products, and that's just a  hard problem to solve.  We take 100 percent responsibility for every  transaction on the platform; we get $5 million of insurance and Handy  happiness guarantee to make sure that we make the customer happy.  </p><p>CARTER:  I've got to say I have found -- I've used your service when I had  an apartment here in the city and it's amazingly convenient.  How -- and I  just kind of assumed because I was in New York City that I was able to get  this level of -- you know, there a hundred of different people that I can  choose from; how does that work in the rest of the country.  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  So, we've rolled out now to about 90 percent of the country to  make sure that we've got 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. availability, but half of  the country it's next day, the other half, it's two-day availability.  And  it's one of the reasons why we built so much technology that power this  platform at scale.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is this like, well, I think it's called pro-referral at Home  Depot.  It's similar, because I know on of the guys, Ethen Anderson, who  founded that company and they sold in to the -- again, I was a start-up,  then they eventually turn around and sold the Home Depot.  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  So, what we don't is we focus right on the transaction.  We  don't what you to have to go through any referral process, we don't want to  have to, you know, ask you to take on any of the clunkiness of scheduling  or negotiation on price or availability or scope of work.  So, we've got  all the way to transaction, and that's one of the reasons why Wal-Mart, and  Wayfair, and others have decided to partner with us because we need  biproducts today, we can offer you services in the same sort of purchase  flow.  So, there's no price variability or price negotiations, we just turn  services into products and that's a little different from anyone who's come  before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you make money?  Do you take a piece, a cut from  every transaction then?  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  We take a little bit from every transaction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amazon offers similar services to Handy, right?  Like furniture  assembly, do you see your company's partnership with Wal-Mart as response  to the competition?  What does that do for the competitive landscape out  there?  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  Yes.  I think there's a lot going on right now in retail.  So,  if you look at what Amazon is doing, obviously they're pushing the boundary  on what customers expect, customers used to expect free returns, then free  shipping, then free two-day.  And now, I think more and more people are  expecting to figure out how to deliver an amazing experience to customers  at scale, and Amazon has obviously done a great job here.  We internally  have pushed our folks to think about how to step back from Amazon; we've  launched something internally called the Amazon challenge, which is to not  buy from any Amazon property for four weeks.  So, no Kindle, no Amazon  Echo, no Prime, no Amazon video, to try and emphasize: look, this is the  kind of experience and this is how pervasive Amazon has become in your  life.  So, we've been going the opposite direction -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's amazing.  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  -- in trying to educate folks how competitive the market really  is.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's great.  Oishin, great to see you, thanks so much.  We'll  check out Handy.  Oishin Hanrahan, we'll be right back</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Monday to you, and it is  Monday, March 26th, your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast  --</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Good Monday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.   And it is Monday, March 26th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the  East Coast.  Averting a trade war.  The Wall Street Journal is reporting  that the White House and China have held behind-the-scenes negotiations in  an effort to ease rising tensions following the administration's move to  impose strict tariffs.  Futures are jumping on the story.  Take a look.   Dow Industrials up almost 300 points.  White House Trade Advisor Peter  Navarro weighed in on the President's trade strategy yesterday with me on  \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL:  President's  vision here, it's stunningly brilliant.  What he's trying to bring about is  a fundamental reordering of the global trading system in a way which  focuses on free markets, fair trade and reciprocal trade.  It's really  important to understand that everything the President does every morning  that he goes to work is all centered around driving economic growth and  creating jobs.  Not just here in America but around the world. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The news coming after a rough week for stocks.  The Dow closed  down yet again on Friday, capping a week which saw all three major indices  down about six percent.  In Europe this morning we're seeing gains across  the board even if just fractional.  FT-100, CAC quarante up a half of a  percent.  DAX Index up two-thirds of a percent.  And in Asia overnight,  stocks were mostly higher with the exception of China.  All the majors up  almost one percent.  Supporting history, new Fox polls say that the  majority of Americans are in favor of President Trump's plans to meet with  North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.  Netflix banned, the big blow to the  streaming service as it is told it cannot compete at the Cannes Film  Festival.  And another celebrity disappears from Snapchat.  The details as  model Chrissy Teigen becomes the latest to ditch the app.  Then Sister Jean  meets the Wolverines and number ones square off.  More on their road to the  final four coming up.</p><p>Plus, shifting gears, one student driver hits the gas straight into the  driving school.  Oh, we are breaking down that accident coming up this  morning.  Nobody was hurt.  Wow.  All those stories coming up this Monday  morning and joining me to talk all about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen  McDowell, PwC Partner, Mitch Roschelle, and pollster and the President of  Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter is here.  Great to see you.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  That was a bad driving  test.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Full disclosure, not a  member of my family.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARTER:  Can you imagine that poor kid?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  It's usually some old person  darting for the handicapped space in front of the golden corral.   (INAUDIBLE) it happens all the time.  My father saw a woman jump the  railroad tracks in her truck in a car once, an elderly woman, Mrs. (Niece),  may she rest in piece, jumped the railroad tracks right in the middle of  Brookneal, hitting the gas, rather than the brakes.  It was something from  a Steve McQueen movie.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, that's crazy.  We got a lot on top this morning.  Joining  the conversation, former U .S. Ambassador to China and former Commerce  Secretary Gary Locke is joining us momentarily.  The host of \"VARNEY &amp;  VARNEY\", Stuart Varney weighs in as well.  And then award-winning record  producer, Harvey Mason Jr. is here.  Wait until you see some of the shows  and music he has produced.  Big interview coming up.  And we kick it off  right here with this hour.  And a look at Futures, markets on a scare right  now, the Wall Street Journal is reporting that Washington and Beijing have  begun negotiations on improving U.S. access to Chinese market.  Adam  Shapiro has live at the White House right now with the details.  Adam, good  morning to you.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  And a good morning to you,  Maria.  And we know that whether the things the Trump administration wants  the Chinese to do is buy more semiconductors.  As well as the President  last week he said he wants reciprocal trades in which the tariffs against  U.S. autos exports which is 25 percent in China get dropped down to -- he  says the two percent it's about 2-1/2 percent when we import automobiles  from China into the United States.  But the President this morning also has  a bit of a victory because it's been announced that the United States in  its negotiations with South Korea have concluded and there are changes to  the trade agreement with South Korea.  So the President this morning has  tweeted \"The economy is looking really good, it has been many years that we  have -- that we have seen these kind of numbers.  The underlying strength  of companies has perhaps never been better.\"  And Steven Mnuchin, the  Treasury Secretary was on Fox News Sunday yesterday in which he talked  about the discussions with China and what the administration is trying to  you achieve.  Here is what he said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY:  We're working on  a pathway to see if we can reach an agreement as to what fair trade is for  them to open up their markets, reduce their tariffs, stop forced technology  transfer.  These are all the things we want to do.  But in a negotiation,  have you to be prepared to take action and that's President Trump is doing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SHAPIRO:  The administration not afraid of a trade war, nor are the Chinese  for that matter but as you pointed out, Maria, the markets are seeming to  be calmer and liking the fact that both sides are talking.  Real quick on  the South Korea deal, it will allow U.S. auto manufacturers to double the  number of cars they export to South Korea.  It will also make permanent,  the exemption for South Korea from the current steel tariff.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Adam, thank you.  Adam  Shapiro.  Joining me right now to talk more about it is former U.S.  ambassador to China, former Commerce Secretary, former governor of  Washington State, now senior advisor and consultant at Davis Wright  trimming, Gary Locke is with us right now.  Good to see you, sir.  Thanks  so much for joining us.  </p><p>GARY LOCKE, ADVISOR AND CONSULTANT, DAVIS WRIGHT TREMAINE:  Good to see  you, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think this is about?  How do you think the U.S. can  make a dent in that $375 billion deficit with the Chinese?  What would you  like to see?</p><p>LOCKE:  We certainly have legitimate concerns about China's trade  practices.  China requires technology transfer.  In many cases, so many  parts of the Chinese economy are off limits to foreign and U.S. investment  whereas there are virtually no impediments to Chinese investment here in  America.  So that's an unlevel playing field.  And when American companies  do invest in China oftentimes they have to have a local partner which means  transferring your knowledge, sharing your knowledge or intellectual  property or trade secrets with those partners which then ultimately  overtime will take it and run with it and hurt U.S. companies.  So there's  been for long an unlevel playing field against U.S. and foreign companies.   That's what we need to target.  I'm concerned that these tariffs, these  surcharges on Chinese goods coming into the United States will not help us  achieve that purpose of leveling the playing field.  Instead, it's just  going to raise the prices that American consumers pay, whether it's at  Target, Macy's, Costco, Home Depot, you name it.  And in many cases, mane  of these products that are coming from China, that's the only place where  you can get them.  I mean, no one in America makes microwave ovens anymore.   They're all coming from China.  Electronic goods, clothing, toys.  So,  ultimately it's just going to raise the price of -- that Americans face  which means less money in their pockets for buying a car, vacation, college  tuition.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I know.  I understand.  So then what is the answer, Gary?   I mean, you know, we know that China is trying to transfer technology from  the United States to China and they're doing it in the very industries that  are supposed to be the industries of tomorrow, like robotics, like A.I.,  biotech, all these very important leadership industries.  So, if it's not  tariffs, what other restrictions should be in place against China?  Because  I know like if you're a Ford motor, for example and you want to sell in  China to the 1.3 billion person population, the first thing you have to do  according to the Chinese government is give them all your technology.  You  have to basically say, OK, here's how we do the cars, here's how we have  inserted technology all over the cars and then maybe you can get a foothold  in China but you certainly won't get more than 49 percent of any joint  venture, even then.  </p><p>LOCKE:  Well, that's why I think that United States has to work with all of  our allies around the world and the E.U. and elsewhere that have been  subjected to these same unfair treatment and rules and regulations and  together we impose basically the same restrictions on China.  China very  much wants to invest and buy companies and partner with U.S. companies and  other foreign companies around the world.  We need to put restrictions on  their ability to invest and go abroad as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  How much of this is also about a national security  concern, Gary?  Because I think most people and certainly businesses in the  United States, big businesses who have tried to get a foothold in China,  they understand this.  They know that they haven't been given a fair shake.   They will only be allowed to own 49 percent of a joint venture.  They have  to give up all their technology secrets.  But in terms of national  security, the chairman of the House Intel Committee, Devin Nunes was with  me yesterday and he right now told me he's investigating Chinese practices  over intellectual property theft but he also says China's manipulation goes  beyond that to military and infrastructure.  Listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NUNES:  The Chinese just opened up a base, a military base in Jaboti,  Jaboti is at the entrance of the Red Sea in the heart of the Middle East at  the -- at --in the Indian Ocean, a long way away from China.  We believe  that they are looking at investing in ports and infrastructure around the  globe, not just for military capabilities but also to control those  governments to have -- to have the ability to lobby and manipulate  governments.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a big deal, Ambassador.  </p><p>LOCKE:  It is.  And that's why you had so many members of the U.S. military  saying that the state department needs to invest more in terms of its soft  power, it's diplomatic outreach and programs all around the world so that  we build up the brand of America that we create allies and partners.  I  mean, China is really stepping into the vacuum created by the United  States.  And long ago we used to have programs to help people farm, to  bring water, clean water and hospitals and build bridges and roads.  We're  not doing that anymore.  Who is?  China.  And China's creating that  favorable political strategic climate all around the world to our  detriment.  Getting back to the issue of intellectual property and  technology, America really needs to put more money into supporting basic  R&amp;D in things like robotics and Artificial Intelligence.  China is throwing  billions of dollars at the world's premier foremost scientists and  researchers in this area, creating laboratories for them, paying for all  their staff.  They're enticing people from around the world to set up their  laboratories in China.  Where is America?  That's how we need to really  confront some of these technological challenges facing them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  These are -- these are big issues.  And by the way, the  President yesterday said that he wants to cut the trade imbalance by $100  billion.  Do you think he'll be able to do that?  Get it down to 275 versus  the current 375 billion?</p><p>LOCKE:  I don't know if he will or not.  I don't think that tariffs,  surcharges on taxes, imposed on Chinese goods coming into the United States  will do that because so much of what we're facing is as we said an unlevel  playing field for U.S. and foreign companies in China where they're limited  in what they can invest in, where they have to have a partner.  Raising the  prices of Chinese goods coming into the United States will slow down the  Chinese economy to a bit, not much, because so much of what we buy is only  made in China.  So, Americans are going to continue buying things from  China.  They're just going to pay more which means less money in their  pockets for other things.  So, we've got to stop this trade war.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want something done but you don't think the current tariff  story is the way to do it.  Let me get your take on North Korea because  then there's that as well.  The President made a surprise decision earlier  this month to accept an invitation to meet with North Korean leader, Kim  Jong-un in May.  Now a new Fox News poll finds a majority of voters approve  of that decision by a margin of 63 to 30 percent.  What are your thoughts  on this bilateral meeting and will China be involved?  </p><p>LOCKE:  Well, I think it's always good that we have talks as opposed to  confrontation and bluster and so we need to lower the temperature and get  the size sides talking.  And if the President is meeting with the North  Korean leader can help set the stage, start that process that's all well  and good.  But we need to be careful and we need to make sure that China is  involved because ultimately North Korea will not give up their nuclear  arsenal unless they have guarantees for their safety.  North Korea is  definitely afraid that the United States is somehow and North -- South  Korea and Japan will invade North Korea.  Topple the North Korean regime  which is why they have their nuclear arsenal, it's kind of their ace in the  hole, make sure that nobody crosses that border.  But if they do give up  their nukes, they're going to want to make sure that they have guarantees  for their security, that China and Russia will come to their rescue, will  defend them, will protect them.  That's why we need to be very, very  careful in our diplomacy and all of our negotiations with China and so many  other issues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So do you believe this is actually happening though, that  we are having these diplomatic talks?  I mean, the markets are rallying  today, Ambassador on the idea that China and the U.S. have been in talks  and they're going to make a change in terms of trade and some of these  issues.  Are you buying it?</p><p>LOCKE:  Well, I -- I'm not privy to those discussions or to the  intelligence.  Let's just hope that the talks are for real, that we're  starting and we're serious about it.  That both sides are serious.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Ambassador Gary Locke,  it's always a pleasure.  Thanks so much.  We appreciate it.</p><p>LOCKE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon, sir.  And we just showed the futures.   Let's show that again because we're at the highs of the morning right now  up better than 300 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average.  The NASDAQ  up better than 100 points.  We're talking about a gain of 1-1/3 percent on  the Dow and almost two percent on the NASDAQ at the start of trading in  about an hour.  Coming up.  Supermodel Chrissy Teigen ditching Snapchat.   The latest celebrity backlash for this social media company.  That's next.   And then a driver's exam coming to a crash and halt.  How a teenager  managed to slam into the local DMV during her test.  She didn't pass the  test.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Spotify issuing a revenue forecast ahead of next  week's initial public offering.  Cheryl Casone with the details now.   Cheryl?  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.  More details for  Spotify.  They says that their -- they see a revenue growing by as much as  30 percent this year.  That works out to nearly $7 billion.  Although that  would be less than last year's 39 percent revenue increase for them.   Shares of Spotify set to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on  April 3rd.</p><p>OK.  Take a look at this historic touchdown.  This is the first direct  flight between Australia and the U.K.  .  It safely arrived at London's  Heathrow Airport overnight.  This is the Qantas flight that flew more than  9,000 miles in just over 17 hours.  There's a flight for you.  The plane  itself a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, had 200 passengers and 16 crew on-board.   By the way, the Dreamliner is twice as fuel efficient as the Boeing 747  Jumbo Jet which they've actually discontinued.</p><p>Chrissy Teigen the latest celebrity to dump Snapchat following the redesign  of the messaging app and a controversial ad about Rihanna and Chris Brown  that appeared to mock domestic violence.  Here's what she quoted, that's  what she said on Twitter.  I stopped using Snap, the update, the constant  complaints, the people not being able to find me plus the Rihanna poll, no  bueno.  Snapchat subsequently issued an apology but the stock tumbled  earlier this month after Rihanna criticized the ad Instagram.  Stocks to  watch today is certainly let's see if that has an effect, Snapchat shares  are higher in the premarket, up more --almost two percent as you can see  you on your screen.</p><p>And then here's a story for you that I'm sure parents are going to love.  A  Minnesota teenager crashed into the DMV office while she was taking her  driver's test.  Police say that she accidentally shifted into drive instead  of reverse and the adult tested that was with her had to be taken to the  hospital, just minor injuries.  The 17-year-old driver was not hurt either,  nor was anybody inside of the DMV.  No word , Maria, on when she's going to  take her test over.  If ever.  We'll see.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's scary.  </p><p>CASONE:  A parent's nightmare.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I would not take her to that location, that's for sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right in there.  Move.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Drive starts with a D, R stands for reverse.  It happens a lot.   Is it a Southern thing?  I don't know but I've actually seen this happened  where somebody drives right through the front of the convenient store by  accident.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Oh, god.</p><p>CARTER:  You've seen it happen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I've seen it happen.  Because people are --- it's a lot of  times it's elderly people like I said fighting for the handicap spot right  in front and they're like racing and they, you know, and rather than  hitting the brake, they push the accelerator down.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're going to love this next story coming up.  We're going to  take a break.  When we come back, Senator Claire McCaskill is calling out  Hillary Clinton for her comments attacking Trump voters.  What she said  coming up next.  And the final four, no one saw coming, we break down the  highlights from March madness.  Back in a minute.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  What a weekend in college basketball.  The final  four is set.  Jared Max has the details.  Jared?</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTSCASTER:  Good morning, Maria.  Yesterday's game  between top-seed Kansas and number two Duke, the best of the tournament so  far.  11 ties, 18 lead changes, back and forth until overtime.  The Midwest  region final in Omaha tied at 72.  Final seconds regulation, Grayson Allen  a chance to win it for Duke, say good night, Graysee, no.  It doesn't get  the lucky bounce, so we go to overtime where it was time to say hello,  Newman.  Malik Newman of the Kansas Jayhawks delivered.  Newman, 32 points  of the game.  Newman scored all of Kansas' points in overtime.  Drained  five threes and all, Kansas in the final four for the first time in six  years.  85-81.  Second time in three years, Villanova going to the final  four, 2016 champions, scored their fourth straight win by double digits.   Wildcats beat Red Raiders of Texas Tech, 71-59 and a sense of a great  matchup in San Antonio next weekend.  Saturday night at the Alamodome.   First up, 6:09 Eastern, it will be the Cinderella Ramblers of Loyola- Chicago underdogs of five against Michigan.  And then 40 minutes after the  first game, top seeds Kansas and Villanova square off.  Nova, a five-point  favorite.  Loyola-Chicago has Sister Jean but Villanova has Father Rob.   Yes.  The priest is on the team bench who guard Dante DiVincenzo calls the  rock of the team.  Father Rob said he very much looks forward to meeting  Sister Jean.  Loyola Chicago's 98-year-old Chaplain and star of this  tournament, now she's been given her blessing for the school to market her.   Loyola Chicago's has reportedly approved in excess of 25 different Sister  Jean t-shirts for various companies like this one.</p><p>For the first time in 25 years, a NASCAR race was postponed by snow.  The  STP500 in Martinsville, Virginia had to get pushed back until today because  snowplows and emergency vehicles in the area were needed elsewhere, not at  the track.  So they will race today instead.  Two of the more colorful  figures in recent sports history have become a viral video tandem.  New  England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski and Hall of Fame basketball star  Shaquille O'Neal, what happens when the two of these get involved?  Well,  Rob takes off his shirt and eventually Shaq would put off on his shoulders.   The video has gone viral receiving well over 1.5 million views.  How do you  get on somebody's shoulders if you're Gronk?  If you watch the final couple  minutes of an NBA game, you've seen it all, right?  Well, the league is now  offering fans the chance to spend 99 cents to stream just the fourth  quarter.  It's like buying the greatest hits album.  Oh, and speaking of  streaming live sports, did you hear baseball commissioner Rob Manfred told  Maria Bartiromo just 30 minutes ago?  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's when you're at home.</p><p>ROB MANFRED, COMMISSIONER, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL:  Home.  And every one of  those breaks is an opportunity to tune away.  We pay a lot of attention to  what's going on in other sports.  We've been fortunate, however.  Our last  two World Series have been really successful in terms of our ratings.  And,  you know, during the summer in 25 of our markets on game days we're the  number one programming on television.  So we've been very fortunate.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MAX:  Major League Baseball season scheduled to get under way this  Thursday, all 30 teams scheduled to play.  Maria, I had an opportunity to  talk with the Commissioner Manfred before you did.  And I expressed to him  as a baseball fan, this pace of play deal as a baseball fan does not bother  me.  I like the slowness of it.  In fact, today's -- everything has to move  so quickly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MAX:  I'm even more enjoying the slowness of the game than ever before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But it's a reaction to the streaming, right?  It's a reaction  to people watching at home on their phones, trying to make it quicker,  trying to get to a younger audience.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're an army of one.  You're an army of one.  I've got -- you  know, I've got some paint you can watch dry.  </p><p>MAX:  Listen, McDowell.  </p><p>CARTER:  I'm with Jared on this one.  It's an army of two.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  We're together.  It's two versus  --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nobody's watching it, it's like NASCAR's problem.  </p><p>MAX:  But it's a multitasking world, right?  We're doing a million things  at once.  So, I can have the game on and be doing whatever I want, even if  I want to watch paint dry and then I hear base hit up the middle and I go  and I look at the screen and then --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And by -- and by the way, I'm a life-long ACC fan but man, it  feels so good to watch Duke lose.  </p><p>MAX:  Mich.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Michigan, since I went to that game against --</p><p>MAX:  Thirteen straight?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  That one 13 games and their good luck charm.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  My son keeps wearing the same thing over and over and over  again.  So, that man -- and we're going to go to the finals -- hopefully  he's not watching, we're going to get to the finals with Michigan.  </p><p>MAX:  You could score some good tickets for that, cheap, right?  Yes?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  Cheap tickets for the finals.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool.  Jared, thank you.</p><p>MAX:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared Max.  Catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines  24/7 or on radio, Sirius XM115.  Coming up.  Americans grade President  Trump on his handling on the economy.  We've got the latest Fox News polls  coming up.  And then Netflix reportedly getting the boost at a famous  French film festival.  Why the streaming company is no longer allowed to  compete there.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, March 26th.  Your  top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Easing fears of a trade  war this morning.  Futures are pointing to a big rally at the start of  trading, up better than 300 points after a new report from the Wall Street  Journal revealed that the U.S. and China have been holding behind the  scenes negotiations to solve trade concerns.  I spoke with Senator Lindsey  Graham about the concerns on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  The aluminum steel tariffs, I  think, were too broad.  The dumper is Canada, it's not Canada, it's not  Mexico, it's not Europe.  The idea that President Trump is going to hold  China accountable for dumping, for currency manipulation, intellectual  property theft, is long overdue.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The U.S. and China talks follow a brutal week for stocks on  Wall Street last week.  All three major indices were down about six  percent.  Global markets this morning look like this: European indices have  a firmer tone.  We are at the highs of the morning right here in Europe  right now.  FT-100 up 30 points; it's almost one-half of one percent.  CAC  Quarante, up 23, almost one-half of percent.  And the DAX Index in Germany  is up two-thirds of a percent, 72 points higher.  In Asia overnight, stocks  closed mostly higher with the exception of Shanghai in China.  </p><p>And Americans believe the economy is firing on all cylinders, thanks to  President Trump.  A new vote of confidence for the commander in chief  coming up.  </p><p>Democrats, turning up the heat on Hillary Clinton.  The former presidential  nominee is facing growing backlash from within her own party.  The tough  words from Democrat Senator Claire McCaskill coming up.  </p><p>Then, Netflix canned at Cannes.  Why the streaming giant was banned from  competing at the movie festival.  We'll tell you why.</p><p>And going beyond the music.  I'll talk to a producer from super stars like  Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears about his latest project, where the  thinks the industry goes next.</p><p>All that coming up this morning.  But first this, grading the president.  A  new Fox News poll shows that more than half of Americans think the  president is having a positive impact on the economy.  51 percent approve,  that's holding steady since January, it is up about four points from just  about this time last year.  Lee, your reaction to this?  We've seen a lot  of criticism about this administration's messaging.  Do you think this  tells a different story?  </p><p>CARTER:  I think it does.  I mean, there's a lot of criticism on the  messaging of the president, but I think that's because people are looking  at it in a very traditional way when this is a nontraditional president.  I  think the fact of the matter is that as erratic and difficult to follow as  the president's messaging is, the Democrat's messaging is that much worse.   And so, you're looking at it, you're saying OK, the president is getting  credit for the economy.  There's other things he's not getting credit for  and people are justifiably concerned, but when you have sound bites like  crumbs, you know, about tax reform, when you have sound bites about white  women are only voting the way they are because that's what their husbands  tell them to do, when you have comments like basketful full of deplorables,  who will get credit?  It's certainly not going to be the Democrats.  And  so, while the Democrats have an opportunity right now to really start  picking things up especially when you see some disapproval ratings out  there, they're not doing a good job doing it.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  My question to you, Lee, is can the democratic candidates  running in the mid-terms in a couple of months really sort of leverage the  -- what's going on here?  Because I'm looking at what happened in  Pennsylvania, it sort of went the opposite way.  You had a candidate who  sort of threw Nancy Pelosi under the bus and that was the entire campaign  strategy and it worked.  So, can Democrats want to sort of use that to  their favor, it could be sort of problematic for Republicans.  </p><p>CARTER:  It could be.  I mean, the bottom line is we're living in an anti- establishment world, whether you're on the right or the left.  People are  fed up with politics as usual.  So, the candidates are going to run on  something different, on something new, on the willingness to compromise, on  saying look, I might disagree with the president but I agree with him on  trade or whatever it is like they did in Pennsylvania.  You're going to  start seeing shifts in policy.  If the Democrats continue to run in many  places where they still are running against, you know, against the  president, against Trump supporters, I mean, really almost making fun of  them and being pejorative towards them, they're not going to win, there's  just not a chance.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But to point that out about the Pennsylvania election, that was  a Republican candidate, Saccone, that moved away from hammering Nancy  Pelosi.  So, it wasn't just the Democrats' strategy, it was Republican  strategy.  But he pivoted at the very end of the campaign toward the tariff  as if that was a good thing for those voters in Pennsylvania and it didn't  resonate, obviously.  </p><p>CARTER:  Well, he was a weak candidate to begin with.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just wanted to point that out.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I think the Republicans knew that.  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes, absolutely.  When you see a candidate that keeps waffling on  message -- shifting directions -- you saw this with Ted Cruz, during the  presidential election.  When you see somebody continuously changing like  that, you know they're losing.  So, somebody need to stay on course, get in  touch with the voting population which you are representing, and keep, you  know, keep on going with the president or without.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  People are confident and happy about the economy right now but  what will they say about the spending?  I mean, conservatives were very  upset about the spending plan last week, but Lindsey Graham, Senator Graham  had some comments about this and here's what he said, and he said the  president -- listen up to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GRAHAM:  We're not in debt because of discretionary spending.  We're in  debt because Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security are just exploding in cost  at 2/3 of the federal budget is entitlement spending, plus interest on the  debt.  So, if you want to get out of debt, let's do entitlement reform.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're not going to get that this year, Dagen, you've been a  critic of this; you've been talking about this for a long time.  You're not  going to get any proposal on this this year in an election year.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't think that you'll get it for a year -- I don't believe  that anybody in Congress and anybody in the White House, regardless of  party, will act on this until it's too late, until interest rates are at a  point that the interest that we're paying on our debt is swamping all other  spending, that it's putting constraints on the economy.  Again, it's less  than a decade that very interest payment is going to top what we spend on  our military every year.  You've got the hospital trust fund and Medicare  goes broke in 11 years where it's going to pay out, I say this all the  time, $0.88 on the dollar in benefits.  I don't think that anybody in  Washington is going to act until, quite frankly, it's too late.  </p><p>CARTER:  I mean, the issue about this is almost like the toothpaste is out  of the tube, because you're looking at it, the issue has become social  security, Medicare, Medicaid, all of these are human fundamental rights in  the opinion of most Americans.  So, how do you take away a right to health  care, a right to your money?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they don't call them entitlements.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Look, I paid in.  I paid in.  It's not an entitlement.  Well,  here's the newsflash, when you have a $60 trillion hole in Medicare and  Social Security, that means that people are taking out more than they ever  paid in.  That is a fact.  It is a fact, particularly with Medicare.  So,  you are now -- you didn't pay in what you're getting back in terms of  health care in your retirement.  So, I tell my parents that all the time.   I'm like, I'm paying for your health care.  Stop telling me that you pay  for it.  You've taken way more than you ever paid in.  </p><p>CARTER:  The bottom line, though, is voters are hearing this and it's so  hard for people to get their arms around.  It's a scary thing so people  avoid it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, they deny it.  They're in denial.  </p><p>CARTER:  Well, of course they do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's not so hard to take something back that was given to  you.</p><p>CARTER:  That's absolutely right.  So, the question is: what do we do about  it?  I mean, even if there's a think tank on the side that's giving us some  kind of pragmatic solution that people can get their arms around, that's  not happening.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (INAUDIBLE), you don't think it's going to happen for years?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that you literally will have a 10 percent interest on --  a 10 percent yield on the 10-year.  And then, all of a sudden, people are  like, wait a minute, our national debt is how our interest on the national  debt is how much every year?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Guys, we got to get to this because another Democrat is coming  out against Hillary Clinton and her recent comments about the 2016  election.  Remember what she said in India?  Missouri Senator, Claire  McCaskill, now says that the former presidential candidate needs to stop  being disrespectful to the Americans who elected President Trump because  Trump won her state.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D), MISSOURI:  For those of us that are in states  that Trump won, we would appreciate if she would be more careful and show  respect to every American voter and not just the ones who voted for her.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, McCaskill has to say something.  She's running for re- election and she says she disagrees with the president on many things but  her entire agenda is not just about being against this president.  </p><p>CARTER:  Thank god.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  You've got to be for something.  You can't entirely be against  something.  </p><p>CARTER:  That's right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And what's happening right now is a massive blame game.  We've  been talking about the spending bill for a while.  The reality is, the  president's blaming Congress, the House is blaming the Senate, and the  blame game's not going to play well with voters.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Hillary Clinton is blaming everybody else for losing the  election.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  It's everybody else's fault.</p><p>CARTER:  Blame the policies, not the people.  This is a really, really  important lesson.  People look at things, it is not helping them to blame  the voters and the people who they say are ignorant or the people who  caused this mess.  You know, the issue is the policy, and that's what  people need to focus on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But this has come up to bite her.  I mean, you know, she said  in India anybody who voted for Trump did so because their husband told them  to do it, remember that comment? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, she has an open disdain for any woman who doesn't agree  with her.  It's not just Republican --</p><p>CARTER:  And it's not just Hillary Clinton.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's Nancy Pelosi.  You hear the same underlying rhetoric from  all of these women that if you -- you are nothing unless you agree with  them.  You don't have a mind of your own.  You can't think for yourself.  I  mean, says a woman who took up for her husband who was basically having an  affair in the White House in the oval office with a woman and she went out  on national T.V. and lied repeatedly for him.  I'm not some Tammy Wynett,  stand by your man, she said during the first campaign.  So, I just think  that women are sick of this individual talking down to them.  </p><p>CARTER:  Of course, they are now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the other thing is, I don't know what she was talking  about.  She said things like, well, you know how it is, you hate women, you  don't want women to get ahead, you hate Indian-Americans who are getting  ahead.  I'm like, what?  I have no idea what she's talking about.  </p><p>CARTER:  This is how bad it is.  I was speaking at a women's event.  And I  said, I'm going to say something shocking thing to all of you that you're  going to hear today, is that I am a conservative woman and I'm here  speaking at a woman's event and there was like a gasp in the audience.  And  then afterwards, they were like, how can you be a conservative and a woman,  and think for yourself?  I'm like, how has this gotten to the point where  people -- people actually believe that?  But you can't be -- it's true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.  That's crazy.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  It's an echo chamber.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is crazy.  All right.  So, the president is tweeting right  now, I want to get to it, and here's what he said just a moment ago: \"So  much fake news, never been more voluminous or more inaccurate.  But through  it all, our country is doing great.\"  Country is doing well, economically  speaking.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think that we would like to see the market turn around after  that, it fell of last week.  But one thing I'll point out about women on  some of the other networks, I didn't realize that sneering was a job  requirement.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh yes, let's talk about that.  Are you talking about MSNBC?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm talking about MSNBC, because I didn't bring this up.  I'm  talking about Larry Kudlow, he said, you know, if god-willing or something  like that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  She made fun of his face.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE), she made fun of his face, she did apologize.  But  I'll say one thing that struck me, for somebody who has openly talked about  his recovery and the process of that, basically looking toward a higher  power is a critical element of the recovery process, and your faith in  something higher than you and greater than you.  For you to sneer at that,  I'm sneering back because I find that utterly appalling.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, she apologized.  It didn't seem like an apology.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it's that kind of women, it's that -- I don't think that  women are helping women point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Coming up, the Trump administration is reportedly seeking  a trade solution with China following the threat of hefty tariffs on  imports.  Stuart Varney has something to say about that, he'll weigh in  next.  And then, Dropbox shares up in the premarket following the public  debut last week.  The IPO went well; how the data storage company sacks up  against other technology rivals next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stocks are on a tear this morning.  Take a look, Dow  Industrials expected to be up better than 300 points at the open, better  than 100 points on the DASDAQ.  Dropbox is also watching a strong day after  a good IPO performance on Friday.  Nicole Petallides on the floor of the  New York Stock Exchange, watching all the action.  Nic, good morning.  </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.   Bring it on for the bulls this morning.  As you noted, 316 points for Dow  Futures, and Dropbox which was the large tech IPO late last week on Friday  which soared at the market open, did great on Friday.  It's looking higher  once again today with a number that was raised for their IPO, it was a  $21.00 IPO.  It traded over 30 bucks.  And you could see here, this  morning, $30.09.  The high was 31.60 on Friday.  We'll see if we can break  through that for the folks who are bullish on tech.  It was the largest IPO  certainly of the year and since Snap.  </p><p>I wanted to move onto Netflix, also looking to the upside this morning,  Maria.  Well, this one obviously it's been a winner this year, up 56  percent.  But here's the thing, Cannes says Netflix, you're out.  Last  year, they brought Netflix in with two films, but with that, they thought  that those films were going into the cinemas.  There were unions,  filmmakers, protesters, saying that the concept of Netflix streaming does  not correlate with everything else that goes on in Cannes.  And now, Cannes  basically saying that they're barred from entering the palm door which is  the -- which is the golden palm, that is the highest honor.  Netflix looks  like they're going to be out on this one.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Nic, thank you so much.  We'll be watching that big  rally at the open.  Futures indicating a gain of better than 300 points due  to easing fears about a trade war with China.  The Wall Street Journal is  reporting that the U.S. and Beijing are in talks to curb trade concerns on  both sides.  Joining us now to weigh in is host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\"  Stuart Varney.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  I  actually want to talk about Zuckerberg and Facebook if that's OK with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p>VARNEY:  I do agree with you that the two sides of the China trade dispute  talking to each other, quietly as the Wall Street Journal says, that's why  we're going to get a big rally at the open today.  But look at Facebook.   Now, that's a bit of a comeback, up a buck 80 at $1.61.  But it sure ain't  much when Facebook was all the way up into the high 180s at one stage a  couple weeks ago.  I think Zuckerberg is the problem.  He's not doing well.   He doesn't appear in public very well.  On television, it's just not  convincing, and those apologies that were published in newspapers over the  weekend were kind of not that much.  I don't think he'll do very well if  he's hold before Congress and I don't think he'll do very well if he's hold  before the British Parliament either.  And yet, Facebook is stuck with  Zuckerberg as its leader.  They're stuck with a leadership problem because  Zuckerberg, what, he controls 75 percent of the voting stock.  His board is  his board.  Nobody is going to raise an eyebrow to him.  I think Facebook  is stuck with Zuckerberg and I think that will hurt the stock in the long  run.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he's got voting control.  You know, investors need to  better understand when investing in companies that have no voting  independence at all when you -- when you have a voting in control situation  like you do at Facebook and other media companies, by the way.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, because there's no response on the part of leadership.  They  don't have to respond to the pressures bubbling up from underneath.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Stu, you're right, they're stuck with him.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's Zuckerberg.  Yes, I think so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stu, thank you.</p><p>VARNEY:  Sure thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will see you in a few minutes.  I know you'll have a lot  more on that.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. Eastern  right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Join Stuart and his great team, next.   But first, coming up, the man behind the hits, award-winning record  producer Harvey Mason, Jr. will be joining us to talk about the  collaborations with the music industry's biggest stars and his latest  project, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was the song \"The Living Proof\" from the film \"The Help\"  just one of the many Golden Globe nominated pieces produced by or next  guest, Harvey Mason, Jr., he's a six-time Grammy winner, who is now taking  his talent to live T.V.  Great to see you, Harvey, thank you so much for  joining us.</p><p>HARVEY MASON, JR., RECORD PRODUCER:  Thank you.  It's good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we want to talk about so much because you're also serving  as music producer for NBC's \"Jesus Christ Superstar Live\" which airs  Sunday.  Let's take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In three days, I shall return.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This endeavor is unique.  It's a broadway show, it's a  concert, it's a television show, it's kind of the best of all of these  worlds.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is awesome.  I can't wait to see that one.  Tell us why,  what attracted you to that project?</p><p>MASON:  Well, the story, the music, the cast.  It's just this -- it's an  epic story and we've got an incredible cast.  The music is amazing.  Andrew  Lloyd Webber, iconic music, iconic story so --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.  But does -- did the challenges change with live T.V.?</p><p>MASON:  Totally.  We've got over 30-piece band and orchestra, full strings,  and everybody is singing live.  Nothing is recorded, nothing is pre-done,  all the musicians are playing.  So, it's going to be exciting.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Have you worked with Lloyd Webber, has he been involved in this  production at all?</p><p>MASON:  He has.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And how has he contributed?  Because I know that having met him  before, he is so focused on the music and the musicians, like he is a  composer's composer.</p><p>MASON:  He is.  And it's amazing music.  So, he's handling it in very, very  great -- it's a great way that he approaches his music and he interacts  with the cast, and working with me, a lot of details, specifics, this  baseline, this vocal part.  But I mean, it's iconic music.  You can't go  the wrong way with it.  You have to address it very carefully.</p><p>CARTER:  Do you have one piece in the show that you're most excited about?</p><p>MASON:  Sara Bareilles and John Legend sing a couple things where they're  interacting on a couple numbers that are really special and both of them  have such great voices.  So, it's really hard to hard to pick one but those  two going back and forth is special.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I followed both of them on Instagram -- </p><p>MASON:  So, do I.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, there's an array of talent, right?  There's John Legend  is out, Alice Cooper.  So, what it's like working with such a wide-ranging  cast?</p><p>MASON:  It's great.  But that's what makes it so special is the variety and  different genres they all come from and the different skillsets they bring  to the table.  But I've been doing that my whole career and I've been  fortunate to work with some great, great people.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I bet.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Do you think having contemporary performers performing  something that's I guess from the 70s, Jesus Christ Superstar, can sort of  bring some of that sort of classic broadway to a younger demographic?</p><p>MASON:  Yes.  And I think that's the goal with casting the right people,  you want people who can obviously carry the songs and really pull it off,  but you're using some great music along with these new talents to bring the  audiences together.  And that's what we're trying to do with the music, we  try and present it in a new and fresh way, but we're very respectful of the  way that it was originally conceived.  You don't want to offend the  original fans.  We want to reintroduce it to new --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you -- how do you carry the songs from Aretha Franklin?   I mean, you're also producing the upcoming Aretha Franklin biopic called  \"Respect\" starting Jennifer Hudson.  That's going to be hot.</p><p>MASON:  It is.  That's another amazing project.  Again, I'm very fortunate  I'm working on some great things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us about Jennifer Hudson, how she -- how she's doing for,  you know --</p><p>MASON:  Well, that project is early on.  We haven't moved past the script  yet but we do have her excited about the project and we've been working  together for almost 11 years on different projects.  We did \"Dreamgirls\"  together, so I'm a huge Jennifer Hudson fan.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But the idea of it gives me chills.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know, it's great.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thinking about just Aretha and her catalog and her voice and her  achievements and Jennifer, too.</p><p>MASON:  And it's a great story.  A lot of people don't know the story and  the depth of the things that went on with her, so it's going to be really  an empowering story.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, I'll be there watching that one.  Harvey, great to see you.</p><p>MASON:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.  Best of luck with all of these projects.   Harvey Mason, Jr.  Stay with us.

Why he plans to build on the  company's flame thrower success.  </p><p>All those stories this morning coming up and joining me to talk all about  it -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; PWC partner Mitch Roschelle;  and pollster and the president of Maslansky and Partners Lee Carter.</p><p>Great to see everybody.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning -- every Monday.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNERS:  We've got a lot of news.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we do.  We see a market that's completely turning around  this morning.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And the market did a complete reversal from where it was  Thursday and Friday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>CARTER:  No, it's so interesting.  Last week initially we were talking  about the China tariffs.  We're saying I wonder if this is a negotiating  strategy, if he's going to throw this out and then China connects on the  cable and that's what we are seeing maybe it's happening.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And trying to maybe into the table the whole time but backdoor  negotiations.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll tell you -- after looking at this subject I have learned  so much about what China is doing.  It's not just about transferring  technology to China and acquiring some of the best and most important  sectors that we are or trying to acquire, the most important sectors like  robotics and AI that China is doing.</p><p>They are also trying hard to be number one in terms of military.  They're  acquiring infrastructure all across the world, owning that infrastructure  and then getting a spot on the sea level -- on the sea lane in different  parts of the world and setting up military bases there.</p><p>Very interesting.  That's what Devin Nunes from the intel committee told me  yesterday.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  But that's one of the reasons that the spending  bill in the runaway spending and the debt dovetails with what we're trying  to do with China because we lose some valuable ammunition the more that we  run up our national debt and the more that we basically are running $1  trillion budget deficits every year because then we have to lien on China  even more to continue to buy that debt.  And surely not sell what they  already own being the largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why every time we hear a rumor that China's starting  to sell treasuries or buying lesser than what people expect -- you see  massive selloff in the stock market.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And quite -- my opinion, but if you wanted to really have your  allies lock arms with you to take on in China, it's not just the United  States intellectual property and abuse and its motives.  We need to lock  arms with our allies so then you don't throw on those steel and aluminum  tariffs and basically kind of shock those very allies ahead of wanting to  take a harder stance with China.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The 10 industries that they want to, by 2025 be the world  leader in -- </p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  -- aerospace, next gen technology, robotics, agriculture, rail  advancements -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- shipping and bio-tech.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  These are things that we also want to be leaders in.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love that list and I will focus on that list.  We're going to  talk about that list coming up this morning.</p><p>And joining the conversation Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew  Napolitano is here; Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred making  an appearance today, he will be in studio with us; former U.S. Ambassador  to China and former Commerce Secretary Gary Locke is with us as well.  A  lot to talk about with him.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it.  We've got a big two hours coming up.</p><p>And we kick it off right now with this.  Markets -- futures are indicating  a big rally at the start of trading this morning.  Markets are on a tear as  \"The Journal\" is reporting that Washington and Beijing has begun  negotiations on improving U.S. access to Chinese markets.</p><p>This comes as House intel committee chairman Devin Nunes told me yesterday  on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\", \"congressional investigators have been looking  into Chinese practices.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  They are stealing  our intellectual property.  So either it's through the internet or it's  through investing in educational systems here or think tanks.  They are  bringing people here.  I believe that they are still in Silicon Valley  blind.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is the chairman of the Republican Study  Committee and North Carolina Congressman Mark Walker.  Chairman Walker --  good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning.  </p><p>REP. MARK WALKER (R-NC), REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE:  Thanks-- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Devin Nunes just said that his committee is investigating  this.  What should be investigated?  </p><p>WALKER:  Well, if you look, my first two years in Congress, it was an eye- opener for me serving on the homeland security, realizing how many times  per day, tens of thousands of times per day that China literally hacks  every industry that we have.  They are the biggest stealers of our  intellectual property and have been doing it for decades.</p><p>So the Trump body language and the movement to throw down some for warning  shots I think is very important and sends a very clear message.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you like what the President has done here then?  </p><p>WALKER:  I do.  Obviously we want to make sure that the tariffs ultimately  do not get to the place where there is an increase in consumer costs or  ultimately even jobs.  But I believe going after bad actors and  communicating very clearly what the Chinese have been doing, specifically  their leadership, I think is a very educational moment for Americans.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman -- it's Dagen McDowell -- though if China  retaliates, they've already started talking about tariffs on pork but then  what about hogs.  That would hammer the very people in your state.  And if  they do retaliate, they will go after those states in those places who  voted for President Trump.  </p><p>WALKER:  Absolutely.  There's no question.  And this will just impact  theirs, even has ties to the E.U. the F Corp located here in Greensboro,  very concerned, even things about Wrangler jeans -- a 25 percent hike  across Europe.</p><p>This -- ultimately we know that free trade is very important.  We have to  be careful here but sending a shot across the bow, I am glad to see that  these -- what we thought was very wide scope tariffs have been narrowing.   And we want to make sure that it doesn't unroll or disembark the good work  from regulatory relief and tax reform that we've seen already.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I mean do you think that $3 billion in tariffs that China  has promised last week -- was that just a gesture?  I mean obviously it's  not commensurate with $60 billion in tariffs that the U.S. is talking  about.  It's $3 billion.  </p><p>So is China just saying we are not rolling over, but we're also not going  to do anything to mess with this $375 billion surplus that we have?  </p><p>WALKER:  I think at this point, Maria, that is correct.  Maybe more a  gesture than anything else but ultimately, as most of your panelists would  know, we certainly don't want to let it devolve into a trade war.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>WALKER:  So one of the reasons that the spending bill is so important that  we make sure -- I think Dagen hit it out of the park just a few minutes  ago, breaking that down.  It's very important that we keep our fiscal house  in order as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, ok.  You said that.  That's what we were talking about  all morning but fiscal has an order $1.3 trillion spending bill, I don't  know.  It doesn't add up, sir.</p><p>You know, we've got brand new Fox News polls show this morning that  Republicans are narrowing the gap with Democrats ahead of the 2018 midterm  elections.  Democrats had have a five-point lead over the GOP but this  comes as Republican Pennsylvania Congressman Ryan Costello confirmed  yesterday that he will drop his bid for reelection and retire at the end of  his term.</p><p>So Chairman Walker -- are you worried that the Republicans are going to  lose the majority in the House and how does the spending bill play into  that?  </p><p>WALKER:  Well, I think that is secondary.  I think ultimately what we need  to be doing as members of Congress is fulfilling our promises and let the  chips fall where they may.  Do I believe that we have much to run off in  2017?  We do -- ANWR, regulatory relief, tax reform, pro-life legislation.   But if Republicans get to the mindset that we can spend like the Democrats  do and not doing anything from here to November, I think that would be  cataclysmic.</p><p>I think it's very important to continue to build on those promises.  The  Republican Study Committee is coming back with the great fervor pushing for  a balanced budget amendment.  We'll also develop our own Republican Study  Committee budget that's going to be much more in tune in balancing intense  come elected and very important we communicate.  Hopefully in 10 and 11 --  at the most 12 years, it's very important that we communicate these  principles to the American public -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WALKER:  -- if Republicans want to keep the majority.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we want to talk about this because we all have problems  with the spending bill -- sir.  I mean the economy will obviously be a big  issue in the midterms and the President is tweeting about this, this  morning. </p><p>Here's what the President said just a few minutes ago.  \"The economy is  looking really good.  It has been many years that we have seen these kinds  of numbers.  The underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been  better.\"</p><p>Do you agree with that?  And do you believe that if we keep running up all  of this deficit, that that is going to cut into the growth?  </p><p>WALKER:  I believe temporarily we are seeing some wonderful economic  recovery news.  However, if you look out just a few years, our mandatory  spending had gone from about a third of our budget to closing in to 75  percent, 76 percent of our budget.  We simply can't sustain that.</p><p>In this specific omnibus, it increased nondiscretionary spending -- or  discretionary spending 13 percent in one year.  As a fiscal conservative,  some people like to say a fiscal hawk.  Sometimes we feel like we're the  adults in the room trying to say or trying to put out some warning signs.   We are the only group that doesn't have a special interest that we are  advocating for.</p><p>Where Defense needs massive, they were out, stood in the empty silos in  Alaska where this previous administration depleted our military defense.   But at the same time we have to understand that unless we're willing to go  after this mandatory reforms, we will not leave the next generation very  much to work with.  </p><p>CARTER:  So Congressman -- you guys have the House, you have the Senate,  you have the White House.  And if you can't get this through now, when are  you going to get it through and how is it going to be different eight  months from now than it is right now.</p><p>Because it seems to me, that if you couldn't have gotten it done this time,  how are you going to get it done?  </p><p>WALKER:  That's a very fair question.  I remember sitting in the room with  the Majority Leader when Congressman Tom Graves came up with the idea  almost a year ago that we would get all 12 appropriations bills done  through the house for the first time in 13 years. </p><p>We have met that goal, sent it to the Senate.  The senate never took up a  single appropriation.  We then tried again in package 4 props bills,  budgetary bills and put into one particular piece of legislation.  They  still didn't take it up.</p><p>So there has been some talk.  Does the Senate eventually move to a 51  simple majority when it comes to any kind of budgeting idea or  appropriations?  I don't know the solution, but we're going to keep the  pressure, keep the press on, really exposing those who are putting a stop  in the progress.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And clearly there's some politicking going on with the pushback  on President Trump signing the spending bill on Friday because Secretary  Mnuchin of the Treasury Department was on with Chris Wallace yesterday.   And Chris Wallace had to remind him when he brought up the idea of a line- item veto, he wanted Congress to pass the rule for a line-item veto so the  President could go through and veto line items in the spending bill.</p><p>And Chris Wallace had to remind him well, that was ruled some years ago  unconstitutional.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There will be a constitutional amendment.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  So again, you know, you can pass a constitutional amendment but  that requires a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate.  </p><p>WALKER:  It does -- Dagen.  But let's not just talk about the policy.   Let's talk about the process of getting a nearly 2,300 page bill on the  evening of the next day you're supposed to be voting for it.</p><p>We have eight full-time people, staffers on the Republican Study Committee.   Two stayed up all night, trying to get through the bill.  They weren't able  to complete.  I think it is preposterous to ask us to vote on something so  lengthy with the amount of pork and level that was in the specific piece of  legislation.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But YOU did it.</p><p>WALKER:  No, I didn't.  I was one of 90 that voted against it.  And we're  going to continue to rule against it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, this is an important point that you bring up.  You  voted against it so you weren't one of those people who said all right,  look, I'm just going to throw in the towel here just to get the spending  for the military.</p><p>What are you supposed to do the next time?  The President said he's never  spending something like this -- he's never signing something like this  again.  </p><p>WALKER:  Well, this bill should've never reached the President's desk.  It  did not even have some of the specifics that he had asked for, for wall  funding.  I think we acquiesced a little bit too much.  I've got to give  the speaker a little bit of props here because I understood some of the  talks and some of the battles that he was facing trying to get at least  some of the things across the finish line.</p><p>But this bill is really not good.  You're talking about an increase of 13  percent in one year in discretionary funding.  That is ridiculous.</p><p>I believe it's very important that not just 90 of us but more and more  members of Congress have to draw the line somewhere when it comes to being  fiscally conscious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WALKER:  This is preposterous that we would increase this kind of debt.  We  are now matching levels -- think about this - -we are now matching levels  if not even more of a deficit than Obama's last three, maybe four years in  office.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>WALKER:  We promise to do better and I hope that -- I hope more members  will wake up to that cause.  </p><p>BARTIROMO: Mr. Chairman -- thank you.  Thanks so much.  Mark Walker joining  us there.</p><p>WALKER:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Dozens of people including children killed in a fire in a Russian mall.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  That's right -- Maria.  </p><p>Reports say at least 64 people been killed, another 16 are still missing --  dozens of children are among the victims.  The blaze started on the upper  floor of the Winter Cherry Complex in Siberia while many of the victims  were at the movies.  The cause of the fire is still under investigation.</p><p>The shopping mall which opened in 2013 has a cinema, a petting zoo, a  children's center and a bowling alley.</p><p>Well, America's oldest gun maker is filing for bankruptcy protection.   Remington -- taking that step due to a heavy debt load, falling sales and  lawsuits following the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012.</p><p>Under the bankruptcy plan, control of Remington would shift to its  creditors which include Franklin Resources and JPMorgan Chase.  Much of the  company's debt will be erased and its filing also means that Surplus  Capital Management will no longer own Remington.</p><p>Elon Musk unveiling his plan to sell rocks that are carved out by his  tunneling venture.  Here is his tweet and how he announced it.  \"New boring  company merch\" -- which is merchandise\" -- \"coming soon.  Life-size Lego- like interlocking bricks made from tunneling rock that you can use to  create sculptures and buildings.  Rated for California seismic loads, so  super strong, but bored -- like an aircraft wing span so not heavy.\"</p><p>The boring company's main (INAUDIBLE) project is a network of tunnels under  the city of Los Angeles.  Of course, Maria, this is Elon Musk's big, you  know, dream to make these hyper loops so that we can get from city to city  a lot quicker.  That's the idea.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good stuff.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up -- Facebook is saying sorry again.  The reaction to the social  media company's new apology in print, following its breach of trust, next.</p><p>And then Uber selling its Southeast Asia business to a rival company -- we  break down that deal coming up.  Back in a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Facebook's mea culpa -- CEO Mark Zuckerberg is apologizing for the  company's breach of trust in a full-page ad in six U.K. and three U.S.  newspapers following the scandal.  Facebook shares are looking like this,  this morning after a tough week last week where the company gave up more  then 10 percent of its value.  That stock is up fractionally right now.</p><p>Joining us right now is Gabelli multimedia trust portfolio manager Larry  Haverty who owns Facebook and many other companies.  </p><p>Do you think it's done enough -- Larry?  Good to see you.</p><p>LARRY HAVERTY, GABELLI MULTIMEDIA TRUST PORTFOLIO MANAGER:  Yes, I think  basically, Maria, the crisis could have been addressed earlier by  Zuckerberg.  My big rant on the company, if you will, is that Zuckerberg is  the captain of the ship and he should have been at that all-hands meeting  that they had on Tuesday rather than sending a lawyer.</p><p>But after Wednesday, I think somebody got into his ear or there are a lot  of smart people at Facebook and since then in my opinion they've done all  the right things.  They've hit all the boxes including the advertisement,  which I think should've been earlier but in my opinion was very effective.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Larry -- looking more broadly at the tech sector and the fact  that the big run-up in the market, a lot of it was the big tech names in  terms of the S&amp;P.  How -- does this really impact the broader technology  sector, investors are going to start shying away a bit?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I don't really think so.  I look at the tech sector versus other  consumer equities.  And you look at the tech company like Google or  Facebook on current cash flow around 17 times and you look at a consumer  product company that has maybe a 1 percent growth rate and it's 12 times.</p><p>So tech is really very, very underpriced.  The only reason that tech would  I think have big problems is if you had a very significant increase in  interest rates and/or an acceleration in inflation and that would have to  be energy driven and I don't see any chance of that.  It's going to happen  any time soon.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about an increase in regulation?  What if we have a whole  new rule book now for Facebook and all of these other companies that have  an incredible amount of data?  Does that cut into earnings and change the  reason to own these stocks?  </p><p>Haverty:  I think for sure it does and for sure we're going to see  something like that particularly in Europe and the U.K. where the new  regulations are really pretty stringent on what they can do.  And the U.K.  people are very, very conservative about this, at least as far as my  understanding is.</p><p>And you know, what you're looking at is a slowing in the rate of birth.   Say, if you thought Google was going to grow at 20 percent.  Maybe it's  growing at 18.  If you thought Facebook was growing at 30 percent.  May be  it's 25.  I don't really think it's any lower than that Maria, because you  have so much growth in, you know, -- I was just in Australia and New  Zealand last week and they are growing like weed over there.</p><p>I think with this it's unlikely that they are going to get into China.   That would be the big bonanza.  But there's a lot of growth in the world  and the thing about these companies is at the end of the day they don't  give you anything.  They are not giving you Colgate toothpaste; they're not  giving you soap.  Their cost to good sold is virtually nothing.  So if they  get any revenue, they can't spend the money really fast enough so it goes  to free clash flow.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But with Facebook, we talked about regulation and the addict  calls.  And even if they choose, even if it's not through regulation, is  they choose to dial their business back -- that potentially reduces revenue  and profit.</p><p>However, you do have a rising tide to people basically getting rid of their  Facebook account.  And it might -- maybe it's temporary.  Maybe it's not  but which companies also benefit from this backlash like an Apple -- again,  you can use Apple messenger, you can use your iCloud e-mail because they  certainly are more principled and their primary source of revenue and  income is not selling people's data unbeknownst to them.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Well, I think one of the beneficiaries is maybe what we now call  old media.  And you look at one of the companies in the news, Unilever.   And Unilever is apparently very irritated at Facebook.  And of course,  Unilever is a British and a Dutch company and that goes in line with what I  was saying about the regulation over there.</p><p>Well, Unilever is not going to stop advertising so some of some of it is  probably going to filter down to the old guys.  But importantly, my  training as in economics; and in economics, you learn to talk and think  about the margin.</p><p>And what you're talking about is the margin, it's not the mass.  Could they  lose three, four, five percent of their subscribers?  Absolutely.  Do I  expect that they're going to lose that?  Absolutely I do.</p><p>Is it discounted in the market?  I think a lot of it is discounted because  Facebook already lost -- pick a number -- $60 billion, $70 billion in  market value.  That's not a casual number.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They could maintain their profit margin by laying people off.</p><p>HAVERTY:  You are talking about a 40 percent profit margin.  This isn't a  supermarket company with a 6 percent margin.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  What's their annual income, net income -- $50 billion?  </p><p>HAVERTY:  I look at in on operating cash flows so it's $23 billion.   Google's around $32 billion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  It's their income number, not revenue --  that's incredible.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The numbers are really staggering -- yes, sir.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't think we'll look at those numbers and realize that  they're your personal information that they were basically not protecting  and handing off to other companies.  That's how they make that much.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And monetizing it -- right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>CARTER:  I'm curious though because it used to be that Facebook was like  the thing in town.  And now there's so many alternatives.  You've got  Snapshot, you've got Instagram.  There's all these other things that are  rising in popularity.  So if Facebook doesn't do the right thing, don't you  think they could go the way of Kodak and Blackberry?  And these other -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAVERTY:  Oh, no, no, no.</p><p>CARTER:  We don't.  Tell me why.  Tell me why.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Because basically these applications have really changed your  life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HAVERTY:  No one in our business can get along without Google.  I mean I  can't tell you how many times -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there's a prize to be paid -- Larry.</p><p>HAVERTY:  of course there is, and that's -- you know, that's for the market  -- that's for the market to decide.  And the market sets its price, I  think, based upon interest rates and alternatives.  And if interest rates  stay anywhere near where they are and I think that is the best bet, the  price is not unreasonable.</p><p>You're paying -- For Google, 17 times cash flow.  That's a six percent  return.  Google is growing 20 percent.  You get 3 percent if you invest  with the government for 30 years; 6 percent from Google versus 3 percent  from the government, I'm going to go with Google.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's Facebook trading out right now?</p><p>HAVERTY:  Facebook right now is about 18 times -- running rate casual.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Amazon?</p><p>HAVERTY:  Amazon -- that's another story.  On operating cash flow it's  around 34.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.</p><p>HAVERTY:  But the reality is -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But next year's earning is the a hundred.  There's really  virtually no earnings and with what he's planning to do.  I can see that  there's going to be any earnings any time soon.</p><p>I have a lot of trouble with Amazon -- Maria.  I think it's going to sooner  or later run into the antitrust people.  I don't know when or why or how,  but I've been reading about Rockefeller.  Amazon to me looks an awful lot  like standard oil and Standard Doyle who got broken up into many, many  pieces.  So you think they're going to break it up.</p><p>HAVERTY:  I think they will break up Amazon web services and that other  Amazon businesses; and the other Amazon businesses then will not have any  cash flow to support them (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ways to watch Amazon try to buy Microsoft and then all of a  sudden Washington wakes up.  He said wait a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  No, I think they are on tour right now.  I think  they're on tour right now, you know, even without a big acquisition like  that.  But we will see.  That's a big statement you just made.  You think  Amazon Web services gets broken up.   </p><p>HAVERTY:  I think that it's the fuel for anti-social behavior.  The  parallels to standard oil are pretty strong.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  All right.  We're going to look at that.  Larry -- thank  you.</p><p>HAVERTY:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Larry Haverty joining us from Gabelli. </p><p>Coming up -- the House Judiciary committee has subpoenaed the Justice  Department for records tied to Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server.

Easing fears of a trade war this morning, we've got a big  really underway right now.  Futures indicating big gains at the start of  trading after a new report from the Wall Street journal this morning,  reviles that the US and China have been holding behind the scenes  negotiations to solve trade concerns.</p><p>The talks follow a brutal week for stocks last.  All three major industries  down about six percent on the week as you can see right there, looking at  the global markets this morning, taking a queue from the US's rally.  Most  of the major industries in Europe are higher across the board.  The F2 100  up a half of a percent,(CAX) and Paris up a third of a percent, DAX index  in German up two thirds of a percent.</p><p>And overnight in Asia most agencies we're higher with the exception of  Shanghai Composite in China, Nikkei average in Japan up three quarters of  one percent.  Digging into the DOJ, the House Judiciary Committee  subpoenaed the Department Of Justice for all the documents regarding the  Clinton e-mail scandal and more, the very latest twist in this search for  answers coming up.  </p><p>And Uber puts South East Asia in the rearview mirror.

I'm talking to MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred  about the big changes coming this season both on and off the field.  Yes it  is baseball season once again.</p><p>But first our top story this half hour investigating the investigators,  House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte sent a subpoena to the  Department Of Justice last week as you know.  Demanding all the documents  related to the Clinton e-mail scandal.  The Subpoena also seeks access to  any files on alleged abuses to the foreign intelligence surveillance act,  the FISA Court.  I spoke about that with House Intel Chairman Devin Nunes  yesterday on Sunday morning Futures.  </p><p>DEVIN NUNES, HOUSE INTEL CHAIRMAN:  As we're still looking into FISA abuse  and other matters, we still  have a lot of witnesses to bring in from the  State Department and from the FBI and DOJ.  To try to get to the bottom of,  was there a conspiracy to go after the Trump Campaign?  Did people  purposely obstruct Congresses investigation? We still need to get those  answers that what we continue to look at.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He said if all of the documents requested are not on his desk  and Bob Goodlatte's by the time they get back from their Easter break which  is in two weeks.  He is going to call them in contempt of Congress.   Joining us right now is FOX News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew  Napolitano, Judge good to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANAYLST:  Good Morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is the fall out of contempt of Congress?  What is the fall  out if the Department Of Justice doesn't turn over these documents?   Because we know they've been stonewalled for six months already.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well former Attorney General Eric Holder was personally held  in contempt of Congress and nothing happened.  They didn't prosecute it.   They didn't sue him.  It didn't affect his license to practice law.   Absolutely nothing happened.  So it depends upon how serious they want to  be.  They obviously were not serious with Eric Holder.</p><p>Now a couple of basics, you can't hold the FBI in contempt.  You can hold  the Custodian of Documents, who's refusing to surrender them in contempt.   You can hold the Director of the FBI, who's stonewalling the surrender,  same thing with the DOJ.  So we have a Republican Congress now trying to  examine what a Democratic DOJ, Department Of Justice did in the  investigation of Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Was there a conspiracy to exonerate her no matter what the evidence said?   And those documents and that information is now in the hands of a  Republican DOJ, which is resisting cooperating with a Republican congress.   Why would Republicans in the  Department Of Justice resist cooperating with  Republicans in the House of Representatives about how Democrats in the  Department Of Justice, follow me here, exonerated Mrs. Clinton? </p><p>Because there is an institutional attitude, if we don't defend our  predecessors, who will defend us when someone is examining why we're making  our decisions now? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's not a reason to blow off the law.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Absolutely.  My view is if you have that attitude you don't  belong in the government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:   Because the government's job especially the Department Of  Justice is to find crimes, examine them, and prosecute them.  Not look the  other way.  So I don't know where this is going to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why so many people are calling for a second Special  Counsel, just as Lindsey Graham did yesterday, watch this.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LINDSEY GRAHAM, US SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLIA:  Well I want more  information.  I want to be able to prove that the FBI investigation of the  Clinton e-mail scandal was a sham.  That the lead investigator, the lead  FBI agent hated Trump, supportive of Clinton, they whitewashed the e-mail  scandal.  If you had done what she had done you'd probably be in jail now,  and to hold the FBI accountable for not doing their job correctly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I could not agree more.  I don't agree on calling for a  special counsel.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  But I agree on everything he just said.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't like special counsels.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  No I don't like special counsels for a couple of reasons.  One  they tend to go off course in order to justify their existence.  They've  invited our prosecuting manifest for events that occurred - financial  events as we all know that occurred long before Donald Trump was running.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And which have nothing to do with any collusion?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Correct, correct.  But second, think about this.  Bob Mueller  is the Special Council.  Who works for him?  13 lawyers from the Justice  Department, 2000 --excuse me two dozen, three dozen FBI agents.  So it's  basically the same people in a revolving door.  If you picked the most  perfect special council, if you let Lindsey Graham pick the person he  wanted to be Special Council.  Let Trey Gowdy when he leaves Congress  become Special Council.  </p><p>His prosecutors will come from the DOJ.  His investigators will come from  the FBI.  It's basically the same thing as if the DOJ investigated.  And  then you have this institutional reluctance about people that don't want to  investigate their predecessors.  I think it's a conundrum.  But I do  believe that we need to get to the truth.  The evidence of Mrs. Clinton's  guilt.  Forget about Republican or Democrat.  The evidence of her guilt was  overwhelming.   </p><p>Did they even present it to a Grand Jury?  No.  Did Senior and people in  the DOJ make an evaluation of it?  No.  Jim Comey the day after the Fourth  of July held a press conference that said I've decided that no rational  prosecutor, no reasonable prosecutor would take the case.  There for no  one's going to take the case.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And a statement that was drafted even before they  interview her.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  A statement that was authored in part or vetted  verbally by Peter Strzok, the conflicted FBI agent that we only know is  conflicted.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  One of the reasons --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way no notes.  No notes from that FBI interview.  No  notes from any meetings with Hillary Clinton.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  There we're so many absurdities.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No notes.  Only notes on Donald Trump.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They permitted her former lawyer who was a - herself a target  of the investigation to be there and whisper in her ear to help her answer  their questions.  Something the FBI never permits.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, by the way, I reported it earlier, I'm expecting more  texts to be revealed in the next two weeks something about a White House  meeting between those two, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Can we discuss something -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Talking about a White House meeting.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Can we discuss something happy like baseball?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, it's Opening Day on Thursday.  Thank you so much because  we've got Rob Manfred in the studio coming up.  Judge, good to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much Judge Andrew Napalitano.  It is Opening Day  and we are on it this week on Thursday.  Coming up next Uber exits from  Southeast Asia why the ride handling (ph) company sold its operations to  its main competitor.  Plus a more affordable way to visit the happiest  place on Earth, Disney World's new plans for kids to eat for free.  Next.  </p><p>(COMMERICAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, while the Saudi leadership is in New York  this week, the Crown Prince Saudi Arabia has been the target of a missile  strike from Yemen.  Cheryl Casone with the details.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NEW ANCHOR:  Yes, he's in New York today, by  the way, Maria.  Saudi Arabia says that it has shot down seven ballistic  missiles fired by Yemen's Houthis milita.  Three missiles were aimed at the  Saudi capital of Riyadh.  Officials say the debris from the incoming  missiles killed one man in what was the first death in Riyadh during the  Saudi led three year war in Yemen.  </p><p>Well, Uber is getting our of Southeast Asia.  They've agreed to sell the  business in the region to rival Grab.  Uber is going to take a 27 percent  stake in Grab.  This is the second retreat from Asia for Uber after it sold  its China business also to a local rival there.   Well, Walt Disney is  giving families a way to cut the cost of visiting Disney World for the  summer.</p><p>It's offering free meals to kids between the ages of three and nine when  parents book a Magic Your Way package.  This is between May 28th through  August 30th, so the summer.  There's a few blackout dates and limitations  and families must reserve a package by August 1st.  Share of Walt Disney  are down eight percent so far this year.</p><p>All I know is it was free and Disney in the same sentence so I had to do  the story, Maria.  And those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Cheryl.  Thank you so much.  Coming up, Major League  Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred in the studio here.  I had him Opening  Day.  He'll weigh in on Thursday's big day, big changes coming on and off  the field.  That's next.  </p><p>(COMMERICAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  All right it is that time of the year.   America's favorite pastime back.  Thursday is Opening Day for baseball.   For the first time in 50 years every single MLB team will play on Opening  Day.  All 30 clubs.  It is also the earliest Opening Day in league history.   Kicking off with the Cubs versus the Marlins on Thursday.</p><p>Other must watch games include defending champs the Astros facing off  against the Rangers and the Yankees will take on the Blue Jays in Toronto.   Joining me right now and a first on Fox Business Interview MLB Commissioner  Rob Manfred.  Commissioner, it's great to see you.  </p><p>ROB MANFRED, MLB COMMISSIONER:  Great to see you, too, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  I got to tell you, I've seen  a lot and done a lot of stuff over my career.  The most exciting day of my  life was when I threw out the first pitch at Yankee Stadium.  I mean, it's  incredible.  Baseball really is exciting and what do you think about this  Opening Day with all 30 clubs opening at once?</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, we're thrilled about the idea.  We think getting back to  the tradition of everybody playing on Opening Day is an exciting thing for  the sport. I think it give and opportunity to own Thursday, make opening  day into the national holiday that it should be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can the Astro's do a repeat?</p><p>MANFRED:  Hey, look.  The Astro's are really talented, but there are a lot  of good teams out there, a lot of buzz around the one team here in New  York, the Yankees.  Same thing with the Cubs.  The Dodgers were great last  year, so I think we're going to have a really competitive season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, you've got a competitive season, but also because of all  of these new rule changes, right?  Let's talk about that.  Speeding up the  game is one of them.  You're testing new pace of play rules in the minor  leagues teams.  You'll start with a runner on second base if the game goes  into extra innings. Does this expand to the major leagues, and tell me  about the rule changes and the impact.</p><p>MANFRED:  Well the rule changes in the major leagues this year are really  speeding up inning breaks.  There's a clock.  Batters have to be ready to  go at 2:05.  That should save us about 25 seconds on every inning break,  which adds up to be a lot of time.  We're limiting mound visits, six per  game.  The idea there is to take dead time out of the game.  We're trying  to proceed slowly at the major league level.</p><p>We've been more aggressive in the minor leagues.  We have pitch clocks.   We've had them for a number of years.  We feel like they're successful.   Those could come to the major leagues.  The extra inning rule, I don't see  that at the major league level.  Some people really like it.  It does make  for excitement, but I think breaking the tradition of the extra inning game  at the big league level is not likely to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the whole idea of speeding up the game and pacing  differently, is that to make sure that it doesn't impact engagement, get  the engagement (inaudible) because we've watched what has happened at the  NFL.  The NFL has been seeing a drop in viewership over the last couple of  years.  Are you watching this?  What are doing in terms of game viewership  and is that part of it?</p><p>MANFRED:  Oh, it's a huge issue.  In the ballpark, pace of game is not a  big issue because during the breaks there's a lot going on, there's  entertainment.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>MANFRED:  . there's things to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's when you're at home watching.</p><p>MANFRED:  Home, and every one of those breaks is an opportunity to tune  away.  We pay a lot of attention to what's going on in other sports.  We've  been fortunate, however.  Our last two World Series have been really  successful in terms of our ratings.  And during the summer in 25 markets on  game days, we're the number one programming on television, so we've been.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still?</p><p>MANFRED:  . very fortunate in that regard.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.</p><p>MANFRED:  Yes, it's - look, in the summer time, people remember that  baseball is a national pastime and they tune into their local team.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's a good point.  So a lot of big moves there.  The  big Yankees move, obviously, the off season.  Tell me about that because  you've got the Yankees acquiring arguably the two best sluggers, right,  Judge and Stanton.  How were they able to pull off that trade?</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, it was, I think, one of those things where the Marlins felt  that, with their new ownership, they wanted to go down a slightly different  path.  The Yankees were there as willing buyers on what's a very large  contract, but it's exciting in New York.  The two players together last  year hit 111 home runs.  I think it's only four short of what Mantle and  Maris did in their historic season, so a lot of buzz around that team this  year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I'm glad you mentioned the Marlins because you've got the  former shortstop, Derek Jeter, now owning the Marlins or part of the  Marlins.  What does that do for the game?  Are former players becoming  office executives good for the sport?  What's the impact?</p><p>MANFRED:  Oh, I think it's great for the sport.  I'll tell you, it's  difficult at the beginning, you take over a team, you haven't been an owner  before, it's obviously difficult to get your footing, but I was down and  saw an Marlins spring training game recently, talked to a bunch of people  in the organization.  Derek's done a phenomenal job.  The organization is  very positive.  They've got a lot of great, young talent that they brought  back in these trades, and I have every, every expectation that Derek's  going to be really successful.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I would imagine when somebody who knows the games, knows  the tricks, just knows how to get around the field as an owner, it could be  real positive.</p><p>MANFRED:  Look, I think it's a huge positive to have former players,  particularly a player of Derek's stature, involved on the ownership side of  the game.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the new tax law because we were talking  about this earlier.  The new tax law seems to be throwing some of the  players and owners a curve ball, if you will.  It could make it so that  clubs face higher capital gains taxes for trading highly paid players.   This is something that I didn't think about initially when we were looking  at the tax plan, but how does this impact the teams and the players?</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, it could really be an impediment to trades taking place.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>MANFRED:  . particularly trades that happened quickly because of the  requirement evaluation.  We think it was a mistake, that it really was not  intended to apply to trades of baseball players, and we're hopeful that  when things get clarified in the technical corrections that we'll deal with  that issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, because it's not - I mean, you don't think of a trade of a  player being the same as capital gains trading stocks.</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, if you think about the economics of it, right, I'm trading  you something in return for something else.  There's a very good argument  that they should be treated of equal value, otherwise somebody's not acting  rationally, which I don't think is the case with most of our clubs.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you been in touch with lawmakers on this issue?</p><p>MANFRED:  We have.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MANFRED:  We have.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they're looking at it.  They're aware that maybe there were  unintended consequences.</p><p>MANFRED:  Yes, there's a large list of things.  Obviously, we have a couple  of issues in the tax bill that we have been in touch with lawmakers about  and hope they get clarified.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rob, the league is working to finalize a two-game series  between the Yankees and the Red Sox at London's Olympic Stadium.  Let's  talk about that.  This would be the American baseball's first regular  season games in Europe.  Pretty exciting stuff.</p><p>MANFRED:  Very exciting for us.  We feel that Europe's a frontier that we  need to get to.  We want to get there with our very best.  We think a  Yankee-Red Sox series will be very exciting and give us a foothold in  Europe.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about the streaming deals?  This is an important piece of  business right now for the league.  You've got streaming deals with  Twitter, ESPN, Intel, YouTube, Facebook Watch also stepping up to the plate  with a deal with the league.  The exclusive stream, 25 games.  Tell us  about this.</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, being on the cutting edge of technology has been really  good for our business on the development of Bantech (ph), the sale of that  asset to Disney, and we feel that these streaming deals are really  important in terms of capturing the next generation of fans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have to because that's where a lot of people watch the  game, on their phone.</p><p>MANFRED:  Absolutely.  Look, the next generation wants to see their  favorite sport, and we hope it's baseball, on a variety of different  platforms, and our strategy has been to make the game available on those  platforms.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but you said it earlier, you see more people in the stands  that before, right?  Are you having a hard time getting people in their  seats because they're watching it on streaming?</p><p>MANFRED:  Well, it's amazing.  We had 114 million people went to see  baseball live last year, minor league and major league baseball.  That's a  phenomenal number for us.  Our ballpark experience is a little different  than our broadcast experience.  There's a certain commradery to it.   There's all the entertainment that goes on in the ballpark, and fortunately  our attendance has remained really stable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And lots of giveaways when you're in the field.</p><p>MANFRED:  That's right.  Those promotional nights are very popular with our  fans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rob, it's great to see you.  Thanks so much.</p><p>MANFRED:  It's great to see you, too, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good luck with opening day.  We will be watching.</p><p>MANFRED:  All right, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  MLB Commissioner, Rob Manfred, there.  We'll be right back.

And joining me to talk all  about it, Fox Business Networks, Dagen McDowell.  PWC Partner, Mitch  Roschelle.  And Pollster and the President of Maslasnky Partners, Lee  Carter is here.  Lee, Great to see you.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLASNKY + PARTNERS:  Great to see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning everybody.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy Monday.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Happy Monday, Trump  supporters are angry about him signing that spending bill.  So, we're going  to spend the next week and the next year and the next almost three years  trying to explain why he signed it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lindsey Graham had a lot of good comments on this, this  weekend.  And let me tell you, he made a really important point which you  make over and over again.  We're not in debt because of domestic spending.   We are in debt because the entitlements and the growth of things like  Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.  So, until we get some real  feasible program or a proposal to actually rein this programs in, as if,  there's no sign that these changes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  People talk including the President about the importance of  increasing military spending.  But with -- in less than 10 years, I was e- mailing with Douglas Holtz Eakin about this on Friday.  In less than 10  years our interest on the existing national debt is going to top what we  spend every year on our defense and on our military.  That's shocking.   It's not getting better.  It's getting worse.  It's got to stop.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why he say, he'll never sign one of these things  again.  Just like this, he did sign (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>CARTER:  Listen, I think that the American people when I'm out there  talking to them, they're going to be glad that he signed it, overall.   Because now they want deals to get done.  They don't want this to be kick  down the road.  And I think the President's coming out and saying something  really strong saying, I'm not going to sign it again.  So, you can start  negotiating on things now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That, will you sign something that funds plan parenthood that  doesn't cut it, that doesn't fully funds the border wall, that doesn't put  any strings on sanctuary cities in terms of the money.  There's a lot in  there to hate and people are angry.  </p><p>CARTER:  So, mark my words, people are going to blame Congress for this.   Not the President.  They're going to blame them for not getting something  better done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're probably right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And Peter Strzok some of the blame on Congress too, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He sure did.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, his -- certainly his supporters on Twitter has something  different to say about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, look, we got a big rally underway right now.  The markets  are reacting to something different and that is apparently behind-the- scenes negotiations between China and the U.S. on trade.  Check out this  market here at 300 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Up a 100  points on the NASDAQ.  Quite the different scenario that we saw last week.   Coming up during the conversation this morning North Carolina, Congressman  Mark Walker is with us.  The cofounder and CEO of Handy, Oisin Hanrahan, is  here and Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano along  with former U.S. Ambassador to China, Gary Locke will weigh in as well.   So, don't miss the moments.  We got a big three hours coming up.  </p><p>And we kick it off right here with this, the Trump administration  reportedly seeking a trade solution with China following the threat of  hefty tariffs on imports last week.  According to The Journal this morning,  the Trump administration is requesting a reduction of Chinese tariffs on  American vehicles.  Additional Chinese purchases of U.S. semi-conductors  and better access to China's mainland markets.  House Intelligence  Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham  both weighed in on China's actions on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" with me  yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:   Well, China is a big problem.  We actually are running an investigation on  many aspects of China at the House Intelligence Committee.  And I think,  most Americans know that China is in fact stealing our intellectual  property.  They're spreading globally.  They continue to manipulate  currencies, so, China has to be taken on.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  The aluminum steel tariffs, I  think, were too broad.  The dumper is China, it's not -- it's not Canada,  it's not Mexico, it's not Europe.  The idea that President Trump is going  to hold China accountable for dumping, for currency manipulation and  intellectual property pit is long overdue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and that's what people are agreeing with.  Futures  pointing to a big rally on Wall Street today over the concerns easing over  a potential trade war.  Joining us right now, to talk more about market as  the President and chief investment also for Portfolio Wealth Advisors, Lee  Munson.  Lee, good to see you.  </p><p>LEE MUNSON, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT, PORTFOLIO WEALTH ADVISORS:  You  too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on this market here?  Big rally this morning  that's for sure.</p><p>MUNSON:  I mean, I knew, the gig was up on Friday when we closed seven  points above those lows early in February.  So, I knew that we had a rally  here.  You now, I think, if you look at Century Aluminum, that's the tell  of this market right now.  You saw how they punched that stock last week  because everybody in Wall Street knows this this is all bark, no bite.  I  think, we're going to see a lot more talk about these tariffs, but I would  have investors avoid any trade that have to do with the tariff plaque.   Because I don't think it's going to be what people think.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you still like socks here?</p><p>MUNSON:  I do.  I think, you commit money right here, I think, this is your  second chance to get the low of February.  I went in there, about the  Thursday or Friday after that flash crash of February 5th.  I did my buying  -- I'm done buying for the year unless I see this market go down to 2500 on  the S&amp;P.  I think, this is the your only second or third chance you're  going to have for the year.  I would commit money the big long with the  stocks, I keep it smaller and nothing that has to do with the tariff.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Is there any specific sector, Lee, that is more interesting for  you for the balance of the year, recognizing that we're going to have more  volatility this year than we'd have in the -- since the president was  elected?</p><p>MUNSON:  Right, well, I would probably want to focus a little bit more on  old economy stocks if I want to look at the smaller capitalization stocks.   I would not be looking at tech right now.  Hey, you know, this reminds me a  lot of .com with the Facebook and the Googles.  You now, people are talking  about standard commerce and standard social and standard search meaning,  Amazon, Google, Facebook those type of things.  It's just, I don't want to  -- you know, this reminds me buying Cisco at the peak back in 2000.  It  reminds me of buying (INAUDIBLE), it reminds me of those Yahoo's.  So, I  think, you've got to stay away from the tech sectors.  Because, really,  every time we had these tariff problems, small caps pop up and it's the  large caps that are punished because that's where all that hot money is.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But do you expect -- I think, what's interesting about  particularly what happened in the market last week is how much the markets  seem to be driven by headlines at the Washington D.C. and the volatility  that those create and when you have different people saying different  things who work in the White House, it really has, you could -- because a  lot of times people talk about it and you don't see it show up in the stock  market.  How is this different?  And is this going to be a problem for the  rest of the year?</p><p>MUNSON:  Problem, this is like -- this is a gift from the Gods.  I never  had something so immaterial as what happens at the White House affecting  markets.  I mean, this is what's giving this volatility.  Remember last  year?  I can get Trump to say anything to move a market.  And now, anything  that comes out of there were getting mark of volatility.  So, I think, the  investors need to look at this as a gift that's bringing down prices for  you to commit capital.  I don't want to see a redo of last year, were,  where I'm going to put my money?  It's just goes up every day with no, you  know, just unrelenting.</p><p>CARTER:  You know, one of the things that I think that's so interesting is  the markets seem to react so much to the President on the downside.  We see  this lately and there's this the new hysteria, I think in some ways.  But  when it starts to correct, we're not seen as much, you know, as much as the  positive side of things.  So, right now we're looking at things getting  better.  Does that mean that people aren't concerned about what's happening  with China, that things are going to get better, that maybe that the Trump  move was a smart one?</p><p>MUNSON:  Well, I think people are starting to realize, again, Century  Aluminum was the tell last week that shows us that if you're -- if you  really think the tariffs are going to be a problem, why is that stock  selling off?  Look at those steel companies.  I think, everybody knows that  Trump wants to negotiate.  I mean, look who we hired to replace Gary, you  know, Kudlow.  I mean, that guy is like a peers supply sider.  So, I think,  that when people have to realize, newsflash market goes down.  The only  thing that makes that market go up is slow and steady progress on profits,  corporate earnings.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you're still positive on earnings?</p><p>MUNSON:  I do think, I don't agree earnings --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>MUNSON:  I don't think we're going to have earnings profit problems for the  rest of the year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Well we're expecting 18 percent growth.  So, you're  expecting that.  The Federal Reserve is unwinding its balance sheet $4.5  trillion.  We see that the Fed had started to raise interest rates.  Any  worries there?</p><p>MUNSON:  Not particularly.  Because I don't see an (INAUDIBLE), I mean we  still have long rates, you know, more or less above the short rate.  I  think, the market has already come in to the reality that we're going to  get fewer for rate cuts, but you know, when you read into the notes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rate hikes.</p><p>MUNSON:  Rate hikes, I'm sorry.  You know, hope springs eternal, right? </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we're talking about John Williams, President of the San  Francisco Fed taking over the New York Fed.</p><p>MUNSON:  Total status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>MUNSON:  Yes, total status quo.  So, I think, if that guy takes over, we're  not going to see anything shocking.  And by the way, when you look through  the notes, you know, most of the people on the Fed government -- on the  board are looking out less cuts, less hikes than those the wonder rates. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right we'll leave it there.  Lee, great to see you.  </p><p>MUNSON:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Lee Munson, joining us.  Coming up, we'll  take a break.  And then, two police officers are recovering this morning  after shooting in Austin, Texas late last night.  The investigation  underway.  We will have the very latest.  Facebook fallout continues as Mark Zuckerberg continues his apology tour.   The company is denying disturbing new reports that it tracks calls and text  of millions of people for years without permission.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, a police officer shot and injured enough in  Austin, Texas.  Cheryl Casone with the story this morning, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right, Maria. One  Austin officer was shot in the arm by gunmen.  Another officer injured  while responding to a 911 call last night.  Police shot and killed the  suspect as he tried to flee that scene.  Authorities say the injured  officers are both in stable condition at the hospital this morning.  </p><p>Well, SoftBank has started an investigation to find out who is behind the  smear campaign against two of its top executives.  Also, general reports  the plot was intended to oust the executives and involves sending letters  to shareholders, leaking personal financial information to the media and  filing a complaint with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission.  Company  says the campaign was based on false allegations and a board member has now  called at sabotage.  </p><p>Well, Ford and Alibaba launching a new way for consumers in China to buy or  testing a car.  You now can pick the model you want by using an app on your  smartphone and then you go to a vending machine for cars.  Customers can  choose from dozens of four vehicles, it was then called the Super Test- Drive Center that the (INAUDIBLE) created following a partnership announced  by Ford and Alibaba two years ago.  We actually did the story at that time. </p><p>And then, there is the -- Black Panther finally got unseated as the top  film at the Box office by this:</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JOHN BOYEGA, ACTOR:  There are pilots we remember as legends, but they  didn't start out that way.  They started out like us.  This is our time to  make a difference.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  Pacific Rim Uprising, raking in $28 million in its opening weekend  and in its sixth weekend.  Black Panther took the number two spot, now  number two 17 million abroad and over the weekend.  The Marvel movie has  brought in $630 million so far, making it the fifth highest grossing movie  ever and those are just the U.S. numbers.  It's over a billion worldwide.  </p><p>Now, the faith-based, I Can Only Imagine came in at number three.  Rounding  out the top five, the animated comedy Sherlock Gnomes and Tomb Raider,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, thank you so much, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  You got it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A vending machine to buy a car.  Would you do it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I thought.  I don't think I would ever.  It gives  me no information.  I wanted information on safety, I wanted information on  quality. It's a vending machine we're talking about.</p><p>CARTER:  And you want to drive it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that, too.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  That's the weird show room, you just stick your credit card in  and a car drops out?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Machines and more machines, guys.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Or although, I would prefer talking to a machine than the phone  representative from Sprint who I had to talk to over the weekend.  Who  literally -- and this is -- this was a call center that clearly was not in  the United States, but you can't have someone answering calls from  Americans if they literally don't speak English and don't even understand  the syntax of the answers they're reading from a -- from an answer log.  It  was disastrous.  I got a little survey from Sprint saying, would you refer  Sprint service to anyone based on your call?  Zero, never.  I got a zero.   And I'm canceling my -- I'm cancelling my account as soon as it is -- as  possible.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh my God.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was that bad.  They've been a basically -- long story short,  couldn't answer a basic question about why there is a suspicious charge on  my account.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, machines are not always reliable.  But that's why it's so  much -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  More reliable than the humans employed by Sprint. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will take a break.  When we come back, what will Jeff  Sessions do?  Calls by GOP leaders are getting louder for the Attorney  General to appoint a second special counsel.  To prove abuses by the FBI  and the Department of Justice.  We're on that next.</p><p>And then, we are looking at a rally in Wall Street this morning.  Concerns  over a trade war with China are fading as the two countries have been  negotiating behind the scenes.  The Dow Industrials set to open up, almost  300 points.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GRAHAM:  I want to be able to prove that the FBI investigation of the  Clinton email scandal was a sham.  That the lead investigator, the lead FBI  agent, hated Trump, supportive of Clinton.  They whitewashed the e-mail  scandal.  If you had done what she had done you'd probably be in jail now,  and to hold the FBI accountable for not doing their job correctly.  That  Comey, I think the fix was in.  And when it comes to the dossier that was  used by the Department of Justice to get a warrant against Carter Page, it  was prepared by paid informant of the Democratic Party, a foreign agent  with ties to Russia.  It is completely unverified, and it should never have  been used as the basis for a FISA warrant and I want a special counsel to  look at all of this like Mueller's looking at Trump.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was South Carolina, Senator Lindsey Graham with me  yesterday.  Making his case for the second special counsel to probe that  bias at the top of the FBI.  Joining us now to weigh in, is the editor-in- chief of The Daily Caller, Christopher Bedford.  Christopher, good to see  you.  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE DAILY CALLER:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think Jeff Sessions says here?  Now, I understand  that I was told this weekend that there will be more text coming out this  weekend and the next week and they could have to do with some meeting at  the White House.  Is that going to be -- </p><p>BEDFORD:  There's so much --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you know what I'm talking about, Christopher?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  I do.  There's so much primary evidence that we haven't seen.   We've been going off of reports on reports on dossiers, on congressional  memos.  We've barely been able to scratch the surface of this primary  evidence.  And Jeff Sessions is not going to be able to scratch the surface  of any evidence he has available using simply an I.G.  Because we've talked  about on the show before, and I.G. can only talk to people who are  currently employed.  Comey, plays a huge part in this.  McCabe who's now  gone plays a big part.  People like Steele who probably won't want to talk  anyways, played massive parts in this investigation and you need to have a  men about special investigator come on to go after any of these people. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you think this additional text that will be made public  shortly will be (INAUDIBLE) the straw that breaks the camel's back in terms  of Jeff Sessions saying, yes, we need that second special counsel.  What's  it going to take for Sessions to move on this?  We're hearing these calls  get louder.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Sessions is probably one of the most careful people in the Trump  administration.  He's very calculating, he's very serious and he doesn't  move when it's not proper.  He waits for his own FBI to recommend firing  McCabe before he does it.  And he takes his time before he puts up together  a special counsel, does it by the book.  Some people got annoyed and say  that takes too long.  I'm not sure what's in this text yet.  So, I don't  know if that's going to push him, but I assume he knows just like any  prosecutor knows that if he wants to get to the bottom of this he's going  to needs to bring it in and a special investigator probably be named in the  next few weeks.</p><p>CARTER:  Yes, one of the things that I'm really curious about is on the  left there's so many arguments right now that all of this is an effort to  undermine our government, undermine institutions that keep us safe.  And  yet there's this evidence and all of this leaks that are coming out that  are making us question it, how we overcome the fact people are saying,  look, we've got to stop this because they're undermining the CIA, the FBI,  all of the, you know, Justice Department and yet this is something that  needs to be done.</p><p>BEDFORD:  It's so funny to see the Democratic Party become the party of  defending the FBI.  I mean, remember though the controversy two years ago  when a democratic Congressman wanted to paint -- hang a painting of police  officers with pigs on their heads, pig heads, in the U.S. Capitol.  That  was where they were just a few years ago.  Now they're the defenders of the  FBI.  The FBI's got a lot of great people, a lot of strong agents.  But  there are people at the top of it which we've seen are corrupt.  People who  are lacking candor.  And if you've read McCabe's op-ed this weekend in The  Washington Post which he tries to blame his firing on Donald Trump.  And  talking about his long-deserved retirement at 49, which he knew he was  doing early because he was in so much trouble for lacking candor.  They're  trying to push this on Donald Trump and make it not about them and someone  needs to look at them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And yes he has this op-ed in the Washington Post and he writes  this, I did not knowingly mislead or lied to investigators.  At worst, I  was not clear in my responses, and because of what was going on around me  may well have been confused and distracted and for that I take full  responsibility.  But that is not a lack of candor.  And under no  circumstances could it ever serve as the basis for the very public and  extended humiliation of my family and me that the administration, and the  president personally, have engaged in over the past year.  So, what was  going on around him?  He was covering for Hillary Clinton and enforcing an  investigation in to Donald Trump which had no merit.  I mean, what was  going on around him?  He was directing everything.</p><p>BEDFORD:  He is allowed to defend himself just like General Flynn is  allowed to say you know, I was confused when he's accused of the exact same  lack of candor that McCabe is.  But what McCabe is not allowed to do is  pretend that he didn't play politics.  He got involved at the head of the  FBI, he made decisions that field agent for questioning and now the  Congressional investigators are questioning and separating investigations  on his wife taken hundreds of thousands of dollars from a top Democrat for  a state race.  Very sketchy things and as a friend of mine who's a former  agent said, look, bottom line is he play politics and he lost.  And now,  he's going have to deal with that.  And it wasn't Donald Trump like he  says, the President who fired him.  It was Attorney General Jeff Sessions  by the book guide acting on the advice of the FBI itself to fire him.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, the Office of the Professional Responsibility.  So, what  do you think the stake is for these guys?  When you look at Andrew McCabe,  James Comey, Bruce Ohr, number three guy, the Department of Justice, Peter  Stzrok and Lisa Page, who he was texting with. What happens to these people  -- this people at the top of the FBI and the DOJ?  Will we see justice for  what looks like a massive abuse of power?</p><p>BEDFORD:  Well, James Comey seems to have morphed into some kind of  mindless platitude generating Twitter thing.  I mean, I get it by  notifications from him.  And it's like a cheesy motivational poster of him  staring at the sunset.  And his thing writing of -- he's going to write a  book that we're all going to talk about but no one's actually going buy or  read unless they're going to send to them by the publisher.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, let's be clear, this is the top of the bestseller list,  right now, isn't it?</p><p>BEDFORD:  It will do fine, it's a good time to release a book.  But it's  not going to do as well as of course, any of these political books do.  We  talk about them more than they sell.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hey, you know, Christopher, we haven't spoken about Clapper and  Brennan?  I mean, I don't know what their faith will be, but --</p><p>BEDFORD:  Oh my gosh.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- they're pushing back.  But obviously they were right in it  with the bias.</p><p>BEDFORD:  And they put out a lot of statements -- they put out statement  for Brennan specifically putting out statement before Congress in relation  to the dossier that now appear to potentially to be false.  And the idea --  I've heard people wondering about this since the very beginning with the  dossier and how it's handled if it was submitted to the president so that  it could be leaked to the press and then become a big public saying, a lot  of people here are dirty but the chances that any of them go to prison or  any of them are disliked by Democrats after this is all over is very low. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll see.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I mean, McCabe basically admitted in the op-ed on the Washington  Post over the weekend, yes I leaked, but I was authorized to and then he  admitted that he didn't tell the whole truth.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He was distracted around him.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He was interviewed by the investigators.  And by the way, most  people -- he's lucky he's not going to prison for that.  Most people -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we're arguing over his pension.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- it's a felony and he still gets to keep his pension despite  the narrative that you hear from some members of the media. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Pensions are not going anywhere, let's face it.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, it's -- it has to do what (INAUDIBLE) he might've gotten an  extra special bonus that maybe they can take away his health care for life  and we all love health care for life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, but for the most part he's going that pension,  Christopher so, </p><p>BEDFORD:  You're right and General Flynn would be very -- General Flynn  would be very envious of how McCabe is being treated for doing the exact  same thing that Flynn is facing years in prison for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, let's not forget that just the idea of revealing the fact  that Flynn had the phone call with the Russian ambassador, that was a  felony.  So, let's see if that's ever taken up as well by Jeff Sessions.   Christopher, good to see you sir.   </p><p>BEDFORD:  Have a good one.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Christopher Bedford, Daily Caller there.  </p><p>Coming up, Apple Chief, Tim Cook weighing in on the Facebook fiasco.  He's  calling for more regulation for the industry.  More details coming up  there.  </p><p>And then ask and you shall receive, pray.com, bringing together faith and  technology.  Investors are believing, and that the company's CEO will be  here, next.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  Happy Monday, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, March  26th, your top stories right now 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Easing fears of a trade war now, Futures are reporting to a huge rally at  the start of trading, after a new report in the Journal this morning, is  revealing that the U.S. and China have been holding behind the scenes  negotiations to solve the trade concerns.  As a result, the market shot up  260 points on the Dow, the talk follow a brutal week, of course.  </p><p>The stock prices last week, all three major indices fell, just gave out six  percent on the week.  Global markets this morning, mixed, take a look at  European indices right now, and we do see some gains on the heels of the  big rally on Wall Street that we are expecting.  </p><p>The FT-100, up a third of a percent, 21 points higher, CAC Quarante, up a  quarter of a percent, 15 points higher, and the DAX Index, up one half of  one percent, 62 points higher.  In Asia overnight, stocks were mostly  higher, with the exception of China, Nikkei Average in Japan and the Hang  Seng in Hong Kong, up three-quarters of one percent.  </p><p>Working to remake friends, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, taking out a full- page ad in newspapers across the globe to apologize for the company's  Cambridge Analytica Scandal.  The move, coming amid growing calls for him  to testify before Congress.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK WARNER (D-VA), SENATOR OF THE UNITED STATES:  He needs to come  and testify before Congress, not just put an advertisement in newspaper.   He said he would if he was the right guy, he is the right guy.  He needs to  come, testify before Congress and explain how they are going to work with  us to both protect privacy to 50 million Facebook accounts that were used  by this sketchy firm Cambridge Analytica, and how we're going to make sure  it doesn't happen again in terms of weaponization of the social  media  platforms.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The very latest fallout for Facebook is, Apple CEO Tim Cook,  who's joining the push for new privacy regulations in the wake of the  scandal.  And then Wal-Mart, getting handy, the retail giant teams up with  a home services provider to take on the new kind of competition from  Amazon.  I'll talk with the company behind the new partnership as online  retail wars continue to heat up, Amazon up two and a quarter percent right  now.</p><p>Meanwhile, click here to pray, interfaith social network app, Pray.com,  giving faith communities a place to chat, virtually pray, and set up  charities.  Religious leaders are also privy to in-app analytics, to gauge  how many parishioners they reached through pray.com.  Joining us right now  is Pray.com Co-Founder and CEO, Steve Gatena.  Steve, good to see you,  thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>STEVE GATENA, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, PRAY.COM:  Thanks for having me on,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What a great idea.  Pray.com was initially created to give  worshipers an alternative to Facebook, right?</p><p>GATENA:  That's exactly right.  We're very excited to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Explain the company and how -- yes.</p><p>GATENA:  Yes.  So we are -- so we connect people around prayer and action.   We give churches a private social network so that they can connect with  their parishioners and take actions on the causes that they care about.</p><p>CARTER:  You know, I think it's a fascinating time to be in there when  there are so many attacks on thoughts and prayers right now.  When you are  seeing a -- are you seeing a lot more activity?  What's the -- how's your  business going?</p><p>GATENA:  We are, yes.  It's phenomenal.  We've been blessed with some  incredible investors who recently gave us $14 million for a series A round,  and we've got thousands of faith organizations all over the country using  the platform to connect over small groups and connect over mission groups  and every time there's any kind of major event around the country.  We see  peek prayers happen and it's been an incredible experience, really,  building out Pray.com.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Morning, Steve, Mitch Roschelle, how do you monetize the  interaction amongst the congregates, I guess, on Pray.com?</p><p>GATENA:  Yes.  So, we are not an ad-driven business, and we're not building  an advertising-driven model where we sell our consumers data to other  advertisers.  We are actually a transaction-driven business, so right now,  we offer the ability to make a donation to a 501(c)(3) of your choice, and  over time, we will build out a premium content market place, where you can  download audio books, music and other types of digital media.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You know, Facebook has apologized for that data breach  which, of course, rocked the technology sector.  They are running full-page  newspaper ads today, apologizing.  Your take when you see what's gone on  with all of the abuses around people's data and information?</p><p>GATENA:  Yes.  So, we take data, very seriously, at Pray.com, you know, as  I said before, we're not an ad-driven business and I couldn't imagine the  challenges that Mark and Facebook have to deal with and we continuously  pray for them on a weekly basis.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but you have access to everybody's data.  The real  question is what are you doing with it?</p><p>GATENA:  So, Maria, we actually do not collect the type of data that  Facebook collects on their users, we don't even ask our users to self- identify with a faith.  We just simply give our members the opportunity to  connect with an organization that they care about, create a cause and we  keep their data private and secure.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Steve, it's Dagen McDowell, but, are you a for-profit company?</p><p>GATENA:  We are a for-profit company.  At the moment, we do --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was just going to ask you, does that conflict, do you think,  with the way that some people would view their faith and company making  money off of their faith and worship online, if you will?</p><p>GATENA:  So, we do not charge people to pray.  We do not charge people to  use a platform.  The platform is completely free and our business model is  to build out a premium content marketplace over time that can allow people  to buy the types of digital media products that they currently buy from  desperate sources such as bookstores and other websites.</p><p>CARTER:  So Steve, you say you don't collect people's data, but do you know  what the most, you know, common things that people are asking for prayer  about right now are?</p><p>GATENA:  Yes.  On our platform, we've seen people ask for prayer for  illness.  We have a lot of cancer recovery groups.  We see a lot of people  ask for a prayer around causes like gun violence, people who have  experienced and been victims to gun violence.  We see a lot of people  asking for prayer to end human trafficking and we see a lot of groups being  created that allow people to take action, not just prayer, and we believe  in the power of prayer, but also to mobilize action and gather volunteers  to act on the causes that they really care about most.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there, Happy Holidays, Steve,  thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>GATENA:  Happy Holidays.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Steve Gatena, Happy Easter, there.  Coming up, retail wars  heating up, how the Startuphandy.com is teaming up with Wal-Mart, to hammer  away at Amazon.  And then Facebook, still feeling the heat this week, Mark  Zuckerberg continues his apology tour.  Now, he faces fury over new report,  the social network collected calls and text data from millions of people,  wait till you hear this, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  OK, new fallout for Facebook, the social media  giant taking out a full-page apology ad in major newspapers while calling  for regulation, that continues to mount, a lot of people are calling for  regulation.  Lauren Simonetti with the details now, and Lauren, he said it  in the interview last week, I think we should be more regulated.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  A lot of people are saying  that this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Including Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Including Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple and the CEO of IBM,  they're a t a conference in Beijing, and they said, look, change is needed.   I have so much to get to with you guys, today.  First, we'll tale about  this ad, nine major newspapers, have the Mark Zuckerberg apology,  basically.  This is his damage control and he is saying, we are sorry for  the breach of trust referencing Cambridge Analytica, and was using 50  million users' personal information.  </p><p>Going forward, as Zuckerberg says, we're going to limit the data that apps  get, and investigate all of these apps that get this large amount of data,  is damage control working?  Well, if you take a look at Facebook stock,  last week, $75 billion in market cap, wiped out.  This morning, it's doing  a little bit better but the broader market is up, as well.  So I think you  can argue the fallout continues this week even though that chart is looking  pretty good.  </p><p>There's another story that we saw over the weekend, it's Ars Technica  report saying that Facebook stored for android users, their call and their  text message logs.  Facebook denies that, but they did say something which  was interesting to me.  They said, well, we only had it when you, the  users, gave us your permission.  So, the onus is constantly on the user,  with all of these stories.  And, again, as we talk about regulation, there  are calls from many lawmakers for more practical regulation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WARNER:  All of these social media form companies have said they have no  responsibility for any of the content.  I think we have to relook at that.   I think in many ways for media companies.  I think we have to relook at the  fact that if you move one company to another, maybe you should be able to  move all your data.  I do want to out-regulate these companies into  oblivion, but I do think people need to have the ability to know where the  information they are receiving is honest, truthful or at least, originates  in this country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  And all this affects Facebook's bottom line, because the  advertisers are now questioning how they and how much they should  advertise, not only on Facebook, but on many of the social media companies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There should be some rules in terms of understanding where your  data goes, have some transparency in terms of understand who has access to  your data, I mean, that at a minimum.  But I don't know if you can  regulate.  Everything moves so fast.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They could make -- they could make all of this; if your data is  going to be used to make money, it could be an opt-in not an opt-out issue.   Meaning, that any time they're going to make money off of your information,  they have to ask for direct permission to do so rather than basically with  the apps, even since the changes in 2015, you still have to physically go - - it's not under your privacy settings, it is under app settings.  And I  just want to point something out that Facebook has misused people's data  and screwed up over and over and again, it's not Cambridge Analytica.  Now,  all of the sudden, the left and the liberals -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, Trump might be involved.  So, then. it's a different  story.  It was different than when Barack Obama used all the data and mine  all the data to get election voters eight years ago.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It started in 2007, roughly 2010, using Facebook data to build  databases of personal user information then selling the data to political  advertisers, even transmitting I.D. numbers.  2011, social media start up  cloud-created profiles for minors without their knowledge.  And Facebook  over and over again has told these people who they're making money off of,  not the individuals but the companies, cut it out.  I mean, I do that over  and over again, but they don't do anything.  Again, there were -- Russians  were infiltrating the social network; they were manipulating people's news.   They watch Facebook live and were allowing people to murder others and kill  themselves on live video.  Time and again, you know what, they've got  enough passes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's so many abuses.  Remember during the election when you  would Google Hillary Clinton?  It was -- you would get stories Hillary  Clinton is great, everything is great.  Then you would Google and it's  like, Donald Trump investigation, Donald Trump is horrible, evil, even did  that on the search level for Google.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Google owns YouTube, and Proctor &amp; Gamble already told  Google because they were literally running Proctor &amp; Gamble ads doing  terrorist content.  It was, like, violent --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Murders.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- murders.  They were running Proctor &amp; Gamble ads.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  And if the advertisers step back in any way, this will affect  the company's bottom line.  But you are raising two key questions:  systematic mismanagement at Facebook, right, and can Facebook police its  size at this point and if it can, at what cost?  You need to hire more  people to look through everything.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How idiotic it is for them to take out ads and actual real paper  newspapers to apologize -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why not do it on Facebook?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- two billion users who don't read most of these publications.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The apology must be online as well.  But you're right, I mean,  why is Facebook taking ads out.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  But it's not the digital version of those publication.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I hope so.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  This is The Wall Street Journal.  I haven't seen -- I also  haven't looked forward it to be fair.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He wrote a Facebook post, I mean, obviously.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  But did you read the journal digitally, you don't see the ad?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, true.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And somebody needs to train media train him to say I'm sorry and  actually look like you're sorry, can you teach that?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, pivotal research -- suspending fish management, we'll see  if anything happens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll watch that.  Lauren, thank you.  Lauren  Simonetti there.  Coming up, virtual handyman service, Handy, inking a dead  with Wal-Mart.  Why this pairing may hit the nail on the head in the battle  against Amazon, back in a minute.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, TENNIS CHANNEL PRESENTER:  Welcome back to another Tennis  Channel COURT REPORT, a special presentation for Fox Business, I'm Dani  Klupenger.  Venus Williams first listed the trophy at the Miami Open 20  years ago.  Sunday, she needed all of her experience to reach the round of  16.  </p><p>The three-time champion saved three match point against (INAUDIBLE) report,  eventually closing out the win 7-5 in the decider, after almost three hours  on court.  Venus, moving on to phase to defending champion, Johanna Konta  for a spot in the elite eight.  </p><p>On the men's side, the winner at Indian Wells, Juan Martinez, continued his  quest for back to back tour titles in style as he dispatched (INAUDIBLE) in  straight sets.  The popular Argentine has looked fit and sharp all week in  his game and is now on a 13-match win streak.  </p><p>And don't forget Tennis Channel's extensive live coverage of the Miami open  hits air daily at 10:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the handyman for digital age -- one  company is making it easier than ever to recruit help around the house  whether it's cleaning or putting together that new piece of furniture.   Handy, lets you book top-rated home service professional at touch of a  button.  And now, it is teaming up with Wal-Mart.  Joining us right now to  talk more about that and first on Fox Business interview is: Oisin  Hanrahan, he is Handy's Co-Founder and CEO.  Oishin, I love this idea.  </p><p>OISHIN HANRAHAN, CEO AND CO-FOUNDER, HANDY'S:  It's great to be here.   Thank you so much. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic, thank you for joining us.  First, tell us how it  works and about your partnership for Wal-Mart?  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  So, Handy is the easiest ways to get things done inside your  home; you think about everything from cleaners, to handyman, plumbers,  electricians, and it's the easiest way to book services, you just go to  handy.com or Handy mobile app, put in a zip code, you put more you'd like  do.  You could instantly check out in about 30 seconds.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but how do we know these are reputable people that we want  inside the house?  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  So, we've got out and we've done a lot of work to background  check, social security screen, and put a lot of effort into screening every  professional we put in the platform.  We've had over two million people  apply to join the platform, we've had only about 100,000 of them activated  and doing work and that's why Wal-Mart decided to partner with us because  that's the experience they want to deliver to their customers.  </p><p>CARTER:  Now, are people rated?  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  Of course, yes, so we rate every professional that on the  platform.  And if you go to a Wal-Mart store, so we partner to do T.V.  mounting, and furniture assembling, today you can go to any 2,000 Wal- Mart's right there on the T.V. aisle or in a furniture assembly aisle, and  the furniture -- you can buy a cart right off the shelf to purchase in- store.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  What if not that this happens, but we've all had bad  experiences with contractors, what if there ends up a bad experience is  handy on the hook or get to deal with this privately with the contractors?  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  I think that's a great question because you're not going to get  services to the same level of perfection as products, and that's just a  hard problem to solve.  We take 100 percent responsibility for every  transaction on the platform; we get $5 million of insurance and Handy  happiness guarantee to make sure that we make the customer happy.  </p><p>CARTER:  I've got to say I have found -- I've used your service when I had  an apartment here in the city and it's amazingly convenient.  How -- and I  just kind of assumed because I was in New York City that I was able to get  this level of -- you know, there a hundred of different people that I can  choose from; how does that work in the rest of the country.  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  So, we've rolled out now to about 90 percent of the country to  make sure that we've got 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. availability, but half of  the country it's next day, the other half, it's two-day availability.  And  it's one of the reasons why we built so much technology that power this  platform at scale.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is this like, well, I think it's called pro-referral at Home  Depot.  It's similar, because I know on of the guys, Ethen Anderson, who  founded that company and they sold in to the -- again, I was a start-up,  then they eventually turn around and sold the Home Depot.  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  So, what we don't is we focus right on the transaction.  We  don't what you to have to go through any referral process, we don't want to  have to, you know, ask you to take on any of the clunkiness of scheduling  or negotiation on price or availability or scope of work.  So, we've got  all the way to transaction, and that's one of the reasons why Wal-Mart, and  Wayfair, and others have decided to partner with us because we need  biproducts today, we can offer you services in the same sort of purchase  flow.  So, there's no price variability or price negotiations, we just turn  services into products and that's a little different from anyone who's come  before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, how do you make money?  Do you take a piece, a cut from  every transaction then?  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  We take a little bit from every transaction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Amazon offers similar services to Handy, right?  Like furniture  assembly, do you see your company's partnership with Wal-Mart as response  to the competition?  What does that do for the competitive landscape out  there?  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  Yes.  I think there's a lot going on right now in retail.  So,  if you look at what Amazon is doing, obviously they're pushing the boundary  on what customers expect, customers used to expect free returns, then free  shipping, then free two-day.  And now, I think more and more people are  expecting to figure out how to deliver an amazing experience to customers  at scale, and Amazon has obviously done a great job here.  We internally  have pushed our folks to think about how to step back from Amazon; we've  launched something internally called the Amazon challenge, which is to not  buy from any Amazon property for four weeks.  So, no Kindle, no Amazon  Echo, no Prime, no Amazon video, to try and emphasize: look, this is the  kind of experience and this is how pervasive Amazon has become in your  life.  So, we've been going the opposite direction -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's amazing.  </p><p>HANRAHAN:  -- in trying to educate folks how competitive the market really  is.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's great.  Oishin, great to see you, thanks so much.  We'll  check out Handy.  Oishin Hanrahan, we'll be right back</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Happy Monday to you, and it is  Monday, March 26th, your top stories right now, 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast  --</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

The moves, however, as well as China\u2019s counter-response, are contributing to a deeper problem at the heart of the global economy \u2014 one that can\u2019t be resolved unless the world\u2019s two biggest economies work together.    Just as oil opened new possibilities for trade in the last century, data has become the lifeblood of trade growth in the 21st century. Trade in digital services, including apps such as TikTok, is booming. Data flows increasingly underpin trade in physical goods, too, supporting complex global value chains and emerging technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence and the Internet of things. The amount of cross-border bandwidth in use increased 148 times between 2005 and 2017, according to consultants McKinsey and Co.    Meanwhile, however, global trade rules have barely changed since the 1990s. In effect, the world is trying to run a 21st-century, cloud-based economy on the equivalent of Windows 95.   In effect, the world is trying to run a 21st-century, cloud-based economy on the equivalent of Windows 95   In the absence of shared global norms on how data flows should be governed, domestic policymakers everywhere are developing their own \u201cpatches\u201d to regulate data and protect national security and their citizens\u2019 privacy. The European Union implemented its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018. China has passed a sweeping cybersecurity law and, like India, is working on a major data protection law.    If the US has been slower to regulate data, this is partly because it still dominates the industries and network architecture that handle global digital flows. Yet, given rising concerns about China\u2019s access to Americans\u2019 personal data, the tide of opinion there, too, is turning.   Data regulations   According to the OECD, the number of data regulations has risen from around 50 worldwide in the early 2000s to just under 250 in 2019. The overall degree of data control, as measured by the European Centre for International Political Economy\u2019s Digital Trade Restrictiveness Index, has doubled in the past decade.    The patchwork nature of these rules is creating complexity for firms and friction between nations. Just since the start of July, aside from Trump\u2019s executive orders against TikTok and WeChat, India has banned 59 Chinese apps, and the European court of justice struck down the Privacy Shield mechanism, which US firms such as Facebook and Twitter had been using to handle personal data from the EU. Meanwhile, the US is locked in disputes over digital taxation with several European countries.    Different countries naturally have different views, values and capabilities regarding data governance. All should have the right to regulate data as they see fit for purposes of national security. At the same time, the world needs to lay down some common rules for how to manage data, or such conflicts will only proliferate and stifle interoperability, investment and innovation.    Some bilateral and regional agreements have begun to forge such common standards. The e-commerce chapter in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement on Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) allows members to regulate data flows in a rules-based way that minimizes barriers to trade. If China were to join the agreement \u2014 an idea gaining traction in Chinese policy-making circles \u2014 this would help align the country with next-generation data governance norms and support the aspirations of Chinese technology firms to \u201cgo global\u201d.    What\u2019s really required, though, is a multilateral data governance regime that includes both China and the US. The first step is to complete ongoing World Trade Organisation negotiations on e-commerce. These talks should aim to set global ground rules and exceptions for data, while upholding the centrality of the WTO system.    Next, the G20 should build on last year\u2019s Osaka Declaration on Digital Economy, which affirmed the need for international policy discussions to maximise the benefits of digitalisation. A \u201cDigital 20\u201d (D20), comprised of the world\u2019s 20 largest digital companies, should bring together figures from government, industry, academia and non-governmental organisations to develop a workable, fact-based approach that safeguards national security while providing consumers with trust and privacy, and businesses with clarity and predictability.   Leaders in both countries should seek industry consensus and best practices that can be used to establish global standards   The US and China are home to most of these big tech companies. Rather than treating each other\u2019s firms as national security threats, leaders in both countries should seek industry consensus and best practices that can be used to establish global standards.    To reassure security hawks on both sides, the world will need clear standards to judge what constitutes secure data management practice. Countries should be encouraged to use international standards as benchmarks for domestic approaches, such as ISO 27000 information security standards.    Rules-based free trade was crucial in helping the global economy recover from the ravages of World War 2. We now face the worst global recession since then. It is time to haul our multilateral trade rules into the 21st century and stem the tide of digital protectionism so that data flows can be a source of growth and opportunity, not discord.  \u2014 By Wang Huiyao, (c) 2020 Bloomberg LP    The writer is founder and president of the Centre for China and Globalisation in Beijing and vice chairman of the China Association for International Economic Cooperation</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42979770259</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RJ-G3Y1-JCSC-J15M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1003\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>TechCentral.co.za</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 2, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC0002F32</classCode><className>MCKINSEY &amp;

Nancy Pelosi now  saying she will not even accept a decent DACA deal in exchange for border  wall funding. People sick and tired of D.C. politics.</p><p>This as we bring you two big border scandals now hurting Americans. </p><p>Well, thank you for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money, politics. We  got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. The  Evening Edit starts right now. </p><p>OK. Let's get to the China outrage over the arrest of Huawei's CFO. They  are now demanding her release accusing the U.S. and Canada of quote,  \"wrongdoing.\" This is over violating Iran sanctions. But Wall Street  analysts point out other countries are saying Huawei is pretty bad. </p><p>Australia, New Zealand, Britain's telecom B.T. all kicked out Huawei over  fears that Huawei is stealing and spying giving its ties to China's  military. And they say President Trump is right. China for years has been  hollowing out U.S. jobs and entire U.S. industries, not funding its own  R&amp;D, but instead, stealing our research to make China great again. </p><p>Our companies pay for that research. China then sells cheaper copycats,  undercutting us. We're talking nuclear power generators, solar cells,  computer hardware, software, and more.</p><p>Let's get to Edward Lawrence in D.C. with more on that Huawei arrest.  Edward? </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Liz. And don't forget,  circuit boards. That was a huge thing that Chinese put out. And right now,  the arrest of chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou threatens to destabilize  the fragile trade negotiations that have been going on between the U.S. and  China. </p><p>China calling for Canada to release the Huawei CFO. A spokesperson for the  Chinese foreign ministry says, \"The detention of a person without giving a  clear reason is of course a violation of the human rights to the person, or  of the person.\" </p><p>Now China claims they don't know the reason that she was detained. She is  being investigated by the U.S. for possible violations for breaking the  sanctions related to Iran. Now, the timing of arrest is interesting. She  was being detained in Canada the same day President Donald Trump worked out  a path forward on trade talks with China. </p><p>The national security advisor John Bolton told NPR that he was made aware  of the arrest and that it would happen. The White House, though, telling us  that the president did not know about it before he met with President Xi.  Regardless, some senators applauding the U.S. for sticking to its morals.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER, (D) VIRGINIA:  My fear is when the Trump administration  is going to crumble on Huawei the same way they crumbled on ZTE. And as we  think about particularly we move to the next generation of wireless 5G and  that transformation is as big as anything that we've seen in the wireless  industry. And my fear is that China could be successful at setting the  standards and dominating that market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  And national security advisor John Bolton also told NPR that  this is a Justice Department matter and they don't always tell the  president what they are doing. Liz?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Great to see you, Edward. Thank you so much.</p><p>Joining me now is Zach Mottl, he is a top executive at Atlas Tool Works.  This is a company that has had a front row seat for years watching China's  high-tech theft. We welcome you to the show, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p>ZACH MOTTL, CHIEF ALIGNMENT OFFICER, ATLAS TOOL WORKS:  Great to be here,  Elizabeth.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Your company makes precision parts for the internet, radar  systems, medical devices. What do you guys seeing, is President Trump right  about China stealing to make China great again. </p><p>MOTTL:  He's absolutely right. You know, Huawei has built a $90 billion  global enterprise based on commercial espionage, theft of western  technology. You know, my customers are offered -- my business has been  around for 100 years, and for 90 out of the 100 years we were a vendor in  the telecom industry. That was a really important sector for myself and  many other manufacturers like me.</p><p>And we watched as Chinese manufacturers Huawei ZTE came online, and in 20  years they wiped out every single western competitor. Lucent Technologies,  Tellabs, Nortel Networks in Canada. Every one of these companies could not  compete against commercial espionage and state subsidized technology.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Because they're undercutting us taking our jobs, our R&amp;D that  we pay for and then making cheaper copycats. Sir, isn't this a big wake-up  call to Congress to say, you know a what, knock it off about the media  grandstanding before, you know, the D.C. cameras and get on the stick.  Because China has a built-in road project that made in China 2025 project.</p><p>I mean, Obama, President Obama did try to stop China, but it's really up to  Congress to get our trade laws updated to knock it, to get it to knock it  off, right?</p><p>MOTTL:  That's right. This telecom industry was the crown jewel of America  and it portray laws and lack of oversight by Congress has allow the Chinese  to steal this. Let's not lose one more high-tech industry. And quite  frankly, let's bring the telephone manufacturing industry back here. </p><p>We're about to have 5G, and you know, we can worry about the security or we  can simply make it here and know that it's good. Because what we've learned  with this Huawei case and so many other cases, is that we just can't trust  the Chinese. They say one thing, but they do something completely  different. So, I'm hoping Congress will step up to the plate here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We hope so too, because this is got to stop, sir. I mean, this  should be hair on fire and break the glass time right now in D.C.</p><p>MOTTL:  That's right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Because to your point, we just cited these other countries  worried about Huawei. Also, you mentioned 5G. China is embedding itself and  the fears it's going to go into that new 5G rollout worldwide. That's the  internet of things. That's wearable fitness trackers. It's robots, taxis  and the like. </p><p>I mean, if China gets to jump on that and starts embedding itself in 5G,  wow, game over.</p><p>MOTTL:  That's right. And they're counting on, you know, they're taking  advantage of the free market. They are going to undercut price and they are  going to subsidize it to try to buy the market. We cannot let that happen.  We need to put laws in place and we need our other country partners to work  with us to shut them out of the market. Because again, we just cannot trust  them. And when they say they are not spying I certainly think they are.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All this breathtakingly tedious grandstanding in D.C. over it,  and they are setting aside what really matters and that's what you're  talking about. Because, sir, look what happened to U.S. Steel. U.S. Steel  spent tons of money to pioneer a new lighter, higher grade steel product  for cars and planes, but then China hacked it and hacked its computers,  stole the blueprints and started selling copycats steel at way cheaper  prices, right?</p><p>MOTTL:  When profit doesn't matter to these companies and they have a  government behind them helping them cheat and steal, how can we compete? We  need to do it smarter. And what it comes down to is jobs. It's not just  about high-tech and innovation. It's about jobs. It's about national  security. </p><p>And the employees like mine, you know, when I lost my telecom customers in  the early 2000, we have to lay people off. We reinvented ourselves, but a  lot of other companies couldn't. Telecom and so many other sectors are  really important. We're talking about good jobs for Americans versus growth  and good jobs for people in China. I want to see it made here and I want to  see it secure and safe so we can trust what's going through our network.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And now, we got indications that China made in behind that  massive Marriott hack affecting half a billion people potentially. Wow.</p><p>MOTTL:  It's pervasive. It is pervasive and everything that they do they  just simply play by a different set of rules, so they can tell us one thing  but we know they are going to do something else. We can't trust them. </p><p>So, I'm pleased to see President Trump, you know, holding firm. I trust his  judgment here and I hope that Congress is going to come along and finally  join the wise party because they are really missing the boat by not  protecting America and our information.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, you know what, you know, if Congress doesn't it, the  voter could and probably will. Zach Mottl of Atlas Tool Works, thanks for  coming in. We'd like you to come on again soon, sir. </p><p>MOTTL:  We'll see you soon, Elizabeth. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you. Let's get Ned Ryun's reaction. Ned Ryun is one  of the top analysts out there, he's been watching D.C. Ned, I want your  reaction to the conversation we just had.</p><p>NED RYUN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  Well, I got to tell you, I  mean, initially, when you have a clip of Senator Warren saying -- Warner  saying about the fifth-generation 5G networks and Huawei, I mean, that's  one of things. </p><p>I wrote about this for Fox News during the week of Thanksgiving, Liz, in  which I said we have to be very careful because there is a proxy battle  being fought right now between United States and China between QUALCOMM and  Huawei over who's going to control that 5G network, and you are right. </p><p>The implications for the internet of things, right now there is about eight  billion internet of things devices. That number is probably going to triple  in the next three years. And who's going to control the networks and the  data is going to be massive as we move forward into the future.</p><p>And on the other front, you're right. I mean, they have been robbing us  blind. We have helped build the largest authoritarian police state in China  with really bad trade deals, and now we have looked the other way as they  literally over the last probably 10 years, Liz, I've seen estimates about  three trillion are in technology theft and between theft and force  technology transfers that we basically incentivize and given them the means  to compete with us on the technology front, but also on the economic front  and they're not shy about it. </p><p>They are gunning for us. They want to replace us as the center of the  economic world. And right now, for in the past, we've been lightening them  get away with it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know what, there's that and there's also this other  geopolitical risk that the White House is trying to address as well, Ned.  Look at this. New satellite images reveal activity and an unidentified  North Korean missile base. </p><p>So that's also a neck of the woods. What's you take on that?</p><p>RYUN:  Well, my take on this, is again, this has been the failure of the  three previous administrations kicking the can down the road of refusing to  actually deal with the North Korean threat. And now Trump has been  confronted with it. He realizes we cannot have this existential threat with  North Korea having nuclear armaments and being able to literally at some  point in the not-too-distant future have the ability to drop warheads on  American cities. </p><p>The key to this, though, Liz, and it's all, again, like you said, it's all  interconnected. We actually need China to play ball with us on North Korea  to deal with this threat. And so, this whole trade dispute taking place  with China, all of this stuff is interconnected. We have to figure out how  to see China accommodate our interest in real life. They've got to  prioritize our interest.</p><p>And so, this whole trade deal is not only tied to bad trade deals and  intellectual theft. It's also tied to how we deal with North Korea as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. And to your point, China's military has been boosting the  number of warplane intrusions into South Korea airspace, nearly doubling  the number of times in recent years. Your take on that.</p><p>RYUN:  Well, I mean, China, the amazing part to me is how brash China is  and we're acting, we are letting them get away with this. They have been  waging this economic war. They've been threatening us. They've been doing  building these islands in the South China Seas and we've just been sitting  there as though, we, you know, we don't know what they're up to. We know  exactly what they are up to. And I think it's time. </p><p>Obviously, if we can really deal this economic trade and put them on notice  I think we can start to deal with some of these military threats as well. </p><p>Trump is right to do this and I know that some people are worried about  this tariff fight. I will say this, Liz. If we do not confront China now in  the next few years, I'm convinced we will regret it for the next hundred  years. Because China does not want trade partners. China wants tributary  nations. And if we are not careful, if we deal with this trade threat and  these bad trade deals and this theft of our intellectual property we're not  going to like where we're at in 10 or 15 years.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, you make a great point there. Let's move over to  what's going on in Russia, Ned. I'd like your reaction to Russia doing some  saber rattling, showing off new laser weapons after the U.S. is threatening  to pull out of missile, that missile treaty dating back to the 80s because  of Russia cheating. What's your take on that?</p><p>RYUN:  I go back to, you know, despite all the left screaming buddy  murderer about Trump being too cozy with Putin, he is actually been pretty  aggressive with him, especially on the energy front. Over 50 percent of  Russia's, the Russian governments income comes from oil and gas exports.  And Trump knows what he's doing on this front.</p><p>Obviously, he confronted Merkel on Nord Stream II and Russia importing even  more natural gas to Germany, and Trump said you can't do that. He's also  gone in and address a lot of the middle and eastern and European countries  and the three C's initiative in which he is trying to get them off of  Russian energy. </p><p>Because he realizes, Trump realizes if you can cut off Russian exports in  these energy areas of gas and oil, he's going to undermine all this other  stuff that's taking place. So, he's focused on the right things. He has to  cut off the Europeans from getting or being wholly dependent or  significantly dependent on Russian energy. And if he can do that, I think  he's going to really be able to put Putin in his place.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you, Ned Ryun. Great to see you. Come back soon.</p><p>RYUN:  Thanks, Liz. We'll do.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Next case, this morning 1000 friends and family attended the  funeral service at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston to say a final  farewell to President George H.W. Bush.</p><p>In attendance, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris, baseball legends Nolan  Ryan, and Tommy Lasorda. And also, country singers Crystal Gayle and Larry  Gatlin. The funeral train carry the casket of our 41st president a short  time ago to the presidential library at Texas A&amp;M University. </p><p>The president was laid to rest alongside his wife Barbara.</p><p>We're going to be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. tech execs from Google, Microsoft, and Oracle met  today at the White House with Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Larry Kudlow and  others to talk about securing U.S. manufacturing dominance, and artificial  intelligence, quantum computing, and more. Facebook executives not  attending.</p><p>But to the real fireworks. The fight in D.C. with G.M. G.M. CEO Mary Barra  met again today with lawmakers. They are pretty upset over G.M.'s big tax  breaks in the face of G.M. plants -- plans to shut factories and lay off  14,000 workers.</p><p>Look at this. FiatChrysler, though, plans to open a new factory in  Detroit.</p><p>Let's bring in Republican Ohio Congressman Warren Davidson. Good to see  you, sir. </p><p>REP. WARREN DAVIDSON, (R) OHIO:  Good to talk with you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, people are upset that G.M. keeps coming all the time  with tin cap in hand getting a lot of federal bailout help, and wait for  it, a lot of state tax breaks and bailout help too. And you know, Ohio gave  G.M. a ton of tax breaks, but now that factories are closing. What's your  take on this?</p><p>DAVIDSON:  You know, it's truly disappointing. And I've been in Congress  now for about two and half years, but prior to that, for the previous 15  years I was in manufacturing. So, when you talk the intersection of big  tech and automotive, they're really more interconnected than you would  imagine. </p><p>So, when Mary Barra came and talked with the Ohio delegation, she really  led with the transformation that the auto industry is confronting. And you  know, one of the points that I wanted to make is, you know, the good news  is, is unlike in '08, '09 when this was happening, Ohio strong and growing.  G.M. is anomaly our states hiring. </p><p>I offered to drive our economic development folks up to do a job fair at  the plant. So, G.M. is offering those folks jobs I'm sure the eighth  district would be happy to have them.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. But here's the thing. We've been watching and I've been  watching G.M. for years. I've been doing business journalism for three  decades. I was at the Wall Street Journal. I was an editor at Forbes. I've  been writing about G.M. for a long time, sir. </p><p>Here's the problem. Here's one of the issues. Ohio in 2008 gave state  income tax breaks to G.M., saying you don't have to pay 75 percent of your  income taxes to the state of Ohio over the next 15 years. </p><p>So, here's the thing. Should elected officials say once and for all, OK,  we'll give you, Mr. car company or Mr. G.M., a tax break, with the caveat  that you have to show us how you will build factories that you can retool  to make -- to make either smaller or bigger vehicles when gas prices go up  or down. Other car companies do that, why can't G.M.?</p><p>DAVIDSON:  Well, the good news is Honda's been doing that. They reinvested,  the Honda Accord wasn't selling as well as they thought. The CRV is selling  way better, I think two-thirds of the cars on the road that are in demand  right now our crossovers, SUVs or trucks. And Honda who is a huge anchor  for Ohio has been very adaptive. </p><p>G.M. not quite as flexible. There's a lot of history behind that. And you  know, frankly, some of the things were the government has been involved  that shows frankly, the government should be not try to run these  companies. We don't need more central planning.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Got that. Check that. Understood. I hear totally what you're  saying. I don't mean to interrupt. But that is agreed upon. We don't want  that. We don't want the government in there. But G.M. does really rapidly  come with a tin cap getting our tax help.</p><p>I mean, it's striking, sir, that we're -- that, you know, that FiatChrysler is now opening a factory in Detroit. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Yes. I mean, that's great. And you know, we'll see where that  goes for G.M. You know, I think they've been outperformed by a number of  companies that's why they have to come hot in hand and begging for help.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, that's been going on for decades.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'm telling you that's been going on for decades. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. Not to mention the subsidies that are going on to  try to steer consumers to buy this car or that car.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  And the areas (Ph) of government shouldn't be trying to steer  that. And the good news for G.M. is maybe they finally got the message as,  you are not going to get any more bailouts. The American people don't want  to bail you out nor anyone else, and so you are going to have to take care  of your balance sheet and do the right things.</p><p>So, I was impressed that Mary Barra came and was proactively speaking to us  on the hill. But yes, very sad news about the investment in Lordstown,  Ohio, in particular.</p><p>MACDONALD:  But you know what, but what about putting the feet to the fire.  I understand. I watch Mary Barra. We have a lot of respect for her. She is  a great CEO. But listen closely to what she says, OK. A lot of that is a  lot of P.R. talk. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You got to get to the nuts and bolts. Is she going to move jobs  to other factories in the U.S.? And you know, is she going to stop  outsourcing to Mexico? We understand the economics of it, but we also  understand the economics of giving out tax breaks when you're not, you  know, building factories that are flexible, right? Final word.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. And when you look at where the intellectual property  and the tech is, the good news is a lot of that happened in the U.S. and  when you tie that to what you're talking about earlier is the tech folks  coming to the White House. </p><p>The Foreign Investment Risk Reduction Modernization Act, that was one of  the biggest piece of registration that the House financial services  committee move this past year. It was an honor to work on it. Really our  country is going to be more secure, our country is going to be stronger. </p><p>And frankly, if we can complement that with a good reform to privacy so  that we can make sure that whether it's on the internet or in your car or  in app that you download on the phone it's always your data as a consumer.  And I was impressed that was one of the questions I put to Mary is that it  is an opt in practice for G.M. in the car.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  And so, I hope we can do that more and I hope that they'll see  that the competitive advantage in the United States means they should  continue to invest including in Ohio. We have a tremendous supply chain and  folks are happy to supply them.</p><p>MACDONALD:  There's great people in Ohio. Great people in Michigan, great  people in the heartland. Congressman Warren Davidson, thank you so much. We  really appreciate it. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to other headline news. Search and rescue efforts  still underway after two U.S. military planes collided in midair and crash  off the coast of Japan overnight. It happened during a refueling exercise.  One marine killed, another in fair condition. </p><p>However, five marines still missing. Our thoughts and prayers are with the  families there.</p><p>A Southwest Airlines flight get it off the runway upon landing in heavy  rain at Burbank Airport in California. There were no reported injuries.  Among the 117 passengers, they were evacuated using emergency slides.  That's pretty scary stuff.</p><p>And drug company, it's called Tris Pharma, now recalling some of its  children's Ibuprofen after it was notified about overly high concentrations  of that drug that can affect a child's kidneys. This brand was sold under  private label brands at CVS, Wal-Mart and Family Dollar. Check those labels  there.</p><p>Now to the border wall. Brand new analysis on how it saves thousands of  lives. We've got one of the best columnists and thinkers out there. Tammy  Bruce is coming up.</p><p>But first, Congress kicked of the can down the road again. Another  temporary spending budget. What are we sending them to D.C. for? It means  you may see a government shut down by just in time for Christmas. We're  going to tell you what they're fighting about now and why this is the best  case for term limits. We're at the bottom of the hour. Stay there. Back in  two.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're watching the Fox Business Network. To  government spending, again, Congress passing a temporary interim spending  bill today that is going to let the government be funded for two more  weeks, really is just kicking the can down the road again. Congress will  have to vote on this again before midnight on December 21st.</p><p>Joining me now, Trump 2020 campaign advisory board member Madison Gesiotto  and Democrat strategist Al Mottur. I know you guys love talking about this.  Madison, look at this, from Pew Research, you're not going to believe it.  Congress has only managed to pass all required appropriations measures on  time, wait for it, just four times since fiscal 1977. Is this an argument  for term limits. I mean, what do we send them into D.C. to do?</p><p>MADISON GESIOTTO, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, NATIONAL  DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP:  It's one of the many arguments for term  limits. I mean, Congress seems repeatedly every single year do not be able  to do their job. I remember last Christmas, we talked about the same thing.</p><p>Every single year, they are never meeting the requirements, they are never  doing their job. It's such a shame that we continue to have to talk about  this. For over 20 years, they haven't met the requirements. So those four  times between 1977 and 1997, it's frustrating.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. So here's the thing, Al. This is what I'm wondering if we  should do. You know what, Congress, it's sort of like telling your children  to go to their room until you get the job done. We're going to sequester  you in D.C., no grandstanding for the cameras, no campaigning, no political  rallies, no fundraising, you got to be quarantined in D.C. and get a  spending bill on time. How about that?</p><p>AL MOTTUR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Hey, we might as well try it. I mean,  look, you're on to something when you say no campaigning, no fundraising.  The politics have taken over the dynamic in the Congress and there is way  too much time spent on the phone dialing for dollars and don't have enough  time doing work for the American people. That's on both sides of the aisle.  There's got to be a way to stop it. Maybe term limits is part of the  answer. I think campaign finance reform is another.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Pelosi now says she won't accept a pretty decent DACA  deal in exchange for border wall funding. That's what it has come down to  right now. What do you think?</p><p>GESIOTTO:  I think what's frustrating about what she is doing is the fact  that she is unwilling to compromise. I mean, when we look at Congress and  the idea of why we have two parties and why we have Democrats and  Republicans in Congress work together is because they need to compromise to  get to the end solution.</p><p>Sometimes, you are going to have to give a little to get a little. The  Republicans have tried to do that on many issues. Of course, they are not  perfect. But the Democrats slightly have really let their hate for our  president overcome their ability to get anything done.</p><p>MOTTUR:  That's not what is going on here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It feels like it's going on. Go ahead, Al. Finish your point.</p><p>MOTTUR:  No, it's not. I mean, the parties for two decades have been unable  to do immigration compromise. I agree we have to compromise. It's not  because --</p><p>MACDONALD:  But they are purposely politicizing the border. That's the  issue. We know that for a fact from internal e-mails --</p><p>MOTTUR:  Both sides are politicizing the border, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We know for a fact from internal e-mails that Democrat Super  PAC say that's the way to go in order to get that voter. But here's the  thing. Democrats, Al, and you've talked about this too, starting in 2005,  2006 and all the way through 2013, said yeah, to border security. Just get  it done. We have this moment in time after the George H.W. Bush funeral,  that there seems to be some kind of unity. Get it done.</p><p>MOTTUR:  I don't think the president would accept the border wall for a  DACA deal, first of all. And second of all, the president --</p><p>MACDONALD:  We did have one. He had a DACA deal, 1.3 million DACA, to do a  border wall. The Americans want it. They don't our security dealt with like  a political football.</p><p>MOTTUR:  I wish we could compromise on immigration. It's not just right  now. It's not hatred for this president. It has been going on for a long  time.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Should get it done now. Should get it done yesterday. How about  that?</p><p>MOTTUR:  I am for it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Go ahead, Madison.</p><p>GESIOTTO:  You know, Al, you are saying that's simply not true, that the  Democrats are willing to compromise. When you look back 10, 20 years, we  just actually talked about this with Liz last week, the Democrats supported  many of the things that they are now going against when it comes to  immigration.</p><p>So that is your perfect and prime example right there as to why their hate  for our president has changed their views and clouded their judgment when  it comes to the immigration issue specifically.</p><p>MOTTUR:  I don't believe it's about hate to the president. I believe it's  on both sides, Republicans and Democrats --</p><p>GESIOTTO:  Obstruction --</p><p>MOTTUR:  -- pulling the football away.</p><p>GESIOTTO:  We can use any word there.</p><p>MOTTUR:  -- Charlie Brown. And Trump does it too.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, Al, maybe we can all move beyond that and just tell D.C.,  your voice, Al, and Madison's voice, and the viewer and the people out  there saying, you know what, we're done with you, D.C., we're over it. It's  sort of like you tell a child to go to your room until you clean it. Get it  done.</p><p>MOTTUR:  Maybe if there were thermal on Madison (ph), I can go up there and  get it done.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, I'll tell you something. It's just astonishing. I  want your reaction, Al. Congress has managed only four times since fiscal  1977, just four times, to pass all of its required spending measures on  time. Really?</p><p>MOTTUR:  It's ridiculous. They ought to be here more than three days a  week. They ought to be here four, five days a week.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>MOTTUR:  And that would help. Fundraising is a problem. Like I said, term  limits could be part of the solution. But there is no incentive for them to  get this done because there is no punishment.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right, because this is term limits. Madison and Al, thank you  so much. Great fun --</p><p>MOTTUR:  Great to be with you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey will testify  privately behind closed doors on Capitol Hill tomorrow. It will be  transcribed and then released to the public within 24 hours. But how will  the media report on that? Will you get to the truth on what James Comey  said? We're going to break it down.</p><p>But first, why a border wall could save thousands of lives every year?  Tammy Bruce on that. We're going to explain after the break. Back in two.  Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know when something is staring right at you and you say  eureka (ph) of course, absolutely. My next guest has that moment for you,  says President Trump's border wall could help save thousands of lives.  Joining me now, Fox News political contributor, Independent Women's Voice  president, great columnist, writer, Tammy Bruce.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  I'm glad you got to check.  Thank you, dear. Look, my column is up today. This is not new. This is not  new news. What was shocking to me was the CDC report that came out about  last week, that noted and obviously should alarm all of us, that the drug  overdose deaths and suicides are at historic highs, right?</p><p>In just 2017, over 72,000 people died from drug overdoses. That is more  than the U.S. deaths in the Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. In  one year in this country, suicides are at their historic high, about 49,000  suicides also in 2017.</p><p>The CDC doesn't want to speculate, they say, on the cause. But what they do  recognize also is the importation of drugs, the opioid epidemic, people now  moving from prescription drug dynamic because we are at war with that, so  they turn to heroin. And then there is fentanyl which is now the new  synthetic opioid which kills you pretty much right away. It's a tiny, tiny  amount that will kill you.</p><p>We got single individuals bringing into the country, and somebody was  caught just a few weeks ago, bringing over enough that would kill 300  million Americans, and because it takes so little to end up killing you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>BRUCE:  This is at the border. Eighty percent of the fentanyl in this  country comes in through the southern border, and also China is involved in  that facilitation as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It's just two milligrams. We just show that stat, 78 million.  That's based on the amount of fentanyl seized at the border last year and  the first quarter of this year. Life expectancy has been dragged down by  what is going on.</p><p>BRUCE:  That is correct, because you got middle aged individuals, right?  You got -- those are the individuals who are dying too early because of the  drug addiction and because of suicide. Look, one thing we know about  suicide is it's usually not one issue. It can be a multitude of issues. But  when you're also dealing with drug addiction, any addiction, certainly  alcoholism, but the opioid addiction creates hopelessness.</p><p>We've dealt with now -- thank goodness in the economic recovery, but the  last 10 years, people losing their homes, losing their savings, losing  their jobs. That combined with drug addiction. And then of course President  Obama, we lost our hospitals and our doctors and any real access to health  care. That we think of course has contributed to the nature of the suicide  choice. So it is  -- that in it of itself, because of the core of the  people affected is dragging down the U.S. life expectancy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Astonishing, that finding. You know, President Trump is saying  China will try to stop the importation of fentanyl into our country. That's  part of the trade deal. But Thomas Homan, to your point, former acting ICE  director, said, you know, having the troops at the border is making the  drug cartels berserk and crazy. He told us that on the show last week.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yeah. You know, he is -- what they have done is, because of the  caravan, we've obviously boosted up the numbers, and the cartels which have  relied on kind of a lax framework are furious because it is affecting their  ability to move the drugs in.</p><p>This is why when we talk about the wall, it is not just about we need an  orderly framework that happens at the border, but we must take seriously  what's going on and how these drugs are moving into the country, when 80  percent of fentanyl is coming in through the southern border.</p><p>And by the way, the majority of heroin as well is not coming from  Afghanistan, it's grown in Mexico. It's cultivated there and moved in  through Mexico. So the wall is something that not only are we dealing with  keeping bad guys out and killers and all of that and human trafficking, but  to stop this.</p><p>When you got three wars of the deaths combined including Vietnam in one  year, how is this not a war? All the American people deserve to be taken  seriously and to have --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is it Trump's White House capitalizing on this, what you're  talking about?</p><p>BRUCE:  Look, they have got to talk more about the other issues that are  involving the wall and why this matters. People know the opioid crisis and  the prescription drugs, right, OxyContin. We know that there is a heroin  problem. People don't know that people have gone to street drugs when they  can't get a prescription. And where is that coming from? When you think of  heroin, when you think of a poppy fields in Afghanistan --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>BRUCE:  They got to talk more about this. This transcends political  parties, economic status, all of those things. And I wish the president  would speak more about it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Tammy Bruce, you're going to be with us later in the show.  Great information there. Wow! We had a jam-packed hour. Coming up, a major  arrest of illegals in Massachusetts. More than 50 illegal immigrants busted  in a multi-day swift (ph) in New England. Look at this. Three of them  wanted for murder.</p><p>But first, it's the testimony we have been waiting for. Tomorrow, former  FBI Director James Comey, he is going to get a Capitol Hill grilling behind  closed doors. But how will the media report on that? That's next. Stay  there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. Tomorrow, House Republicans will finally get  their chance to grill former FBI Director James Comey behind closed doors  about his actions and anti-Trump bias infecting the top levels of the FBI  during the election. Again, behind closed doors. The transcript will be  made public within 24 hours of that sessions. Joe Concha is a media  reporter for The Hill. He joins us now. So how are they going to report on  it? What do you think, Joe?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL:  Well, if it's going to be made  public in 24 hours, then I would imagine something because nothing gets  slip (ph) in Washington. Everything gets slip (ph) in Washington. Within an  hour, somebody is going to have to use the bathroom, there will be a call  from some reporter and then you're going to hear about it. But at least  everything is going to be out in 24 hours, sometimes that doesn't happen.</p><p>I think they got the wrong guy here, Liz. I want to know why Rod Rosenstein  isn't being called before Congress. He is the guy just nine weeks ago who  said, yeah, you know, I think I'll wear a wire and try to trap the  president, try to get him on tape to compel his cabinet to invoke the 25th  Amendment. I would have had him on there instead.</p><p>But, OK, we have Comey. Here's the thing about Comey. He's an open book.  Literally he's an open book. He wrote a book in April. He did a thousand  interviews after that. I might be exaggerating. Most probably dozens and  dozens. So everything seems to be out there already, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I hear what you're saying because -- let's be clear. This is  about Trump-hating, pro-Hillary FBI director and there are talks about  stopping Trump, impeaching Trump. Really the issue is that FISA warrant to  basically surveil Trump campaign aides because it looks like they really  did break the regulations in getting that FISA warrant, right?</p><p>CONCHA:  It appears that way. Absolutely. So, but I wonder, Comey who is a  very good public speaker, we could agree on that, when he's done his  testimonies, it has been the type of thing where he seems to be pretty  measured in his responses. He is ready for whatever question --</p><p>MACDONALD:  He has got to answer. Did you tell the FISA court that it was  funded by the Democrats, partly, you even said it was unverified on  salacious. Did you know at the time that it was unverified? Did you tell  the court that, right?</p><p>CONCHA:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You got to get that out of him.</p><p>CONCHA:  And if so, why? Was it because --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Why you --</p><p>CONCHA:  -- the president.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>CONCHA:  Right, exactly. Why didn't you pursue going down this particular  route? I also want to know why he leaked a private conversation or  conversations that he had with the president over dinner at the White  House, then leaked everything he talked about to a friend at Columbia  University, who then gave it too The New York Times, and he admits for the  sole purpose of compelling a special counsel to be appointed, and it  happened. How is that not illegal?</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We want -- can we have you back on to talk about it?</p><p>CONCHA:  Absotively (ph).</p><p>MACDONALD:  Absotively (ph). Joe Concha. That's great. Good to see you,  sir. Coming up, we are going to get to that ICE arrest. More than 50  illegals including three wanted for murder in sanctuary city friendly New  England. We're going to have Tammy Bruce back on that. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. ICE arresting more than 50 illegal immigrants  over the past two days. It happened across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New  Hampshire, and Connecticut. Among those arrested, three immigrants,  illegals from Brazil, wanted there for murder.</p><p>The ICE raids taking place the very same week that the Massachusetts  Republican governor said, you know what, a state judge must temporarily  step down after that judge let an undocumented immigrant here basically  sneak out a backdoor to avoid ICE agents waiting to take him into custody.</p><p>Tammy Bruce is back with us. First on that story, Tammy, great to have you  back.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  That illegal that sneaked out (ph) the backdoor had been  deported multiple times for multiple drug arrests. And now the judge let  him go at the backdoor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yeah. It is interesting. During the court proceedings, the judge  called them up to the bench, and the judge asked for the recording to stop.  And that is when suddenly when that went back on and they resumed, there  was suddenly some machinations there to have the charges dropped.</p><p>And then somehow, the defense attorney was able to walk the defendant out  through a side door back through which would not have been allowed without  it being facilitated and being able to avoid as there was also (ph) ICE  agents.</p><p>Some judges and immigration advocates of course don't want ICE agents to be  able to go into courthouses. They have argued that they have to stay  outside and that seems to be changing a little bit. There is argument about  that. This is one of the reasons why they want that to be able to be in the  courthouses to deal with this kind of stuff.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What a story. And we have seen another courts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, this judge, understandably, they think the judge should not be  hearing any federal cases because if you are really obstructing law  enforcement, why should you be on the bench? I mean, as a judge, you are  supposed to be implementing the laws.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>BRUCE:  And adjudicating them as opposed to helping a defendant sneak out  to get away from federal law enforcement. That's crazy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  She hears criminal cases. Are you going to let other criminals  go?</p><p>BRUCE:  Right. No matter -- look, they are human beings. We all have  opinions on the issues. But if you're willing to skirt the law and allow  someone else to do so, what else are you doing that is not fair?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to the swifts (ph) in New England. The 50 arrested  illegal immigrants selling opioids. You have been talking about that.</p><p>BRUCE:  Oh, yeah. This is our prior discussion. This is the big deal.  Trafficking in heroin. Trafficking in fentanyl. These are not drug users,  these are traffickers. And so this is where -- it is also a reminder to  people what ICE does. This is inside the country. It's the internal  framework.</p><p>They do not handle the border. They deal with criminals, the gangs, the  drug traffickers, sex traffickers, kidnappers, murderers, getting these  three Brazilians who are wanted for murder in that country, that's what ICE  does.</p><p>This is the organization that many Democrats want to abolish. That would be  a mistake because the people that are targeted and affected first and  victimized first are the communities of immigrants.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right, that's a point.</p><p>BRUCE:  This is who we are trying to protect here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right. But, you know, here is the other point about the story.  Several towns in Massachusetts here, they're sanctuary cities. It's Boston,  Cambridge, Lawrence and Newton. These are the cities where these  individuals have been detained.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's right. So the people that were scooped up had been in  custody. And then were released. Again, you think, well, was this somebody  who was driving under the influence or somebody who made a mistake? No,  these are drug traffickers. These are very serious individuals.</p><p>MACDONALD:  But the victims of the crimes are treated like rounding errors  in D.C. There is not a human being behind it that is treated --</p><p>BRUCE:  Big government, whether it is about health care or even law  enforcement. When people become the budget and you become a chit on a piece  of paper, you stop being a human being. This is why local law enforcement  matters. You know, judges matter.</p><p>They are supposed to see the individuals and yet they claim it is because  they are sensitive to immigrants, but this kind of action re-victimizes  immigrants. Legal immigrants who are playing by the rules and even  undocumented people who are also playing by the rules. Those are the people  that are protected by ICE.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Great stuff again from Tammy Bruce. You're going to come back  soon.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'll look forward to it. Thank you so much for having us in  your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on the  Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It  was down nearly 800 points, and then down about 80 points, doing a major  rethink after the initial freak out, panicked attack over the arrest that  U.S. request in Canada of the CFO of Huawei, that's China's top tech giant. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> That CFO, the daughter of Huawei's founder, a former Chinese military  officer. She's arrested on charges that Huawei broke U.S. sanctions by  selling U.S. technology to Iran. We've got details on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But Wall Streeters now applauding President Trump's tough line in trade  talks with China because China is stealing to make China great again. We've  got fresh new details on that. And it has to stop. </p><p> What's going on we've got an insider who has a front row seat on how China  has hollowed out entire U.S. industries and taken U.S. jobs. And why Trump  is right to fix the problem that elected officials for years have done  nothing about.</p><p> The Dow down 8 percent since its October high. But take a breath for some  perspective. Historically it is normal to have these kinds of downturns. We  bring you what you need to know.</p><p> Plus, tech execs at the White House today on how to beat China and more.  But the real firework is a fight in D.C. over G.M. getting not just loathes  of federal bailout help but state bailout help and tax breaks too, where it  hardly pays any taxes as its closing U.S. factories and laying off  thousands of people before Christmastime, sending those factory jobs to  Mexico. We've got the back story to FBN's exclusive with CEO Mary Barra. </p><p> Also, Democrat in-fighting over border wall funding. Nancy Pelosi now  saying she will not even accept a decent DACA deal in exchange for border  wall funding. People sick and tired of D.C. politics.</p><p> This as we bring you two big border scandals now hurting Americans. </p><p> Well, thank you for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money, politics. We  got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. The  Evening Edit starts right now. </p><p> OK. Let's get to the China outrage over the arrest of Huawei's CFO. They  are now demanding her release accusing the U.S. and Canada of quote,  \"wrongdoing.\" This is over violating Iran sanctions. But Wall Street  analysts point out other countries are saying Huawei is pretty bad. </p><p> Australia, New Zealand, Britain's telecom B.T. all kicked out Huawei over  fears that Huawei is stealing and spying giving its ties to China's  military. And they say President Trump is right. China for years has been  hollowing out U.S. jobs and entire U.S. industries, not funding its own  R&amp;D, but instead, stealing our research to make China great again. </p><p> Our companies pay for that research. China then sells cheaper copycats,  undercutting us. We're talking nuclear power generators, solar cells,  computer hardware, software, and more.</p><p> Let's get to Edward Lawrence in D.C. with more on that Huawei arrest.  Edward? </p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Liz. And don't forget,  circuit boards. That was a huge thing that Chinese put out. And right now,  the arrest of chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou threatens to destabilize  the fragile trade negotiations that have been going on between the U.S. and  China. </p><p> China calling for Canada to release the Huawei CFO. A spokesperson for the  Chinese foreign ministry says, \"The detention of a person without giving a  clear reason is of course a violation of the human rights to the person, or  of the person.\" </p><p> Now China claims they don't know the reason that she was detained. She is  being investigated by the U.S. for possible violations for breaking the  sanctions related to Iran. Now, the timing of arrest is interesting. She  was being detained in Canada the same day President Donald Trump worked out  a path forward on trade talks with China. </p><p> The national security advisor John Bolton told NPR that he was made aware  of the arrest and that it would happen. The White House, though, telling us  that the president did not know about it before he met with President Xi.  Regardless, some senators applauding the U.S. for sticking to its morals.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. MARK WARNER, (D) VIRGINIA:  My fear is when the Trump administration  is going to crumble on Huawei the same way they crumbled on ZTE. And as we  think about particularly we move to the next generation of wireless 5G and  that transformation is as big as anything that we've seen in the wireless  industry. And my fear is that China could be successful at setting the  standards and dominating that market.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  And national security advisor John Bolton also told NPR that  this is a Justice Department matter and they don't always tell the  president what they are doing. Liz?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Great to see you, Edward. Thank you so much.</p><p> Joining me now is Zach Mottl, he is a top executive at Atlas Tool Works.  This is a company that has had a front row seat for years watching China's  high-tech theft. We welcome you to the show, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p> ZACH MOTTL, CHIEF ALIGNMENT OFFICER, ATLAS TOOL WORKS:  Great to be here,  Elizabeth.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Your company makes precision parts for the internet, radar  systems, medical devices. What do you guys seeing, is President Trump right  about China stealing to make China great again. </p><p> MOTTL:  He's absolutely right. You know, Huawei has built a $90 billion  global enterprise based on commercial espionage, theft of western  technology. You know, my customers are offered -- my business has been  around for 100 years, and for 90 out of the 100 years we were a vendor in  the telecom industry. That was a really important sector for myself and  many other manufacturers like me.</p><p> And we watched as Chinese manufacturers Huawei ZTE came online, and in 20  years they wiped out every single western competitor. Lucent Technologies,  Tellabs, Nortel Networks in Canada. Every one of these companies could not  compete against commercial espionage and state subsidized technology.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Because they're undercutting us taking our jobs, our R&amp;D that  we pay for and then making cheaper copycats. Sir, isn't this a big wake-up  call to Congress to say, you know a what, knock it off about the media  grandstanding before, you know, the D.C. cameras and get on the stick.  Because China has a built-in road project that made in China 2025 project.</p><p> I mean, Obama, President Obama did try to stop China, but it's really up to  Congress to get our trade laws updated to knock it, to get it to knock it  off, right?</p><p> MOTTL:  That's right. This telecom industry was the crown jewel of America  and it portray laws and lack of oversight by Congress has allow the Chinese  to steal this. Let's not lose one more high-tech industry. And quite  frankly, let's bring the telephone manufacturing industry back here. </p><p> We're about to have 5G, and you know, we can worry about the security or we  can simply make it here and know that it's good. Because what we've learned  with this Huawei case and so many other cases, is that we just can't trust  the Chinese. They say one thing, but they do something completely  different. So, I'm hoping Congress will step up to the plate here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We hope so too, because this is got to stop, sir. I mean, this  should be hair on fire and break the glass time right now in D.C.</p><p> MOTTL:  That's right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Because to your point, we just cited these other countries  worried about Huawei. Also, you mentioned 5G. China is embedding itself and  the fears it's going to go into that new 5G rollout worldwide. That's the  internet of things. That's wearable fitness trackers. It's robots, taxis  and the like. </p><p> I mean, if China gets to jump on that and starts embedding itself in 5G,  wow, game over.</p><p> MOTTL:  That's right. And they're counting on, you know, they're taking  advantage of the free market. They are going to undercut price and they are  going to subsidize it to try to buy the market. We cannot let that happen.  We need to put laws in place and we need our other country partners to work  with us to shut them out of the market. Because again, we just cannot trust  them. And when they say they are not spying I certainly think they are.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All this breathtakingly tedious grandstanding in D.C. over it,  and they are setting aside what really matters and that's what you're  talking about. Because, sir, look what happened to U.S. Steel. U.S. Steel  spent tons of money to pioneer a new lighter, higher grade steel product  for cars and planes, but then China hacked it and hacked its computers,  stole the blueprints and started selling copycats steel at way cheaper  prices, right?</p><p> MOTTL:  When profit doesn't matter to these companies and they have a  government behind them helping them cheat and steal, how can we compete? We  need to do it smarter. And what it comes down to is jobs. It's not just  about high-tech and innovation. It's about jobs. It's about national  security. </p><p> And the employees like mine, you know, when I lost my telecom customers in  the early 2000, we have to lay people off. We reinvented ourselves, but a  lot of other companies couldn't. Telecom and so many other sectors are  really important. We're talking about good jobs for Americans versus growth  and good jobs for people in China. I want to see it made here and I want to  see it secure and safe so we can trust what's going through our network.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And now, we got indications that China made in behind that  massive Marriott hack affecting half a billion people potentially. Wow.</p><p> MOTTL:  It's pervasive. It is pervasive and everything that they do they  just simply play by a different set of rules, so they can tell us one thing  but we know they are going to do something else. We can't trust them. </p><p> So, I'm pleased to see President Trump, you know, holding firm. I trust his  judgment here and I hope that Congress is going to come along and finally  join the wise party because they are really missing the boat by not  protecting America and our information.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, you know what, you know, if Congress doesn't it, the  voter could and probably will. Zach Mottl of Atlas Tool Works, thanks for  coming in. We'd like you to come on again soon, sir. </p><p> MOTTL:  We'll see you soon, Elizabeth. Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you. Let's get Ned Ryun's reaction. Ned Ryun is one  of the top analysts out there, he's been watching D.C. Ned, I want your  reaction to the conversation we just had.</p><p> NED RYUN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  Well, I got to tell you, I  mean, initially, when you have a clip of Senator Warren saying -- Warner  saying about the fifth-generation 5G networks and Huawei, I mean, that's  one of things. </p><p> I wrote about this for Fox News during the week of Thanksgiving, Liz, in  which I said we have to be very careful because there is a proxy battle  being fought right now between United States and China between QUALCOMM and  Huawei over who's going to control that 5G network, and you are right. </p><p> The implications for the internet of things, right now there is about eight  billion internet of things devices. That number is probably going to triple  in the next three years. And who's going to control the networks and the  data is going to be massive as we move forward into the future.</p><p> And on the other front, you're right. I mean, they have been robbing us  blind. We have helped build the largest authoritarian police state in China  with really bad trade deals, and now we have looked the other way as they  literally over the last probably 10 years, Liz, I've seen estimates about  three trillion are in technology theft and between theft and force  technology transfers that we basically incentivize and given them the means  to compete with us on the technology front, but also on the economic front  and they're not shy about it. </p><p> They are gunning for us. They want to replace us as the center of the  economic world. And right now, for in the past, we've been lightening them  get away with it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know what, there's that and there's also this other  geopolitical risk that the White House is trying to address as well, Ned.  Look at this. New satellite images reveal activity and an unidentified  North Korean missile base. </p><p> So that's also a neck of the woods. What's you take on that?</p><p> RYUN:  Well, my take on this, is again, this has been the failure of the  three previous administrations kicking the can down the road of refusing to  actually deal with the North Korean threat. And now Trump has been  confronted with it. He realizes we cannot have this existential threat with  North Korea having nuclear armaments and being able to literally at some  point in the not-too-distant future have the ability to drop warheads on  American cities. </p><p> The key to this, though, Liz, and it's all, again, like you said, it's all  interconnected. We actually need China to play ball with us on North Korea  to deal with this threat. And so, this whole trade dispute taking place  with China, all of this stuff is interconnected. We have to figure out how  to see China accommodate our interest in real life. They've got to  prioritize our interest.</p><p> And so, this whole trade deal is not only tied to bad trade deals and  intellectual theft. It's also tied to how we deal with North Korea as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. And to your point, China's military has been boosting the  number of warplane intrusions into South Korea airspace, nearly doubling  the number of times in recent years. Your take on that.</p><p> RYUN:  Well, I mean, China, the amazing part to me is how brash China is  and we're acting, we are letting them get away with this. They have been  waging this economic war. They've been threatening us. They've been doing  building these islands in the South China Seas and we've just been sitting  there as though, we, you know, we don't know what they're up to. We know  exactly what they are up to. And I think it's time. </p><p> Obviously, if we can really deal this economic trade and put them on notice  I think we can start to deal with some of these military threats as well. </p><p> Trump is right to do this and I know that some people are worried about  this tariff fight. I will say this, Liz. If we do not confront China now in  the next few years, I'm convinced we will regret it for the next hundred  years. Because China does not want trade partners. China wants tributary  nations. And if we are not careful, if we deal with this trade threat and  these bad trade deals and this theft of our intellectual property we're not  going to like where we're at in 10 or 15 years.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, you make a great point there. Let's move over to  what's going on in Russia, Ned. I'd like your reaction to Russia doing some  saber rattling, showing off new laser weapons after the U.S. is threatening  to pull out of missile, that missile treaty dating back to the 80s because  of Russia cheating. What's your take on that?</p><p> RYUN:  I go back to, you know, despite all the left screaming buddy  murderer about Trump being too cozy with Putin, he is actually been pretty  aggressive with him, especially on the energy front. Over 50 percent of  Russia's, the Russian governments income comes from oil and gas exports.  And Trump knows what he's doing on this front.</p><p> Obviously, he confronted Merkel on Nord Stream II and Russia importing even  more natural gas to Germany, and Trump said you can't do that. He's also  gone in and address a lot of the middle and eastern and European countries  and the three C's initiative in which he is trying to get them off of  Russian energy. </p><p> Because he realizes, Trump realizes if you can cut off Russian exports in  these energy areas of gas and oil, he's going to undermine all this other  stuff that's taking place. So, he's focused on the right things. He has to  cut off the Europeans from getting or being wholly dependent or  significantly dependent on Russian energy. And if he can do that, I think  he's going to really be able to put Putin in his place.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Thank you, Ned Ryun. Great to see you. Come back soon.</p><p> RYUN:  Thanks, Liz. We'll do.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Next case, this morning 1000 friends and family attended the  funeral service at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston to say a final  farewell to President George H.W. Bush.</p><p> In attendance, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris, baseball legends Nolan  Ryan, and Tommy Lasorda. And also, country singers Crystal Gayle and Larry  Gatlin. The funeral train carry the casket of our 41st president a short  time ago to the presidential library at Texas A&amp;M University. </p><p> The president was laid to rest alongside his wife Barbara.</p><p> We're going to be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. tech execs from Google, Microsoft, and Oracle met  today at the White House with Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Larry Kudlow and  others to talk about securing U.S. manufacturing dominance, and artificial  intelligence, quantum computing, and more. Facebook executives not  attending.</p><p> But to the real fireworks. The fight in D.C. with G.M. G.M. CEO Mary Barra  met again today with lawmakers. They are pretty upset over G.M.'s big tax  breaks in the face of G.M. plants -- plans to shut factories and lay off  14,000 workers.</p><p> Look at this. FiatChrysler, though, plans to open a new factory in  Detroit.</p><p> Let's bring in Republican Ohio Congressman Warren Davidson. Good to see  you, sir. </p><p> REP. WARREN DAVIDSON, (R) OHIO:  Good to talk with you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, people are upset that G.M. keeps coming all the time  with tin cap in hand getting a lot of federal bailout help, and wait for  it, a lot of state tax breaks and bailout help too. And you know, Ohio gave  G.M. a ton of tax breaks, but now that factories are closing. What's your  take on this?</p><p> DAVIDSON:  You know, it's truly disappointing. And I've been in Congress  now for about two and half years, but prior to that, for the previous 15  years I was in manufacturing. So, when you talk the intersection of big  tech and automotive, they're really more interconnected than you would  imagine. </p><p> So, when Mary Barra came and talked with the Ohio delegation, she really  led with the transformation that the auto industry is confronting. And you  know, one of the points that I wanted to make is, you know, the good news  is, is unlike in '08, '09 when this was happening, Ohio strong and growing.  G.M. is anomaly our states hiring. </p><p> I offered to drive our economic development folks up to do a job fair at  the plant. So, G.M. is offering those folks jobs I'm sure the eighth  district would be happy to have them.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. But here's the thing. We've been watching and I've been  watching G.M. for years. I've been doing business journalism for three  decades. I was at the Wall Street Journal. I was an editor at Forbes. I've  been writing about G.M. for a long time, sir. </p><p> Here's the problem. Here's one of the issues. Ohio in 2008 gave state  income tax breaks to G.M., saying you don't have to pay 75 percent of your  income taxes to the state of Ohio over the next 15 years. </p><p> So, here's the thing. Should elected officials say once and for all, OK,  we'll give you, Mr. car company or Mr. G.M., a tax break, with the caveat  that you have to show us how you will build factories that you can retool  to make -- to make either smaller or bigger vehicles when gas prices go up  or down. Other car companies do that, why can't G.M.?</p><p> DAVIDSON:  Well, the good news is Honda's been doing that. They reinvested,  the Honda Accord wasn't selling as well as they thought. The CRV is selling  way better, I think two-thirds of the cars on the road that are in demand  right now our crossovers, SUVs or trucks. And Honda who is a huge anchor  for Ohio has been very adaptive. </p><p> G.M. not quite as flexible. There's a lot of history behind that. And you  know, frankly, some of the things were the government has been involved  that shows frankly, the government should be not try to run these  companies. We don't need more central planning.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Got that. Check that. Understood. I hear totally what you're  saying. I don't mean to interrupt. But that is agreed upon. We don't want  that. We don't want the government in there. But G.M. does really rapidly  come with a tin cap getting our tax help.</p><p> I mean, it's striking, sir, that we're -- that, you know, that FiatChrysler is now opening a factory in Detroit. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Yes. I mean, that's great. And you know, we'll see where that  goes for G.M. You know, I think they've been outperformed by a number of  companies that's why they have to come hot in hand and begging for help.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, that's been going on for decades.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'm telling you that's been going on for decades. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. Not to mention the subsidies that are going on to  try to steer consumers to buy this car or that car.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  And the areas (Ph) of government shouldn't be trying to steer  that. And the good news for G.M. is maybe they finally got the message as,  you are not going to get any more bailouts. The American people don't want  to bail you out nor anyone else, and so you are going to have to take care  of your balance sheet and do the right things.</p><p> So, I was impressed that Mary Barra came and was proactively speaking to us  on the hill. But yes, very sad news about the investment in Lordstown,  Ohio, in particular.</p><p> MACDONALD:  But you know what, but what about putting the feet to the fire.  I understand. I watch Mary Barra. We have a lot of respect for her. She is  a great CEO. But listen closely to what she says, OK. A lot of that is a  lot of P.R. talk. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You got to get to the nuts and bolts. Is she going to move jobs  to other factories in the U.S.? And you know, is she going to stop  outsourcing to Mexico? We understand the economics of it, but we also  understand the economics of giving out tax breaks when you're not, you  know, building factories that are flexible, right? Final word.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. And when you look at where the intellectual property  and the tech is, the good news is a lot of that happened in the U.S. and  when you tie that to what you're talking about earlier is the tech folks  coming to the White House. </p><p> The Foreign Investment Risk Reduction Modernization Act, that was one of  the biggest piece of registration that the House financial services  committee move this past year. It was an honor to work on it. Really our  country is going to be more secure, our country is going to be stronger. </p><p> And frankly, if we can complement that with a good reform to privacy so  that we can make sure that whether it's on the internet or in your car or  in app that you download on the phone it's always your data as a consumer.  And I was impressed that was one of the questions I put to Mary is that it  is an opt in practice for G.M. in the car.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  And so, I hope we can do that more and I hope that they'll see  that the competitive advantage in the United States means they should  continue to invest including in Ohio. We have a tremendous supply chain and  folks are happy to supply them.</p><p> MACDONALD:  There's great people in Ohio. Great people in Michigan, great  people in the heartland. Congressman Warren Davidson, thank you so much. We  really appreciate it. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's get to other headline news. Search and rescue efforts  still underway after two U.S. military planes collided in midair and crash  off the coast of Japan overnight. It happened during a refueling exercise.  One marine killed, another in fair condition. </p><p> However, five marines still missing. Our thoughts and prayers are with the  families there.</p><p> A Southwest Airlines flight get it off the runway upon landing in heavy  rain at Burbank Airport in California.

We've got one of the best columnists and thinkers out there. Tammy  Bruce is coming up.</p><p> But first, Congress kicked of the can down the road again. Another  temporary spending budget. What are we sending them to D.C. for? It means  you may see a government shut down by just in time for Christmas. We're  going to tell you what they're fighting about now and why this is the best  case for term limits. We're at the bottom of the hour. Stay there. Back in  two.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're watching the Fox Business Network. To  government spending, again, Congress passing a temporary interim spending  bill today that is going to let the government be funded for two more  weeks, really is just kicking the can down the road again. Congress will  have to vote on this again before midnight on December 21st.</p><p> Joining me now, Trump 2020 campaign advisory board member Madison Gesiotto  and Democrat strategist Al Mottur. I know you guys love talking about this.  Madison, look at this, from Pew Research, you're not going to believe it.  Congress has only managed to pass all required appropriations measures on  time, wait for it, just four times since fiscal 1977. Is this an argument  for term limits. I mean, what do we send them into D.C. to do?</p><p> MADISON GESIOTTO, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, NATIONAL  DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP:  It's one of the many arguments for term  limits. I mean, Congress seems repeatedly every single year do not be able  to do their job. I remember last Christmas, we talked about the same thing.</p><p> Every single year, they are never meeting the requirements, they are never  doing their job. It's such a shame that we continue to have to talk about  this. For over 20 years, they haven't met the requirements. So those four  times between 1977 and 1997, it's frustrating.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. So here's the thing, Al. This is what I'm wondering if we  should do. You know what, Congress, it's sort of like telling your children  to go to their room until you get the job done. We're going to sequester  you in D.C., no grandstanding for the cameras, no campaigning, no political  rallies, no fundraising, you got to be quarantined in D.C. and get a  spending bill on time. How about that?</p><p> AL MOTTUR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Hey, we might as well try it. I mean,  look, you're on to something when you say no campaigning, no fundraising.  The politics have taken over the dynamic in the Congress and there is way  too much time spent on the phone dialing for dollars and don't have enough  time doing work for the American people. That's on both sides of the aisle.  There's got to be a way to stop it. Maybe term limits is part of the  answer. I think campaign finance reform is another.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, Pelosi now says she won't accept a pretty decent DACA  deal in exchange for border wall funding. That's what it has come down to  right now. What do you think?</p><p> GESIOTTO:  I think what's frustrating about what she is doing is the fact  that she is unwilling to compromise. I mean, when we look at Congress and  the idea of why we have two parties and why we have Democrats and  Republicans in Congress work together is because they need to compromise to  get to the end solution.</p><p> Sometimes, you are going to have to give a little to get a little. The  Republicans have tried to do that on many issues. Of course, they are not  perfect. But the Democrats slightly have really let their hate for our  president overcome their ability to get anything done.</p><p> MOTTUR:  That's not what is going on here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  It feels like it's going on. Go ahead, Al. Finish your point.</p><p> MOTTUR:  No, it's not. I mean, the parties for two decades have been unable  to do immigration compromise. I agree we have to compromise. It's not  because --</p><p> MACDONALD:  But they are purposely politicizing the border. That's the  issue. We know that for a fact from internal e-mails --</p><p> MOTTUR:  Both sides are politicizing the border, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We know for a fact from internal e-mails that Democrat Super  PAC say that's the way to go in order to get that voter. But here's the  thing. Democrats, Al, and you've talked about this too, starting in 2005,  2006 and all the way through 2013, said yeah, to border security. Just get  it done. We have this moment in time after the George H.W. Bush funeral,  that there seems to be some kind of unity. Get it done.</p><p> MOTTUR:  I don't think the president would accept the border wall for a  DACA deal, first of all. And second of all, the president --</p><p> MACDONALD:  We did have one. He had a DACA deal, 1.3 million DACA, to do a  border wall. The Americans want it. They don't our security dealt with like  a political football.</p><p> MOTTUR:  I wish we could compromise on immigration. It's not just right  now. It's not hatred for this president. It has been going on for a long  time.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Should get it done now. Should get it done yesterday. How about  that?</p><p> MOTTUR:  I am for it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Go ahead, Madison.</p><p> GESIOTTO:  You know, Al, you are saying that's simply not true, that the  Democrats are willing to compromise. When you look back 10, 20 years, we  just actually talked about this with Liz last week, the Democrats supported  many of the things that they are now going against when it comes to  immigration.</p><p> So that is your perfect and prime example right there as to why their hate  for our president has changed their views and clouded their judgment when  it comes to the immigration issue specifically.</p><p> MOTTUR:  I don't believe it's about hate to the president. I believe it's  on both sides, Republicans and Democrats --</p><p> GESIOTTO:  Obstruction --</p><p> MOTTUR:  -- pulling the football away.</p><p> GESIOTTO:  We can use any word there.</p><p> MOTTUR:  -- Charlie Brown. And Trump does it too.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK, Al, maybe we can all move beyond that and just tell D.C.,  your voice, Al, and Madison's voice, and the viewer and the people out  there saying, you know what, we're done with you, D.C., we're over it. It's  sort of like you tell a child to go to your room until you clean it. Get it  done.</p><p> MOTTUR:  Maybe if there were thermal on Madison (ph), I can go up there and  get it done.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, I'll tell you something. It's just astonishing. I  want your reaction, Al. Congress has managed only four times since fiscal  1977, just four times, to pass all of its required spending measures on  time. Really?</p><p> MOTTUR:  It's ridiculous. They ought to be here more than three days a  week. They ought to be here four, five days a week.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> MOTTUR:  And that would help. Fundraising is a problem. Like I said, term  limits could be part of the solution. But there is no incentive for them to  get this done because there is no punishment.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right, because this is term limits. Madison and Al, thank you  so much. Great fun --</p><p> MOTTUR:  Great to be with you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey will testify  privately behind closed doors on Capitol Hill tomorrow. It will be  transcribed and then released to the public within 24 hours. But how will  the media report on that? Will you get to the truth on what James Comey  said? We're going to break it down.</p><p> But first, why a border wall could save thousands of lives every year?  Tammy Bruce on that. We're going to explain after the break. Back in two.  Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know when something is staring right at you and you say  eureka (ph) of course, absolutely. My next guest has that moment for you,  says President Trump's border wall could help save thousands of lives.  Joining me now, Fox News political contributor, Independent Women's Voice  president, great columnist, writer, Tammy Bruce.</p><p> TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  I'm glad you got to check.  Thank you, dear. Look, my column is up today. This is not new. This is not  new news. What was shocking to me was the CDC report that came out about  last week, that noted and obviously should alarm all of us, that the drug  overdose deaths and suicides are at historic highs, right?</p><p> In just 2017, over 72,000 people died from drug overdoses. That is more  than the U.S. deaths in the Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. In  one year in this country, suicides are at their historic high, about 49,000  suicides also in 2017.</p><p> The CDC doesn't want to speculate, they say, on the cause. But what they do  recognize also is the importation of drugs, the opioid epidemic, people now  moving from prescription drug dynamic because we are at war with that, so  they turn to heroin. And then there is fentanyl which is now the new  synthetic opioid which kills you pretty much right away. It's a tiny, tiny  amount that will kill you.</p><p> We got single individuals bringing into the country, and somebody was  caught just a few weeks ago, bringing over enough that would kill 300  million Americans, and because it takes so little to end up killing you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> BRUCE:  This is at the border. Eighty percent of the fentanyl in this  country comes in through the southern border, and also China is involved in  that facilitation as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  It's just two milligrams. We just show that stat, 78 million.  That's based on the amount of fentanyl seized at the border last year and  the first quarter of this year. Life expectancy has been dragged down by  what is going on.</p><p> BRUCE:  That is correct, because you got middle aged individuals, right?  You got -- those are the individuals who are dying too early because of the  drug addiction and because of suicide. Look, one thing we know about  suicide is it's usually not one issue. It can be a multitude of issues. But  when you're also dealing with drug addiction, any addiction, certainly  alcoholism, but the opioid addiction creates hopelessness.</p><p> We've dealt with now -- thank goodness in the economic recovery, but the  last 10 years, people losing their homes, losing their savings, losing  their jobs. That combined with drug addiction. And then of course President  Obama, we lost our hospitals and our doctors and any real access to health  care. That we think of course has contributed to the nature of the suicide  choice. So it is  -- that in it of itself, because of the core of the  people affected is dragging down the U.S. life expectancy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Astonishing, that finding. You know, President Trump is saying  China will try to stop the importation of fentanyl into our country. That's  part of the trade deal. But Thomas Homan, to your point, former acting ICE  director, said, you know, having the troops at the border is making the  drug cartels berserk and crazy. He told us that on the show last week.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yeah. You know, he is -- what they have done is, because of the  caravan, we've obviously boosted up the numbers, and the cartels which have  relied on kind of a lax framework are furious because it is affecting their  ability to move the drugs in.</p><p> This is why when we talk about the wall, it is not just about we need an  orderly framework that happens at the border, but we must take seriously  what's going on and how these drugs are moving into the country, when 80  percent of fentanyl is coming in through the southern border.</p><p> And by the way, the majority of heroin as well is not coming from  Afghanistan, it's grown in Mexico. It's cultivated there and moved in  through Mexico. So the wall is something that not only are we dealing with  keeping bad guys out and killers and all of that and human trafficking, but  to stop this.</p><p> When you got three wars of the deaths combined including Vietnam in one  year, how is this not a war? All the American people deserve to be taken  seriously and to have --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Is it Trump's White House capitalizing on this, what you're  talking about?</p><p> BRUCE:  Look, they have got to talk more about the other issues that are  involving the wall and why this matters. People know the opioid crisis and  the prescription drugs, right, OxyContin. We know that there is a heroin  problem. People don't know that people have gone to street drugs when they  can't get a prescription. And where is that coming from? When you think of  heroin, when you think of a poppy fields in Afghanistan --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> BRUCE:  They got to talk more about this. This transcends political  parties, economic status, all of those things. And I wish the president  would speak more about it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Tammy Bruce, you're going to be with us later in the show.  Great information there. Wow! We had a jam-packed hour. Coming up, a major  arrest of illegals in Massachusetts. More than 50 illegal immigrants busted  in a multi-day swift (ph) in New England. Look at this. Three of them  wanted for murder.</p><p> But first, it's the testimony we have been waiting for. Tomorrow, former  FBI Director James Comey, he is going to get a Capitol Hill grilling behind  closed doors. But how will the media report on that? That's next. Stay  there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. Tomorrow, House Republicans will finally get  their chance to grill former FBI Director James Comey behind closed doors  about his actions and anti-Trump bias infecting the top levels of the FBI  during the election. Again, behind closed doors. The transcript will be  made public within 24 hours of that sessions. Joe Concha is a media  reporter for The Hill. He joins us now. So how are they going to report on  it? What do you think, Joe?</p><p> JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL:  Well, if it's going to be made  public in 24 hours, then I would imagine something because nothing gets  slip (ph) in Washington. Everything gets slip (ph) in Washington. Within an  hour, somebody is going to have to use the bathroom, there will be a call  from some reporter and then you're going to hear about it. But at least  everything is going to be out in 24 hours, sometimes that doesn't happen.</p><p> I think they got the wrong guy here, Liz. I want to know why Rod Rosenstein  isn't being called before Congress. He is the guy just nine weeks ago who  said, yeah, you know, I think I'll wear a wire and try to trap the  president, try to get him on tape to compel his cabinet to invoke the 25th  Amendment. I would have had him on there instead.</p><p> But, OK, we have Comey. Here's the thing about Comey. He's an open book.  Literally he's an open book. He wrote a book in April. He did a thousand  interviews after that. I might be exaggerating. Most probably dozens and  dozens. So everything seems to be out there already, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I hear what you're saying because -- let's be clear. This is  about Trump-hating, pro-Hillary FBI director and there are talks about  stopping Trump, impeaching Trump. Really the issue is that FISA warrant to  basically surveil Trump campaign aides because it looks like they really  did break the regulations in getting that FISA warrant, right?</p><p> CONCHA:  It appears that way. Absolutely. So, but I wonder, Comey who is a  very good public speaker, we could agree on that, when he's done his  testimonies, it has been the type of thing where he seems to be pretty  measured in his responses. He is ready for whatever question --</p><p> MACDONALD:  He has got to answer. Did you tell the FISA court that it was  funded by the Democrats, partly, you even said it was unverified on  salacious. Did you know at the time that it was unverified? Did you tell  the court that, right?</p><p> CONCHA:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You got to get that out of him.</p><p> CONCHA:  And if so, why? Was it because --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Why you --</p><p> CONCHA:  -- the president.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> CONCHA:  Right, exactly. Why didn't you pursue going down this particular  route? I also want to know why he leaked a private conversation or  conversations that he had with the president over dinner at the White  House, then leaked everything he talked about to a friend at Columbia  University, who then gave it too The New York Times, and he admits for the  sole purpose of compelling a special counsel to be appointed, and it  happened. How is that not illegal?</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We want -- can we have you back on to talk about it?</p><p> CONCHA:  Absotively (ph).</p><p> MACDONALD:  Absotively (ph). Joe Concha. That's great. Good to see you,  sir. Coming up, we are going to get to that ICE arrest. More than 50  illegals including three wanted for murder in sanctuary city friendly New  England. We're going to have Tammy Bruce back on that. Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. ICE arresting more than 50 illegal immigrants  over the past two days. It happened across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New  Hampshire, and Connecticut. Among those arrested, three immigrants,  illegals from Brazil, wanted there for murder.</p><p> The ICE raids taking place the very same week that the Massachusetts  Republican governor said, you know what, a state judge must temporarily  step down after that judge let an undocumented immigrant here basically  sneak out a backdoor to avoid ICE agents waiting to take him into custody.</p><p> Tammy Bruce is back with us. First on that story, Tammy, great to have you  back.</p><p> BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  That illegal that sneaked out (ph) the backdoor had been  deported multiple times for multiple drug arrests. And now the judge let  him go at the backdoor.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yeah. It is interesting. During the court proceedings, the judge  called them up to the bench, and the judge asked for the recording to stop.  And that is when suddenly when that went back on and they resumed, there  was suddenly some machinations there to have the charges dropped.</p><p> And then somehow, the defense attorney was able to walk the defendant out  through a side door back through which would not have been allowed without  it being facilitated and being able to avoid as there was also (ph) ICE  agents.</p><p> Some judges and immigration advocates of course don't want ICE agents to be  able to go into courthouses. They have argued that they have to stay  outside and that seems to be changing a little bit. There is argument about  that. This is one of the reasons why they want that to be able to be in the  courthouses to deal with this kind of stuff.</p><p> MACDONALD:  What a story. And we have seen another courts.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yes, this judge, understandably, they think the judge should not be  hearing any federal cases because if you are really obstructing law  enforcement, why should you be on the bench? I mean, as a judge, you are  supposed to be implementing the laws.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> BRUCE:  And adjudicating them as opposed to helping a defendant sneak out  to get away from federal law enforcement. That's crazy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  She hears criminal cases. Are you going to let other criminals  go?</p><p> BRUCE:  Right. No matter -- look, they are human beings. We all have  opinions on the issues. But if you're willing to skirt the law and allow  someone else to do so, what else are you doing that is not fair?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's get to the swifts (ph) in New England. The 50 arrested  illegal immigrants selling opioids. You have been talking about that.</p><p> BRUCE:  Oh, yeah. This is our prior discussion. This is the big deal.  Trafficking in heroin. Trafficking in fentanyl. These are not drug users,  these are traffickers. And so this is where -- it is also a reminder to  people what ICE does. This is inside the country. It's the internal  framework.</p><p> They do not handle the border. They deal with criminals, the gangs, the  drug traffickers, sex traffickers, kidnappers, murderers, getting these  three Brazilians who are wanted for murder in that country, that's what ICE  does.</p><p> This is the organization that many Democrats want to abolish. That would be  a mistake because the people that are targeted and affected first and  victimized first are the communities of immigrants.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right, that's a point.</p><p> BRUCE:  This is who we are trying to protect here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right. But, you know, here is the other point about the story.  Several towns in Massachusetts here, they're sanctuary cities. It's Boston,  Cambridge, Lawrence and Newton. These are the cities where these  individuals have been detained.</p><p> BRUCE:  That's right. So the people that were scooped up had been in  custody. And then were released. Again, you think, well, was this somebody  who was driving under the influence or somebody who made a mistake? No,  these are drug traffickers. These are very serious individuals.</p><p> MACDONALD:  But the victims of the crimes are treated like rounding errors  in D.C. There is not a human being behind it that is treated --</p><p> BRUCE:  Big government, whether it is about health care or even law  enforcement. When people become the budget and you become a chit on a piece  of paper, you stop being a human being. This is why local law enforcement  matters. You know, judges matter.</p><p> They are supposed to see the individuals and yet they claim it is because  they are sensitive to immigrants, but this kind of action re-victimizes  immigrants. Legal immigrants who are playing by the rules and even  undocumented people who are also playing by the rules. Those are the people  that are protected by ICE.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Great stuff again from Tammy Bruce. You're going to come back  soon.</p><p> BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'll look forward to it. Thank you so much for having us in  your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on the  Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It  was down nearly 800 points, and then down about 80 points, doing a major  rethink after the initial freak out, panicked attack over the arrest that  U.S. request in Canada of the CFO of Huawei, that's China's top tech giant. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> That CFO, the daughter of Huawei's founder, a former Chinese military  officer. She's arrested on charges that Huawei broke U.S. sanctions by  selling U.S. technology to Iran. We've got details on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But Wall Streeters now applauding President Trump's tough line in trade  talks with China because China is stealing to make China great again. We've  got fresh new details on that. And it has to stop. </p><p> What's going on we've got an insider who has a front row seat on how China  has hollowed out entire U.S. industries and taken U.S. jobs. And why Trump  is right to fix the problem that elected officials for years have done  nothing about.</p><p> The Dow down 8 percent since its October high. But take a breath for some  perspective. Historically it is normal to have these kinds of downturns. We  bring you what you need to know.</p><p> Plus, tech execs at the White House today on how to beat China and more.  But the real firework is a fight in D.C. over G.M. getting not just loathes  of federal bailout help but state bailout help and tax breaks too, where it  hardly pays any taxes as its closing U.S. factories and laying off  thousands of people before Christmastime, sending those factory jobs to  Mexico. We've got the back story to FBN's exclusive with CEO Mary Barra. </p><p> Also, Democrat in-fighting over border wall funding. Nancy Pelosi now  saying she will not even accept a decent DACA deal in exchange for border  wall funding. People sick and tired of D.C. politics.</p><p> This as we bring you two big border scandals now hurting Americans. </p><p> Well, thank you for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money, politics. We  got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. The  Evening Edit starts right now. </p><p> OK. Let's get to the China outrage over the arrest of Huawei's CFO. They  are now demanding her release accusing the U.S. and Canada of quote,  \"wrongdoing.\" This is over violating Iran sanctions. But Wall Street  analysts point out other countries are saying Huawei is pretty bad. </p><p> Australia, New Zealand, Britain's telecom B.T. all kicked out Huawei over  fears that Huawei is stealing and spying giving its ties to China's  military. And they say President Trump is right. China for years has been  hollowing out U.S. jobs and entire U.S. industries, not funding its own  R&amp;D, but instead, stealing our research to make China great again. </p><p> Our companies pay for that research. China then sells cheaper copycats,  undercutting us. We're talking nuclear power generators, solar cells,  computer hardware, software, and more.</p><p> Let's get to Edward Lawrence in D.C. with more on that Huawei arrest.  Edward? </p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Liz. And don't forget,  circuit boards. That was a huge thing that Chinese put out. And right now,  the arrest of chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou threatens to destabilize  the fragile trade negotiations that have been going on between the U.S. and  China. </p><p> China calling for Canada to release the Huawei CFO. A spokesperson for the  Chinese foreign ministry says, \"The detention of a person without giving a  clear reason is of course a violation of the human rights to the person, or  of the person.\" </p><p> Now China claims they don't know the reason that she was detained. She is  being investigated by the U.S. for possible violations for breaking the  sanctions related to Iran. Now, the timing of arrest is interesting. She  was being detained in Canada the same day President Donald Trump worked out  a path forward on trade talks with China. </p><p> The national security advisor John Bolton told NPR that he was made aware  of the arrest and that it would happen. The White House, though, telling us  that the president did not know about it before he met with President Xi.  Regardless, some senators applauding the U.S. for sticking to its morals.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. MARK WARNER, (D) VIRGINIA:  My fear is when the Trump administration  is going to crumble on Huawei the same way they crumbled on ZTE. And as we  think about particularly we move to the next generation of wireless 5G and  that transformation is as big as anything that we've seen in the wireless  industry. And my fear is that China could be successful at setting the  standards and dominating that market.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  And national security advisor John Bolton also told NPR that  this is a Justice Department matter and they don't always tell the  president what they are doing. Liz?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Great to see you, Edward. Thank you so much.</p><p> Joining me now is Zach Mottl, he is a top executive at Atlas Tool Works.  This is a company that has had a front row seat for years watching China's  high-tech theft. We welcome you to the show, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p> ZACH MOTTL, CHIEF ALIGNMENT OFFICER, ATLAS TOOL WORKS:  Great to be here,  Elizabeth.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Your company makes precision parts for the internet, radar  systems, medical devices. What do you guys seeing, is President Trump right  about China stealing to make China great again. </p><p> MOTTL:  He's absolutely right. You know, Huawei has built a $90 billion  global enterprise based on commercial espionage, theft of western  technology. You know, my customers are offered -- my business has been  around for 100 years, and for 90 out of the 100 years we were a vendor in  the telecom industry. That was a really important sector for myself and  many other manufacturers like me.</p><p> And we watched as Chinese manufacturers Huawei ZTE came online, and in 20  years they wiped out every single western competitor. Lucent Technologies,  Tellabs, Nortel Networks in Canada. Every one of these companies could not  compete against commercial espionage and state subsidized technology.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Because they're undercutting us taking our jobs, our R&amp;D that  we pay for and then making cheaper copycats. Sir, isn't this a big wake-up  call to Congress to say, you know a what, knock it off about the media  grandstanding before, you know, the D.C. cameras and get on the stick.  Because China has a built-in road project that made in China 2025 project.</p><p> I mean, Obama, President Obama did try to stop China, but it's really up to  Congress to get our trade laws updated to knock it, to get it to knock it  off, right?</p><p> MOTTL:  That's right. This telecom industry was the crown jewel of America  and it portray laws and lack of oversight by Congress has allow the Chinese  to steal this. Let's not lose one more high-tech industry. And quite  frankly, let's bring the telephone manufacturing industry back here. </p><p> We're about to have 5G, and you know, we can worry about the security or we  can simply make it here and know that it's good. Because what we've learned  with this Huawei case and so many other cases, is that we just can't trust  the Chinese. They say one thing, but they do something completely  different. So, I'm hoping Congress will step up to the plate here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We hope so too, because this is got to stop, sir. I mean, this  should be hair on fire and break the glass time right now in D.C.</p><p> MOTTL:  That's right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Because to your point, we just cited these other countries  worried about Huawei. Also, you mentioned 5G. China is embedding itself and  the fears it's going to go into that new 5G rollout worldwide. That's the  internet of things. That's wearable fitness trackers. It's robots, taxis  and the like. </p><p> I mean, if China gets to jump on that and starts embedding itself in 5G,  wow, game over.</p><p> MOTTL:  That's right. And they're counting on, you know, they're taking  advantage of the free market. They are going to undercut price and they are  going to subsidize it to try to buy the market. We cannot let that happen.  We need to put laws in place and we need our other country partners to work  with us to shut them out of the market. Because again, we just cannot trust  them. And when they say they are not spying I certainly think they are.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All this breathtakingly tedious grandstanding in D.C. over it,  and they are setting aside what really matters and that's what you're  talking about. Because, sir, look what happened to U.S. Steel. U.S. Steel  spent tons of money to pioneer a new lighter, higher grade steel product  for cars and planes, but then China hacked it and hacked its computers,  stole the blueprints and started selling copycats steel at way cheaper  prices, right?</p><p> MOTTL:  When profit doesn't matter to these companies and they have a  government behind them helping them cheat and steal, how can we compete? We  need to do it smarter. And what it comes down to is jobs. It's not just  about high-tech and innovation. It's about jobs. It's about national  security. </p><p> And the employees like mine, you know, when I lost my telecom customers in  the early 2000, we have to lay people off. We reinvented ourselves, but a  lot of other companies couldn't. Telecom and so many other sectors are  really important. We're talking about good jobs for Americans versus growth  and good jobs for people in China. I want to see it made here and I want to  see it secure and safe so we can trust what's going through our network.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And now, we got indications that China made in behind that  massive Marriott hack affecting half a billion people potentially. Wow.</p><p> MOTTL:  It's pervasive. It is pervasive and everything that they do they  just simply play by a different set of rules, so they can tell us one thing  but we know they are going to do something else. We can't trust them. </p><p> So, I'm pleased to see President Trump, you know, holding firm. I trust his  judgment here and I hope that Congress is going to come along and finally  join the wise party because they are really missing the boat by not  protecting America and our information.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, you know what, you know, if Congress doesn't it, the  voter could and probably will. Zach Mottl of Atlas Tool Works, thanks for  coming in. We'd like you to come on again soon, sir. </p><p> MOTTL:  We'll see you soon, Elizabeth. Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you. Let's get Ned Ryun's reaction. Ned Ryun is one  of the top analysts out there, he's been watching D.C. Ned, I want your  reaction to the conversation we just had.</p><p> NED RYUN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  Well, I got to tell you, I  mean, initially, when you have a clip of Senator Warren saying -- Warner  saying about the fifth-generation 5G networks and Huawei, I mean, that's  one of things. </p><p> I wrote about this for Fox News during the week of Thanksgiving, Liz, in  which I said we have to be very careful because there is a proxy battle  being fought right now between United States and China between QUALCOMM and  Huawei over who's going to control that 5G network, and you are right. </p><p> The implications for the internet of things, right now there is about eight  billion internet of things devices. That number is probably going to triple  in the next three years. And who's going to control the networks and the  data is going to be massive as we move forward into the future.</p><p> And on the other front, you're right. I mean, they have been robbing us  blind. We have helped build the largest authoritarian police state in China  with really bad trade deals, and now we have looked the other way as they  literally over the last probably 10 years, Liz, I've seen estimates about  three trillion are in technology theft and between theft and force  technology transfers that we basically incentivize and given them the means  to compete with us on the technology front, but also on the economic front  and they're not shy about it. </p><p> They are gunning for us. They want to replace us as the center of the  economic world. And right now, for in the past, we've been lightening them  get away with it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know what, there's that and there's also this other  geopolitical risk that the White House is trying to address as well, Ned.  Look at this. New satellite images reveal activity and an unidentified  North Korean missile base. </p><p> So that's also a neck of the woods. What's you take on that?</p><p> RYUN:  Well, my take on this, is again, this has been the failure of the  three previous administrations kicking the can down the road of refusing to  actually deal with the North Korean threat. And now Trump has been  confronted with it. He realizes we cannot have this existential threat with  North Korea having nuclear armaments and being able to literally at some  point in the not-too-distant future have the ability to drop warheads on  American cities. </p><p> The key to this, though, Liz, and it's all, again, like you said, it's all  interconnected. We actually need China to play ball with us on North Korea  to deal with this threat. And so, this whole trade dispute taking place  with China, all of this stuff is interconnected. We have to figure out how  to see China accommodate our interest in real life. They've got to  prioritize our interest.</p><p> And so, this whole trade deal is not only tied to bad trade deals and  intellectual theft. It's also tied to how we deal with North Korea as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. And to your point, China's military has been boosting the  number of warplane intrusions into South Korea airspace, nearly doubling  the number of times in recent years. Your take on that.</p><p> RYUN:  Well, I mean, China, the amazing part to me is how brash China is  and we're acting, we are letting them get away with this. They have been  waging this economic war. They've been threatening us. They've been doing  building these islands in the South China Seas and we've just been sitting  there as though, we, you know, we don't know what they're up to. We know  exactly what they are up to. And I think it's time. </p><p> Obviously, if we can really deal this economic trade and put them on notice  I think we can start to deal with some of these military threats as well. </p><p> Trump is right to do this and I know that some people are worried about  this tariff fight. I will say this, Liz. If we do not confront China now in  the next few years, I'm convinced we will regret it for the next hundred  years. Because China does not want trade partners. China wants tributary  nations. And if we are not careful, if we deal with this trade threat and  these bad trade deals and this theft of our intellectual property we're not  going to like where we're at in 10 or 15 years.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, you make a great point there. Let's move over to  what's going on in Russia, Ned. I'd like your reaction to Russia doing some  saber rattling, showing off new laser weapons after the U.S. is threatening  to pull out of missile, that missile treaty dating back to the 80s because  of Russia cheating. What's your take on that?</p><p> RYUN:  I go back to, you know, despite all the left screaming buddy  murderer about Trump being too cozy with Putin, he is actually been pretty  aggressive with him, especially on the energy front. Over 50 percent of  Russia's, the Russian governments income comes from oil and gas exports.  And Trump knows what he's doing on this front.</p><p> Obviously, he confronted Merkel on Nord Stream II and Russia importing even  more natural gas to Germany, and Trump said you can't do that. He's also  gone in and address a lot of the middle and eastern and European countries  and the three C's initiative in which he is trying to get them off of  Russian energy. </p><p> Because he realizes, Trump realizes if you can cut off Russian exports in  these energy areas of gas and oil, he's going to undermine all this other  stuff that's taking place. So, he's focused on the right things. He has to  cut off the Europeans from getting or being wholly dependent or  significantly dependent on Russian energy. And if he can do that, I think  he's going to really be able to put Putin in his place.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Thank you, Ned Ryun. Great to see you. Come back soon.</p><p> RYUN:  Thanks, Liz. We'll do.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Next case, this morning 1000 friends and family attended the  funeral service at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston to say a final  farewell to President George H.W. Bush.</p><p> In attendance, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris, baseball legends Nolan  Ryan, and Tommy Lasorda. And also, country singers Crystal Gayle and Larry  Gatlin. The funeral train carry the casket of our 41st president a short  time ago to the presidential library at Texas A&amp;M University. </p><p> The president was laid to rest alongside his wife Barbara.</p><p> We're going to be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. tech execs from Google, Microsoft, and Oracle met  today at the White House with Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Larry Kudlow and  others to talk about securing U.S. manufacturing dominance, and artificial  intelligence, quantum computing, and more. Facebook executives not  attending.</p><p> But to the real fireworks. The fight in D.C. with G.M. G.M. CEO Mary Barra  met again today with lawmakers. They are pretty upset over G.M.'s big tax  breaks in the face of G.M. plants -- plans to shut factories and lay off  14,000 workers.</p><p> Look at this. FiatChrysler, though, plans to open a new factory in  Detroit.</p><p> Let's bring in Republican Ohio Congressman Warren Davidson. Good to see  you, sir. </p><p> REP. WARREN DAVIDSON, (R) OHIO:  Good to talk with you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, people are upset that G.M. keeps coming all the time  with tin cap in hand getting a lot of federal bailout help, and wait for  it, a lot of state tax breaks and bailout help too. And you know, Ohio gave  G.M. a ton of tax breaks, but now that factories are closing. What's your  take on this?</p><p> DAVIDSON:  You know, it's truly disappointing. And I've been in Congress  now for about two and half years, but prior to that, for the previous 15  years I was in manufacturing. So, when you talk the intersection of big  tech and automotive, they're really more interconnected than you would  imagine. </p><p> So, when Mary Barra came and talked with the Ohio delegation, she really  led with the transformation that the auto industry is confronting. And you  know, one of the points that I wanted to make is, you know, the good news  is, is unlike in '08, '09 when this was happening, Ohio strong and growing.  G.M. is anomaly our states hiring. </p><p> I offered to drive our economic development folks up to do a job fair at  the plant. So, G.M. is offering those folks jobs I'm sure the eighth  district would be happy to have them.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. But here's the thing. We've been watching and I've been  watching G.M. for years. I've been doing business journalism for three  decades. I was at the Wall Street Journal. I was an editor at Forbes. I've  been writing about G.M. for a long time, sir. </p><p> Here's the problem. Here's one of the issues. Ohio in 2008 gave state  income tax breaks to G.M., saying you don't have to pay 75 percent of your  income taxes to the state of Ohio over the next 15 years. </p><p> So, here's the thing. Should elected officials say once and for all, OK,  we'll give you, Mr. car company or Mr. G.M., a tax break, with the caveat  that you have to show us how you will build factories that you can retool  to make -- to make either smaller or bigger vehicles when gas prices go up  or down. Other car companies do that, why can't G.M.?</p><p> DAVIDSON:  Well, the good news is Honda's been doing that. They reinvested,  the Honda Accord wasn't selling as well as they thought. The CRV is selling  way better, I think two-thirds of the cars on the road that are in demand  right now our crossovers, SUVs or trucks. And Honda who is a huge anchor  for Ohio has been very adaptive. </p><p> G.M. not quite as flexible. There's a lot of history behind that. And you  know, frankly, some of the things were the government has been involved  that shows frankly, the government should be not try to run these  companies. We don't need more central planning.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Got that. Check that. Understood. I hear totally what you're  saying. I don't mean to interrupt. But that is agreed upon. We don't want  that. We don't want the government in there. But G.M. does really rapidly  come with a tin cap getting our tax help.</p><p> I mean, it's striking, sir, that we're -- that, you know, that FiatChrysler is now opening a factory in Detroit. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Yes. I mean, that's great. And you know, we'll see where that  goes for G.M. You know, I think they've been outperformed by a number of  companies that's why they have to come hot in hand and begging for help.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, that's been going on for decades.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'm telling you that's been going on for decades. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. Not to mention the subsidies that are going on to  try to steer consumers to buy this car or that car.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  And the areas (Ph) of government shouldn't be trying to steer  that. And the good news for G.M. is maybe they finally got the message as,  you are not going to get any more bailouts. The American people don't want  to bail you out nor anyone else, and so you are going to have to take care  of your balance sheet and do the right things.</p><p> So, I was impressed that Mary Barra came and was proactively speaking to us  on the hill. But yes, very sad news about the investment in Lordstown,  Ohio, in particular.</p><p> MACDONALD:  But you know what, but what about putting the feet to the fire.  I understand. I watch Mary Barra. We have a lot of respect for her. She is  a great CEO. But listen closely to what she says, OK. A lot of that is a  lot of P.R. talk. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You got to get to the nuts and bolts. Is she going to move jobs  to other factories in the U.S.? And you know, is she going to stop  outsourcing to Mexico? We understand the economics of it, but we also  understand the economics of giving out tax breaks when you're not, you  know, building factories that are flexible, right? Final word.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. And when you look at where the intellectual property  and the tech is, the good news is a lot of that happened in the U.S. and  when you tie that to what you're talking about earlier is the tech folks  coming to the White House. </p><p> The Foreign Investment Risk Reduction Modernization Act, that was one of  the biggest piece of registration that the House financial services  committee move this past year. It was an honor to work on it. Really our  country is going to be more secure, our country is going to be stronger. </p><p> And frankly, if we can complement that with a good reform to privacy so  that we can make sure that whether it's on the internet or in your car or  in app that you download on the phone it's always your data as a consumer.  And I was impressed that was one of the questions I put to Mary is that it  is an opt in practice for G.M. in the car.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  And so, I hope we can do that more and I hope that they'll see  that the competitive advantage in the United States means they should  continue to invest including in Ohio. We have a tremendous supply chain and  folks are happy to supply them.</p><p> MACDONALD:  There's great people in Ohio. Great people in Michigan, great  people in the heartland. Congressman Warren Davidson, thank you so much. We  really appreciate it. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's get to other headline news. Search and rescue efforts  still underway after two U.S. military planes collided in midair and crash  off the coast of Japan overnight. It happened during a refueling exercise.  One marine killed, another in fair condition. </p><p> However, five marines still missing. Our thoughts and prayers are with the  families there.</p><p> A Southwest Airlines flight get it off the runway upon landing in heavy  rain at Burbank Airport in California. There were no reported injuries.  Among the 117 passengers, they were evacuated using emergency slides.  That's pretty scary stuff.</p><p> And drug company, it's called Tris Pharma, now recalling some of its  children's Ibuprofen after it was notified about overly high concentrations  of that drug that can affect a child's kidneys. This brand was sold under  private label brands at CVS, Wal-Mart and Family Dollar. Check those labels  there.</p><p> Now to the border wall. Brand new analysis on how it saves thousands of  lives. We've got one of the best columnists and thinkers out there. Tammy  Bruce is coming up.</p><p> But first, Congress kicked of the can down the road again. Another  temporary spending budget. What are we sending them to D.C. for? It means  you may see a government shut down by just in time for Christmas. We're  going to tell you what they're fighting about now and why this is the best  case for term limits. We're at the bottom of the hour. Stay there. Back in  two.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're watching the Fox Business Network. To  government spending, again, Congress passing a temporary interim spending  bill today that is going to let the government be funded for two more  weeks, really is just kicking the can down the road again. Congress will  have to vote on this again before midnight on December 21st.</p><p> Joining me now, Trump 2020 campaign advisory board member Madison Gesiotto  and Democrat strategist Al Mottur. I know you guys love talking about this.  Madison, look at this, from Pew Research, you're not going to believe it.  Congress has only managed to pass all required appropriations measures on  time, wait for it, just four times since fiscal 1977. Is this an argument  for term limits. I mean, what do we send them into D.C. to do?</p><p> MADISON GESIOTTO, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, NATIONAL  DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP:  It's one of the many arguments for term  limits. I mean, Congress seems repeatedly every single year do not be able  to do their job. I remember last Christmas, we talked about the same thing.</p><p> Every single year, they are never meeting the requirements, they are never  doing their job. It's such a shame that we continue to have to talk about  this. For over 20 years, they haven't met the requirements. So those four  times between 1977 and 1997, it's frustrating.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. So here's the thing, Al. This is what I'm wondering if we  should do. You know what, Congress, it's sort of like telling your children  to go to their room until you get the job done. We're going to sequester  you in D.C., no grandstanding for the cameras, no campaigning, no political  rallies, no fundraising, you got to be quarantined in D.C. and get a  spending bill on time. How about that?</p><p> AL MOTTUR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Hey, we might as well try it. I mean,  look, you're on to something when you say no campaigning, no fundraising.  The politics have taken over the dynamic in the Congress and there is way  too much time spent on the phone dialing for dollars and don't have enough  time doing work for the American people. That's on both sides of the aisle.  There's got to be a way to stop it. Maybe term limits is part of the  answer. I think campaign finance reform is another.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, Pelosi now says she won't accept a pretty decent DACA  deal in exchange for border wall funding. That's what it has come down to  right now. What do you think?</p><p> GESIOTTO:  I think what's frustrating about what she is doing is the fact  that she is unwilling to compromise. I mean, when we look at Congress and  the idea of why we have two parties and why we have Democrats and  Republicans in Congress work together is because they need to compromise to  get to the end solution.</p><p> Sometimes, you are going to have to give a little to get a little. The  Republicans have tried to do that on many issues. Of course, they are not  perfect. But the Democrats slightly have really let their hate for our  president overcome their ability to get anything done.</p><p> MOTTUR:  That's not what is going on here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  It feels like it's going on. Go ahead, Al. Finish your point.</p><p> MOTTUR:  No, it's not. I mean, the parties for two decades have been unable  to do immigration compromise. I agree we have to compromise. It's not  because --</p><p> MACDONALD:  But they are purposely politicizing the border. That's the  issue. We know that for a fact from internal e-mails --</p><p> MOTTUR:  Both sides are politicizing the border, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We know for a fact from internal e-mails that Democrat Super  PAC say that's the way to go in order to get that voter. But here's the  thing. Democrats, Al, and you've talked about this too, starting in 2005,  2006 and all the way through 2013, said yeah, to border security. Just get  it done. We have this moment in time after the George H.W. Bush funeral,  that there seems to be some kind of unity. Get it done.</p><p> MOTTUR:  I don't think the president would accept the border wall for a  DACA deal, first of all. And second of all, the president --</p><p> MACDONALD:  We did have one. He had a DACA deal, 1.3 million DACA, to do a  border wall. The Americans want it. They don't our security dealt with like  a political football.</p><p> MOTTUR:  I wish we could compromise on immigration. It's not just right  now. It's not hatred for this president. It has been going on for a long  time.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Should get it done now. Should get it done yesterday. How about  that?</p><p> MOTTUR:  I am for it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Go ahead, Madison.</p><p> GESIOTTO:  You know, Al, you are saying that's simply not true, that the  Democrats are willing to compromise. When you look back 10, 20 years, we  just actually talked about this with Liz last week, the Democrats supported  many of the things that they are now going against when it comes to  immigration.</p><p> So that is your perfect and prime example right there as to why their hate  for our president has changed their views and clouded their judgment when  it comes to the immigration issue specifically.</p><p> MOTTUR:  I don't believe it's about hate to the president. I believe it's  on both sides, Republicans and Democrats --</p><p> GESIOTTO:  Obstruction --</p><p> MOTTUR:  -- pulling the football away.</p><p> GESIOTTO:  We can use any word there.</p><p> MOTTUR:  -- Charlie Brown. And Trump does it too.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK, Al, maybe we can all move beyond that and just tell D.C.,  your voice, Al, and Madison's voice, and the viewer and the people out  there saying, you know what, we're done with you, D.C., we're over it. It's  sort of like you tell a child to go to your room until you clean it. Get it  done.</p><p> MOTTUR:  Maybe if there were thermal on Madison (ph), I can go up there and  get it done.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, I'll tell you something. It's just astonishing. I  want your reaction, Al. Congress has managed only four times since fiscal  1977, just four times, to pass all of its required spending measures on  time. Really?</p><p> MOTTUR:  It's ridiculous. They ought to be here more than three days a  week. They ought to be here four, five days a week.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> MOTTUR:  And that would help. Fundraising is a problem. Like I said, term  limits could be part of the solution. But there is no incentive for them to  get this done because there is no punishment.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right, because this is term limits. Madison and Al, thank you  so much. Great fun --</p><p> MOTTUR:  Great to be with you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey will testify  privately behind closed doors on Capitol Hill tomorrow. It will be  transcribed and then released to the public within 24 hours. But how will  the media report on that? Will you get to the truth on what James Comey  said? We're going to break it down.</p><p> But first, why a border wall could save thousands of lives every year?  Tammy Bruce on that. We're going to explain after the break. Back in two.  Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know when something is staring right at you and you say  eureka (ph) of course, absolutely. My next guest has that moment for you,  says President Trump's border wall could help save thousands of lives.  Joining me now, Fox News political contributor, Independent Women's Voice  president, great columnist, writer, Tammy Bruce.</p><p> TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  I'm glad you got to check.  Thank you, dear. Look, my column is up today. This is not new. This is not  new news. What was shocking to me was the CDC report that came out about  last week, that noted and obviously should alarm all of us, that the drug  overdose deaths and suicides are at historic highs, right?</p><p> In just 2017, over 72,000 people died from drug overdoses. That is more  than the U.S. deaths in the Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. In  one year in this country, suicides are at their historic high, about 49,000  suicides also in 2017.</p><p> The CDC doesn't want to speculate, they say, on the cause. But what they do  recognize also is the importation of drugs, the opioid epidemic, people now  moving from prescription drug dynamic because we are at war with that, so  they turn to heroin. And then there is fentanyl which is now the new  synthetic opioid which kills you pretty much right away. It's a tiny, tiny  amount that will kill you.</p><p> We got single individuals bringing into the country, and somebody was  caught just a few weeks ago, bringing over enough that would kill 300  million Americans, and because it takes so little to end up killing you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> BRUCE:  This is at the border. Eighty percent of the fentanyl in this  country comes in through the southern border, and also China is involved in  that facilitation as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  It's just two milligrams. We just show that stat, 78 million.  That's based on the amount of fentanyl seized at the border last year and  the first quarter of this year. Life expectancy has been dragged down by  what is going on.</p><p> BRUCE:  That is correct, because you got middle aged individuals, right?  You got -- those are the individuals who are dying too early because of the  drug addiction and because of suicide. Look, one thing we know about  suicide is it's usually not one issue. It can be a multitude of issues. But  when you're also dealing with drug addiction, any addiction, certainly  alcoholism, but the opioid addiction creates hopelessness.</p><p> We've dealt with now -- thank goodness in the economic recovery, but the  last 10 years, people losing their homes, losing their savings, losing  their jobs. That combined with drug addiction. And then of course President  Obama, we lost our hospitals and our doctors and any real access to health  care. That we think of course has contributed to the nature of the suicide  choice. So it is  -- that in it of itself, because of the core of the  people affected is dragging down the U.S. life expectancy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Astonishing, that finding. You know, President Trump is saying  China will try to stop the importation of fentanyl into our country. That's  part of the trade deal. But Thomas Homan, to your point, former acting ICE  director, said, you know, having the troops at the border is making the  drug cartels berserk and crazy. He told us that on the show last week.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yeah. You know, he is -- what they have done is, because of the  caravan, we've obviously boosted up the numbers, and the cartels which have  relied on kind of a lax framework are furious because it is affecting their  ability to move the drugs in.</p><p> This is why when we talk about the wall, it is not just about we need an  orderly framework that happens at the border, but we must take seriously  what's going on and how these drugs are moving into the country, when 80  percent of fentanyl is coming in through the southern border.</p><p> And by the way, the majority of heroin as well is not coming from  Afghanistan, it's grown in Mexico. It's cultivated there and moved in  through Mexico. So the wall is something that not only are we dealing with  keeping bad guys out and killers and all of that and human trafficking, but  to stop this.</p><p> When you got three wars of the deaths combined including Vietnam in one  year, how is this not a war? All the American people deserve to be taken  seriously and to have --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Is it Trump's White House capitalizing on this, what you're  talking about?</p><p> BRUCE:  Look, they have got to talk more about the other issues that are  involving the wall and why this matters. People know the opioid crisis and  the prescription drugs, right, OxyContin. We know that there is a heroin  problem. People don't know that people have gone to street drugs when they  can't get a prescription. And where is that coming from? When you think of  heroin, when you think of a poppy fields in Afghanistan --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> BRUCE:  They got to talk more about this. This transcends political  parties, economic status, all of those things. And I wish the president  would speak more about it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Tammy Bruce, you're going to be with us later in the show.  Great information there. Wow! We had a jam-packed hour. Coming up, a major  arrest of illegals in Massachusetts. More than 50 illegal immigrants busted  in a multi-day swift (ph) in New England. Look at this. Three of them  wanted for murder.</p><p> But first, it's the testimony we have been waiting for. Tomorrow, former  FBI Director James Comey, he is going to get a Capitol Hill grilling behind  closed doors. But how will the media report on that? That's next. Stay  there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. Tomorrow, House Republicans will finally get  their chance to grill former FBI Director James Comey behind closed doors  about his actions and anti-Trump bias infecting the top levels of the FBI  during the election. Again, behind closed doors. The transcript will be  made public within 24 hours of that sessions. Joe Concha is a media  reporter for The Hill. He joins us now. So how are they going to report on  it? What do you think, Joe?</p><p> JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL:  Well, if it's going to be made  public in 24 hours, then I would imagine something because nothing gets  slip (ph) in Washington. Everything gets slip (ph) in Washington. Within an  hour, somebody is going to have to use the bathroom, there will be a call  from some reporter and then you're going to hear about it. But at least  everything is going to be out in 24 hours, sometimes that doesn't happen.</p><p> I think they got the wrong guy here, Liz. I want to know why Rod Rosenstein  isn't being called before Congress. He is the guy just nine weeks ago who  said, yeah, you know, I think I'll wear a wire and try to trap the  president, try to get him on tape to compel his cabinet to invoke the 25th  Amendment. I would have had him on there instead.</p><p> But, OK, we have Comey. Here's the thing about Comey. He's an open book.  Literally he's an open book. He wrote a book in April. He did a thousand  interviews after that. I might be exaggerating. Most probably dozens and  dozens. So everything seems to be out there already, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I hear what you're saying because -- let's be clear. This is  about Trump-hating, pro-Hillary FBI director and there are talks about  stopping Trump, impeaching Trump. Really the issue is that FISA warrant to  basically surveil Trump campaign aides because it looks like they really  did break the regulations in getting that FISA warrant, right?</p><p> CONCHA:  It appears that way. Absolutely. So, but I wonder, Comey who is a  very good public speaker, we could agree on that, when he's done his  testimonies, it has been the type of thing where he seems to be pretty  measured in his responses. He is ready for whatever question --</p><p> MACDONALD:  He has got to answer. Did you tell the FISA court that it was  funded by the Democrats, partly, you even said it was unverified on  salacious. Did you know at the time that it was unverified? Did you tell  the court that, right?</p><p> CONCHA:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You got to get that out of him.</p><p> CONCHA:  And if so, why? Was it because --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Why you --</p><p> CONCHA:  -- the president.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> CONCHA:  Right, exactly. Why didn't you pursue going down this particular  route? I also want to know why he leaked a private conversation or  conversations that he had with the president over dinner at the White  House, then leaked everything he talked about to a friend at Columbia  University, who then gave it too The New York Times, and he admits for the  sole purpose of compelling a special counsel to be appointed, and it  happened. How is that not illegal?</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We want -- can we have you back on to talk about it?</p><p> CONCHA:  Absotively (ph).</p><p> MACDONALD:  Absotively (ph). Joe Concha. That's great. Good to see you,  sir. Coming up, we are going to get to that ICE arrest. More than 50  illegals including three wanted for murder in sanctuary city friendly New  England. We're going to have Tammy Bruce back on that. Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. ICE arresting more than 50 illegal immigrants  over the past two days. It happened across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New  Hampshire, and Connecticut. Among those arrested, three immigrants,  illegals from Brazil, wanted there for murder.</p><p> The ICE raids taking place the very same week that the Massachusetts  Republican governor said, you know what, a state judge must temporarily  step down after that judge let an undocumented immigrant here basically  sneak out a backdoor to avoid ICE agents waiting to take him into custody.</p><p> Tammy Bruce is back with us. First on that story, Tammy, great to have you  back.</p><p> BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  That illegal that sneaked out (ph) the backdoor had been  deported multiple times for multiple drug arrests. And now the judge let  him go at the backdoor.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yeah. It is interesting. During the court proceedings, the judge  called them up to the bench, and the judge asked for the recording to stop.  And that is when suddenly when that went back on and they resumed, there  was suddenly some machinations there to have the charges dropped.</p><p> And then somehow, the defense attorney was able to walk the defendant out  through a side door back through which would not have been allowed without  it being facilitated and being able to avoid as there was also (ph) ICE  agents.</p><p> Some judges and immigration advocates of course don't want ICE agents to be  able to go into courthouses. They have argued that they have to stay  outside and that seems to be changing a little bit. There is argument about  that. This is one of the reasons why they want that to be able to be in the  courthouses to deal with this kind of stuff.</p><p> MACDONALD:  What a story. And we have seen another courts.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yes, this judge, understandably, they think the judge should not be  hearing any federal cases because if you are really obstructing law  enforcement, why should you be on the bench? I mean, as a judge, you are  supposed to be implementing the laws.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> BRUCE:  And adjudicating them as opposed to helping a defendant sneak out  to get away from federal law enforcement. That's crazy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  She hears criminal cases. Are you going to let other criminals  go?</p><p> BRUCE:  Right. No matter -- look, they are human beings. We all have  opinions on the issues. But if you're willing to skirt the law and allow  someone else to do so, what else are you doing that is not fair?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's get to the swifts (ph) in New England. The 50 arrested  illegal immigrants selling opioids. You have been talking about that.</p><p> BRUCE:  Oh, yeah. This is our prior discussion. This is the big deal.  Trafficking in heroin. Trafficking in fentanyl. These are not drug users,  these are traffickers. And so this is where -- it is also a reminder to  people what ICE does. This is inside the country. It's the internal  framework.</p><p> They do not handle the border. They deal with criminals, the gangs, the  drug traffickers, sex traffickers, kidnappers, murderers, getting these  three Brazilians who are wanted for murder in that country, that's what ICE  does.</p><p> This is the organization that many Democrats want to abolish. That would be  a mistake because the people that are targeted and affected first and  victimized first are the communities of immigrants.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right, that's a point.</p><p> BRUCE:  This is who we are trying to protect here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right. But, you know, here is the other point about the story.  Several towns in Massachusetts here, they're sanctuary cities. It's Boston,  Cambridge, Lawrence and Newton. These are the cities where these  individuals have been detained.</p><p> BRUCE:  That's right. So the people that were scooped up had been in  custody. And then were released. Again, you think, well, was this somebody  who was driving under the influence or somebody who made a mistake? No,  these are drug traffickers. These are very serious individuals.</p><p> MACDONALD:  But the victims of the crimes are treated like rounding errors  in D.C. There is not a human being behind it that is treated --</p><p> BRUCE:  Big government, whether it is about health care or even law  enforcement. When people become the budget and you become a chit on a piece  of paper, you stop being a human being. This is why local law enforcement  matters. You know, judges matter.</p><p> They are supposed to see the individuals and yet they claim it is because  they are sensitive to immigrants, but this kind of action re-victimizes  immigrants. Legal immigrants who are playing by the rules and even  undocumented people who are also playing by the rules. Those are the people  that are protected by ICE.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Great stuff again from Tammy Bruce. You're going to come back  soon.</p><p> BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'll look forward to it. Thank you so much for having us in  your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on the  Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It  was down nearly 800 points, and then down about 80 points, doing a major  rethink after the initial freak out, panicked attack over the arrest that  U.S. request in Canada of the CFO of Huawei, that's China's top tech giant. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That CFO, the daughter of Huawei's founder, a former Chinese military  officer. She's arrested on charges that Huawei broke U.S. sanctions by  selling U.S. technology to Iran. We've got details on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Wall Streeters now applauding President Trump's tough line in trade  talks with China because China is stealing to make China great again. We've  got fresh new details on that. And it has to stop. </p><p>What's going on we've got an insider who has a front row seat on how China  has hollowed out entire U.S. industries and taken U.S. jobs. And why Trump  is right to fix the problem that elected officials for years have done  nothing about.</p><p>The Dow down 8 percent since its October high. But take a breath for some  perspective. Historically it is normal to have these kinds of downturns. We  bring you what you need to know.</p><p>Plus, tech execs at the White House today on how to beat China and more.  But the real firework is a fight in D.C. over G.M. getting not just loathes  of federal bailout help but state bailout help and tax breaks too, where it  hardly pays any taxes as its closing U.S. factories and laying off  thousands of people before Christmastime, sending those factory jobs to  Mexico. We've got the back story to FBN's exclusive with CEO Mary Barra. </p><p>Also, Democrat in-fighting over border wall funding. Nancy Pelosi now  saying she will not even accept a decent DACA deal in exchange for border  wall funding. People sick and tired of D.C. politics.</p><p>This as we bring you two big border scandals now hurting Americans. </p><p>Well, thank you for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money, politics. We  got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. The  Evening Edit starts right now. </p><p>OK. Let's get to the China outrage over the arrest of Huawei's CFO. They  are now demanding her release accusing the U.S. and Canada of quote,  \"wrongdoing.\" This is over violating Iran sanctions. But Wall Street  analysts point out other countries are saying Huawei is pretty bad. </p><p>Australia, New Zealand, Britain's telecom B.T. all kicked out Huawei over  fears that Huawei is stealing and spying giving its ties to China's  military. And they say President Trump is right. China for years has been  hollowing out U.S. jobs and entire U.S. industries, not funding its own  R&amp;D, but instead, stealing our research to make China great again. </p><p>Our companies pay for that research. China then sells cheaper copycats,  undercutting us. We're talking nuclear power generators, solar cells,  computer hardware, software, and more.</p><p>Let's get to Edward Lawrence in D.C. with more on that Huawei arrest.  Edward? </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Liz. And don't forget,  circuit boards. That was a huge thing that Chinese put out. And right now,  the arrest of chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou threatens to destabilize  the fragile trade negotiations that have been going on between the U.S. and  China. </p><p>China calling for Canada to release the Huawei CFO. A spokesperson for the  Chinese foreign ministry says, \"The detention of a person without giving a  clear reason is of course a violation of the human rights to the person, or  of the person.\" </p><p>Now China claims they don't know the reason that she was detained. She is  being investigated by the U.S. for possible violations for breaking the  sanctions related to Iran. Now, the timing of arrest is interesting. She  was being detained in Canada the same day President Donald Trump worked out  a path forward on trade talks with China. </p><p>The national security advisor John Bolton told NPR that he was made aware  of the arrest and that it would happen. The White House, though, telling us  that the president did not know about it before he met with President Xi.  Regardless, some senators applauding the U.S. for sticking to its morals.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER, (D) VIRGINIA:  My fear is when the Trump administration  is going to crumble on Huawei the same way they crumbled on ZTE. And as we  think about particularly we move to the next generation of wireless 5G and  that transformation is as big as anything that we've seen in the wireless  industry. And my fear is that China could be successful at setting the  standards and dominating that market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  And national security advisor John Bolton also told NPR that  this is a Justice Department matter and they don't always tell the  president what they are doing. Liz?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Great to see you, Edward. Thank you so much.</p><p>Joining me now is Zach Mottl, he is a top executive at Atlas Tool Works.  This is a company that has had a front row seat for years watching China's  high-tech theft. We welcome you to the show, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p>ZACH MOTTL, CHIEF ALIGNMENT OFFICER, ATLAS TOOL WORKS:  Great to be here,  Elizabeth.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Your company makes precision parts for the internet, radar  systems, medical devices. What do you guys seeing, is President Trump right  about China stealing to make China great again. </p><p>MOTTL:  He's absolutely right. You know, Huawei has built a $90 billion  global enterprise based on commercial espionage, theft of western  technology. You know, my customers are offered -- my business has been  around for 100 years, and for 90 out of the 100 years we were a vendor in  the telecom industry. That was a really important sector for myself and  many other manufacturers like me.</p><p>And we watched as Chinese manufacturers Huawei ZTE came online, and in 20  years they wiped out every single western competitor. Lucent Technologies,  Tellabs, Nortel Networks in Canada. Every one of these companies could not  compete against commercial espionage and state subsidized technology.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Because they're undercutting us taking our jobs, our R&amp;D that  we pay for and then making cheaper copycats. Sir, isn't this a big wake-up  call to Congress to say, you know a what, knock it off about the media  grandstanding before, you know, the D.C. cameras and get on the stick.  Because China has a built-in road project that made in China 2025 project.</p><p>I mean, Obama, President Obama did try to stop China, but it's really up to  Congress to get our trade laws updated to knock it, to get it to knock it  off, right?</p><p>MOTTL:  That's right. This telecom industry was the crown jewel of America  and it portray laws and lack of oversight by Congress has allow the Chinese  to steal this. Let's not lose one more high-tech industry. And quite  frankly, let's bring the telephone manufacturing industry back here. </p><p>We're about to have 5G, and you know, we can worry about the security or we  can simply make it here and know that it's good. Because what we've learned  with this Huawei case and so many other cases, is that we just can't trust  the Chinese. They say one thing, but they do something completely  different. So, I'm hoping Congress will step up to the plate here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We hope so too, because this is got to stop, sir. I mean, this  should be hair on fire and break the glass time right now in D.C.</p><p>MOTTL:  That's right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Because to your point, we just cited these other countries  worried about Huawei. Also, you mentioned 5G. China is embedding itself and  the fears it's going to go into that new 5G rollout worldwide. That's the  internet of things. That's wearable fitness trackers. It's robots, taxis  and the like. </p><p>I mean, if China gets to jump on that and starts embedding itself in 5G,  wow, game over.</p><p>MOTTL:  That's right. And they're counting on, you know, they're taking  advantage of the free market. They are going to undercut price and they are  going to subsidize it to try to buy the market. We cannot let that happen.  We need to put laws in place and we need our other country partners to work  with us to shut them out of the market. Because again, we just cannot trust  them. And when they say they are not spying I certainly think they are.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All this breathtakingly tedious grandstanding in D.C. over it,  and they are setting aside what really matters and that's what you're  talking about. Because, sir, look what happened to U.S. Steel. U.S. Steel  spent tons of money to pioneer a new lighter, higher grade steel product  for cars and planes, but then China hacked it and hacked its computers,  stole the blueprints and started selling copycats steel at way cheaper  prices, right?</p><p>MOTTL:  When profit doesn't matter to these companies and they have a  government behind them helping them cheat and steal, how can we compete? We  need to do it smarter. And what it comes down to is jobs. It's not just  about high-tech and innovation. It's about jobs. It's about national  security. </p><p>And the employees like mine, you know, when I lost my telecom customers in  the early 2000, we have to lay people off. We reinvented ourselves, but a  lot of other companies couldn't. Telecom and so many other sectors are  really important. We're talking about good jobs for Americans versus growth  and good jobs for people in China. I want to see it made here and I want to  see it secure and safe so we can trust what's going through our network.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And now, we got indications that China made in behind that  massive Marriott hack affecting half a billion people potentially. Wow.</p><p>MOTTL:  It's pervasive. It is pervasive and everything that they do they  just simply play by a different set of rules, so they can tell us one thing  but we know they are going to do something else. We can't trust them. </p><p>So, I'm pleased to see President Trump, you know, holding firm. I trust his  judgment here and I hope that Congress is going to come along and finally  join the wise party because they are really missing the boat by not  protecting America and our information.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, you know what, you know, if Congress doesn't it, the  voter could and probably will. Zach Mottl of Atlas Tool Works, thanks for  coming in. We'd like you to come on again soon, sir. </p><p>MOTTL:  We'll see you soon, Elizabeth. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you. Let's get Ned Ryun's reaction. Ned Ryun is one  of the top analysts out there, he's been watching D.C. Ned, I want your  reaction to the conversation we just had.</p><p>NED RYUN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  Well, I got to tell you, I  mean, initially, when you have a clip of Senator Warren saying -- Warner  saying about the fifth-generation 5G networks and Huawei, I mean, that's  one of things. </p><p>I wrote about this for Fox News during the week of Thanksgiving, Liz, in  which I said we have to be very careful because there is a proxy battle  being fought right now between United States and China between QUALCOMM and  Huawei over who's going to control that 5G network, and you are right. </p><p>The implications for the internet of things, right now there is about eight  billion internet of things devices. That number is probably going to triple  in the next three years. And who's going to control the networks and the  data is going to be massive as we move forward into the future.</p><p>And on the other front, you're right. I mean, they have been robbing us  blind. We have helped build the largest authoritarian police state in China  with really bad trade deals, and now we have looked the other way as they  literally over the last probably 10 years, Liz, I've seen estimates about  three trillion are in technology theft and between theft and force  technology transfers that we basically incentivize and given them the means  to compete with us on the technology front, but also on the economic front  and they're not shy about it. </p><p>They are gunning for us. They want to replace us as the center of the  economic world. And right now, for in the past, we've been lightening them  get away with it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know what, there's that and there's also this other  geopolitical risk that the White House is trying to address as well, Ned.  Look at this. New satellite images reveal activity and an unidentified  North Korean missile base. </p><p>So that's also a neck of the woods. What's you take on that?</p><p>RYUN:  Well, my take on this, is again, this has been the failure of the  three previous administrations kicking the can down the road of refusing to  actually deal with the North Korean threat. And now Trump has been  confronted with it. He realizes we cannot have this existential threat with  North Korea having nuclear armaments and being able to literally at some  point in the not-too-distant future have the ability to drop warheads on  American cities. </p><p>The key to this, though, Liz, and it's all, again, like you said, it's all  interconnected. We actually need China to play ball with us on North Korea  to deal with this threat. And so, this whole trade dispute taking place  with China, all of this stuff is interconnected. We have to figure out how  to see China accommodate our interest in real life. They've got to  prioritize our interest.</p><p>And so, this whole trade deal is not only tied to bad trade deals and  intellectual theft. It's also tied to how we deal with North Korea as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. And to your point, China's military has been boosting the  number of warplane intrusions into South Korea airspace, nearly doubling  the number of times in recent years. Your take on that.</p><p>RYUN:  Well, I mean, China, the amazing part to me is how brash China is  and we're acting, we are letting them get away with this. They have been  waging this economic war. They've been threatening us. They've been doing  building these islands in the South China Seas and we've just been sitting  there as though, we, you know, we don't know what they're up to. We know  exactly what they are up to. And I think it's time. </p><p>Obviously, if we can really deal this economic trade and put them on notice  I think we can start to deal with some of these military threats as well. </p><p>Trump is right to do this and I know that some people are worried about  this tariff fight. I will say this, Liz. If we do not confront China now in  the next few years, I'm convinced we will regret it for the next hundred  years. Because China does not want trade partners. China wants tributary  nations. And if we are not careful, if we deal with this trade threat and  these bad trade deals and this theft of our intellectual property we're not  going to like where we're at in 10 or 15 years.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, you make a great point there. Let's move over to  what's going on in Russia, Ned. I'd like your reaction to Russia doing some  saber rattling, showing off new laser weapons after the U.S. is threatening  to pull out of missile, that missile treaty dating back to the 80s because  of Russia cheating. What's your take on that?</p><p>RYUN:  I go back to, you know, despite all the left screaming buddy  murderer about Trump being too cozy with Putin, he is actually been pretty  aggressive with him, especially on the energy front. Over 50 percent of  Russia's, the Russian governments income comes from oil and gas exports.  And Trump knows what he's doing on this front.</p><p>Obviously, he confronted Merkel on Nord Stream II and Russia importing even  more natural gas to Germany, and Trump said you can't do that. He's also  gone in and address a lot of the middle and eastern and European countries  and the three C's initiative in which he is trying to get them off of  Russian energy. </p><p>Because he realizes, Trump realizes if you can cut off Russian exports in  these energy areas of gas and oil, he's going to undermine all this other  stuff that's taking place. So, he's focused on the right things. He has to  cut off the Europeans from getting or being wholly dependent or  significantly dependent on Russian energy. And if he can do that, I think  he's going to really be able to put Putin in his place.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you, Ned Ryun. Great to see you. Come back soon.</p><p>RYUN:  Thanks, Liz. We'll do.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Next case, this morning 1000 friends and family attended the  funeral service at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston to say a final  farewell to President George H.W. Bush.</p><p>In attendance, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris, baseball legends Nolan  Ryan, and Tommy Lasorda. And also, country singers Crystal Gayle and Larry  Gatlin. The funeral train carry the casket of our 41st president a short  time ago to the presidential library at Texas A&amp;M University. </p><p>The president was laid to rest alongside his wife Barbara.</p><p>We're going to be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. tech execs from Google, Microsoft, and Oracle met  today at the White House with Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Larry Kudlow and  others to talk about securing U.S. manufacturing dominance, and artificial  intelligence, quantum computing, and more. Facebook executives not  attending.</p><p>But to the real fireworks. The fight in D.C. with G.M. G.M. CEO Mary Barra  met again today with lawmakers. They are pretty upset over G.M.'s big tax  breaks in the face of G.M. plants -- plans to shut factories and lay off  14,000 workers.</p><p>Look at this. FiatChrysler, though, plans to open a new factory in  Detroit.</p><p>Let's bring in Republican Ohio Congressman Warren Davidson. Good to see  you, sir. </p><p>REP. WARREN DAVIDSON, (R) OHIO:  Good to talk with you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, people are upset that G.M. keeps coming all the time  with tin cap in hand getting a lot of federal bailout help, and wait for  it, a lot of state tax breaks and bailout help too. And you know, Ohio gave  G.M. a ton of tax breaks, but now that factories are closing. What's your  take on this?</p><p>DAVIDSON:  You know, it's truly disappointing. And I've been in Congress  now for about two and half years, but prior to that, for the previous 15  years I was in manufacturing. So, when you talk the intersection of big  tech and automotive, they're really more interconnected than you would  imagine. </p><p>So, when Mary Barra came and talked with the Ohio delegation, she really  led with the transformation that the auto industry is confronting. And you  know, one of the points that I wanted to make is, you know, the good news  is, is unlike in '08, '09 when this was happening, Ohio strong and growing.  G.M. is anomaly our states hiring. </p><p>I offered to drive our economic development folks up to do a job fair at  the plant. So, G.M. is offering those folks jobs I'm sure the eighth  district would be happy to have them.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. But here's the thing. We've been watching and I've been  watching G.M. for years. I've been doing business journalism for three  decades. I was at the Wall Street Journal. I was an editor at Forbes. I've  been writing about G.M. for a long time, sir. </p><p>Here's the problem. Here's one of the issues. Ohio in 2008 gave state  income tax breaks to G.M., saying you don't have to pay 75 percent of your  income taxes to the state of Ohio over the next 15 years. </p><p>So, here's the thing. Should elected officials say once and for all, OK,  we'll give you, Mr. car company or Mr. G.M., a tax break, with the caveat  that you have to show us how you will build factories that you can retool  to make -- to make either smaller or bigger vehicles when gas prices go up  or down. Other car companies do that, why can't G.M.?</p><p>DAVIDSON:  Well, the good news is Honda's been doing that. They reinvested,  the Honda Accord wasn't selling as well as they thought. The CRV is selling  way better, I think two-thirds of the cars on the road that are in demand  right now our crossovers, SUVs or trucks. And Honda who is a huge anchor  for Ohio has been very adaptive. </p><p>G.M. not quite as flexible. There's a lot of history behind that. And you  know, frankly, some of the things were the government has been involved  that shows frankly, the government should be not try to run these  companies. We don't need more central planning.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Got that. Check that. Understood. I hear totally what you're  saying. I don't mean to interrupt. But that is agreed upon. We don't want  that. We don't want the government in there. But G.M. does really rapidly  come with a tin cap getting our tax help.</p><p>I mean, it's striking, sir, that we're -- that, you know, that FiatChrysler is now opening a factory in Detroit. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Yes. I mean, that's great. And you know, we'll see where that  goes for G.M. You know, I think they've been outperformed by a number of  companies that's why they have to come hot in hand and begging for help.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, that's been going on for decades.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'm telling you that's been going on for decades. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. Not to mention the subsidies that are going on to  try to steer consumers to buy this car or that car.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  And the areas (Ph) of government shouldn't be trying to steer  that. And the good news for G.M. is maybe they finally got the message as,  you are not going to get any more bailouts. The American people don't want  to bail you out nor anyone else, and so you are going to have to take care  of your balance sheet and do the right things.</p><p>So, I was impressed that Mary Barra came and was proactively speaking to us  on the hill. But yes, very sad news about the investment in Lordstown,  Ohio, in particular.</p><p>MACDONALD:  But you know what, but what about putting the feet to the fire.  I understand. I watch Mary Barra. We have a lot of respect for her. She is  a great CEO. But listen closely to what she says, OK. A lot of that is a  lot of P.R. talk. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You got to get to the nuts and bolts. Is she going to move jobs  to other factories in the U.S.? And you know, is she going to stop  outsourcing to Mexico? We understand the economics of it, but we also  understand the economics of giving out tax breaks when you're not, you  know, building factories that are flexible, right? Final word.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. And when you look at where the intellectual property  and the tech is, the good news is a lot of that happened in the U.S. and  when you tie that to what you're talking about earlier is the tech folks  coming to the White House. </p><p>The Foreign Investment Risk Reduction Modernization Act, that was one of  the biggest piece of registration that the House financial services  committee move this past year. It was an honor to work on it. Really our  country is going to be more secure, our country is going to be stronger. </p><p>And frankly, if we can complement that with a good reform to privacy so  that we can make sure that whether it's on the internet or in your car or  in app that you download on the phone it's always your data as a consumer.  And I was impressed that was one of the questions I put to Mary is that it  is an opt in practice for G.M. in the car.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  And so, I hope we can do that more and I hope that they'll see  that the competitive advantage in the United States means they should  continue to invest including in Ohio. We have a tremendous supply chain and  folks are happy to supply them.</p><p>MACDONALD:  There's great people in Ohio. Great people in Michigan, great  people in the heartland. Congressman Warren Davidson, thank you so much. We  really appreciate it. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to other headline news. Search and rescue efforts  still underway after two U.S. military planes collided in midair and crash  off the coast of Japan overnight. It happened during a refueling exercise.  One marine killed, another in fair condition. </p><p>However, five marines still missing. Our thoughts and prayers are with the  families there.</p><p>A Southwest Airlines flight get it off the runway upon landing in heavy  rain at Burbank Airport in California. There were no reported injuries.  Among the 117 passengers, they were evacuated using emergency slides.  That's pretty scary stuff.</p><p>And drug company, it's called Tris Pharma, now recalling some of its  children's Ibuprofen after it was notified about overly high concentrations  of that drug that can affect a child's kidneys. This brand was sold under  private label brands at CVS, Wal-Mart and Family Dollar. Check those labels  there.</p><p>Now to the border wall. Brand new analysis on how it saves thousands of  lives. We've got one of the best columnists and thinkers out there. Tammy  Bruce is coming up.</p><p>But first, Congress kicked of the can down the road again. Another  temporary spending budget. What are we sending them to D.C. for? It means  you may see a government shut down by just in time for Christmas. We're  going to tell you what they're fighting about now and why this is the best  case for term limits. We're at the bottom of the hour. Stay there. Back in  two.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're watching the Fox Business Network. To  government spending, again, Congress passing a temporary interim spending  bill today that is going to let the government be funded for two more  weeks, really is just kicking the can down the road again. Congress will  have to vote on this again before midnight on December 21st.</p><p>Joining me now, Trump 2020 campaign advisory board member Madison Gesiotto  and Democrat strategist Al Mottur. I know you guys love talking about this.  Madison, look at this, from Pew Research, you're not going to believe it.  Congress has only managed to pass all required appropriations measures on  time, wait for it, just four times since fiscal 1977. Is this an argument  for term limits. I mean, what do we send them into D.C. to do?</p><p>MADISON GESIOTTO, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, NATIONAL  DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP:  It's one of the many arguments for term  limits. I mean, Congress seems repeatedly every single year do not be able  to do their job. I remember last Christmas, we talked about the same thing.</p><p>Every single year, they are never meeting the requirements, they are never  doing their job. It's such a shame that we continue to have to talk about  this. For over 20 years, they haven't met the requirements. So those four  times between 1977 and 1997, it's frustrating.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. So here's the thing, Al. This is what I'm wondering if we  should do. You know what, Congress, it's sort of like telling your children  to go to their room until you get the job done. We're going to sequester  you in D.C., no grandstanding for the cameras, no campaigning, no political  rallies, no fundraising, you got to be quarantined in D.C. and get a  spending bill on time. How about that?</p><p>AL MOTTUR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Hey, we might as well try it. I mean,  look, you're on to something when you say no campaigning, no fundraising.  The politics have taken over the dynamic in the Congress and there is way  too much time spent on the phone dialing for dollars and don't have enough  time doing work for the American people. That's on both sides of the aisle.  There's got to be a way to stop it. Maybe term limits is part of the  answer. I think campaign finance reform is another.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Pelosi now says she won't accept a pretty decent DACA  deal in exchange for border wall funding. That's what it has come down to  right now. What do you think?</p><p>GESIOTTO:  I think what's frustrating about what she is doing is the fact  that she is unwilling to compromise. I mean, when we look at Congress and  the idea of why we have two parties and why we have Democrats and  Republicans in Congress work together is because they need to compromise to  get to the end solution.</p><p>Sometimes, you are going to have to give a little to get a little. The  Republicans have tried to do that on many issues. Of course, they are not  perfect. But the Democrats slightly have really let their hate for our  president overcome their ability to get anything done.</p><p>MOTTUR:  That's not what is going on here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It feels like it's going on. Go ahead, Al. Finish your point.</p><p>MOTTUR:  No, it's not. I mean, the parties for two decades have been unable  to do immigration compromise. I agree we have to compromise. It's not  because --</p><p>MACDONALD:  But they are purposely politicizing the border. That's the  issue. We know that for a fact from internal e-mails --</p><p>MOTTUR:  Both sides are politicizing the border, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We know for a fact from internal e-mails that Democrat Super  PAC say that's the way to go in order to get that voter. But here's the  thing. Democrats, Al, and you've talked about this too, starting in 2005,  2006 and all the way through 2013, said yeah, to border security. Just get  it done. We have this moment in time after the George H.W. Bush funeral,  that there seems to be some kind of unity. Get it done.</p><p>MOTTUR:  I don't think the president would accept the border wall for a  DACA deal, first of all. And second of all, the president --</p><p>MACDONALD:  We did have one. He had a DACA deal, 1.3 million DACA, to do a  border wall. The Americans want it. They don't our security dealt with like  a political football.</p><p>MOTTUR:  I wish we could compromise on immigration. It's not just right  now. It's not hatred for this president. It has been going on for a long  time.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Should get it done now. Should get it done yesterday. How about  that?</p><p>MOTTUR:  I am for it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Go ahead, Madison.</p><p>GESIOTTO:  You know, Al, you are saying that's simply not true, that the  Democrats are willing to compromise. When you look back 10, 20 years, we  just actually talked about this with Liz last week, the Democrats supported  many of the things that they are now going against when it comes to  immigration.</p><p>So that is your perfect and prime example right there as to why their hate  for our president has changed their views and clouded their judgment when  it comes to the immigration issue specifically.</p><p>MOTTUR:  I don't believe it's about hate to the president. I believe it's  on both sides, Republicans and Democrats --</p><p>GESIOTTO:  Obstruction --</p><p>MOTTUR:  -- pulling the football away.</p><p>GESIOTTO:  We can use any word there.</p><p>MOTTUR:  -- Charlie Brown. And Trump does it too.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, Al, maybe we can all move beyond that and just tell D.C.,  your voice, Al, and Madison's voice, and the viewer and the people out  there saying, you know what, we're done with you, D.C., we're over it. It's  sort of like you tell a child to go to your room until you clean it. Get it  done.</p><p>MOTTUR:  Maybe if there were thermal on Madison (ph), I can go up there and  get it done.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, I'll tell you something. It's just astonishing. I  want your reaction, Al. Congress has managed only four times since fiscal  1977, just four times, to pass all of its required spending measures on  time. Really?</p><p>MOTTUR:  It's ridiculous. They ought to be here more than three days a  week. They ought to be here four, five days a week.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>MOTTUR:  And that would help. Fundraising is a problem. Like I said, term  limits could be part of the solution. But there is no incentive for them to  get this done because there is no punishment.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right, because this is term limits. Madison and Al, thank you  so much. Great fun --</p><p>MOTTUR:  Great to be with you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey will testify  privately behind closed doors on Capitol Hill tomorrow. It will be  transcribed and then released to the public within 24 hours. But how will  the media report on that? Will you get to the truth on what James Comey  said? We're going to break it down.</p><p>But first, why a border wall could save thousands of lives every year?  Tammy Bruce on that. We're going to explain after the break. Back in two.  Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know when something is staring right at you and you say  eureka (ph) of course, absolutely. My next guest has that moment for you,  says President Trump's border wall could help save thousands of lives.  Joining me now, Fox News political contributor, Independent Women's Voice  president, great columnist, writer, Tammy Bruce.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  I'm glad you got to check.  Thank you, dear. Look, my column is up today. This is not new. This is not  new news. What was shocking to me was the CDC report that came out about  last week, that noted and obviously should alarm all of us, that the drug  overdose deaths and suicides are at historic highs, right?</p><p>In just 2017, over 72,000 people died from drug overdoses. That is more  than the U.S. deaths in the Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. In  one year in this country, suicides are at their historic high, about 49,000  suicides also in 2017.</p><p>The CDC doesn't want to speculate, they say, on the cause. But what they do  recognize also is the importation of drugs, the opioid epidemic, people now  moving from prescription drug dynamic because we are at war with that, so  they turn to heroin. And then there is fentanyl which is now the new  synthetic opioid which kills you pretty much right away. It's a tiny, tiny  amount that will kill you.</p><p>We got single individuals bringing into the country, and somebody was  caught just a few weeks ago, bringing over enough that would kill 300  million Americans, and because it takes so little to end up killing you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>BRUCE:  This is at the border. Eighty percent of the fentanyl in this  country comes in through the southern border, and also China is involved in  that facilitation as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It's just two milligrams. We just show that stat, 78 million.  That's based on the amount of fentanyl seized at the border last year and  the first quarter of this year. Life expectancy has been dragged down by  what is going on.</p><p>BRUCE:  That is correct, because you got middle aged individuals, right?  You got -- those are the individuals who are dying too early because of the  drug addiction and because of suicide. Look, one thing we know about  suicide is it's usually not one issue. It can be a multitude of issues. But  when you're also dealing with drug addiction, any addiction, certainly  alcoholism, but the opioid addiction creates hopelessness.</p><p>We've dealt with now -- thank goodness in the economic recovery, but the  last 10 years, people losing their homes, losing their savings, losing  their jobs. That combined with drug addiction. And then of course President  Obama, we lost our hospitals and our doctors and any real access to health  care. That we think of course has contributed to the nature of the suicide  choice. So it is  -- that in it of itself, because of the core of the  people affected is dragging down the U.S. life expectancy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Astonishing, that finding. You know, President Trump is saying  China will try to stop the importation of fentanyl into our country. That's  part of the trade deal. But Thomas Homan, to your point, former acting ICE  director, said, you know, having the troops at the border is making the  drug cartels berserk and crazy. He told us that on the show last week.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yeah. You know, he is -- what they have done is, because of the  caravan, we've obviously boosted up the numbers, and the cartels which have  relied on kind of a lax framework are furious because it is affecting their  ability to move the drugs in.</p><p>This is why when we talk about the wall, it is not just about we need an  orderly framework that happens at the border, but we must take seriously  what's going on and how these drugs are moving into the country, when 80  percent of fentanyl is coming in through the southern border.</p><p>And by the way, the majority of heroin as well is not coming from  Afghanistan, it's grown in Mexico. It's cultivated there and moved in  through Mexico. So the wall is something that not only are we dealing with  keeping bad guys out and killers and all of that and human trafficking, but  to stop this.</p><p>When you got three wars of the deaths combined including Vietnam in one  year, how is this not a war? All the American people deserve to be taken  seriously and to have --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is it Trump's White House capitalizing on this, what you're  talking about?</p><p>BRUCE:  Look, they have got to talk more about the other issues that are  involving the wall and why this matters. People know the opioid crisis and  the prescription drugs, right, OxyContin. We know that there is a heroin  problem. People don't know that people have gone to street drugs when they  can't get a prescription. And where is that coming from? When you think of  heroin, when you think of a poppy fields in Afghanistan --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>BRUCE:  They got to talk more about this. This transcends political  parties, economic status, all of those things. And I wish the president  would speak more about it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Tammy Bruce, you're going to be with us later in the show.  Great information there. Wow! We had a jam-packed hour. Coming up, a major  arrest of illegals in Massachusetts. More than 50 illegal immigrants busted  in a multi-day swift (ph) in New England. Look at this. Three of them  wanted for murder.</p><p>But first, it's the testimony we have been waiting for. Tomorrow, former  FBI Director James Comey, he is going to get a Capitol Hill grilling behind  closed doors. But how will the media report on that? That's next. Stay  there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. Tomorrow, House Republicans will finally get  their chance to grill former FBI Director James Comey behind closed doors  about his actions and anti-Trump bias infecting the top levels of the FBI  during the election. Again, behind closed doors. The transcript will be  made public within 24 hours of that sessions. Joe Concha is a media  reporter for The Hill. He joins us now. So how are they going to report on  it? What do you think, Joe?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL:  Well, if it's going to be made  public in 24 hours, then I would imagine something because nothing gets  slip (ph) in Washington. Everything gets slip (ph) in Washington. Within an  hour, somebody is going to have to use the bathroom, there will be a call  from some reporter and then you're going to hear about it. But at least  everything is going to be out in 24 hours, sometimes that doesn't happen.</p><p>I think they got the wrong guy here, Liz. I want to know why Rod Rosenstein  isn't being called before Congress. He is the guy just nine weeks ago who  said, yeah, you know, I think I'll wear a wire and try to trap the  president, try to get him on tape to compel his cabinet to invoke the 25th  Amendment. I would have had him on there instead.</p><p>But, OK, we have Comey. Here's the thing about Comey. He's an open book.  Literally he's an open book. He wrote a book in April. He did a thousand  interviews after that. I might be exaggerating. Most probably dozens and  dozens. So everything seems to be out there already, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I hear what you're saying because -- let's be clear. This is  about Trump-hating, pro-Hillary FBI director and there are talks about  stopping Trump, impeaching Trump. Really the issue is that FISA warrant to  basically surveil Trump campaign aides because it looks like they really  did break the regulations in getting that FISA warrant, right?</p><p>CONCHA:  It appears that way. Absolutely. So, but I wonder, Comey who is a  very good public speaker, we could agree on that, when he's done his  testimonies, it has been the type of thing where he seems to be pretty  measured in his responses. He is ready for whatever question --</p><p>MACDONALD:  He has got to answer. Did you tell the FISA court that it was  funded by the Democrats, partly, you even said it was unverified on  salacious. Did you know at the time that it was unverified? Did you tell  the court that, right?</p><p>CONCHA:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You got to get that out of him.</p><p>CONCHA:  And if so, why? Was it because --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Why you --</p><p>CONCHA:  -- the president.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>CONCHA:  Right, exactly. Why didn't you pursue going down this particular  route? I also want to know why he leaked a private conversation or  conversations that he had with the president over dinner at the White  House, then leaked everything he talked about to a friend at Columbia  University, who then gave it too The New York Times, and he admits for the  sole purpose of compelling a special counsel to be appointed, and it  happened. How is that not illegal?</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We want -- can we have you back on to talk about it?</p><p>CONCHA:  Absotively (ph).</p><p>MACDONALD:  Absotively (ph). Joe Concha. That's great. Good to see you,  sir. Coming up, we are going to get to that ICE arrest. More than 50  illegals including three wanted for murder in sanctuary city friendly New  England. We're going to have Tammy Bruce back on that. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. ICE arresting more than 50 illegal immigrants  over the past two days. It happened across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New  Hampshire, and Connecticut. Among those arrested, three immigrants,  illegals from Brazil, wanted there for murder.</p><p>The ICE raids taking place the very same week that the Massachusetts  Republican governor said, you know what, a state judge must temporarily  step down after that judge let an undocumented immigrant here basically  sneak out a backdoor to avoid ICE agents waiting to take him into custody.</p><p>Tammy Bruce is back with us. First on that story, Tammy, great to have you  back.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  That illegal that sneaked out (ph) the backdoor had been  deported multiple times for multiple drug arrests. And now the judge let  him go at the backdoor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yeah. It is interesting. During the court proceedings, the judge  called them up to the bench, and the judge asked for the recording to stop.  And that is when suddenly when that went back on and they resumed, there  was suddenly some machinations there to have the charges dropped.</p><p>And then somehow, the defense attorney was able to walk the defendant out  through a side door back through which would not have been allowed without  it being facilitated and being able to avoid as there was also (ph) ICE  agents.</p><p>Some judges and immigration advocates of course don't want ICE agents to be  able to go into courthouses. They have argued that they have to stay  outside and that seems to be changing a little bit. There is argument about  that. This is one of the reasons why they want that to be able to be in the  courthouses to deal with this kind of stuff.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What a story. And we have seen another courts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, this judge, understandably, they think the judge should not be  hearing any federal cases because if you are really obstructing law  enforcement, why should you be on the bench? I mean, as a judge, you are  supposed to be implementing the laws.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>BRUCE:  And adjudicating them as opposed to helping a defendant sneak out  to get away from federal law enforcement. That's crazy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  She hears criminal cases. Are you going to let other criminals  go?</p><p>BRUCE:  Right. No matter -- look, they are human beings. We all have  opinions on the issues. But if you're willing to skirt the law and allow  someone else to do so, what else are you doing that is not fair?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to the swifts (ph) in New England. The 50 arrested  illegal immigrants selling opioids. You have been talking about that.</p><p>BRUCE:  Oh, yeah. This is our prior discussion. This is the big deal.  Trafficking in heroin. Trafficking in fentanyl. These are not drug users,  these are traffickers. And so this is where -- it is also a reminder to  people what ICE does. This is inside the country. It's the internal  framework.</p><p>They do not handle the border. They deal with criminals, the gangs, the  drug traffickers, sex traffickers, kidnappers, murderers, getting these  three Brazilians who are wanted for murder in that country, that's what ICE  does.</p><p>This is the organization that many Democrats want to abolish. That would be  a mistake because the people that are targeted and affected first and  victimized first are the communities of immigrants.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right, that's a point.</p><p>BRUCE:  This is who we are trying to protect here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right. But, you know, here is the other point about the story.  Several towns in Massachusetts here, they're sanctuary cities. It's Boston,  Cambridge, Lawrence and Newton. These are the cities where these  individuals have been detained.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's right. So the people that were scooped up had been in  custody. And then were released. Again, you think, well, was this somebody  who was driving under the influence or somebody who made a mistake? No,  these are drug traffickers. These are very serious individuals.</p><p>MACDONALD:  But the victims of the crimes are treated like rounding errors  in D.C. There is not a human being behind it that is treated --</p><p>BRUCE:  Big government, whether it is about health care or even law  enforcement. When people become the budget and you become a chit on a piece  of paper, you stop being a human being. This is why local law enforcement  matters. You know, judges matter.</p><p>They are supposed to see the individuals and yet they claim it is because  they are sensitive to immigrants, but this kind of action re-victimizes  immigrants. Legal immigrants who are playing by the rules and even  undocumented people who are also playing by the rules. Those are the people  that are protected by ICE.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Great stuff again from Tammy Bruce. You're going to come back  soon.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'll look forward to it. Thank you so much for having us in  your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on the  Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It  was down nearly 800 points, and then down about 80 points, doing a major  rethink after the initial freak out, panicked attack over the arrest that  U.S. request in Canada of the CFO of Huawei, that's China's top tech giant. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That CFO, the daughter of Huawei's founder, a former Chinese military  officer. She's arrested on charges that Huawei broke U.S. sanctions by  selling U.S. technology to Iran. We've got details on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Wall Streeters now applauding President Trump's tough line in trade  talks with China because China is stealing to make China great again. We've  got fresh new details on that. And it has to stop. </p><p>What's going on we've got an insider who has a front row seat on how China  has hollowed out entire U.S. industries and taken U.S. jobs. And why Trump  is right to fix the problem that elected officials for years have done  nothing about.</p><p>The Dow down 8 percent since its October high. But take a breath for some  perspective. Historically it is normal to have these kinds of downturns. We  bring you what you need to know.</p><p>Plus, tech execs at the White House today on how to beat China and more.  But the real firework is a fight in D.C. over G.M. getting not just loathes  of federal bailout help but state bailout help and tax breaks too, where it  hardly pays any taxes as its closing U.S. factories and laying off  thousands of people before Christmastime, sending those factory jobs to  Mexico. We've got the back story to FBN's exclusive with CEO Mary Barra. </p><p>Also, Democrat in-fighting over border wall funding. Nancy Pelosi now  saying she will not even accept a decent DACA deal in exchange for border  wall funding. People sick and tired of D.C. politics.</p><p>This as we bring you two big border scandals now hurting Americans. </p><p>Well, thank you for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money, politics. We  got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. The  Evening Edit starts right now. </p><p>OK. Let's get to the China outrage over the arrest of Huawei's CFO. They  are now demanding her release accusing the U.S. and Canada of quote,  \"wrongdoing.\" This is over violating Iran sanctions. But Wall Street  analysts point out other countries are saying Huawei is pretty bad. </p><p>Australia, New Zealand, Britain's telecom B.T. all kicked out Huawei over  fears that Huawei is stealing and spying giving its ties to China's  military. And they say President Trump is right. China for years has been  hollowing out U.S. jobs and entire U.S. industries, not funding its own  R&amp;D, but instead, stealing our research to make China great again. </p><p>Our companies pay for that research. China then sells cheaper copycats,  undercutting us. We're talking nuclear power generators, solar cells,  computer hardware, software, and more.</p><p>Let's get to Edward Lawrence in D.C. with more on that Huawei arrest.  Edward? </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Liz. And don't forget,  circuit boards. That was a huge thing that Chinese put out. And right now,  the arrest of chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou threatens to destabilize  the fragile trade negotiations that have been going on between the U.S. and  China. </p><p>China calling for Canada to release the Huawei CFO. A spokesperson for the  Chinese foreign ministry says, \"The detention of a person without giving a  clear reason is of course a violation of the human rights to the person, or  of the person.\" </p><p>Now China claims they don't know the reason that she was detained. She is  being investigated by the U.S. for possible violations for breaking the  sanctions related to Iran. Now, the timing of arrest is interesting. She  was being detained in Canada the same day President Donald Trump worked out  a path forward on trade talks with China. </p><p>The national security advisor John Bolton told NPR that he was made aware  of the arrest and that it would happen. The White House, though, telling us  that the president did not know about it before he met with President Xi.  Regardless, some senators applauding the U.S. for sticking to its morals.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER, (D) VIRGINIA:  My fear is when the Trump administration  is going to crumble on Huawei the same way they crumbled on ZTE. And as we  think about particularly we move to the next generation of wireless 5G and  that transformation is as big as anything that we've seen in the wireless  industry. And my fear is that China could be successful at setting the  standards and dominating that market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  And national security advisor John Bolton also told NPR that  this is a Justice Department matter and they don't always tell the  president what they are doing. Liz?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Great to see you, Edward. Thank you so much.</p><p>Joining me now is Zach Mottl, he is a top executive at Atlas Tool Works.  This is a company that has had a front row seat for years watching China's  high-tech theft. We welcome you to the show, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p>ZACH MOTTL, CHIEF ALIGNMENT OFFICER, ATLAS TOOL WORKS:  Great to be here,  Elizabeth.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Your company makes precision parts for the internet, radar  systems, medical devices. What do you guys seeing, is President Trump right  about China stealing to make China great again. </p><p>MOTTL:  He's absolutely right. You know, Huawei has built a $90 billion  global enterprise based on commercial espionage, theft of western  technology. You know, my customers are offered -- my business has been  around for 100 years, and for 90 out of the 100 years we were a vendor in  the telecom industry. That was a really important sector for myself and  many other manufacturers like me.</p><p>And we watched as Chinese manufacturers Huawei ZTE came online, and in 20  years they wiped out every single western competitor. Lucent Technologies,  Tellabs, Nortel Networks in Canada. Every one of these companies could not  compete against commercial espionage and state subsidized technology.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Because they're undercutting us taking our jobs, our R&amp;D that  we pay for and then making cheaper copycats. Sir, isn't this a big wake-up  call to Congress to say, you know a what, knock it off about the media  grandstanding before, you know, the D.C. cameras and get on the stick.  Because China has a built-in road project that made in China 2025 project.</p><p>I mean, Obama, President Obama did try to stop China, but it's really up to  Congress to get our trade laws updated to knock it, to get it to knock it  off, right?</p><p>MOTTL:  That's right. This telecom industry was the crown jewel of America  and it portray laws and lack of oversight by Congress has allow the Chinese  to steal this. Let's not lose one more high-tech industry. And quite  frankly, let's bring the telephone manufacturing industry back here. </p><p>We're about to have 5G, and you know, we can worry about the security or we  can simply make it here and know that it's good. Because what we've learned  with this Huawei case and so many other cases, is that we just can't trust  the Chinese. They say one thing, but they do something completely  different. So, I'm hoping Congress will step up to the plate here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We hope so too, because this is got to stop, sir. I mean, this  should be hair on fire and break the glass time right now in D.C.</p><p>MOTTL:  That's right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Because to your point, we just cited these other countries  worried about Huawei. Also, you mentioned 5G. China is embedding itself and  the fears it's going to go into that new 5G rollout worldwide. That's the  internet of things. That's wearable fitness trackers. It's robots, taxis  and the like. </p><p>I mean, if China gets to jump on that and starts embedding itself in 5G,  wow, game over.</p><p>MOTTL:  That's right. And they're counting on, you know, they're taking  advantage of the free market. They are going to undercut price and they are  going to subsidize it to try to buy the market. We cannot let that happen.  We need to put laws in place and we need our other country partners to work  with us to shut them out of the market. Because again, we just cannot trust  them. And when they say they are not spying I certainly think they are.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All this breathtakingly tedious grandstanding in D.C. over it,  and they are setting aside what really matters and that's what you're  talking about. Because, sir, look what happened to U.S. Steel. U.S. Steel  spent tons of money to pioneer a new lighter, higher grade steel product  for cars and planes, but then China hacked it and hacked its computers,  stole the blueprints and started selling copycats steel at way cheaper  prices, right?</p><p>MOTTL:  When profit doesn't matter to these companies and they have a  government behind them helping them cheat and steal, how can we compete? We  need to do it smarter. And what it comes down to is jobs. It's not just  about high-tech and innovation. It's about jobs. It's about national  security. </p><p>And the employees like mine, you know, when I lost my telecom customers in  the early 2000, we have to lay people off. We reinvented ourselves, but a  lot of other companies couldn't. Telecom and so many other sectors are  really important. We're talking about good jobs for Americans versus growth  and good jobs for people in China. I want to see it made here and I want to  see it secure and safe so we can trust what's going through our network.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And now, we got indications that China made in behind that  massive Marriott hack affecting half a billion people potentially. Wow.</p><p>MOTTL:  It's pervasive. It is pervasive and everything that they do they  just simply play by a different set of rules, so they can tell us one thing  but we know they are going to do something else. We can't trust them. </p><p>So, I'm pleased to see President Trump, you know, holding firm. I trust his  judgment here and I hope that Congress is going to come along and finally  join the wise party because they are really missing the boat by not  protecting America and our information.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, you know what, you know, if Congress doesn't it, the  voter could and probably will. Zach Mottl of Atlas Tool Works, thanks for  coming in. We'd like you to come on again soon, sir. </p><p>MOTTL:  We'll see you soon, Elizabeth. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you. Let's get Ned Ryun's reaction. Ned Ryun is one  of the top analysts out there, he's been watching D.C. Ned, I want your  reaction to the conversation we just had.</p><p>NED RYUN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  Well, I got to tell you, I  mean, initially, when you have a clip of Senator Warren saying -- Warner  saying about the fifth-generation 5G networks and Huawei, I mean, that's  one of things. </p><p>I wrote about this for Fox News during the week of Thanksgiving, Liz, in  which I said we have to be very careful because there is a proxy battle  being fought right now between United States and China between QUALCOMM and  Huawei over who's going to control that 5G network, and you are right. </p><p>The implications for the internet of things, right now there is about eight  billion internet of things devices. That number is probably going to triple  in the next three years. And who's going to control the networks and the  data is going to be massive as we move forward into the future.</p><p>And on the other front, you're right. I mean, they have been robbing us  blind. We have helped build the largest authoritarian police state in China  with really bad trade deals, and now we have looked the other way as they  literally over the last probably 10 years, Liz, I've seen estimates about  three trillion are in technology theft and between theft and force  technology transfers that we basically incentivize and given them the means  to compete with us on the technology front, but also on the economic front  and they're not shy about it. </p><p>They are gunning for us. They want to replace us as the center of the  economic world. And right now, for in the past, we've been lightening them  get away with it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know what, there's that and there's also this other  geopolitical risk that the White House is trying to address as well, Ned.  Look at this. New satellite images reveal activity and an unidentified  North Korean missile base. </p><p>So that's also a neck of the woods. What's you take on that?</p><p>RYUN:  Well, my take on this, is again, this has been the failure of the  three previous administrations kicking the can down the road of refusing to  actually deal with the North Korean threat. And now Trump has been  confronted with it. He realizes we cannot have this existential threat with  North Korea having nuclear armaments and being able to literally at some  point in the not-too-distant future have the ability to drop warheads on  American cities. </p><p>The key to this, though, Liz, and it's all, again, like you said, it's all  interconnected. We actually need China to play ball with us on North Korea  to deal with this threat. And so, this whole trade dispute taking place  with China, all of this stuff is interconnected. We have to figure out how  to see China accommodate our interest in real life. They've got to  prioritize our interest.</p><p>And so, this whole trade deal is not only tied to bad trade deals and  intellectual theft. It's also tied to how we deal with North Korea as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. And to your point, China's military has been boosting the  number of warplane intrusions into South Korea airspace, nearly doubling  the number of times in recent years. Your take on that.</p><p>RYUN:  Well, I mean, China, the amazing part to me is how brash China is  and we're acting, we are letting them get away with this. They have been  waging this economic war. They've been threatening us. They've been doing  building these islands in the South China Seas and we've just been sitting  there as though, we, you know, we don't know what they're up to. We know  exactly what they are up to. And I think it's time. </p><p>Obviously, if we can really deal this economic trade and put them on notice  I think we can start to deal with some of these military threats as well. </p><p>Trump is right to do this and I know that some people are worried about  this tariff fight. I will say this, Liz. If we do not confront China now in  the next few years, I'm convinced we will regret it for the next hundred  years. Because China does not want trade partners. China wants tributary  nations. And if we are not careful, if we deal with this trade threat and  these bad trade deals and this theft of our intellectual property we're not  going to like where we're at in 10 or 15 years.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, you make a great point there. Let's move over to  what's going on in Russia, Ned. I'd like your reaction to Russia doing some  saber rattling, showing off new laser weapons after the U.S. is threatening  to pull out of missile, that missile treaty dating back to the 80s because  of Russia cheating. What's your take on that?</p><p>RYUN:  I go back to, you know, despite all the left screaming buddy  murderer about Trump being too cozy with Putin, he is actually been pretty  aggressive with him, especially on the energy front. Over 50 percent of  Russia's, the Russian governments income comes from oil and gas exports.  And Trump knows what he's doing on this front.</p><p>Obviously, he confronted Merkel on Nord Stream II and Russia importing even  more natural gas to Germany, and Trump said you can't do that. He's also  gone in and address a lot of the middle and eastern and European countries  and the three C's initiative in which he is trying to get them off of  Russian energy. </p><p>Because he realizes, Trump realizes if you can cut off Russian exports in  these energy areas of gas and oil, he's going to undermine all this other  stuff that's taking place. So, he's focused on the right things. He has to  cut off the Europeans from getting or being wholly dependent or  significantly dependent on Russian energy. And if he can do that, I think  he's going to really be able to put Putin in his place.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you, Ned Ryun. Great to see you. Come back soon.</p><p>RYUN:  Thanks, Liz. We'll do.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Next case, this morning 1000 friends and family attended the  funeral service at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston to say a final  farewell to President George H.W. Bush.</p><p>In attendance, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris, baseball legends Nolan  Ryan, and Tommy Lasorda. And also, country singers Crystal Gayle and Larry  Gatlin. The funeral train carry the casket of our 41st president a short  time ago to the presidential library at Texas A&amp;M University. </p><p>The president was laid to rest alongside his wife Barbara.</p><p>We're going to be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. tech execs from Google, Microsoft, and Oracle met  today at the White House with Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Larry Kudlow and  others to talk about securing U.S. manufacturing dominance, and artificial  intelligence, quantum computing, and more. Facebook executives not  attending.</p><p>But to the real fireworks. The fight in D.C. with G.M. G.M. CEO Mary Barra  met again today with lawmakers. They are pretty upset over G.M.'s big tax  breaks in the face of G.M. plants -- plans to shut factories and lay off  14,000 workers.</p><p>Look at this. FiatChrysler, though, plans to open a new factory in  Detroit.</p><p>Let's bring in Republican Ohio Congressman Warren Davidson. Good to see  you, sir. </p><p>REP. WARREN DAVIDSON, (R) OHIO:  Good to talk with you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, people are upset that G.M. keeps coming all the time  with tin cap in hand getting a lot of federal bailout help, and wait for  it, a lot of state tax breaks and bailout help too. And you know, Ohio gave  G.M. a ton of tax breaks, but now that factories are closing. What's your  take on this?</p><p>DAVIDSON:  You know, it's truly disappointing. And I've been in Congress  now for about two and half years, but prior to that, for the previous 15  years I was in manufacturing. So, when you talk the intersection of big  tech and automotive, they're really more interconnected than you would  imagine. </p><p>So, when Mary Barra came and talked with the Ohio delegation, she really  led with the transformation that the auto industry is confronting. And you  know, one of the points that I wanted to make is, you know, the good news  is, is unlike in '08, '09 when this was happening, Ohio strong and growing.  G.M. is anomaly our states hiring. </p><p>I offered to drive our economic development folks up to do a job fair at  the plant. So, G.M. is offering those folks jobs I'm sure the eighth  district would be happy to have them.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. But here's the thing. We've been watching and I've been  watching G.M. for years. I've been doing business journalism for three  decades. I was at the Wall Street Journal. I was an editor at Forbes. I've  been writing about G.M. for a long time, sir. </p><p>Here's the problem. Here's one of the issues. Ohio in 2008 gave state  income tax breaks to G.M., saying you don't have to pay 75 percent of your  income taxes to the state of Ohio over the next 15 years. </p><p>So, here's the thing. Should elected officials say once and for all, OK,  we'll give you, Mr. car company or Mr. G.M., a tax break, with the caveat  that you have to show us how you will build factories that you can retool  to make -- to make either smaller or bigger vehicles when gas prices go up  or down. Other car companies do that, why can't G.M.?</p><p>DAVIDSON:  Well, the good news is Honda's been doing that. They reinvested,  the Honda Accord wasn't selling as well as they thought. The CRV is selling  way better, I think two-thirds of the cars on the road that are in demand  right now our crossovers, SUVs or trucks. And Honda who is a huge anchor  for Ohio has been very adaptive. </p><p>G.M. not quite as flexible. There's a lot of history behind that. And you  know, frankly, some of the things were the government has been involved  that shows frankly, the government should be not try to run these  companies. We don't need more central planning.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Got that. Check that. Understood. I hear totally what you're  saying. I don't mean to interrupt. But that is agreed upon. We don't want  that. We don't want the government in there. But G.M. does really rapidly  come with a tin cap getting our tax help.</p><p>I mean, it's striking, sir, that we're -- that, you know, that FiatChrysler is now opening a factory in Detroit. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Yes. I mean, that's great. And you know, we'll see where that  goes for G.M. You know, I think they've been outperformed by a number of  companies that's why they have to come hot in hand and begging for help.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, that's been going on for decades.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'm telling you that's been going on for decades. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. Not to mention the subsidies that are going on to  try to steer consumers to buy this car or that car.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  And the areas (Ph) of government shouldn't be trying to steer  that. And the good news for G.M. is maybe they finally got the message as,  you are not going to get any more bailouts. The American people don't want  to bail you out nor anyone else, and so you are going to have to take care  of your balance sheet and do the right things.</p><p>So, I was impressed that Mary Barra came and was proactively speaking to us  on the hill. But yes, very sad news about the investment in Lordstown,  Ohio, in particular.</p><p>MACDONALD:  But you know what, but what about putting the feet to the fire.  I understand. I watch Mary Barra. We have a lot of respect for her. She is  a great CEO. But listen closely to what she says, OK. A lot of that is a  lot of P.R. talk. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You got to get to the nuts and bolts. Is she going to move jobs  to other factories in the U.S.? And you know, is she going to stop  outsourcing to Mexico? We understand the economics of it, but we also  understand the economics of giving out tax breaks when you're not, you  know, building factories that are flexible, right? Final word.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. And when you look at where the intellectual property  and the tech is, the good news is a lot of that happened in the U.S. and  when you tie that to what you're talking about earlier is the tech folks  coming to the White House. </p><p>The Foreign Investment Risk Reduction Modernization Act, that was one of  the biggest piece of registration that the House financial services  committee move this past year. It was an honor to work on it. Really our  country is going to be more secure, our country is going to be stronger. </p><p>And frankly, if we can complement that with a good reform to privacy so  that we can make sure that whether it's on the internet or in your car or  in app that you download on the phone it's always your data as a consumer.  And I was impressed that was one of the questions I put to Mary is that it  is an opt in practice for G.M. in the car.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  And so, I hope we can do that more and I hope that they'll see  that the competitive advantage in the United States means they should  continue to invest including in Ohio. We have a tremendous supply chain and  folks are happy to supply them.</p><p>MACDONALD:  There's great people in Ohio. Great people in Michigan, great  people in the heartland. Congressman Warren Davidson, thank you so much. We  really appreciate it. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to other headline news. Search and rescue efforts  still underway after two U.S. military planes collided in midair and crash  off the coast of Japan overnight. It happened during a refueling exercise.  One marine killed, another in fair condition. </p><p>However, five marines still missing. Our thoughts and prayers are with the  families there.</p><p>A Southwest Airlines flight get it off the runway upon landing in heavy  rain at Burbank Airport in California. There were no reported injuries.  Among the 117 passengers, they were evacuated using emergency slides.  That's pretty scary stuff.</p><p>And drug company, it's called Tris Pharma, now recalling some of its  children's Ibuprofen after it was notified about overly high concentrations  of that drug that can affect a child's kidneys. This brand was sold under  private label brands at CVS, Wal-Mart and Family Dollar. Check those labels  there.</p><p>Now to the border wall. Brand new analysis on how it saves thousands of  lives. We've got one of the best columnists and thinkers out there. Tammy  Bruce is coming up.</p><p>But first, Congress kicked of the can down the road again. Another  temporary spending budget. What are we sending them to D.C. for? It means  you may see a government shut down by just in time for Christmas. We're  going to tell you what they're fighting about now and why this is the best  case for term limits. We're at the bottom of the hour. Stay there. Back in  two.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're watching the Fox Business Network. To  government spending, again, Congress passing a temporary interim spending  bill today that is going to let the government be funded for two more  weeks, really is just kicking the can down the road again. Congress will  have to vote on this again before midnight on December 21st.</p><p>Joining me now, Trump 2020 campaign advisory board member Madison Gesiotto  and Democrat strategist Al Mottur. I know you guys love talking about this.  Madison, look at this, from Pew Research, you're not going to believe it.  Congress has only managed to pass all required appropriations measures on  time, wait for it, just four times since fiscal 1977. Is this an argument  for term limits. I mean, what do we send them into D.C. to do?</p><p>MADISON GESIOTTO, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, NATIONAL  DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP:  It's one of the many arguments for term  limits. I mean, Congress seems repeatedly every single year do not be able  to do their job. I remember last Christmas, we talked about the same thing.</p><p>Every single year, they are never meeting the requirements, they are never  doing their job. It's such a shame that we continue to have to talk about  this. For over 20 years, they haven't met the requirements. So those four  times between 1977 and 1997, it's frustrating.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. So here's the thing, Al. This is what I'm wondering if we  should do. You know what, Congress, it's sort of like telling your children  to go to their room until you get the job done. We're going to sequester  you in D.C., no grandstanding for the cameras, no campaigning, no political  rallies, no fundraising, you got to be quarantined in D.C. and get a  spending bill on time. How about that?</p><p>AL MOTTUR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Hey, we might as well try it. I mean,  look, you're on to something when you say no campaigning, no fundraising.  The politics have taken over the dynamic in the Congress and there is way  too much time spent on the phone dialing for dollars and don't have enough  time doing work for the American people. That's on both sides of the aisle.  There's got to be a way to stop it. Maybe term limits is part of the  answer. I think campaign finance reform is another.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Pelosi now says she won't accept a pretty decent DACA  deal in exchange for border wall funding. That's what it has come down to  right now. What do you think?</p><p>GESIOTTO:  I think what's frustrating about what she is doing is the fact  that she is unwilling to compromise. I mean, when we look at Congress and  the idea of why we have two parties and why we have Democrats and  Republicans in Congress work together is because they need to compromise to  get to the end solution.</p><p>Sometimes, you are going to have to give a little to get a little. The  Republicans have tried to do that on many issues. Of course, they are not  perfect. But the Democrats slightly have really let their hate for our  president overcome their ability to get anything done.</p><p>MOTTUR:  That's not what is going on here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It feels like it's going on. Go ahead, Al. Finish your point.</p><p>MOTTUR:  No, it's not. I mean, the parties for two decades have been unable  to do immigration compromise. I agree we have to compromise. It's not  because --</p><p>MACDONALD:  But they are purposely politicizing the border. That's the  issue. We know that for a fact from internal e-mails --</p><p>MOTTUR:  Both sides are politicizing the border, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We know for a fact from internal e-mails that Democrat Super  PAC say that's the way to go in order to get that voter. But here's the  thing. Democrats, Al, and you've talked about this too, starting in 2005,  2006 and all the way through 2013, said yeah, to border security. Just get  it done. We have this moment in time after the George H.W. Bush funeral,  that there seems to be some kind of unity. Get it done.</p><p>MOTTUR:  I don't think the president would accept the border wall for a  DACA deal, first of all. And second of all, the president --</p><p>MACDONALD:  We did have one. He had a DACA deal, 1.3 million DACA, to do a  border wall. The Americans want it. They don't our security dealt with like  a political football.</p><p>MOTTUR:  I wish we could compromise on immigration. It's not just right  now. It's not hatred for this president. It has been going on for a long  time.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Should get it done now. Should get it done yesterday. How about  that?</p><p>MOTTUR:  I am for it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Go ahead, Madison.</p><p>GESIOTTO:  You know, Al, you are saying that's simply not true, that the  Democrats are willing to compromise. When you look back 10, 20 years, we  just actually talked about this with Liz last week, the Democrats supported  many of the things that they are now going against when it comes to  immigration.</p><p>So that is your perfect and prime example right there as to why their hate  for our president has changed their views and clouded their judgment when  it comes to the immigration issue specifically.</p><p>MOTTUR:  I don't believe it's about hate to the president. I believe it's  on both sides, Republicans and Democrats --</p><p>GESIOTTO:  Obstruction --</p><p>MOTTUR:  -- pulling the football away.</p><p>GESIOTTO:  We can use any word there.</p><p>MOTTUR:  -- Charlie Brown. And Trump does it too.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, Al, maybe we can all move beyond that and just tell D.C.,  your voice, Al, and Madison's voice, and the viewer and the people out  there saying, you know what, we're done with you, D.C., we're over it. It's  sort of like you tell a child to go to your room until you clean it. Get it  done.</p><p>MOTTUR:  Maybe if there were thermal on Madison (ph), I can go up there and  get it done.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, I'll tell you something. It's just astonishing. I  want your reaction, Al. Congress has managed only four times since fiscal  1977, just four times, to pass all of its required spending measures on  time. Really?</p><p>MOTTUR:  It's ridiculous. They ought to be here more than three days a  week. They ought to be here four, five days a week.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>MOTTUR:  And that would help. Fundraising is a problem. Like I said, term  limits could be part of the solution. But there is no incentive for them to  get this done because there is no punishment.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right, because this is term limits. Madison and Al, thank you  so much. Great fun --</p><p>MOTTUR:  Great to be with you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey will testify  privately behind closed doors on Capitol Hill tomorrow. It will be  transcribed and then released to the public within 24 hours. But how will  the media report on that? Will you get to the truth on what James Comey  said? We're going to break it down.</p><p>But first, why a border wall could save thousands of lives every year?  Tammy Bruce on that. We're going to explain after the break. Back in two.  Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know when something is staring right at you and you say  eureka (ph) of course, absolutely. My next guest has that moment for you,  says President Trump's border wall could help save thousands of lives.  Joining me now, Fox News political contributor, Independent Women's Voice  president, great columnist, writer, Tammy Bruce.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  I'm glad you got to check.  Thank you, dear. Look, my column is up today. This is not new. This is not  new news. What was shocking to me was the CDC report that came out about  last week, that noted and obviously should alarm all of us, that the drug  overdose deaths and suicides are at historic highs, right?</p><p>In just 2017, over 72,000 people died from drug overdoses. That is more  than the U.S. deaths in the Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. In  one year in this country, suicides are at their historic high, about 49,000  suicides also in 2017.</p><p>The CDC doesn't want to speculate, they say, on the cause. But what they do  recognize also is the importation of drugs, the opioid epidemic, people now  moving from prescription drug dynamic because we are at war with that, so  they turn to heroin. And then there is fentanyl which is now the new  synthetic opioid which kills you pretty much right away. It's a tiny, tiny  amount that will kill you.</p><p>We got single individuals bringing into the country, and somebody was  caught just a few weeks ago, bringing over enough that would kill 300  million Americans, and because it takes so little to end up killing you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>BRUCE:  This is at the border. Eighty percent of the fentanyl in this  country comes in through the southern border, and also China is involved in  that facilitation as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It's just two milligrams. We just show that stat, 78 million.  That's based on the amount of fentanyl seized at the border last year and  the first quarter of this year. Life expectancy has been dragged down by  what is going on.</p><p>BRUCE:  That is correct, because you got middle aged individuals, right?  You got -- those are the individuals who are dying too early because of the  drug addiction and because of suicide. Look, one thing we know about  suicide is it's usually not one issue. It can be a multitude of issues. But  when you're also dealing with drug addiction, any addiction, certainly  alcoholism, but the opioid addiction creates hopelessness.</p><p>We've dealt with now -- thank goodness in the economic recovery, but the  last 10 years, people losing their homes, losing their savings, losing  their jobs. That combined with drug addiction. And then of course President  Obama, we lost our hospitals and our doctors and any real access to health  care. That we think of course has contributed to the nature of the suicide  choice. So it is  -- that in it of itself, because of the core of the  people affected is dragging down the U.S. life expectancy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Astonishing, that finding. You know, President Trump is saying  China will try to stop the importation of fentanyl into our country. That's  part of the trade deal. But Thomas Homan, to your point, former acting ICE  director, said, you know, having the troops at the border is making the  drug cartels berserk and crazy. He told us that on the show last week.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yeah. You know, he is -- what they have done is, because of the  caravan, we've obviously boosted up the numbers, and the cartels which have  relied on kind of a lax framework are furious because it is affecting their  ability to move the drugs in.</p><p>This is why when we talk about the wall, it is not just about we need an  orderly framework that happens at the border, but we must take seriously  what's going on and how these drugs are moving into the country, when 80  percent of fentanyl is coming in through the southern border.</p><p>And by the way, the majority of heroin as well is not coming from  Afghanistan, it's grown in Mexico. It's cultivated there and moved in  through Mexico. So the wall is something that not only are we dealing with  keeping bad guys out and killers and all of that and human trafficking, but  to stop this.</p><p>When you got three wars of the deaths combined including Vietnam in one  year, how is this not a war? All the American people deserve to be taken  seriously and to have --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is it Trump's White House capitalizing on this, what you're  talking about?</p><p>BRUCE:  Look, they have got to talk more about the other issues that are  involving the wall and why this matters. People know the opioid crisis and  the prescription drugs, right, OxyContin. We know that there is a heroin  problem. People don't know that people have gone to street drugs when they  can't get a prescription. And where is that coming from? When you think of  heroin, when you think of a poppy fields in Afghanistan --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>BRUCE:  They got to talk more about this. This transcends political  parties, economic status, all of those things. And I wish the president  would speak more about it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Tammy Bruce, you're going to be with us later in the show.  Great information there. Wow! We had a jam-packed hour. Coming up, a major  arrest of illegals in Massachusetts. More than 50 illegal immigrants busted  in a multi-day swift (ph) in New England. Look at this. Three of them  wanted for murder.</p><p>But first, it's the testimony we have been waiting for. Tomorrow, former  FBI Director James Comey, he is going to get a Capitol Hill grilling behind  closed doors. But how will the media report on that? That's next. Stay  there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. Tomorrow, House Republicans will finally get  their chance to grill former FBI Director James Comey behind closed doors  about his actions and anti-Trump bias infecting the top levels of the FBI  during the election. Again, behind closed doors. The transcript will be  made public within 24 hours of that sessions. Joe Concha is a media  reporter for The Hill. He joins us now. So how are they going to report on  it? What do you think, Joe?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL:  Well, if it's going to be made  public in 24 hours, then I would imagine something because nothing gets  slip (ph) in Washington. Everything gets slip (ph) in Washington. Within an  hour, somebody is going to have to use the bathroom, there will be a call  from some reporter and then you're going to hear about it. But at least  everything is going to be out in 24 hours, sometimes that doesn't happen.</p><p>I think they got the wrong guy here, Liz. I want to know why Rod Rosenstein  isn't being called before Congress. He is the guy just nine weeks ago who  said, yeah, you know, I think I'll wear a wire and try to trap the  president, try to get him on tape to compel his cabinet to invoke the 25th  Amendment. I would have had him on there instead.</p><p>But, OK, we have Comey. Here's the thing about Comey. He's an open book.  Literally he's an open book. He wrote a book in April. He did a thousand  interviews after that. I might be exaggerating. Most probably dozens and  dozens. So everything seems to be out there already, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I hear what you're saying because -- let's be clear. This is  about Trump-hating, pro-Hillary FBI director and there are talks about  stopping Trump, impeaching Trump. Really the issue is that FISA warrant to  basically surveil Trump campaign aides because it looks like they really  did break the regulations in getting that FISA warrant, right?</p><p>CONCHA:  It appears that way. Absolutely. So, but I wonder, Comey who is a  very good public speaker, we could agree on that, when he's done his  testimonies, it has been the type of thing where he seems to be pretty  measured in his responses. He is ready for whatever question --</p><p>MACDONALD:  He has got to answer. Did you tell the FISA court that it was  funded by the Democrats, partly, you even said it was unverified on  salacious. Did you know at the time that it was unverified? Did you tell  the court that, right?</p><p>CONCHA:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You got to get that out of him.</p><p>CONCHA:  And if so, why? Was it because --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Why you --</p><p>CONCHA:  -- the president.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>CONCHA:  Right, exactly. Why didn't you pursue going down this particular  route? I also want to know why he leaked a private conversation or  conversations that he had with the president over dinner at the White  House, then leaked everything he talked about to a friend at Columbia  University, who then gave it too The New York Times, and he admits for the  sole purpose of compelling a special counsel to be appointed, and it  happened. How is that not illegal?</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We want -- can we have you back on to talk about it?</p><p>CONCHA:  Absotively (ph).</p><p>MACDONALD:  Absotively (ph). Joe Concha. That's great. Good to see you,  sir. Coming up, we are going to get to that ICE arrest. More than 50  illegals including three wanted for murder in sanctuary city friendly New  England. We're going to have Tammy Bruce back on that. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. ICE arresting more than 50 illegal immigrants  over the past two days. It happened across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New  Hampshire, and Connecticut. Among those arrested, three immigrants,  illegals from Brazil, wanted there for murder.</p><p>The ICE raids taking place the very same week that the Massachusetts  Republican governor said, you know what, a state judge must temporarily  step down after that judge let an undocumented immigrant here basically  sneak out a backdoor to avoid ICE agents waiting to take him into custody.</p><p>Tammy Bruce is back with us. First on that story, Tammy, great to have you  back.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  That illegal that sneaked out (ph) the backdoor had been  deported multiple times for multiple drug arrests. And now the judge let  him go at the backdoor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yeah. It is interesting. During the court proceedings, the judge  called them up to the bench, and the judge asked for the recording to stop.  And that is when suddenly when that went back on and they resumed, there  was suddenly some machinations there to have the charges dropped.</p><p>And then somehow, the defense attorney was able to walk the defendant out  through a side door back through which would not have been allowed without  it being facilitated and being able to avoid as there was also (ph) ICE  agents.</p><p>Some judges and immigration advocates of course don't want ICE agents to be  able to go into courthouses. They have argued that they have to stay  outside and that seems to be changing a little bit. There is argument about  that. This is one of the reasons why they want that to be able to be in the  courthouses to deal with this kind of stuff.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What a story. And we have seen another courts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, this judge, understandably, they think the judge should not be  hearing any federal cases because if you are really obstructing law  enforcement, why should you be on the bench? I mean, as a judge, you are  supposed to be implementing the laws.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>BRUCE:  And adjudicating them as opposed to helping a defendant sneak out  to get away from federal law enforcement. That's crazy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  She hears criminal cases. Are you going to let other criminals  go?</p><p>BRUCE:  Right. No matter -- look, they are human beings. We all have  opinions on the issues. But if you're willing to skirt the law and allow  someone else to do so, what else are you doing that is not fair?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to the swifts (ph) in New England. The 50 arrested  illegal immigrants selling opioids. You have been talking about that.</p><p>BRUCE:  Oh, yeah. This is our prior discussion. This is the big deal.  Trafficking in heroin. Trafficking in fentanyl. These are not drug users,  these are traffickers. And so this is where -- it is also a reminder to  people what ICE does. This is inside the country. It's the internal  framework.</p><p>They do not handle the border. They deal with criminals, the gangs, the  drug traffickers, sex traffickers, kidnappers, murderers, getting these  three Brazilians who are wanted for murder in that country, that's what ICE  does.</p><p>This is the organization that many Democrats want to abolish. That would be  a mistake because the people that are targeted and affected first and  victimized first are the communities of immigrants.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right, that's a point.</p><p>BRUCE:  This is who we are trying to protect here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right. But, you know, here is the other point about the story.  Several towns in Massachusetts here, they're sanctuary cities. It's Boston,  Cambridge, Lawrence and Newton. These are the cities where these  individuals have been detained.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's right. So the people that were scooped up had been in  custody. And then were released. Again, you think, well, was this somebody  who was driving under the influence or somebody who made a mistake? No,  these are drug traffickers. These are very serious individuals.</p><p>MACDONALD:  But the victims of the crimes are treated like rounding errors  in D.C. There is not a human being behind it that is treated --</p><p>BRUCE:  Big government, whether it is about health care or even law  enforcement. When people become the budget and you become a chit on a piece  of paper, you stop being a human being. This is why local law enforcement  matters. You know, judges matter.</p><p>They are supposed to see the individuals and yet they claim it is because  they are sensitive to immigrants, but this kind of action re-victimizes  immigrants. Legal immigrants who are playing by the rules and even  undocumented people who are also playing by the rules. Those are the people  that are protected by ICE.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Great stuff again from Tammy Bruce. You're going to come back  soon.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'll look forward to it. Thank you so much for having us in  your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on the  Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It  was down nearly 800 points, and then down about 80 points, doing a major  rethink after the initial freak out, panicked attack over the arrest that  U.S. request in Canada of the CFO of Huawei, that's China's top tech giant. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That CFO, the daughter of Huawei's founder, a former Chinese military  officer. She's arrested on charges that Huawei broke U.S. sanctions by  selling U.S. technology to Iran. We've got details on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Wall Streeters now applauding President Trump's tough line in trade  talks with China because China is stealing to make China great again. We've  got fresh new details on that. And it has to stop. </p><p>What's going on we've got an insider who has a front row seat on how China  has hollowed out entire U.S. industries and taken U.S. jobs. And why Trump  is right to fix the problem that elected officials for years have done  nothing about.</p><p>The Dow down 8 percent since its October high. But take a breath for some  perspective. Historically it is normal to have these kinds of downturns. We  bring you what you need to know.</p><p>Plus, tech execs at the White House today on how to beat China and more.  But the real firework is a fight in D.C. over G.M. getting not just loathes  of federal bailout help but state bailout help and tax breaks too, where it  hardly pays any taxes as its closing U.S. factories and laying off  thousands of people before Christmastime, sending those factory jobs to  Mexico. We've got the back story to FBN's exclusive with CEO Mary Barra. </p><p>Also, Democrat in-fighting over border wall funding. Nancy Pelosi now  saying she will not even accept a decent DACA deal in exchange for border  wall funding. People sick and tired of D.C. politics.</p><p>This as we bring you two big border scandals now hurting Americans. </p><p>Well, thank you for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money, politics. We  got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. The  Evening Edit starts right now. </p><p>OK. Let's get to the China outrage over the arrest of Huawei's CFO. They  are now demanding her release accusing the U.S. and Canada of quote,  \"wrongdoing.\" This is over violating Iran sanctions. But Wall Street  analysts point out other countries are saying Huawei is pretty bad. </p><p>Australia, New Zealand, Britain's telecom B.T. all kicked out Huawei over  fears that Huawei is stealing and spying giving its ties to China's  military. And they say President Trump is right. China for years has been  hollowing out U.S. jobs and entire U.S. industries, not funding its own  R&amp;D, but instead, stealing our research to make China great again. </p><p>Our companies pay for that research. China then sells cheaper copycats,  undercutting us. We're talking nuclear power generators, solar cells,  computer hardware, software, and more.</p><p>Let's get to Edward Lawrence in D.C. with more on that Huawei arrest.  Edward? </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Liz. And don't forget,  circuit boards. That was a huge thing that Chinese put out. And right now,  the arrest of chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou threatens to destabilize  the fragile trade negotiations that have been going on between the U.S. and  China. </p><p>China calling for Canada to release the Huawei CFO. A spokesperson for the  Chinese foreign ministry says, \"The detention of a person without giving a  clear reason is of course a violation of the human rights to the person, or  of the person.\" </p><p>Now China claims they don't know the reason that she was detained. She is  being investigated by the U.S. for possible violations for breaking the  sanctions related to Iran. Now, the timing of arrest is interesting. She  was being detained in Canada the same day President Donald Trump worked out  a path forward on trade talks with China. </p><p>The national security advisor John Bolton told NPR that he was made aware  of the arrest and that it would happen. The White House, though, telling us  that the president did not know about it before he met with President Xi.  Regardless, some senators applauding the U.S. for sticking to its morals.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER, (D) VIRGINIA:  My fear is when the Trump administration  is going to crumble on Huawei the same way they crumbled on ZTE. And as we  think about particularly we move to the next generation of wireless 5G and  that transformation is as big as anything that we've seen in the wireless  industry. And my fear is that China could be successful at setting the  standards and dominating that market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  And national security advisor John Bolton also told NPR that  this is a Justice Department matter and they don't always tell the  president what they are doing. Liz?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Great to see you, Edward. Thank you so much.</p><p>Joining me now is Zach Mottl, he is a top executive at Atlas Tool Works.  This is a company that has had a front row seat for years watching China's  high-tech theft. We welcome you to the show, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p>ZACH MOTTL, CHIEF ALIGNMENT OFFICER, ATLAS TOOL WORKS:  Great to be here,  Elizabeth.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Your company makes precision parts for the internet, radar  systems, medical devices. What do you guys seeing, is President Trump right  about China stealing to make China great again. </p><p>MOTTL:  He's absolutely right. You know, Huawei has built a $90 billion  global enterprise based on commercial espionage, theft of western  technology. You know, my customers are offered -- my business has been  around for 100 years, and for 90 out of the 100 years we were a vendor in  the telecom industry. That was a really important sector for myself and  many other manufacturers like me.</p><p>And we watched as Chinese manufacturers Huawei ZTE came online, and in 20  years they wiped out every single western competitor. Lucent Technologies,  Tellabs, Nortel Networks in Canada. Every one of these companies could not  compete against commercial espionage and state subsidized technology.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Because they're undercutting us taking our jobs, our R&amp;D that  we pay for and then making cheaper copycats. Sir, isn't this a big wake-up  call to Congress to say, you know a what, knock it off about the media  grandstanding before, you know, the D.C. cameras and get on the stick.  Because China has a built-in road project that made in China 2025 project.</p><p>I mean, Obama, President Obama did try to stop China, but it's really up to  Congress to get our trade laws updated to knock it, to get it to knock it  off, right?</p><p>MOTTL:  That's right. This telecom industry was the crown jewel of America  and it portray laws and lack of oversight by Congress has allow the Chinese  to steal this. Let's not lose one more high-tech industry. And quite  frankly, let's bring the telephone manufacturing industry back here. </p><p>We're about to have 5G, and you know, we can worry about the security or we  can simply make it here and know that it's good. Because what we've learned  with this Huawei case and so many other cases, is that we just can't trust  the Chinese. They say one thing, but they do something completely  different. So, I'm hoping Congress will step up to the plate here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We hope so too, because this is got to stop, sir. I mean, this  should be hair on fire and break the glass time right now in D.C.</p><p>MOTTL:  That's right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Because to your point, we just cited these other countries  worried about Huawei. Also, you mentioned 5G. China is embedding itself and  the fears it's going to go into that new 5G rollout worldwide. That's the  internet of things. That's wearable fitness trackers. It's robots, taxis  and the like. </p><p>I mean, if China gets to jump on that and starts embedding itself in 5G,  wow, game over.</p><p>MOTTL:  That's right. And they're counting on, you know, they're taking  advantage of the free market. They are going to undercut price and they are  going to subsidize it to try to buy the market. We cannot let that happen.  We need to put laws in place and we need our other country partners to work  with us to shut them out of the market. Because again, we just cannot trust  them. And when they say they are not spying I certainly think they are.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All this breathtakingly tedious grandstanding in D.C. over it,  and they are setting aside what really matters and that's what you're  talking about. Because, sir, look what happened to U.S. Steel. U.S. Steel  spent tons of money to pioneer a new lighter, higher grade steel product  for cars and planes, but then China hacked it and hacked its computers,  stole the blueprints and started selling copycats steel at way cheaper  prices, right?</p><p>MOTTL:  When profit doesn't matter to these companies and they have a  government behind them helping them cheat and steal, how can we compete? We  need to do it smarter. And what it comes down to is jobs. It's not just  about high-tech and innovation. It's about jobs. It's about national  security. </p><p>And the employees like mine, you know, when I lost my telecom customers in  the early 2000, we have to lay people off. We reinvented ourselves, but a  lot of other companies couldn't. Telecom and so many other sectors are  really important. We're talking about good jobs for Americans versus growth  and good jobs for people in China. I want to see it made here and I want to  see it secure and safe so we can trust what's going through our network.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And now, we got indications that China made in behind that  massive Marriott hack affecting half a billion people potentially. Wow.</p><p>MOTTL:  It's pervasive. It is pervasive and everything that they do they  just simply play by a different set of rules, so they can tell us one thing  but we know they are going to do something else. We can't trust them. </p><p>So, I'm pleased to see President Trump, you know, holding firm. I trust his  judgment here and I hope that Congress is going to come along and finally  join the wise party because they are really missing the boat by not  protecting America and our information.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, you know what, you know, if Congress doesn't it, the  voter could and probably will. Zach Mottl of Atlas Tool Works, thanks for  coming in. We'd like you to come on again soon, sir. </p><p>MOTTL:  We'll see you soon, Elizabeth. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you. Let's get Ned Ryun's reaction. Ned Ryun is one  of the top analysts out there, he's been watching D.C. Ned, I want your  reaction to the conversation we just had.</p><p>NED RYUN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  Well, I got to tell you, I  mean, initially, when you have a clip of Senator Warren saying -- Warner  saying about the fifth-generation 5G networks and Huawei, I mean, that's  one of things. </p><p>I wrote about this for Fox News during the week of Thanksgiving, Liz, in  which I said we have to be very careful because there is a proxy battle  being fought right now between United States and China between QUALCOMM and  Huawei over who's going to control that 5G network, and you are right. </p><p>The implications for the internet of things, right now there is about eight  billion internet of things devices. That number is probably going to triple  in the next three years. And who's going to control the networks and the  data is going to be massive as we move forward into the future.</p><p>And on the other front, you're right. I mean, they have been robbing us  blind. We have helped build the largest authoritarian police state in China  with really bad trade deals, and now we have looked the other way as they  literally over the last probably 10 years, Liz, I've seen estimates about  three trillion are in technology theft and between theft and force  technology transfers that we basically incentivize and given them the means  to compete with us on the technology front, but also on the economic front  and they're not shy about it. </p><p>They are gunning for us. They want to replace us as the center of the  economic world. And right now, for in the past, we've been lightening them  get away with it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know what, there's that and there's also this other  geopolitical risk that the White House is trying to address as well, Ned.  Look at this. New satellite images reveal activity and an unidentified  North Korean missile base. </p><p>So that's also a neck of the woods. What's you take on that?</p><p>RYUN:  Well, my take on this, is again, this has been the failure of the  three previous administrations kicking the can down the road of refusing to  actually deal with the North Korean threat. And now Trump has been  confronted with it. He realizes we cannot have this existential threat with  North Korea having nuclear armaments and being able to literally at some  point in the not-too-distant future have the ability to drop warheads on  American cities. </p><p>The key to this, though, Liz, and it's all, again, like you said, it's all  interconnected. We actually need China to play ball with us on North Korea  to deal with this threat. And so, this whole trade dispute taking place  with China, all of this stuff is interconnected. We have to figure out how  to see China accommodate our interest in real life. They've got to  prioritize our interest.</p><p>And so, this whole trade deal is not only tied to bad trade deals and  intellectual theft. It's also tied to how we deal with North Korea as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. And to your point, China's military has been boosting the  number of warplane intrusions into South Korea airspace, nearly doubling  the number of times in recent years. Your take on that.</p><p>RYUN:  Well, I mean, China, the amazing part to me is how brash China is  and we're acting, we are letting them get away with this. They have been  waging this economic war. They've been threatening us. They've been doing  building these islands in the South China Seas and we've just been sitting  there as though, we, you know, we don't know what they're up to. We know  exactly what they are up to. And I think it's time. </p><p>Obviously, if we can really deal this economic trade and put them on notice  I think we can start to deal with some of these military threats as well. </p><p>Trump is right to do this and I know that some people are worried about  this tariff fight. I will say this, Liz. If we do not confront China now in  the next few years, I'm convinced we will regret it for the next hundred  years. Because China does not want trade partners. China wants tributary  nations. And if we are not careful, if we deal with this trade threat and  these bad trade deals and this theft of our intellectual property we're not  going to like where we're at in 10 or 15 years.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, you make a great point there. Let's move over to  what's going on in Russia, Ned. I'd like your reaction to Russia doing some  saber rattling, showing off new laser weapons after the U.S. is threatening  to pull out of missile, that missile treaty dating back to the 80s because  of Russia cheating. What's your take on that?</p><p>RYUN:  I go back to, you know, despite all the left screaming buddy  murderer about Trump being too cozy with Putin, he is actually been pretty  aggressive with him, especially on the energy front. Over 50 percent of  Russia's, the Russian governments income comes from oil and gas exports.  And Trump knows what he's doing on this front.</p><p>Obviously, he confronted Merkel on Nord Stream II and Russia importing even  more natural gas to Germany, and Trump said you can't do that. He's also  gone in and address a lot of the middle and eastern and European countries  and the three C's initiative in which he is trying to get them off of  Russian energy. </p><p>Because he realizes, Trump realizes if you can cut off Russian exports in  these energy areas of gas and oil, he's going to undermine all this other  stuff that's taking place. So, he's focused on the right things. He has to  cut off the Europeans from getting or being wholly dependent or  significantly dependent on Russian energy. And if he can do that, I think  he's going to really be able to put Putin in his place.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you, Ned Ryun. Great to see you. Come back soon.</p><p>RYUN:  Thanks, Liz. We'll do.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Next case, this morning 1000 friends and family attended the  funeral service at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston to say a final  farewell to President George H.W. Bush.</p><p>In attendance, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris, baseball legends Nolan  Ryan, and Tommy Lasorda. And also, country singers Crystal Gayle and Larry  Gatlin. The funeral train carry the casket of our 41st president a short  time ago to the presidential library at Texas A&amp;M University. </p><p>The president was laid to rest alongside his wife Barbara.</p><p>We're going to be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. tech execs from Google, Microsoft, and Oracle met  today at the White House with Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Larry Kudlow and  others to talk about securing U.S. manufacturing dominance, and artificial  intelligence, quantum computing, and more. Facebook executives not  attending.</p><p>But to the real fireworks. The fight in D.C. with G.M. G.M. CEO Mary Barra  met again today with lawmakers. They are pretty upset over G.M.'s big tax  breaks in the face of G.M. plants -- plans to shut factories and lay off  14,000 workers.</p><p>Look at this. FiatChrysler, though, plans to open a new factory in  Detroit.</p><p>Let's bring in Republican Ohio Congressman Warren Davidson. Good to see  you, sir. </p><p>REP. WARREN DAVIDSON, (R) OHIO:  Good to talk with you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, people are upset that G.M. keeps coming all the time  with tin cap in hand getting a lot of federal bailout help, and wait for  it, a lot of state tax breaks and bailout help too. And you know, Ohio gave  G.M. a ton of tax breaks, but now that factories are closing. What's your  take on this?</p><p>DAVIDSON:  You know, it's truly disappointing. And I've been in Congress  now for about two and half years, but prior to that, for the previous 15  years I was in manufacturing. So, when you talk the intersection of big  tech and automotive, they're really more interconnected than you would  imagine. </p><p>So, when Mary Barra came and talked with the Ohio delegation, she really  led with the transformation that the auto industry is confronting. And you  know, one of the points that I wanted to make is, you know, the good news  is, is unlike in '08, '09 when this was happening, Ohio strong and growing.  G.M. is anomaly our states hiring. </p><p>I offered to drive our economic development folks up to do a job fair at  the plant. So, G.M. is offering those folks jobs I'm sure the eighth  district would be happy to have them.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. But here's the thing. We've been watching and I've been  watching G.M. for years. I've been doing business journalism for three  decades. I was at the Wall Street Journal. I was an editor at Forbes. I've  been writing about G.M. for a long time, sir. </p><p>Here's the problem. Here's one of the issues. Ohio in 2008 gave state  income tax breaks to G.M., saying you don't have to pay 75 percent of your  income taxes to the state of Ohio over the next 15 years. </p><p>So, here's the thing. Should elected officials say once and for all, OK,  we'll give you, Mr. car company or Mr. G.M., a tax break, with the caveat  that you have to show us how you will build factories that you can retool  to make -- to make either smaller or bigger vehicles when gas prices go up  or down. Other car companies do that, why can't G.M.?</p><p>DAVIDSON:  Well, the good news is Honda's been doing that. They reinvested,  the Honda Accord wasn't selling as well as they thought. The CRV is selling  way better, I think two-thirds of the cars on the road that are in demand  right now our crossovers, SUVs or trucks. And Honda who is a huge anchor  for Ohio has been very adaptive. </p><p>G.M. not quite as flexible. There's a lot of history behind that. And you  know, frankly, some of the things were the government has been involved  that shows frankly, the government should be not try to run these  companies. We don't need more central planning.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Got that. Check that. Understood. I hear totally what you're  saying. I don't mean to interrupt. But that is agreed upon. We don't want  that. We don't want the government in there. But G.M. does really rapidly  come with a tin cap getting our tax help.</p><p>I mean, it's striking, sir, that we're -- that, you know, that FiatChrysler is now opening a factory in Detroit. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Yes. I mean, that's great. And you know, we'll see where that  goes for G.M. You know, I think they've been outperformed by a number of  companies that's why they have to come hot in hand and begging for help.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, that's been going on for decades.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'm telling you that's been going on for decades. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. Not to mention the subsidies that are going on to  try to steer consumers to buy this car or that car.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  And the areas (Ph) of government shouldn't be trying to steer  that. And the good news for G.M. is maybe they finally got the message as,  you are not going to get any more bailouts. The American people don't want  to bail you out nor anyone else, and so you are going to have to take care  of your balance sheet and do the right things.</p><p>So, I was impressed that Mary Barra came and was proactively speaking to us  on the hill. But yes, very sad news about the investment in Lordstown,  Ohio, in particular.</p><p>MACDONALD:  But you know what, but what about putting the feet to the fire.  I understand. I watch Mary Barra. We have a lot of respect for her. She is  a great CEO. But listen closely to what she says, OK. A lot of that is a  lot of P.R. talk. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You got to get to the nuts and bolts. Is she going to move jobs  to other factories in the U.S.? And you know, is she going to stop  outsourcing to Mexico? We understand the economics of it, but we also  understand the economics of giving out tax breaks when you're not, you  know, building factories that are flexible, right? Final word.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. And when you look at where the intellectual property  and the tech is, the good news is a lot of that happened in the U.S. and  when you tie that to what you're talking about earlier is the tech folks  coming to the White House. </p><p>The Foreign Investment Risk Reduction Modernization Act, that was one of  the biggest piece of registration that the House financial services  committee move this past year. It was an honor to work on it. Really our  country is going to be more secure, our country is going to be stronger. </p><p>And frankly, if we can complement that with a good reform to privacy so  that we can make sure that whether it's on the internet or in your car or  in app that you download on the phone it's always your data as a consumer.  And I was impressed that was one of the questions I put to Mary is that it  is an opt in practice for G.M. in the car.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  And so, I hope we can do that more and I hope that they'll see  that the competitive advantage in the United States means they should  continue to invest including in Ohio. We have a tremendous supply chain and  folks are happy to supply them.</p><p>MACDONALD:  There's great people in Ohio. Great people in Michigan, great  people in the heartland. Congressman Warren Davidson, thank you so much. We  really appreciate it. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to other headline news. Search and rescue efforts  still underway after two U.S. military planes collided in midair and crash  off the coast of Japan overnight. It happened during a refueling exercise.  One marine killed, another in fair condition. </p><p>However, five marines still missing. Our thoughts and prayers are with the  families there.</p><p>A Southwest Airlines flight get it off the runway upon landing in heavy  rain at Burbank Airport in California. There were no reported injuries.  Among the 117 passengers, they were evacuated using emergency slides.  That's pretty scary stuff.</p><p>And drug company, it's called Tris Pharma, now recalling some of its  children's Ibuprofen after it was notified about overly high concentrations  of that drug that can affect a child's kidneys. This brand was sold under  private label brands at CVS, Wal-Mart and Family Dollar. Check those labels  there.</p><p>Now to the border wall. Brand new analysis on how it saves thousands of  lives. We've got one of the best columnists and thinkers out there. Tammy  Bruce is coming up.</p><p>But first, Congress kicked of the can down the road again. Another  temporary spending budget. What are we sending them to D.C. for? It means  you may see a government shut down by just in time for Christmas. We're  going to tell you what they're fighting about now and why this is the best  case for term limits. We're at the bottom of the hour. Stay there. Back in  two.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're watching the Fox Business Network. To  government spending, again, Congress passing a temporary interim spending  bill today that is going to let the government be funded for two more  weeks, really is just kicking the can down the road again. Congress will  have to vote on this again before midnight on December 21st.</p><p>Joining me now, Trump 2020 campaign advisory board member Madison Gesiotto  and Democrat strategist Al Mottur. I know you guys love talking about this.  Madison, look at this, from Pew Research, you're not going to believe it.  Congress has only managed to pass all required appropriations measures on  time, wait for it, just four times since fiscal 1977. Is this an argument  for term limits. I mean, what do we send them into D.C. to do?</p><p>MADISON GESIOTTO, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, NATIONAL  DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP:  It's one of the many arguments for term  limits. I mean, Congress seems repeatedly every single year do not be able  to do their job. I remember last Christmas, we talked about the same thing.</p><p>Every single year, they are never meeting the requirements, they are never  doing their job. It's such a shame that we continue to have to talk about  this. For over 20 years, they haven't met the requirements. So those four  times between 1977 and 1997, it's frustrating.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. So here's the thing, Al. This is what I'm wondering if we  should do. You know what, Congress, it's sort of like telling your children  to go to their room until you get the job done. We're going to sequester  you in D.C., no grandstanding for the cameras, no campaigning, no political  rallies, no fundraising, you got to be quarantined in D.C. and get a  spending bill on time. How about that?</p><p>AL MOTTUR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Hey, we might as well try it. I mean,  look, you're on to something when you say no campaigning, no fundraising.  The politics have taken over the dynamic in the Congress and there is way  too much time spent on the phone dialing for dollars and don't have enough  time doing work for the American people. That's on both sides of the aisle.  There's got to be a way to stop it. Maybe term limits is part of the  answer. I think campaign finance reform is another.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Pelosi now says she won't accept a pretty decent DACA  deal in exchange for border wall funding. That's what it has come down to  right now. What do you think?</p><p>GESIOTTO:  I think what's frustrating about what she is doing is the fact  that she is unwilling to compromise. I mean, when we look at Congress and  the idea of why we have two parties and why we have Democrats and  Republicans in Congress work together is because they need to compromise to  get to the end solution.</p><p>Sometimes, you are going to have to give a little to get a little. The  Republicans have tried to do that on many issues. Of course, they are not  perfect. But the Democrats slightly have really let their hate for our  president overcome their ability to get anything done.</p><p>MOTTUR:  That's not what is going on here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It feels like it's going on. Go ahead, Al. Finish your point.</p><p>MOTTUR:  No, it's not. I mean, the parties for two decades have been unable  to do immigration compromise. I agree we have to compromise. It's not  because --</p><p>MACDONALD:  But they are purposely politicizing the border. That's the  issue. We know that for a fact from internal e-mails --</p><p>MOTTUR:  Both sides are politicizing the border, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We know for a fact from internal e-mails that Democrat Super  PAC say that's the way to go in order to get that voter. But here's the  thing. Democrats, Al, and you've talked about this too, starting in 2005,  2006 and all the way through 2013, said yeah, to border security. Just get  it done. We have this moment in time after the George H.W. Bush funeral,  that there seems to be some kind of unity. Get it done.</p><p>MOTTUR:  I don't think the president would accept the border wall for a  DACA deal, first of all. And second of all, the president --</p><p>MACDONALD:  We did have one. He had a DACA deal, 1.3 million DACA, to do a  border wall. The Americans want it. They don't our security dealt with like  a political football.</p><p>MOTTUR:  I wish we could compromise on immigration. It's not just right  now. It's not hatred for this president. It has been going on for a long  time.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Should get it done now. Should get it done yesterday. How about  that?</p><p>MOTTUR:  I am for it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Go ahead, Madison.</p><p>GESIOTTO:  You know, Al, you are saying that's simply not true, that the  Democrats are willing to compromise. When you look back 10, 20 years, we  just actually talked about this with Liz last week, the Democrats supported  many of the things that they are now going against when it comes to  immigration.</p><p>So that is your perfect and prime example right there as to why their hate  for our president has changed their views and clouded their judgment when  it comes to the immigration issue specifically.</p><p>MOTTUR:  I don't believe it's about hate to the president. I believe it's  on both sides, Republicans and Democrats --</p><p>GESIOTTO:  Obstruction --</p><p>MOTTUR:  -- pulling the football away.</p><p>GESIOTTO:  We can use any word there.</p><p>MOTTUR:  -- Charlie Brown. And Trump does it too.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, Al, maybe we can all move beyond that and just tell D.C.,  your voice, Al, and Madison's voice, and the viewer and the people out  there saying, you know what, we're done with you, D.C., we're over it. It's  sort of like you tell a child to go to your room until you clean it. Get it  done.</p><p>MOTTUR:  Maybe if there were thermal on Madison (ph), I can go up there and  get it done.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, I'll tell you something. It's just astonishing. I  want your reaction, Al. Congress has managed only four times since fiscal  1977, just four times, to pass all of its required spending measures on  time. Really?</p><p>MOTTUR:  It's ridiculous. They ought to be here more than three days a  week. They ought to be here four, five days a week.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>MOTTUR:  And that would help. Fundraising is a problem. Like I said, term  limits could be part of the solution. But there is no incentive for them to  get this done because there is no punishment.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right, because this is term limits. Madison and Al, thank you  so much. Great fun --</p><p>MOTTUR:  Great to be with you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey will testify  privately behind closed doors on Capitol Hill tomorrow. It will be  transcribed and then released to the public within 24 hours. But how will  the media report on that? Will you get to the truth on what James Comey  said? We're going to break it down.</p><p>But first, why a border wall could save thousands of lives every year?  Tammy Bruce on that. We're going to explain after the break. Back in two.  Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know when something is staring right at you and you say  eureka (ph) of course, absolutely. My next guest has that moment for you,  says President Trump's border wall could help save thousands of lives.  Joining me now, Fox News political contributor, Independent Women's Voice  president, great columnist, writer, Tammy Bruce.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  I'm glad you got to check.  Thank you, dear. Look, my column is up today. This is not new. This is not  new news. What was shocking to me was the CDC report that came out about  last week, that noted and obviously should alarm all of us, that the drug  overdose deaths and suicides are at historic highs, right?</p><p>In just 2017, over 72,000 people died from drug overdoses. That is more  than the U.S. deaths in the Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. In  one year in this country, suicides are at their historic high, about 49,000  suicides also in 2017.</p><p>The CDC doesn't want to speculate, they say, on the cause. But what they do  recognize also is the importation of drugs, the opioid epidemic, people now  moving from prescription drug dynamic because we are at war with that, so  they turn to heroin. And then there is fentanyl which is now the new  synthetic opioid which kills you pretty much right away. It's a tiny, tiny  amount that will kill you.</p><p>We got single individuals bringing into the country, and somebody was  caught just a few weeks ago, bringing over enough that would kill 300  million Americans, and because it takes so little to end up killing you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>BRUCE:  This is at the border. Eighty percent of the fentanyl in this  country comes in through the southern border, and also China is involved in  that facilitation as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It's just two milligrams. We just show that stat, 78 million.  That's based on the amount of fentanyl seized at the border last year and  the first quarter of this year. Life expectancy has been dragged down by  what is going on.</p><p>BRUCE:  That is correct, because you got middle aged individuals, right?  You got -- those are the individuals who are dying too early because of the  drug addiction and because of suicide. Look, one thing we know about  suicide is it's usually not one issue. It can be a multitude of issues. But  when you're also dealing with drug addiction, any addiction, certainly  alcoholism, but the opioid addiction creates hopelessness.</p><p>We've dealt with now -- thank goodness in the economic recovery, but the  last 10 years, people losing their homes, losing their savings, losing  their jobs. That combined with drug addiction. And then of course President  Obama, we lost our hospitals and our doctors and any real access to health  care. That we think of course has contributed to the nature of the suicide  choice. So it is  -- that in it of itself, because of the core of the  people affected is dragging down the U.S. life expectancy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Astonishing, that finding. You know, President Trump is saying  China will try to stop the importation of fentanyl into our country. That's  part of the trade deal. But Thomas Homan, to your point, former acting ICE  director, said, you know, having the troops at the border is making the  drug cartels berserk and crazy. He told us that on the show last week.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yeah. You know, he is -- what they have done is, because of the  caravan, we've obviously boosted up the numbers, and the cartels which have  relied on kind of a lax framework are furious because it is affecting their  ability to move the drugs in.</p><p>This is why when we talk about the wall, it is not just about we need an  orderly framework that happens at the border, but we must take seriously  what's going on and how these drugs are moving into the country, when 80  percent of fentanyl is coming in through the southern border.</p><p>And by the way, the majority of heroin as well is not coming from  Afghanistan, it's grown in Mexico. It's cultivated there and moved in  through Mexico. So the wall is something that not only are we dealing with  keeping bad guys out and killers and all of that and human trafficking, but  to stop this.</p><p>When you got three wars of the deaths combined including Vietnam in one  year, how is this not a war? All the American people deserve to be taken  seriously and to have --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is it Trump's White House capitalizing on this, what you're  talking about?</p><p>BRUCE:  Look, they have got to talk more about the other issues that are  involving the wall and why this matters. People know the opioid crisis and  the prescription drugs, right, OxyContin. We know that there is a heroin  problem. People don't know that people have gone to street drugs when they  can't get a prescription. And where is that coming from? When you think of  heroin, when you think of a poppy fields in Afghanistan --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>BRUCE:  They got to talk more about this. This transcends political  parties, economic status, all of those things. And I wish the president  would speak more about it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Tammy Bruce, you're going to be with us later in the show.  Great information there. Wow! We had a jam-packed hour. Coming up, a major  arrest of illegals in Massachusetts. More than 50 illegal immigrants busted  in a multi-day swift (ph) in New England. Look at this. Three of them  wanted for murder.</p><p>But first, it's the testimony we have been waiting for. Tomorrow, former  FBI Director James Comey, he is going to get a Capitol Hill grilling behind  closed doors. But how will the media report on that? That's next. Stay  there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. Tomorrow, House Republicans will finally get  their chance to grill former FBI Director James Comey behind closed doors  about his actions and anti-Trump bias infecting the top levels of the FBI  during the election. Again, behind closed doors. The transcript will be  made public within 24 hours of that sessions. Joe Concha is a media  reporter for The Hill. He joins us now. So how are they going to report on  it? What do you think, Joe?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL:  Well, if it's going to be made  public in 24 hours, then I would imagine something because nothing gets  slip (ph) in Washington. Everything gets slip (ph) in Washington. Within an  hour, somebody is going to have to use the bathroom, there will be a call  from some reporter and then you're going to hear about it. But at least  everything is going to be out in 24 hours, sometimes that doesn't happen.</p><p>I think they got the wrong guy here, Liz. I want to know why Rod Rosenstein  isn't being called before Congress. He is the guy just nine weeks ago who  said, yeah, you know, I think I'll wear a wire and try to trap the  president, try to get him on tape to compel his cabinet to invoke the 25th  Amendment. I would have had him on there instead.</p><p>But, OK, we have Comey. Here's the thing about Comey. He's an open book.  Literally he's an open book. He wrote a book in April. He did a thousand  interviews after that. I might be exaggerating. Most probably dozens and  dozens. So everything seems to be out there already, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I hear what you're saying because -- let's be clear. This is  about Trump-hating, pro-Hillary FBI director and there are talks about  stopping Trump, impeaching Trump. Really the issue is that FISA warrant to  basically surveil Trump campaign aides because it looks like they really  did break the regulations in getting that FISA warrant, right?</p><p>CONCHA:  It appears that way. Absolutely. So, but I wonder, Comey who is a  very good public speaker, we could agree on that, when he's done his  testimonies, it has been the type of thing where he seems to be pretty  measured in his responses. He is ready for whatever question --</p><p>MACDONALD:  He has got to answer. Did you tell the FISA court that it was  funded by the Democrats, partly, you even said it was unverified on  salacious. Did you know at the time that it was unverified? Did you tell  the court that, right?</p><p>CONCHA:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You got to get that out of him.</p><p>CONCHA:  And if so, why? Was it because --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Why you --</p><p>CONCHA:  -- the president.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>CONCHA:  Right, exactly. Why didn't you pursue going down this particular  route? I also want to know why he leaked a private conversation or  conversations that he had with the president over dinner at the White  House, then leaked everything he talked about to a friend at Columbia  University, who then gave it too The New York Times, and he admits for the  sole purpose of compelling a special counsel to be appointed, and it  happened. How is that not illegal?</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We want -- can we have you back on to talk about it?</p><p>CONCHA:  Absotively (ph).</p><p>MACDONALD:  Absotively (ph). Joe Concha. That's great. Good to see you,  sir. Coming up, we are going to get to that ICE arrest. More than 50  illegals including three wanted for murder in sanctuary city friendly New  England. We're going to have Tammy Bruce back on that. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. ICE arresting more than 50 illegal immigrants  over the past two days. It happened across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New  Hampshire, and Connecticut. Among those arrested, three immigrants,  illegals from Brazil, wanted there for murder.</p><p>The ICE raids taking place the very same week that the Massachusetts  Republican governor said, you know what, a state judge must temporarily  step down after that judge let an undocumented immigrant here basically  sneak out a backdoor to avoid ICE agents waiting to take him into custody.</p><p>Tammy Bruce is back with us. First on that story, Tammy, great to have you  back.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  That illegal that sneaked out (ph) the backdoor had been  deported multiple times for multiple drug arrests. And now the judge let  him go at the backdoor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yeah. It is interesting. During the court proceedings, the judge  called them up to the bench, and the judge asked for the recording to stop.  And that is when suddenly when that went back on and they resumed, there  was suddenly some machinations there to have the charges dropped.</p><p>And then somehow, the defense attorney was able to walk the defendant out  through a side door back through which would not have been allowed without  it being facilitated and being able to avoid as there was also (ph) ICE  agents.</p><p>Some judges and immigration advocates of course don't want ICE agents to be  able to go into courthouses. They have argued that they have to stay  outside and that seems to be changing a little bit. There is argument about  that. This is one of the reasons why they want that to be able to be in the  courthouses to deal with this kind of stuff.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What a story. And we have seen another courts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, this judge, understandably, they think the judge should not be  hearing any federal cases because if you are really obstructing law  enforcement, why should you be on the bench? I mean, as a judge, you are  supposed to be implementing the laws.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>BRUCE:  And adjudicating them as opposed to helping a defendant sneak out  to get away from federal law enforcement. That's crazy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  She hears criminal cases. Are you going to let other criminals  go?</p><p>BRUCE:  Right. No matter -- look, they are human beings. We all have  opinions on the issues. But if you're willing to skirt the law and allow  someone else to do so, what else are you doing that is not fair?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to the swifts (ph) in New England. The 50 arrested  illegal immigrants selling opioids. You have been talking about that.</p><p>BRUCE:  Oh, yeah. This is our prior discussion. This is the big deal.  Trafficking in heroin. Trafficking in fentanyl. These are not drug users,  these are traffickers. And so this is where -- it is also a reminder to  people what ICE does. This is inside the country. It's the internal  framework.</p><p>They do not handle the border. They deal with criminals, the gangs, the  drug traffickers, sex traffickers, kidnappers, murderers, getting these  three Brazilians who are wanted for murder in that country, that's what ICE  does.</p><p>This is the organization that many Democrats want to abolish. That would be  a mistake because the people that are targeted and affected first and  victimized first are the communities of immigrants.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right, that's a point.</p><p>BRUCE:  This is who we are trying to protect here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right. But, you know, here is the other point about the story.  Several towns in Massachusetts here, they're sanctuary cities. It's Boston,  Cambridge, Lawrence and Newton. These are the cities where these  individuals have been detained.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's right. So the people that were scooped up had been in  custody. And then were released. Again, you think, well, was this somebody  who was driving under the influence or somebody who made a mistake? No,  these are drug traffickers. These are very serious individuals.</p><p>MACDONALD:  But the victims of the crimes are treated like rounding errors  in D.C. There is not a human being behind it that is treated --</p><p>BRUCE:  Big government, whether it is about health care or even law  enforcement. When people become the budget and you become a chit on a piece  of paper, you stop being a human being. This is why local law enforcement  matters. You know, judges matter.</p><p>They are supposed to see the individuals and yet they claim it is because  they are sensitive to immigrants, but this kind of action re-victimizes  immigrants. Legal immigrants who are playing by the rules and even  undocumented people who are also playing by the rules. Those are the people  that are protected by ICE.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Great stuff again from Tammy Bruce. You're going to come back  soon.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'll look forward to it. Thank you so much for having us in  your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on the  Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It  was down nearly 800 points, and then down about 80 points, doing a major  rethink after the initial freak out, panicked attack over the arrest that  U.S. request in Canada of the CFO of Huawei, that's China's top tech giant. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> That CFO, the daughter of Huawei's founder, a former Chinese military  officer. She's arrested on charges that Huawei broke U.S. sanctions by  selling U.S. technology to Iran. We've got details on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But Wall Streeters now applauding President Trump's tough line in trade  talks with China because China is stealing to make China great again. We've  got fresh new details on that. And it has to stop. </p><p> What's going on we've got an insider who has a front row seat on how China  has hollowed out entire U.S. industries and taken U.S. jobs. And why Trump  is right to fix the problem that elected officials for years have done  nothing about.</p><p> The Dow down 8 percent since its October high. But take a breath for some  perspective. Historically it is normal to have these kinds of downturns. We  bring you what you need to know.</p><p> Plus, tech execs at the White House today on how to beat China and more.  But the real firework is a fight in D.C. over G.M. getting not just loathes  of federal bailout help but state bailout help and tax breaks too, where it  hardly pays any taxes as its closing U.S. factories and laying off  thousands of people before Christmastime, sending those factory jobs to  Mexico. We've got the back story to FBN's exclusive with CEO Mary Barra. </p><p> Also, Democrat in-fighting over border wall funding. Nancy Pelosi now  saying she will not even accept a decent DACA deal in exchange for border  wall funding. People sick and tired of D.C. politics.</p><p> This as we bring you two big border scandals now hurting Americans. </p><p> Well, thank you for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money, politics. We  got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. The  Evening Edit starts right now. </p><p> OK. Let's get to the China outrage over the arrest of Huawei's CFO. They  are now demanding her release accusing the U.S. and Canada of quote,  \"wrongdoing.\" This is over violating Iran sanctions. But Wall Street  analysts point out other countries are saying Huawei is pretty bad. </p><p> Australia, New Zealand, Britain's telecom B.T. all kicked out Huawei over  fears that Huawei is stealing and spying giving its ties to China's  military. And they say President Trump is right. China for years has been  hollowing out U.S. jobs and entire U.S. industries, not funding its own  R&amp;D, but instead, stealing our research to make China great again. </p><p> Our companies pay for that research. China then sells cheaper copycats,  undercutting us. We're talking nuclear power generators, solar cells,  computer hardware, software, and more.</p><p> Let's get to Edward Lawrence in D.C. with more on that Huawei arrest.  Edward? </p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Liz. And don't forget,  circuit boards. That was a huge thing that Chinese put out. And right now,  the arrest of chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou threatens to destabilize  the fragile trade negotiations that have been going on between the U.S. and  China. </p><p> China calling for Canada to release the Huawei CFO. A spokesperson for the  Chinese foreign ministry says, \"The detention of a person without giving a  clear reason is of course a violation of the human rights to the person, or  of the person.\" </p><p> Now China claims they don't know the reason that she was detained. She is  being investigated by the U.S. for possible violations for breaking the  sanctions related to Iran. Now, the timing of arrest is interesting. She  was being detained in Canada the same day President Donald Trump worked out  a path forward on trade talks with China. </p><p> The national security advisor John Bolton told NPR that he was made aware  of the arrest and that it would happen. The White House, though, telling us  that the president did not know about it before he met with President Xi.  Regardless, some senators applauding the U.S. for sticking to its morals.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. MARK WARNER, (D) VIRGINIA:  My fear is when the Trump administration  is going to crumble on Huawei the same way they crumbled on ZTE. And as we  think about particularly we move to the next generation of wireless 5G and  that transformation is as big as anything that we've seen in the wireless  industry. And my fear is that China could be successful at setting the  standards and dominating that market.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  And national security advisor John Bolton also told NPR that  this is a Justice Department matter and they don't always tell the  president what they are doing. Liz?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Great to see you, Edward. Thank you so much.</p><p> Joining me now is Zach Mottl, he is a top executive at Atlas Tool Works.  This is a company that has had a front row seat for years watching China's  high-tech theft. We welcome you to the show, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p> ZACH MOTTL, CHIEF ALIGNMENT OFFICER, ATLAS TOOL WORKS:  Great to be here,  Elizabeth.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Your company makes precision parts for the internet, radar  systems, medical devices. What do you guys seeing, is President Trump right  about China stealing to make China great again. </p><p> MOTTL:  He's absolutely right. You know, Huawei has built a $90 billion  global enterprise based on commercial espionage, theft of western  technology. You know, my customers are offered -- my business has been  around for 100 years, and for 90 out of the 100 years we were a vendor in  the telecom industry. That was a really important sector for myself and  many other manufacturers like me.</p><p> And we watched as Chinese manufacturers Huawei ZTE came online, and in 20  years they wiped out every single western competitor. Lucent Technologies,  Tellabs, Nortel Networks in Canada. Every one of these companies could not  compete against commercial espionage and state subsidized technology.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Because they're undercutting us taking our jobs, our R&amp;D that  we pay for and then making cheaper copycats. Sir, isn't this a big wake-up  call to Congress to say, you know a what, knock it off about the media  grandstanding before, you know, the D.C. cameras and get on the stick.  Because China has a built-in road project that made in China 2025 project.</p><p> I mean, Obama, President Obama did try to stop China, but it's really up to  Congress to get our trade laws updated to knock it, to get it to knock it  off, right?</p><p> MOTTL:  That's right. This telecom industry was the crown jewel of America  and it portray laws and lack of oversight by Congress has allow the Chinese  to steal this. Let's not lose one more high-tech industry. And quite  frankly, let's bring the telephone manufacturing industry back here. </p><p> We're about to have 5G, and you know, we can worry about the security or we  can simply make it here and know that it's good. Because what we've learned  with this Huawei case and so many other cases, is that we just can't trust  the Chinese. They say one thing, but they do something completely  different. So, I'm hoping Congress will step up to the plate here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We hope so too, because this is got to stop, sir. I mean, this  should be hair on fire and break the glass time right now in D.C.</p><p> MOTTL:  That's right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Because to your point, we just cited these other countries  worried about Huawei. Also, you mentioned 5G. China is embedding itself and  the fears it's going to go into that new 5G rollout worldwide. That's the  internet of things. That's wearable fitness trackers. It's robots, taxis  and the like. </p><p> I mean, if China gets to jump on that and starts embedding itself in 5G,  wow, game over.</p><p> MOTTL:  That's right. And they're counting on, you know, they're taking  advantage of the free market. They are going to undercut price and they are  going to subsidize it to try to buy the market. We cannot let that happen.  We need to put laws in place and we need our other country partners to work  with us to shut them out of the market. Because again, we just cannot trust  them. And when they say they are not spying I certainly think they are.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All this breathtakingly tedious grandstanding in D.C. over it,  and they are setting aside what really matters and that's what you're  talking about. Because, sir, look what happened to U.S. Steel. U.S. Steel  spent tons of money to pioneer a new lighter, higher grade steel product  for cars and planes, but then China hacked it and hacked its computers,  stole the blueprints and started selling copycats steel at way cheaper  prices, right?</p><p> MOTTL:  When profit doesn't matter to these companies and they have a  government behind them helping them cheat and steal, how can we compete? We  need to do it smarter. And what it comes down to is jobs. It's not just  about high-tech and innovation. It's about jobs. It's about national  security. </p><p> And the employees like mine, you know, when I lost my telecom customers in  the early 2000, we have to lay people off. We reinvented ourselves, but a  lot of other companies couldn't. Telecom and so many other sectors are  really important. We're talking about good jobs for Americans versus growth  and good jobs for people in China. I want to see it made here and I want to  see it secure and safe so we can trust what's going through our network.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And now, we got indications that China made in behind that  massive Marriott hack affecting half a billion people potentially. Wow.</p><p> MOTTL:  It's pervasive. It is pervasive and everything that they do they  just simply play by a different set of rules, so they can tell us one thing  but we know they are going to do something else. We can't trust them. </p><p> So, I'm pleased to see President Trump, you know, holding firm. I trust his  judgment here and I hope that Congress is going to come along and finally  join the wise party because they are really missing the boat by not  protecting America and our information.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, you know what, you know, if Congress doesn't it, the  voter could and probably will. Zach Mottl of Atlas Tool Works, thanks for  coming in. We'd like you to come on again soon, sir. </p><p> MOTTL:  We'll see you soon, Elizabeth. Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you. Let's get Ned Ryun's reaction. Ned Ryun is one  of the top analysts out there, he's been watching D.C. Ned, I want your  reaction to the conversation we just had.</p><p> NED RYUN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  Well, I got to tell you, I  mean, initially, when you have a clip of Senator Warren saying -- Warner  saying about the fifth-generation 5G networks and Huawei, I mean, that's  one of things. </p><p> I wrote about this for Fox News during the week of Thanksgiving, Liz, in  which I said we have to be very careful because there is a proxy battle  being fought right now between United States and China between QUALCOMM and  Huawei over who's going to control that 5G network, and you are right. </p><p> The implications for the internet of things, right now there is about eight  billion internet of things devices. That number is probably going to triple  in the next three years. And who's going to control the networks and the  data is going to be massive as we move forward into the future.</p><p> And on the other front, you're right. I mean, they have been robbing us  blind. We have helped build the largest authoritarian police state in China  with really bad trade deals, and now we have looked the other way as they  literally over the last probably 10 years, Liz, I've seen estimates about  three trillion are in technology theft and between theft and force  technology transfers that we basically incentivize and given them the means  to compete with us on the technology front, but also on the economic front  and they're not shy about it. </p><p> They are gunning for us. They want to replace us as the center of the  economic world. And right now, for in the past, we've been lightening them  get away with it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know what, there's that and there's also this other  geopolitical risk that the White House is trying to address as well, Ned.  Look at this. New satellite images reveal activity and an unidentified  North Korean missile base. </p><p> So that's also a neck of the woods. What's you take on that?</p><p> RYUN:  Well, my take on this, is again, this has been the failure of the  three previous administrations kicking the can down the road of refusing to  actually deal with the North Korean threat. And now Trump has been  confronted with it. He realizes we cannot have this existential threat with  North Korea having nuclear armaments and being able to literally at some  point in the not-too-distant future have the ability to drop warheads on  American cities. </p><p> The key to this, though, Liz, and it's all, again, like you said, it's all  interconnected. We actually need China to play ball with us on North Korea  to deal with this threat. And so, this whole trade dispute taking place  with China, all of this stuff is interconnected. We have to figure out how  to see China accommodate our interest in real life. They've got to  prioritize our interest.</p><p> And so, this whole trade deal is not only tied to bad trade deals and  intellectual theft. It's also tied to how we deal with North Korea as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. And to your point, China's military has been boosting the  number of warplane intrusions into South Korea airspace, nearly doubling  the number of times in recent years. Your take on that.</p><p> RYUN:  Well, I mean, China, the amazing part to me is how brash China is  and we're acting, we are letting them get away with this. They have been  waging this economic war. They've been threatening us. They've been doing  building these islands in the South China Seas and we've just been sitting  there as though, we, you know, we don't know what they're up to. We know  exactly what they are up to. And I think it's time. </p><p> Obviously, if we can really deal this economic trade and put them on notice  I think we can start to deal with some of these military threats as well. </p><p> Trump is right to do this and I know that some people are worried about  this tariff fight. I will say this, Liz. If we do not confront China now in  the next few years, I'm convinced we will regret it for the next hundred  years. Because China does not want trade partners. China wants tributary  nations. And if we are not careful, if we deal with this trade threat and  these bad trade deals and this theft of our intellectual property we're not  going to like where we're at in 10 or 15 years.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, you make a great point there. Let's move over to  what's going on in Russia, Ned. I'd like your reaction to Russia doing some  saber rattling, showing off new laser weapons after the U.S. is threatening  to pull out of missile, that missile treaty dating back to the 80s because  of Russia cheating. What's your take on that?</p><p> RYUN:  I go back to, you know, despite all the left screaming buddy  murderer about Trump being too cozy with Putin, he is actually been pretty  aggressive with him, especially on the energy front. Over 50 percent of  Russia's, the Russian governments income comes from oil and gas exports.  And Trump knows what he's doing on this front.</p><p> Obviously, he confronted Merkel on Nord Stream II and Russia importing even  more natural gas to Germany, and Trump said you can't do that. He's also  gone in and address a lot of the middle and eastern and European countries  and the three C's initiative in which he is trying to get them off of  Russian energy. </p><p> Because he realizes, Trump realizes if you can cut off Russian exports in  these energy areas of gas and oil, he's going to undermine all this other  stuff that's taking place. So, he's focused on the right things. He has to  cut off the Europeans from getting or being wholly dependent or  significantly dependent on Russian energy. And if he can do that, I think  he's going to really be able to put Putin in his place.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Thank you, Ned Ryun. Great to see you. Come back soon.</p><p> RYUN:  Thanks, Liz. We'll do.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Next case, this morning 1000 friends and family attended the  funeral service at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston to say a final  farewell to President George H.W. Bush.</p><p> In attendance, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris, baseball legends Nolan  Ryan, and Tommy Lasorda. And also, country singers Crystal Gayle and Larry  Gatlin. The funeral train carry the casket of our 41st president a short  time ago to the presidential library at Texas A&amp;M University. </p><p> The president was laid to rest alongside his wife Barbara.</p><p> We're going to be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. tech execs from Google, Microsoft, and Oracle met  today at the White House with Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Larry Kudlow and  others to talk about securing U.S. manufacturing dominance, and artificial  intelligence, quantum computing, and more. Facebook executives not  attending.</p><p> But to the real fireworks. The fight in D.C. with G.M. G.M. CEO Mary Barra  met again today with lawmakers. They are pretty upset over G.M.'s big tax  breaks in the face of G.M. plants -- plans to shut factories and lay off  14,000 workers.</p><p> Look at this. FiatChrysler, though, plans to open a new factory in  Detroit.</p><p> Let's bring in Republican Ohio Congressman Warren Davidson. Good to see  you, sir. </p><p> REP. WARREN DAVIDSON, (R) OHIO:  Good to talk with you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, people are upset that G.M. keeps coming all the time  with tin cap in hand getting a lot of federal bailout help, and wait for  it, a lot of state tax breaks and bailout help too. And you know, Ohio gave  G.M. a ton of tax breaks, but now that factories are closing. What's your  take on this?</p><p> DAVIDSON:  You know, it's truly disappointing. And I've been in Congress  now for about two and half years, but prior to that, for the previous 15  years I was in manufacturing. So, when you talk the intersection of big  tech and automotive, they're really more interconnected than you would  imagine. </p><p> So, when Mary Barra came and talked with the Ohio delegation, she really  led with the transformation that the auto industry is confronting. And you  know, one of the points that I wanted to make is, you know, the good news  is, is unlike in '08, '09 when this was happening, Ohio strong and growing.  G.M. is anomaly our states hiring. </p><p> I offered to drive our economic development folks up to do a job fair at  the plant. So, G.M. is offering those folks jobs I'm sure the eighth  district would be happy to have them.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. But here's the thing. We've been watching and I've been  watching G.M. for years. I've been doing business journalism for three  decades. I was at the Wall Street Journal. I was an editor at Forbes. I've  been writing about G.M. for a long time, sir. </p><p> Here's the problem. Here's one of the issues. Ohio in 2008 gave state  income tax breaks to G.M., saying you don't have to pay 75 percent of your  income taxes to the state of Ohio over the next 15 years. </p><p> So, here's the thing. Should elected officials say once and for all, OK,  we'll give you, Mr. car company or Mr. G.M., a tax break, with the caveat  that you have to show us how you will build factories that you can retool  to make -- to make either smaller or bigger vehicles when gas prices go up  or down. Other car companies do that, why can't G.M.?</p><p> DAVIDSON:  Well, the good news is Honda's been doing that. They reinvested,  the Honda Accord wasn't selling as well as they thought. The CRV is selling  way better, I think two-thirds of the cars on the road that are in demand  right now our crossovers, SUVs or trucks. And Honda who is a huge anchor  for Ohio has been very adaptive. </p><p> G.M. not quite as flexible. There's a lot of history behind that. And you  know, frankly, some of the things were the government has been involved  that shows frankly, the government should be not try to run these  companies. We don't need more central planning.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Got that. Check that. Understood. I hear totally what you're  saying. I don't mean to interrupt. But that is agreed upon. We don't want  that. We don't want the government in there. But G.M. does really rapidly  come with a tin cap getting our tax help.</p><p> I mean, it's striking, sir, that we're -- that, you know, that FiatChrysler is now opening a factory in Detroit. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Yes. I mean, that's great. And you know, we'll see where that  goes for G.M. You know, I think they've been outperformed by a number of  companies that's why they have to come hot in hand and begging for help.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, that's been going on for decades.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'm telling you that's been going on for decades. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. Not to mention the subsidies that are going on to  try to steer consumers to buy this car or that car.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  And the areas (Ph) of government shouldn't be trying to steer  that. And the good news for G.M. is maybe they finally got the message as,  you are not going to get any more bailouts. The American people don't want  to bail you out nor anyone else, and so you are going to have to take care  of your balance sheet and do the right things.</p><p> So, I was impressed that Mary Barra came and was proactively speaking to us  on the hill. But yes, very sad news about the investment in Lordstown,  Ohio, in particular.</p><p> MACDONALD:  But you know what, but what about putting the feet to the fire.  I understand. I watch Mary Barra. We have a lot of respect for her. She is  a great CEO. But listen closely to what she says, OK. A lot of that is a  lot of P.R. talk. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You got to get to the nuts and bolts. Is she going to move jobs  to other factories in the U.S.? And you know, is she going to stop  outsourcing to Mexico? We understand the economics of it, but we also  understand the economics of giving out tax breaks when you're not, you  know, building factories that are flexible, right? Final word.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. And when you look at where the intellectual property  and the tech is, the good news is a lot of that happened in the U.S. and  when you tie that to what you're talking about earlier is the tech folks  coming to the White House. </p><p> The Foreign Investment Risk Reduction Modernization Act, that was one of  the biggest piece of registration that the House financial services  committee move this past year. It was an honor to work on it. Really our  country is going to be more secure, our country is going to be stronger. </p><p> And frankly, if we can complement that with a good reform to privacy so  that we can make sure that whether it's on the internet or in your car or  in app that you download on the phone it's always your data as a consumer.  And I was impressed that was one of the questions I put to Mary is that it  is an opt in practice for G.M. in the car.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  And so, I hope we can do that more and I hope that they'll see  that the competitive advantage in the United States means they should  continue to invest including in Ohio. We have a tremendous supply chain and  folks are happy to supply them.</p><p> MACDONALD:  There's great people in Ohio. Great people in Michigan, great  people in the heartland. Congressman Warren Davidson, thank you so much. We  really appreciate it. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's get to other headline news. Search and rescue efforts  still underway after two U.S. military planes collided in midair and crash  off the coast of Japan overnight. It happened during a refueling exercise.  One marine killed, another in fair condition. </p><p> However, five marines still missing. Our thoughts and prayers are with the  families there.</p><p> A Southwest Airlines flight get it off the runway upon landing in heavy  rain at Burbank Airport in California. There were no reported injuries.  Among the 117 passengers, they were evacuated using emergency slides.  That's pretty scary stuff.</p><p> And drug company, it's called Tris Pharma, now recalling some of its  children's Ibuprofen after it was notified about overly high concentrations  of that drug that can affect a child's kidneys. This brand was sold under  private label brands at CVS, Wal-Mart and Family Dollar. Check those labels  there.</p><p> Now to the border wall. Brand new analysis on how it saves thousands of  lives. We've got one of the best columnists and thinkers out there. Tammy  Bruce is coming up.</p><p> But first, Congress kicked of the can down the road again. Another  temporary spending budget. What are we sending them to D.C. for? It means  you may see a government shut down by just in time for Christmas. We're  going to tell you what they're fighting about now and why this is the best  case for term limits. We're at the bottom of the hour. Stay there. Back in  two.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're watching the Fox Business Network. To  government spending, again, Congress passing a temporary interim spending  bill today that is going to let the government be funded for two more  weeks, really is just kicking the can down the road again. Congress will  have to vote on this again before midnight on December 21st.</p><p> Joining me now, Trump 2020 campaign advisory board member Madison Gesiotto  and Democrat strategist Al Mottur. I know you guys love talking about this.  Madison, look at this, from Pew Research, you're not going to believe it.  Congress has only managed to pass all required appropriations measures on  time, wait for it, just four times since fiscal 1977. Is this an argument  for term limits. I mean, what do we send them into D.C. to do?</p><p> MADISON GESIOTTO, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, NATIONAL  DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP:  It's one of the many arguments for term  limits. I mean, Congress seems repeatedly every single year do not be able  to do their job. I remember last Christmas, we talked about the same thing.</p><p> Every single year, they are never meeting the requirements, they are never  doing their job. It's such a shame that we continue to have to talk about  this. For over 20 years, they haven't met the requirements. So those four  times between 1977 and 1997, it's frustrating.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. So here's the thing, Al. This is what I'm wondering if we  should do. You know what, Congress, it's sort of like telling your children  to go to their room until you get the job done. We're going to sequester  you in D.C., no grandstanding for the cameras, no campaigning, no political  rallies, no fundraising, you got to be quarantined in D.C. and get a  spending bill on time. How about that?</p><p> AL MOTTUR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Hey, we might as well try it. I mean,  look, you're on to something when you say no campaigning, no fundraising.  The politics have taken over the dynamic in the Congress and there is way  too much time spent on the phone dialing for dollars and don't have enough  time doing work for the American people. That's on both sides of the aisle.  There's got to be a way to stop it. Maybe term limits is part of the  answer. I think campaign finance reform is another.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, Pelosi now says she won't accept a pretty decent DACA  deal in exchange for border wall funding. That's what it has come down to  right now. What do you think?</p><p> GESIOTTO:  I think what's frustrating about what she is doing is the fact  that she is unwilling to compromise. I mean, when we look at Congress and  the idea of why we have two parties and why we have Democrats and  Republicans in Congress work together is because they need to compromise to  get to the end solution.</p><p> Sometimes, you are going to have to give a little to get a little. The  Republicans have tried to do that on many issues. Of course, they are not  perfect. But the Democrats slightly have really let their hate for our  president overcome their ability to get anything done.</p><p> MOTTUR:  That's not what is going on here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  It feels like it's going on. Go ahead, Al. Finish your point.</p><p> MOTTUR:  No, it's not. I mean, the parties for two decades have been unable  to do immigration compromise. I agree we have to compromise. It's not  because --</p><p> MACDONALD:  But they are purposely politicizing the border. That's the  issue. We know that for a fact from internal e-mails --</p><p> MOTTUR:  Both sides are politicizing the border, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We know for a fact from internal e-mails that Democrat Super  PAC say that's the way to go in order to get that voter. But here's the  thing. Democrats, Al, and you've talked about this too, starting in 2005,  2006 and all the way through 2013, said yeah, to border security. Just get  it done. We have this moment in time after the George H.W. Bush funeral,  that there seems to be some kind of unity. Get it done.</p><p> MOTTUR:  I don't think the president would accept the border wall for a  DACA deal, first of all. And second of all, the president --</p><p> MACDONALD:  We did have one. He had a DACA deal, 1.3 million DACA, to do a  border wall. The Americans want it. They don't our security dealt with like  a political football.</p><p> MOTTUR:  I wish we could compromise on immigration. It's not just right  now. It's not hatred for this president. It has been going on for a long  time.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Should get it done now. Should get it done yesterday. How about  that?</p><p> MOTTUR:  I am for it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Go ahead, Madison.</p><p> GESIOTTO:  You know, Al, you are saying that's simply not true, that the  Democrats are willing to compromise. When you look back 10, 20 years, we  just actually talked about this with Liz last week, the Democrats supported  many of the things that they are now going against when it comes to  immigration.</p><p> So that is your perfect and prime example right there as to why their hate  for our president has changed their views and clouded their judgment when  it comes to the immigration issue specifically.</p><p> MOTTUR:  I don't believe it's about hate to the president. I believe it's  on both sides, Republicans and Democrats --</p><p> GESIOTTO:  Obstruction --</p><p> MOTTUR:  -- pulling the football away.</p><p> GESIOTTO:  We can use any word there.</p><p> MOTTUR:  -- Charlie Brown. And Trump does it too.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK, Al, maybe we can all move beyond that and just tell D.C.,  your voice, Al, and Madison's voice, and the viewer and the people out  there saying, you know what, we're done with you, D.C., we're over it. It's  sort of like you tell a child to go to your room until you clean it. Get it  done.</p><p> MOTTUR:  Maybe if there were thermal on Madison (ph), I can go up there and  get it done.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, I'll tell you something. It's just astonishing. I  want your reaction, Al. Congress has managed only four times since fiscal  1977, just four times, to pass all of its required spending measures on  time. Really?</p><p> MOTTUR:  It's ridiculous. They ought to be here more than three days a  week. They ought to be here four, five days a week.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> MOTTUR:  And that would help. Fundraising is a problem. Like I said, term  limits could be part of the solution. But there is no incentive for them to  get this done because there is no punishment.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right, because this is term limits. Madison and Al, thank you  so much. Great fun --</p><p> MOTTUR:  Great to be with you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey will testify  privately behind closed doors on Capitol Hill tomorrow. It will be  transcribed and then released to the public within 24 hours. But how will  the media report on that? Will you get to the truth on what James Comey  said? We're going to break it down.</p><p> But first, why a border wall could save thousands of lives every year?  Tammy Bruce on that. We're going to explain after the break. Back in two.  Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know when something is staring right at you and you say  eureka (ph) of course, absolutely. My next guest has that moment for you,  says President Trump's border wall could help save thousands of lives.  Joining me now, Fox News political contributor, Independent Women's Voice  president, great columnist, writer, Tammy Bruce.</p><p> TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  I'm glad you got to check.  Thank you, dear. Look, my column is up today. This is not new. This is not  new news. What was shocking to me was the CDC report that came out about  last week, that noted and obviously should alarm all of us, that the drug  overdose deaths and suicides are at historic highs, right?</p><p> In just 2017, over 72,000 people died from drug overdoses. That is more  than the U.S. deaths in the Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. In  one year in this country, suicides are at their historic high, about 49,000  suicides also in 2017.</p><p> The CDC doesn't want to speculate, they say, on the cause. But what they do  recognize also is the importation of drugs, the opioid epidemic, people now  moving from prescription drug dynamic because we are at war with that, so  they turn to heroin. And then there is fentanyl which is now the new  synthetic opioid which kills you pretty much right away. It's a tiny, tiny  amount that will kill you.</p><p> We got single individuals bringing into the country, and somebody was  caught just a few weeks ago, bringing over enough that would kill 300  million Americans, and because it takes so little to end up killing you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> BRUCE:  This is at the border. Eighty percent of the fentanyl in this  country comes in through the southern border, and also China is involved in  that facilitation as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  It's just two milligrams. We just show that stat, 78 million.  That's based on the amount of fentanyl seized at the border last year and  the first quarter of this year. Life expectancy has been dragged down by  what is going on.</p><p> BRUCE:  That is correct, because you got middle aged individuals, right?  You got -- those are the individuals who are dying too early because of the  drug addiction and because of suicide. Look, one thing we know about  suicide is it's usually not one issue. It can be a multitude of issues. But  when you're also dealing with drug addiction, any addiction, certainly  alcoholism, but the opioid addiction creates hopelessness.</p><p> We've dealt with now -- thank goodness in the economic recovery, but the  last 10 years, people losing their homes, losing their savings, losing  their jobs. That combined with drug addiction. And then of course President  Obama, we lost our hospitals and our doctors and any real access to health  care. That we think of course has contributed to the nature of the suicide  choice. So it is  -- that in it of itself, because of the core of the  people affected is dragging down the U.S. life expectancy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Astonishing, that finding. You know, President Trump is saying  China will try to stop the importation of fentanyl into our country. That's  part of the trade deal. But Thomas Homan, to your point, former acting ICE  director, said, you know, having the troops at the border is making the  drug cartels berserk and crazy. He told us that on the show last week.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yeah. You know, he is -- what they have done is, because of the  caravan, we've obviously boosted up the numbers, and the cartels which have  relied on kind of a lax framework are furious because it is affecting their  ability to move the drugs in.</p><p> This is why when we talk about the wall, it is not just about we need an  orderly framework that happens at the border, but we must take seriously  what's going on and how these drugs are moving into the country, when 80  percent of fentanyl is coming in through the southern border.</p><p> And by the way, the majority of heroin as well is not coming from  Afghanistan, it's grown in Mexico. It's cultivated there and moved in  through Mexico. So the wall is something that not only are we dealing with  keeping bad guys out and killers and all of that and human trafficking, but  to stop this.</p><p> When you got three wars of the deaths combined including Vietnam in one  year, how is this not a war? All the American people deserve to be taken  seriously and to have --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Is it Trump's White House capitalizing on this, what you're  talking about?</p><p> BRUCE:  Look, they have got to talk more about the other issues that are  involving the wall and why this matters. People know the opioid crisis and  the prescription drugs, right, OxyContin. We know that there is a heroin  problem. People don't know that people have gone to street drugs when they  can't get a prescription. And where is that coming from? When you think of  heroin, when you think of a poppy fields in Afghanistan --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> BRUCE:  They got to talk more about this. This transcends political  parties, economic status, all of those things. And I wish the president  would speak more about it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Tammy Bruce, you're going to be with us later in the show.  Great information there. Wow! We had a jam-packed hour. Coming up, a major  arrest of illegals in Massachusetts. More than 50 illegal immigrants busted  in a multi-day swift (ph) in New England. Look at this. Three of them  wanted for murder.</p><p> But first, it's the testimony we have been waiting for. Tomorrow, former  FBI Director James Comey, he is going to get a Capitol Hill grilling behind  closed doors. But how will the media report on that? That's next. Stay  there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. Tomorrow, House Republicans will finally get  their chance to grill former FBI Director James Comey behind closed doors  about his actions and anti-Trump bias infecting the top levels of the FBI  during the election. Again, behind closed doors. The transcript will be  made public within 24 hours of that sessions. Joe Concha is a media  reporter for The Hill. He joins us now. So how are they going to report on  it? What do you think, Joe?</p><p> JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL:  Well, if it's going to be made  public in 24 hours, then I would imagine something because nothing gets  slip (ph) in Washington. Everything gets slip (ph) in Washington. Within an  hour, somebody is going to have to use the bathroom, there will be a call  from some reporter and then you're going to hear about it. But at least  everything is going to be out in 24 hours, sometimes that doesn't happen.</p><p> I think they got the wrong guy here, Liz. I want to know why Rod Rosenstein  isn't being called before Congress. He is the guy just nine weeks ago who  said, yeah, you know, I think I'll wear a wire and try to trap the  president, try to get him on tape to compel his cabinet to invoke the 25th  Amendment. I would have had him on there instead.</p><p> But, OK, we have Comey. Here's the thing about Comey. He's an open book.  Literally he's an open book. He wrote a book in April. He did a thousand  interviews after that. I might be exaggerating. Most probably dozens and  dozens. So everything seems to be out there already, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I hear what you're saying because -- let's be clear. This is  about Trump-hating, pro-Hillary FBI director and there are talks about  stopping Trump, impeaching Trump. Really the issue is that FISA warrant to  basically surveil Trump campaign aides because it looks like they really  did break the regulations in getting that FISA warrant, right?</p><p> CONCHA:  It appears that way. Absolutely. So, but I wonder, Comey who is a  very good public speaker, we could agree on that, when he's done his  testimonies, it has been the type of thing where he seems to be pretty  measured in his responses. He is ready for whatever question --</p><p> MACDONALD:  He has got to answer. Did you tell the FISA court that it was  funded by the Democrats, partly, you even said it was unverified on  salacious. Did you know at the time that it was unverified? Did you tell  the court that, right?</p><p> CONCHA:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You got to get that out of him.</p><p> CONCHA:  And if so, why? Was it because --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Why you --</p><p> CONCHA:  -- the president.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> CONCHA:  Right, exactly. Why didn't you pursue going down this particular  route? I also want to know why he leaked a private conversation or  conversations that he had with the president over dinner at the White  House, then leaked everything he talked about to a friend at Columbia  University, who then gave it too The New York Times, and he admits for the  sole purpose of compelling a special counsel to be appointed, and it  happened. How is that not illegal?</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We want -- can we have you back on to talk about it?</p><p> CONCHA:  Absotively (ph).</p><p> MACDONALD:  Absotively (ph). Joe Concha. That's great. Good to see you,  sir. Coming up, we are going to get to that ICE arrest. More than 50  illegals including three wanted for murder in sanctuary city friendly New  England. We're going to have Tammy Bruce back on that. Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. ICE arresting more than 50 illegal immigrants  over the past two days. It happened across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New  Hampshire, and Connecticut. Among those arrested, three immigrants,  illegals from Brazil, wanted there for murder.</p><p> The ICE raids taking place the very same week that the Massachusetts  Republican governor said, you know what, a state judge must temporarily  step down after that judge let an undocumented immigrant here basically  sneak out a backdoor to avoid ICE agents waiting to take him into custody.</p><p> Tammy Bruce is back with us. First on that story, Tammy, great to have you  back.</p><p> BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  That illegal that sneaked out (ph) the backdoor had been  deported multiple times for multiple drug arrests. And now the judge let  him go at the backdoor.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yeah. It is interesting. During the court proceedings, the judge  called them up to the bench, and the judge asked for the recording to stop.  And that is when suddenly when that went back on and they resumed, there  was suddenly some machinations there to have the charges dropped.</p><p> And then somehow, the defense attorney was able to walk the defendant out  through a side door back through which would not have been allowed without  it being facilitated and being able to avoid as there was also (ph) ICE  agents.</p><p> Some judges and immigration advocates of course don't want ICE agents to be  able to go into courthouses. They have argued that they have to stay  outside and that seems to be changing a little bit. There is argument about  that. This is one of the reasons why they want that to be able to be in the  courthouses to deal with this kind of stuff.</p><p> MACDONALD:  What a story. And we have seen another courts.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yes, this judge, understandably, they think the judge should not be  hearing any federal cases because if you are really obstructing law  enforcement, why should you be on the bench? I mean, as a judge, you are  supposed to be implementing the laws.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> BRUCE:  And adjudicating them as opposed to helping a defendant sneak out  to get away from federal law enforcement. That's crazy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  She hears criminal cases. Are you going to let other criminals  go?</p><p> BRUCE:  Right. No matter -- look, they are human beings. We all have  opinions on the issues. But if you're willing to skirt the law and allow  someone else to do so, what else are you doing that is not fair?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's get to the swifts (ph) in New England. The 50 arrested  illegal immigrants selling opioids. You have been talking about that.</p><p> BRUCE:  Oh, yeah. This is our prior discussion. This is the big deal.  Trafficking in heroin. Trafficking in fentanyl. These are not drug users,  these are traffickers. And so this is where -- it is also a reminder to  people what ICE does. This is inside the country. It's the internal  framework.</p><p> They do not handle the border. They deal with criminals, the gangs, the  drug traffickers, sex traffickers, kidnappers, murderers, getting these  three Brazilians who are wanted for murder in that country, that's what ICE  does.</p><p> This is the organization that many Democrats want to abolish. That would be  a mistake because the people that are targeted and affected first and  victimized first are the communities of immigrants.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right, that's a point.</p><p> BRUCE:  This is who we are trying to protect here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right. But, you know, here is the other point about the story.  Several towns in Massachusetts here, they're sanctuary cities. It's Boston,  Cambridge, Lawrence and Newton. These are the cities where these  individuals have been detained.</p><p> BRUCE:  That's right. So the people that were scooped up had been in  custody. And then were released. Again, you think, well, was this somebody  who was driving under the influence or somebody who made a mistake? No,  these are drug traffickers. These are very serious individuals.</p><p> MACDONALD:  But the victims of the crimes are treated like rounding errors  in D.C. There is not a human being behind it that is treated --</p><p> BRUCE:  Big government, whether it is about health care or even law  enforcement. When people become the budget and you become a chit on a piece  of paper, you stop being a human being. This is why local law enforcement  matters. You know, judges matter.</p><p> They are supposed to see the individuals and yet they claim it is because  they are sensitive to immigrants, but this kind of action re-victimizes  immigrants. Legal immigrants who are playing by the rules and even  undocumented people who are also playing by the rules. Those are the people  that are protected by ICE.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Great stuff again from Tammy Bruce. You're going to come back  soon.</p><p> BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'll look forward to it. Thank you so much for having us in  your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on the  Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It  was down nearly 800 points, and then down about 80 points, doing a major  rethink after the initial freak out, panicked attack over the arrest that  U.S. request in Canada of the CFO of Huawei, that's China's top tech giant. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> That CFO, the daughter of Huawei's founder, a former Chinese military  officer. She's arrested on charges that Huawei broke U.S. sanctions by  selling U.S. technology to Iran. We've got details on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But Wall Streeters now applauding President Trump's tough line in trade  talks with China because China is stealing to make China great again. We've  got fresh new details on that. And it has to stop. </p><p> What's going on we've got an insider who has a front row seat on how China  has hollowed out entire U.S. industries and taken U.S. jobs. And why Trump  is right to fix the problem that elected officials for years have done  nothing about.</p><p> The Dow down 8 percent since its October high. But take a breath for some  perspective. Historically it is normal to have these kinds of downturns. We  bring you what you need to know.</p><p> Plus, tech execs at the White House today on how to beat China and more.  But the real firework is a fight in D.C. over G.M. getting not just loathes  of federal bailout help but state bailout help and tax breaks too, where it  hardly pays any taxes as its closing U.S. factories and laying off  thousands of people before Christmastime, sending those factory jobs to  Mexico. We've got the back story to FBN's exclusive with CEO Mary Barra. </p><p> Also, Democrat in-fighting over border wall funding. Nancy Pelosi now  saying she will not even accept a decent DACA deal in exchange for border  wall funding. People sick and tired of D.C. politics.</p><p> This as we bring you two big border scandals now hurting Americans. </p><p> Well, thank you for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money, politics. We  got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. The  Evening Edit starts right now. </p><p> OK. Let's get to the China outrage over the arrest of Huawei's CFO. They  are now demanding her release accusing the U.S. and Canada of quote,  \"wrongdoing.\" This is over violating Iran sanctions. But Wall Street  analysts point out other countries are saying Huawei is pretty bad. </p><p> Australia, New Zealand, Britain's telecom B.T. all kicked out Huawei over  fears that Huawei is stealing and spying giving its ties to China's  military. And they say President Trump is right. China for years has been  hollowing out U.S. jobs and entire U.S. industries, not funding its own  R&amp;D, but instead, stealing our research to make China great again. </p><p> Our companies pay for that research. China then sells cheaper copycats,  undercutting us. We're talking nuclear power generators, solar cells,  computer hardware, software, and more.</p><p> Let's get to Edward Lawrence in D.C. with more on that Huawei arrest.  Edward? </p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Liz. And don't forget,  circuit boards. That was a huge thing that Chinese put out. And right now,  the arrest of chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou threatens to destabilize  the fragile trade negotiations that have been going on between the U.S. and  China. </p><p> China calling for Canada to release the Huawei CFO. A spokesperson for the  Chinese foreign ministry says, \"The detention of a person without giving a  clear reason is of course a violation of the human rights to the person, or  of the person.\" </p><p> Now China claims they don't know the reason that she was detained. She is  being investigated by the U.S. for possible violations for breaking the  sanctions related to Iran. Now, the timing of arrest is interesting. She  was being detained in Canada the same day President Donald Trump worked out  a path forward on trade talks with China. </p><p> The national security advisor John Bolton told NPR that he was made aware  of the arrest and that it would happen. The White House, though, telling us  that the president did not know about it before he met with President Xi.  Regardless, some senators applauding the U.S. for sticking to its morals.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. MARK WARNER, (D) VIRGINIA:  My fear is when the Trump administration  is going to crumble on Huawei the same way they crumbled on ZTE. And as we  think about particularly we move to the next generation of wireless 5G and  that transformation is as big as anything that we've seen in the wireless  industry. And my fear is that China could be successful at setting the  standards and dominating that market.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  And national security advisor John Bolton also told NPR that  this is a Justice Department matter and they don't always tell the  president what they are doing. Liz?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Great to see you, Edward. Thank you so much.</p><p> Joining me now is Zach Mottl, he is a top executive at Atlas Tool Works.  This is a company that has had a front row seat for years watching China's  high-tech theft. We welcome you to the show, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p> ZACH MOTTL, CHIEF ALIGNMENT OFFICER, ATLAS TOOL WORKS:  Great to be here,  Elizabeth.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Your company makes precision parts for the internet, radar  systems, medical devices. What do you guys seeing, is President Trump right  about China stealing to make China great again. </p><p> MOTTL:  He's absolutely right. You know, Huawei has built a $90 billion  global enterprise based on commercial espionage, theft of western  technology. You know, my customers are offered -- my business has been  around for 100 years, and for 90 out of the 100 years we were a vendor in  the telecom industry. That was a really important sector for myself and  many other manufacturers like me.</p><p> And we watched as Chinese manufacturers Huawei ZTE came online, and in 20  years they wiped out every single western competitor. Lucent Technologies,  Tellabs, Nortel Networks in Canada. Every one of these companies could not  compete against commercial espionage and state subsidized technology.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Because they're undercutting us taking our jobs, our R&amp;D that  we pay for and then making cheaper copycats. Sir, isn't this a big wake-up  call to Congress to say, you know a what, knock it off about the media  grandstanding before, you know, the D.C. cameras and get on the stick.  Because China has a built-in road project that made in China 2025 project.</p><p> I mean, Obama, President Obama did try to stop China, but it's really up to  Congress to get our trade laws updated to knock it, to get it to knock it  off, right?</p><p> MOTTL:  That's right. This telecom industry was the crown jewel of America  and it portray laws and lack of oversight by Congress has allow the Chinese  to steal this. Let's not lose one more high-tech industry. And quite  frankly, let's bring the telephone manufacturing industry back here. </p><p> We're about to have 5G, and you know, we can worry about the security or we  can simply make it here and know that it's good. Because what we've learned  with this Huawei case and so many other cases, is that we just can't trust  the Chinese. They say one thing, but they do something completely  different. So, I'm hoping Congress will step up to the plate here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We hope so too, because this is got to stop, sir. I mean, this  should be hair on fire and break the glass time right now in D.C.</p><p> MOTTL:  That's right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Because to your point, we just cited these other countries  worried about Huawei. Also, you mentioned 5G. China is embedding itself and  the fears it's going to go into that new 5G rollout worldwide. That's the  internet of things. That's wearable fitness trackers. It's robots, taxis  and the like. </p><p> I mean, if China gets to jump on that and starts embedding itself in 5G,  wow, game over.</p><p> MOTTL:  That's right. And they're counting on, you know, they're taking  advantage of the free market. They are going to undercut price and they are  going to subsidize it to try to buy the market. We cannot let that happen.  We need to put laws in place and we need our other country partners to work  with us to shut them out of the market. Because again, we just cannot trust  them. And when they say they are not spying I certainly think they are.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All this breathtakingly tedious grandstanding in D.C. over it,  and they are setting aside what really matters and that's what you're  talking about. Because, sir, look what happened to U.S. Steel. U.S. Steel  spent tons of money to pioneer a new lighter, higher grade steel product  for cars and planes, but then China hacked it and hacked its computers,  stole the blueprints and started selling copycats steel at way cheaper  prices, right?</p><p> MOTTL:  When profit doesn't matter to these companies and they have a  government behind them helping them cheat and steal, how can we compete? We  need to do it smarter. And what it comes down to is jobs. It's not just  about high-tech and innovation. It's about jobs. It's about national  security. </p><p> And the employees like mine, you know, when I lost my telecom customers in  the early 2000, we have to lay people off. We reinvented ourselves, but a  lot of other companies couldn't. Telecom and so many other sectors are  really important. We're talking about good jobs for Americans versus growth  and good jobs for people in China. I want to see it made here and I want to  see it secure and safe so we can trust what's going through our network.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And now, we got indications that China made in behind that  massive Marriott hack affecting half a billion people potentially. Wow.</p><p> MOTTL:  It's pervasive. It is pervasive and everything that they do they  just simply play by a different set of rules, so they can tell us one thing  but we know they are going to do something else. We can't trust them. </p><p> So, I'm pleased to see President Trump, you know, holding firm. I trust his  judgment here and I hope that Congress is going to come along and finally  join the wise party because they are really missing the boat by not  protecting America and our information.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, you know what, you know, if Congress doesn't it, the  voter could and probably will. Zach Mottl of Atlas Tool Works, thanks for  coming in. We'd like you to come on again soon, sir. </p><p> MOTTL:  We'll see you soon, Elizabeth. Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you. Let's get Ned Ryun's reaction. Ned Ryun is one  of the top analysts out there, he's been watching D.C. Ned, I want your  reaction to the conversation we just had.</p><p> NED RYUN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  Well, I got to tell you, I  mean, initially, when you have a clip of Senator Warren saying -- Warner  saying about the fifth-generation 5G networks and Huawei, I mean, that's  one of things. </p><p> I wrote about this for Fox News during the week of Thanksgiving, Liz, in  which I said we have to be very careful because there is a proxy battle  being fought right now between United States and China between QUALCOMM and  Huawei over who's going to control that 5G network, and you are right. </p><p> The implications for the internet of things, right now there is about eight  billion internet of things devices. That number is probably going to triple  in the next three years. And who's going to control the networks and the  data is going to be massive as we move forward into the future.</p><p> And on the other front, you're right. I mean, they have been robbing us  blind. We have helped build the largest authoritarian police state in China  with really bad trade deals, and now we have looked the other way as they  literally over the last probably 10 years, Liz, I've seen estimates about  three trillion are in technology theft and between theft and force  technology transfers that we basically incentivize and given them the means  to compete with us on the technology front, but also on the economic front  and they're not shy about it. </p><p> They are gunning for us. They want to replace us as the center of the  economic world. And right now, for in the past, we've been lightening them  get away with it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know what, there's that and there's also this other  geopolitical risk that the White House is trying to address as well, Ned.  Look at this. New satellite images reveal activity and an unidentified  North Korean missile base. </p><p> So that's also a neck of the woods. What's you take on that?</p><p> RYUN:  Well, my take on this, is again, this has been the failure of the  three previous administrations kicking the can down the road of refusing to  actually deal with the North Korean threat. And now Trump has been  confronted with it. He realizes we cannot have this existential threat with  North Korea having nuclear armaments and being able to literally at some  point in the not-too-distant future have the ability to drop warheads on  American cities. </p><p> The key to this, though, Liz, and it's all, again, like you said, it's all  interconnected. We actually need China to play ball with us on North Korea  to deal with this threat. And so, this whole trade dispute taking place  with China, all of this stuff is interconnected. We have to figure out how  to see China accommodate our interest in real life. They've got to  prioritize our interest.</p><p> And so, this whole trade deal is not only tied to bad trade deals and  intellectual theft. It's also tied to how we deal with North Korea as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. And to your point, China's military has been boosting the  number of warplane intrusions into South Korea airspace, nearly doubling  the number of times in recent years. Your take on that.</p><p> RYUN:  Well, I mean, China, the amazing part to me is how brash China is  and we're acting, we are letting them get away with this. They have been  waging this economic war. They've been threatening us. They've been doing  building these islands in the South China Seas and we've just been sitting  there as though, we, you know, we don't know what they're up to. We know  exactly what they are up to. And I think it's time. </p><p> Obviously, if we can really deal this economic trade and put them on notice  I think we can start to deal with some of these military threats as well. </p><p> Trump is right to do this and I know that some people are worried about  this tariff fight. I will say this, Liz. If we do not confront China now in  the next few years, I'm convinced we will regret it for the next hundred  years. Because China does not want trade partners. China wants tributary  nations. And if we are not careful, if we deal with this trade threat and  these bad trade deals and this theft of our intellectual property we're not  going to like where we're at in 10 or 15 years.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, you make a great point there. Let's move over to  what's going on in Russia, Ned. I'd like your reaction to Russia doing some  saber rattling, showing off new laser weapons after the U.S. is threatening  to pull out of missile, that missile treaty dating back to the 80s because  of Russia cheating. What's your take on that?</p><p> RYUN:  I go back to, you know, despite all the left screaming buddy  murderer about Trump being too cozy with Putin, he is actually been pretty  aggressive with him, especially on the energy front. Over 50 percent of  Russia's, the Russian governments income comes from oil and gas exports.  And Trump knows what he's doing on this front.</p><p> Obviously, he confronted Merkel on Nord Stream II and Russia importing even  more natural gas to Germany, and Trump said you can't do that. He's also  gone in and address a lot of the middle and eastern and European countries  and the three C's initiative in which he is trying to get them off of  Russian energy. </p><p> Because he realizes, Trump realizes if you can cut off Russian exports in  these energy areas of gas and oil, he's going to undermine all this other  stuff that's taking place. So, he's focused on the right things. He has to  cut off the Europeans from getting or being wholly dependent or  significantly dependent on Russian energy. And if he can do that, I think  he's going to really be able to put Putin in his place.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Thank you, Ned Ryun. Great to see you. Come back soon.</p><p> RYUN:  Thanks, Liz. We'll do.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Next case, this morning 1000 friends and family attended the  funeral service at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston to say a final  farewell to President George H.W. Bush.</p><p> In attendance, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris, baseball legends Nolan  Ryan, and Tommy Lasorda. And also, country singers Crystal Gayle and Larry  Gatlin. The funeral train carry the casket of our 41st president a short  time ago to the presidential library at Texas A&amp;M University. </p><p> The president was laid to rest alongside his wife Barbara.</p><p> We're going to be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. tech execs from Google, Microsoft, and Oracle met  today at the White House with Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Larry Kudlow and  others to talk about securing U.S. manufacturing dominance, and artificial  intelligence, quantum computing, and more. Facebook executives not  attending.</p><p> But to the real fireworks. The fight in D.C. with G.M. G.M. CEO Mary Barra  met again today with lawmakers. They are pretty upset over G.M.'s big tax  breaks in the face of G.M. plants -- plans to shut factories and lay off  14,000 workers.</p><p> Look at this. FiatChrysler, though, plans to open a new factory in  Detroit.</p><p> Let's bring in Republican Ohio Congressman Warren Davidson. Good to see  you, sir. </p><p> REP. WARREN DAVIDSON, (R) OHIO:  Good to talk with you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, people are upset that G.M. keeps coming all the time  with tin cap in hand getting a lot of federal bailout help, and wait for  it, a lot of state tax breaks and bailout help too. And you know, Ohio gave  G.M. a ton of tax breaks, but now that factories are closing. What's your  take on this?</p><p> DAVIDSON:  You know, it's truly disappointing. And I've been in Congress  now for about two and half years, but prior to that, for the previous 15  years I was in manufacturing. So, when you talk the intersection of big  tech and automotive, they're really more interconnected than you would  imagine. </p><p> So, when Mary Barra came and talked with the Ohio delegation, she really  led with the transformation that the auto industry is confronting. And you  know, one of the points that I wanted to make is, you know, the good news  is, is unlike in '08, '09 when this was happening, Ohio strong and growing.  G.M. is anomaly our states hiring. </p><p> I offered to drive our economic development folks up to do a job fair at  the plant. So, G.M. is offering those folks jobs I'm sure the eighth  district would be happy to have them.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. But here's the thing. We've been watching and I've been  watching G.M. for years. I've been doing business journalism for three  decades. I was at the Wall Street Journal. I was an editor at Forbes. I've  been writing about G.M. for a long time, sir. </p><p> Here's the problem. Here's one of the issues. Ohio in 2008 gave state  income tax breaks to G.M., saying you don't have to pay 75 percent of your  income taxes to the state of Ohio over the next 15 years. </p><p> So, here's the thing. Should elected officials say once and for all, OK,  we'll give you, Mr. car company or Mr. G.M., a tax break, with the caveat  that you have to show us how you will build factories that you can retool  to make -- to make either smaller or bigger vehicles when gas prices go up  or down. Other car companies do that, why can't G.M.?</p><p> DAVIDSON:  Well, the good news is Honda's been doing that. They reinvested,  the Honda Accord wasn't selling as well as they thought. The CRV is selling  way better, I think two-thirds of the cars on the road that are in demand  right now our crossovers, SUVs or trucks. And Honda who is a huge anchor  for Ohio has been very adaptive. </p><p> G.M. not quite as flexible. There's a lot of history behind that. And you  know, frankly, some of the things were the government has been involved  that shows frankly, the government should be not try to run these  companies. We don't need more central planning.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Got that. Check that. Understood. I hear totally what you're  saying. I don't mean to interrupt. But that is agreed upon. We don't want  that. We don't want the government in there. But G.M. does really rapidly  come with a tin cap getting our tax help.</p><p> I mean, it's striking, sir, that we're -- that, you know, that FiatChrysler is now opening a factory in Detroit. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Yes. I mean, that's great. And you know, we'll see where that  goes for G.M. You know, I think they've been outperformed by a number of  companies that's why they have to come hot in hand and begging for help.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, that's been going on for decades.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'm telling you that's been going on for decades. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. Not to mention the subsidies that are going on to  try to steer consumers to buy this car or that car.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  And the areas (Ph) of government shouldn't be trying to steer  that. And the good news for G.M. is maybe they finally got the message as,  you are not going to get any more bailouts. The American people don't want  to bail you out nor anyone else, and so you are going to have to take care  of your balance sheet and do the right things.</p><p> So, I was impressed that Mary Barra came and was proactively speaking to us  on the hill. But yes, very sad news about the investment in Lordstown,  Ohio, in particular.</p><p> MACDONALD:  But you know what, but what about putting the feet to the fire.  I understand. I watch Mary Barra. We have a lot of respect for her. She is  a great CEO. But listen closely to what she says, OK. A lot of that is a  lot of P.R. talk. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You got to get to the nuts and bolts. Is she going to move jobs  to other factories in the U.S.? And you know, is she going to stop  outsourcing to Mexico? We understand the economics of it, but we also  understand the economics of giving out tax breaks when you're not, you  know, building factories that are flexible, right? Final word.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. And when you look at where the intellectual property  and the tech is, the good news is a lot of that happened in the U.S. and  when you tie that to what you're talking about earlier is the tech folks  coming to the White House. </p><p> The Foreign Investment Risk Reduction Modernization Act, that was one of  the biggest piece of registration that the House financial services  committee move this past year. It was an honor to work on it. Really our  country is going to be more secure, our country is going to be stronger. </p><p> And frankly, if we can complement that with a good reform to privacy so  that we can make sure that whether it's on the internet or in your car or  in app that you download on the phone it's always your data as a consumer.  And I was impressed that was one of the questions I put to Mary is that it  is an opt in practice for G.M. in the car.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  And so, I hope we can do that more and I hope that they'll see  that the competitive advantage in the United States means they should  continue to invest including in Ohio. We have a tremendous supply chain and  folks are happy to supply them.</p><p> MACDONALD:  There's great people in Ohio. Great people in Michigan, great  people in the heartland. Congressman Warren Davidson, thank you so much. We  really appreciate it. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's get to other headline news. Search and rescue efforts  still underway after two U.S. military planes collided in midair and crash  off the coast of Japan overnight. It happened during a refueling exercise.  One marine killed, another in fair condition. </p><p> However, five marines still missing. Our thoughts and prayers are with the  families there.</p><p> A Southwest Airlines flight get it off the runway upon landing in heavy  rain at Burbank Airport in California. There were no reported injuries.  Among the 117 passengers, they were evacuated using emergency slides.  That's pretty scary stuff.</p><p> And drug company, it's called Tris Pharma, now recalling some of its  children's Ibuprofen after it was notified about overly high concentrations  of that drug that can affect a child's kidneys. This brand was sold under  private label brands at CVS, Wal-Mart and Family Dollar. Check those labels  there.</p><p> Now to the border wall. Brand new analysis on how it saves thousands of  lives. We've got one of the best columnists and thinkers out there. Tammy  Bruce is coming up.</p><p> But first, Congress kicked of the can down the road again. Another  temporary spending budget. What are we sending them to D.C. for? It means  you may see a government shut down by just in time for Christmas. We're  going to tell you what they're fighting about now and why this is the best  case for term limits. We're at the bottom of the hour. Stay there. Back in  two.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're watching the Fox Business Network. To  government spending, again, Congress passing a temporary interim spending  bill today that is going to let the government be funded for two more  weeks, really is just kicking the can down the road again. Congress will  have to vote on this again before midnight on December 21st.</p><p> Joining me now, Trump 2020 campaign advisory board member Madison Gesiotto  and Democrat strategist Al Mottur. I know you guys love talking about this.  Madison, look at this, from Pew Research, you're not going to believe it.  Congress has only managed to pass all required appropriations measures on  time, wait for it, just four times since fiscal 1977. Is this an argument  for term limits. I mean, what do we send them into D.C. to do?</p><p> MADISON GESIOTTO, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, NATIONAL  DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP:  It's one of the many arguments for term  limits. I mean, Congress seems repeatedly every single year do not be able  to do their job. I remember last Christmas, we talked about the same thing.</p><p> Every single year, they are never meeting the requirements, they are never  doing their job. It's such a shame that we continue to have to talk about  this. For over 20 years, they haven't met the requirements. So those four  times between 1977 and 1997, it's frustrating.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. So here's the thing, Al. This is what I'm wondering if we  should do. You know what, Congress, it's sort of like telling your children  to go to their room until you get the job done. We're going to sequester  you in D.C., no grandstanding for the cameras, no campaigning, no political  rallies, no fundraising, you got to be quarantined in D.C. and get a  spending bill on time. How about that?</p><p> AL MOTTUR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Hey, we might as well try it. I mean,  look, you're on to something when you say no campaigning, no fundraising.  The politics have taken over the dynamic in the Congress and there is way  too much time spent on the phone dialing for dollars and don't have enough  time doing work for the American people. That's on both sides of the aisle.  There's got to be a way to stop it. Maybe term limits is part of the  answer. I think campaign finance reform is another.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, Pelosi now says she won't accept a pretty decent DACA  deal in exchange for border wall funding. That's what it has come down to  right now. What do you think?</p><p> GESIOTTO:  I think what's frustrating about what she is doing is the fact  that she is unwilling to compromise. I mean, when we look at Congress and  the idea of why we have two parties and why we have Democrats and  Republicans in Congress work together is because they need to compromise to  get to the end solution.</p><p> Sometimes, you are going to have to give a little to get a little. The  Republicans have tried to do that on many issues. Of course, they are not  perfect. But the Democrats slightly have really let their hate for our  president overcome their ability to get anything done.</p><p> MOTTUR:  That's not what is going on here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  It feels like it's going on. Go ahead, Al. Finish your point.</p><p> MOTTUR:  No, it's not. I mean, the parties for two decades have been unable  to do immigration compromise. I agree we have to compromise. It's not  because --</p><p> MACDONALD:  But they are purposely politicizing the border. That's the  issue. We know that for a fact from internal e-mails --</p><p> MOTTUR:  Both sides are politicizing the border, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We know for a fact from internal e-mails that Democrat Super  PAC say that's the way to go in order to get that voter. But here's the  thing. Democrats, Al, and you've talked about this too, starting in 2005,  2006 and all the way through 2013, said yeah, to border security. Just get  it done. We have this moment in time after the George H.W. Bush funeral,  that there seems to be some kind of unity. Get it done.</p><p> MOTTUR:  I don't think the president would accept the border wall for a  DACA deal, first of all. And second of all, the president --</p><p> MACDONALD:  We did have one. He had a DACA deal, 1.3 million DACA, to do a  border wall. The Americans want it. They don't our security dealt with like  a political football.</p><p> MOTTUR:  I wish we could compromise on immigration. It's not just right  now. It's not hatred for this president. It has been going on for a long  time.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Should get it done now. Should get it done yesterday. How about  that?</p><p> MOTTUR:  I am for it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Go ahead, Madison.</p><p> GESIOTTO:  You know, Al, you are saying that's simply not true, that the  Democrats are willing to compromise. When you look back 10, 20 years, we  just actually talked about this with Liz last week, the Democrats supported  many of the things that they are now going against when it comes to  immigration.</p><p> So that is your perfect and prime example right there as to why their hate  for our president has changed their views and clouded their judgment when  it comes to the immigration issue specifically.</p><p> MOTTUR:  I don't believe it's about hate to the president. I believe it's  on both sides, Republicans and Democrats --</p><p> GESIOTTO:  Obstruction --</p><p> MOTTUR:  -- pulling the football away.</p><p> GESIOTTO:  We can use any word there.</p><p> MOTTUR:  -- Charlie Brown. And Trump does it too.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK, Al, maybe we can all move beyond that and just tell D.C.,  your voice, Al, and Madison's voice, and the viewer and the people out  there saying, you know what, we're done with you, D.C., we're over it. It's  sort of like you tell a child to go to your room until you clean it. Get it  done.</p><p> MOTTUR:  Maybe if there were thermal on Madison (ph), I can go up there and  get it done.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, I'll tell you something. It's just astonishing. I  want your reaction, Al. Congress has managed only four times since fiscal  1977, just four times, to pass all of its required spending measures on  time. Really?</p><p> MOTTUR:  It's ridiculous. They ought to be here more than three days a  week. They ought to be here four, five days a week.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> MOTTUR:  And that would help. Fundraising is a problem. Like I said, term  limits could be part of the solution. But there is no incentive for them to  get this done because there is no punishment.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right, because this is term limits. Madison and Al, thank you  so much. Great fun --</p><p> MOTTUR:  Great to be with you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey will testify  privately behind closed doors on Capitol Hill tomorrow. It will be  transcribed and then released to the public within 24 hours. But how will  the media report on that? Will you get to the truth on what James Comey  said? We're going to break it down.</p><p> But first, why a border wall could save thousands of lives every year?  Tammy Bruce on that. We're going to explain after the break. Back in two.  Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know when something is staring right at you and you say  eureka (ph) of course, absolutely. My next guest has that moment for you,  says President Trump's border wall could help save thousands of lives.  Joining me now, Fox News political contributor, Independent Women's Voice  president, great columnist, writer, Tammy Bruce.</p><p> TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  I'm glad you got to check.  Thank you, dear. Look, my column is up today. This is not new. This is not  new news. What was shocking to me was the CDC report that came out about  last week, that noted and obviously should alarm all of us, that the drug  overdose deaths and suicides are at historic highs, right?</p><p> In just 2017, over 72,000 people died from drug overdoses. That is more  than the U.S. deaths in the Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. In  one year in this country, suicides are at their historic high, about 49,000  suicides also in 2017.</p><p> The CDC doesn't want to speculate, they say, on the cause. But what they do  recognize also is the importation of drugs, the opioid epidemic, people now  moving from prescription drug dynamic because we are at war with that, so  they turn to heroin. And then there is fentanyl which is now the new  synthetic opioid which kills you pretty much right away. It's a tiny, tiny  amount that will kill you.</p><p> We got single individuals bringing into the country, and somebody was  caught just a few weeks ago, bringing over enough that would kill 300  million Americans, and because it takes so little to end up killing you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> BRUCE:  This is at the border. Eighty percent of the fentanyl in this  country comes in through the southern border, and also China is involved in  that facilitation as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  It's just two milligrams. We just show that stat, 78 million.  That's based on the amount of fentanyl seized at the border last year and  the first quarter of this year. Life expectancy has been dragged down by  what is going on.</p><p> BRUCE:  That is correct, because you got middle aged individuals, right?  You got -- those are the individuals who are dying too early because of the  drug addiction and because of suicide. Look, one thing we know about  suicide is it's usually not one issue. It can be a multitude of issues. But  when you're also dealing with drug addiction, any addiction, certainly  alcoholism, but the opioid addiction creates hopelessness.</p><p> We've dealt with now -- thank goodness in the economic recovery, but the  last 10 years, people losing their homes, losing their savings, losing  their jobs. That combined with drug addiction. And then of course President  Obama, we lost our hospitals and our doctors and any real access to health  care. That we think of course has contributed to the nature of the suicide  choice. So it is  -- that in it of itself, because of the core of the  people affected is dragging down the U.S. life expectancy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Astonishing, that finding. You know, President Trump is saying  China will try to stop the importation of fentanyl into our country. That's  part of the trade deal. But Thomas Homan, to your point, former acting ICE  director, said, you know, having the troops at the border is making the  drug cartels berserk and crazy. He told us that on the show last week.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yeah. You know, he is -- what they have done is, because of the  caravan, we've obviously boosted up the numbers, and the cartels which have  relied on kind of a lax framework are furious because it is affecting their  ability to move the drugs in.</p><p> This is why when we talk about the wall, it is not just about we need an  orderly framework that happens at the border, but we must take seriously  what's going on and how these drugs are moving into the country, when 80  percent of fentanyl is coming in through the southern border.</p><p> And by the way, the majority of heroin as well is not coming from  Afghanistan, it's grown in Mexico. It's cultivated there and moved in  through Mexico. So the wall is something that not only are we dealing with  keeping bad guys out and killers and all of that and human trafficking, but  to stop this.</p><p> When you got three wars of the deaths combined including Vietnam in one  year, how is this not a war? All the American people deserve to be taken  seriously and to have --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Is it Trump's White House capitalizing on this, what you're  talking about?</p><p> BRUCE:  Look, they have got to talk more about the other issues that are  involving the wall and why this matters. People know the opioid crisis and  the prescription drugs, right, OxyContin. We know that there is a heroin  problem. People don't know that people have gone to street drugs when they  can't get a prescription. And where is that coming from? When you think of  heroin, when you think of a poppy fields in Afghanistan --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> BRUCE:  They got to talk more about this. This transcends political  parties, economic status, all of those things. And I wish the president  would speak more about it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Tammy Bruce, you're going to be with us later in the show.  Great information there. Wow! We had a jam-packed hour. Coming up, a major  arrest of illegals in Massachusetts. More than 50 illegal immigrants busted  in a multi-day swift (ph) in New England. Look at this. Three of them  wanted for murder.</p><p> But first, it's the testimony we have been waiting for. Tomorrow, former  FBI Director James Comey, he is going to get a Capitol Hill grilling behind  closed doors. But how will the media report on that? That's next. Stay  there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. Tomorrow, House Republicans will finally get  their chance to grill former FBI Director James Comey behind closed doors  about his actions and anti-Trump bias infecting the top levels of the FBI  during the election. Again, behind closed doors. The transcript will be  made public within 24 hours of that sessions. Joe Concha is a media  reporter for The Hill. He joins us now. So how are they going to report on  it? What do you think, Joe?</p><p> JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL:  Well, if it's going to be made  public in 24 hours, then I would imagine something because nothing gets  slip (ph) in Washington. Everything gets slip (ph) in Washington. Within an  hour, somebody is going to have to use the bathroom, there will be a call  from some reporter and then you're going to hear about it. But at least  everything is going to be out in 24 hours, sometimes that doesn't happen.</p><p> I think they got the wrong guy here, Liz. I want to know why Rod Rosenstein  isn't being called before Congress. He is the guy just nine weeks ago who  said, yeah, you know, I think I'll wear a wire and try to trap the  president, try to get him on tape to compel his cabinet to invoke the 25th  Amendment. I would have had him on there instead.</p><p> But, OK, we have Comey. Here's the thing about Comey. He's an open book.  Literally he's an open book. He wrote a book in April. He did a thousand  interviews after that. I might be exaggerating. Most probably dozens and  dozens. So everything seems to be out there already, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I hear what you're saying because -- let's be clear. This is  about Trump-hating, pro-Hillary FBI director and there are talks about  stopping Trump, impeaching Trump. Really the issue is that FISA warrant to  basically surveil Trump campaign aides because it looks like they really  did break the regulations in getting that FISA warrant, right?</p><p> CONCHA:  It appears that way. Absolutely. So, but I wonder, Comey who is a  very good public speaker, we could agree on that, when he's done his  testimonies, it has been the type of thing where he seems to be pretty  measured in his responses. He is ready for whatever question --</p><p> MACDONALD:  He has got to answer. Did you tell the FISA court that it was  funded by the Democrats, partly, you even said it was unverified on  salacious. Did you know at the time that it was unverified? Did you tell  the court that, right?</p><p> CONCHA:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You got to get that out of him.</p><p> CONCHA:  And if so, why? Was it because --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Why you --</p><p> CONCHA:  -- the president.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> CONCHA:  Right, exactly. Why didn't you pursue going down this particular  route? I also want to know why he leaked a private conversation or  conversations that he had with the president over dinner at the White  House, then leaked everything he talked about to a friend at Columbia  University, who then gave it too The New York Times, and he admits for the  sole purpose of compelling a special counsel to be appointed, and it  happened. How is that not illegal?</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We want -- can we have you back on to talk about it?</p><p> CONCHA:  Absotively (ph).</p><p> MACDONALD:  Absotively (ph). Joe Concha. That's great. Good to see you,  sir. Coming up, we are going to get to that ICE arrest. More than 50  illegals including three wanted for murder in sanctuary city friendly New  England. We're going to have Tammy Bruce back on that. Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. ICE arresting more than 50 illegal immigrants  over the past two days. It happened across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New  Hampshire, and Connecticut. Among those arrested, three immigrants,  illegals from Brazil, wanted there for murder.</p><p> The ICE raids taking place the very same week that the Massachusetts  Republican governor said, you know what, a state judge must temporarily  step down after that judge let an undocumented immigrant here basically  sneak out a backdoor to avoid ICE agents waiting to take him into custody.</p><p> Tammy Bruce is back with us. First on that story, Tammy, great to have you  back.</p><p> BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  That illegal that sneaked out (ph) the backdoor had been  deported multiple times for multiple drug arrests. And now the judge let  him go at the backdoor.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yeah. It is interesting. During the court proceedings, the judge  called them up to the bench, and the judge asked for the recording to stop.  And that is when suddenly when that went back on and they resumed, there  was suddenly some machinations there to have the charges dropped.</p><p> And then somehow, the defense attorney was able to walk the defendant out  through a side door back through which would not have been allowed without  it being facilitated and being able to avoid as there was also (ph) ICE  agents.</p><p> Some judges and immigration advocates of course don't want ICE agents to be  able to go into courthouses. They have argued that they have to stay  outside and that seems to be changing a little bit. There is argument about  that. This is one of the reasons why they want that to be able to be in the  courthouses to deal with this kind of stuff.</p><p> MACDONALD:  What a story. And we have seen another courts.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yes, this judge, understandably, they think the judge should not be  hearing any federal cases because if you are really obstructing law  enforcement, why should you be on the bench? I mean, as a judge, you are  supposed to be implementing the laws.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> BRUCE:  And adjudicating them as opposed to helping a defendant sneak out  to get away from federal law enforcement. That's crazy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  She hears criminal cases. Are you going to let other criminals  go?</p><p> BRUCE:  Right. No matter -- look, they are human beings. We all have  opinions on the issues. But if you're willing to skirt the law and allow  someone else to do so, what else are you doing that is not fair?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's get to the swifts (ph) in New England. The 50 arrested  illegal immigrants selling opioids. You have been talking about that.</p><p> BRUCE:  Oh, yeah. This is our prior discussion. This is the big deal.  Trafficking in heroin. Trafficking in fentanyl. These are not drug users,  these are traffickers. And so this is where -- it is also a reminder to  people what ICE does. This is inside the country. It's the internal  framework.</p><p> They do not handle the border. They deal with criminals, the gangs, the  drug traffickers, sex traffickers, kidnappers, murderers, getting these  three Brazilians who are wanted for murder in that country, that's what ICE  does.</p><p> This is the organization that many Democrats want to abolish. That would be  a mistake because the people that are targeted and affected first and  victimized first are the communities of immigrants.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right, that's a point.</p><p> BRUCE:  This is who we are trying to protect here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right. But, you know, here is the other point about the story.  Several towns in Massachusetts here, they're sanctuary cities. It's Boston,  Cambridge, Lawrence and Newton. These are the cities where these  individuals have been detained.</p><p> BRUCE:  That's right. So the people that were scooped up had been in  custody. And then were released. Again, you think, well, was this somebody  who was driving under the influence or somebody who made a mistake? No,  these are drug traffickers. These are very serious individuals.</p><p> MACDONALD:  But the victims of the crimes are treated like rounding errors  in D.C. There is not a human being behind it that is treated --</p><p> BRUCE:  Big government, whether it is about health care or even law  enforcement. When people become the budget and you become a chit on a piece  of paper, you stop being a human being. This is why local law enforcement  matters. You know, judges matter.</p><p> They are supposed to see the individuals and yet they claim it is because  they are sensitive to immigrants, but this kind of action re-victimizes  immigrants. Legal immigrants who are playing by the rules and even  undocumented people who are also playing by the rules. Those are the people  that are protected by ICE.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Great stuff again from Tammy Bruce. You're going to come back  soon.</p><p> BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'll look forward to it. Thank you so much for having us in  your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on the  Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It  was down nearly 800 points, and then down about 80 points, doing a major  rethink after the initial freak out, panicked attack over the arrest that  U.S. request in Canada of the CFO of Huawei, that's China's top tech giant. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> That CFO, the daughter of Huawei's founder, a former Chinese military  officer. She's arrested on charges that Huawei broke U.S. sanctions by  selling U.S. technology to Iran. We've got details on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But Wall Streeters now applauding President Trump's tough line in trade  talks with China because China is stealing to make China great again. We've  got fresh new details on that. And it has to stop. </p><p> What's going on we've got an insider who has a front row seat on how China  has hollowed out entire U.S. industries and taken U.S. jobs. And why Trump  is right to fix the problem that elected officials for years have done  nothing about.</p><p> The Dow down 8 percent since its October high. But take a breath for some  perspective. Historically it is normal to have these kinds of downturns. We  bring you what you need to know.</p><p> Plus, tech execs at the White House today on how to beat China and more.  But the real firework is a fight in D.C. over G.M. getting not just loathes  of federal bailout help but state bailout help and tax breaks too, where it  hardly pays any taxes as its closing U.S. factories and laying off  thousands of people before Christmastime, sending those factory jobs to  Mexico. We've got the back story to FBN's exclusive with CEO Mary Barra. </p><p> Also, Democrat in-fighting over border wall funding. Nancy Pelosi now  saying she will not even accept a decent DACA deal in exchange for border  wall funding. People sick and tired of D.C. politics.</p><p> This as we bring you two big border scandals now hurting Americans. </p><p> Well, thank you for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money, politics. We  got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. The  Evening Edit starts right now. </p><p> OK. Let's get to the China outrage over the arrest of Huawei's CFO. They  are now demanding her release accusing the U.S. and Canada of quote,  \"wrongdoing.\" This is over violating Iran sanctions. But Wall Street  analysts point out other countries are saying Huawei is pretty bad. </p><p> Australia, New Zealand, Britain's telecom B.T. all kicked out Huawei over  fears that Huawei is stealing and spying giving its ties to China's  military. And they say President Trump is right. China for years has been  hollowing out U.S. jobs and entire U.S. industries, not funding its own  R&amp;D, but instead, stealing our research to make China great again. </p><p> Our companies pay for that research. China then sells cheaper copycats,  undercutting us. We're talking nuclear power generators, solar cells,  computer hardware, software, and more.</p><p> Let's get to Edward Lawrence in D.C. with more on that Huawei arrest.  Edward? </p><p> EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Liz. And don't forget,  circuit boards. That was a huge thing that Chinese put out. And right now,  the arrest of chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou threatens to destabilize  the fragile trade negotiations that have been going on between the U.S. and  China. </p><p> China calling for Canada to release the Huawei CFO. A spokesperson for the  Chinese foreign ministry says, \"The detention of a person without giving a  clear reason is of course a violation of the human rights to the person, or  of the person.\" </p><p> Now China claims they don't know the reason that she was detained. She is  being investigated by the U.S. for possible violations for breaking the  sanctions related to Iran. Now, the timing of arrest is interesting. She  was being detained in Canada the same day President Donald Trump worked out  a path forward on trade talks with China. </p><p> The national security advisor John Bolton told NPR that he was made aware  of the arrest and that it would happen. The White House, though, telling us  that the president did not know about it before he met with President Xi.  Regardless, some senators applauding the U.S. for sticking to its morals.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. MARK WARNER, (D) VIRGINIA:  My fear is when the Trump administration  is going to crumble on Huawei the same way they crumbled on ZTE. And as we  think about particularly we move to the next generation of wireless 5G and  that transformation is as big as anything that we've seen in the wireless  industry. And my fear is that China could be successful at setting the  standards and dominating that market.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAWRENCE:  And national security advisor John Bolton also told NPR that  this is a Justice Department matter and they don't always tell the  president what they are doing. Liz?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Great to see you, Edward. Thank you so much.</p><p> Joining me now is Zach Mottl, he is a top executive at Atlas Tool Works.  This is a company that has had a front row seat for years watching China's  high-tech theft. We welcome you to the show, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p> ZACH MOTTL, CHIEF ALIGNMENT OFFICER, ATLAS TOOL WORKS:  Great to be here,  Elizabeth.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. Your company makes precision parts for the internet, radar  systems, medical devices. What do you guys seeing, is President Trump right  about China stealing to make China great again. </p><p> MOTTL:  He's absolutely right. You know, Huawei has built a $90 billion  global enterprise based on commercial espionage, theft of western  technology. You know, my customers are offered -- my business has been  around for 100 years, and for 90 out of the 100 years we were a vendor in  the telecom industry. That was a really important sector for myself and  many other manufacturers like me.</p><p> And we watched as Chinese manufacturers Huawei ZTE came online, and in 20  years they wiped out every single western competitor. Lucent Technologies,  Tellabs, Nortel Networks in Canada. Every one of these companies could not  compete against commercial espionage and state subsidized technology.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Because they're undercutting us taking our jobs, our R&amp;D that  we pay for and then making cheaper copycats. Sir, isn't this a big wake-up  call to Congress to say, you know a what, knock it off about the media  grandstanding before, you know, the D.C. cameras and get on the stick.  Because China has a built-in road project that made in China 2025 project.</p><p> I mean, Obama, President Obama did try to stop China, but it's really up to  Congress to get our trade laws updated to knock it, to get it to knock it  off, right?</p><p> MOTTL:  That's right. This telecom industry was the crown jewel of America  and it portray laws and lack of oversight by Congress has allow the Chinese  to steal this. Let's not lose one more high-tech industry. And quite  frankly, let's bring the telephone manufacturing industry back here. </p><p> We're about to have 5G, and you know, we can worry about the security or we  can simply make it here and know that it's good. Because what we've learned  with this Huawei case and so many other cases, is that we just can't trust  the Chinese. They say one thing, but they do something completely  different. So, I'm hoping Congress will step up to the plate here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We hope so too, because this is got to stop, sir. I mean, this  should be hair on fire and break the glass time right now in D.C.</p><p> MOTTL:  That's right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Because to your point, we just cited these other countries  worried about Huawei. Also, you mentioned 5G. China is embedding itself and  the fears it's going to go into that new 5G rollout worldwide. That's the  internet of things. That's wearable fitness trackers. It's robots, taxis  and the like. </p><p> I mean, if China gets to jump on that and starts embedding itself in 5G,  wow, game over.</p><p> MOTTL:  That's right. And they're counting on, you know, they're taking  advantage of the free market. They are going to undercut price and they are  going to subsidize it to try to buy the market. We cannot let that happen.  We need to put laws in place and we need our other country partners to work  with us to shut them out of the market. Because again, we just cannot trust  them. And when they say they are not spying I certainly think they are.</p><p> MACDONALD:  All this breathtakingly tedious grandstanding in D.C. over it,  and they are setting aside what really matters and that's what you're  talking about. Because, sir, look what happened to U.S. Steel. U.S. Steel  spent tons of money to pioneer a new lighter, higher grade steel product  for cars and planes, but then China hacked it and hacked its computers,  stole the blueprints and started selling copycats steel at way cheaper  prices, right?</p><p> MOTTL:  When profit doesn't matter to these companies and they have a  government behind them helping them cheat and steal, how can we compete? We  need to do it smarter. And what it comes down to is jobs. It's not just  about high-tech and innovation. It's about jobs. It's about national  security. </p><p> And the employees like mine, you know, when I lost my telecom customers in  the early 2000, we have to lay people off. We reinvented ourselves, but a  lot of other companies couldn't. Telecom and so many other sectors are  really important. We're talking about good jobs for Americans versus growth  and good jobs for people in China. I want to see it made here and I want to  see it secure and safe so we can trust what's going through our network.</p><p> MACDONALD:  And now, we got indications that China made in behind that  massive Marriott hack affecting half a billion people potentially. Wow.</p><p> MOTTL:  It's pervasive. It is pervasive and everything that they do they  just simply play by a different set of rules, so they can tell us one thing  but we know they are going to do something else. We can't trust them. </p><p> So, I'm pleased to see President Trump, you know, holding firm. I trust his  judgment here and I hope that Congress is going to come along and finally  join the wise party because they are really missing the boat by not  protecting America and our information.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, you know what, you know, if Congress doesn't it, the  voter could and probably will. Zach Mottl of Atlas Tool Works, thanks for  coming in. We'd like you to come on again soon, sir. </p><p> MOTTL:  We'll see you soon, Elizabeth. Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Good to see you. Let's get Ned Ryun's reaction. Ned Ryun is one  of the top analysts out there, he's been watching D.C. Ned, I want your  reaction to the conversation we just had.</p><p> NED RYUN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  Well, I got to tell you, I  mean, initially, when you have a clip of Senator Warren saying -- Warner  saying about the fifth-generation 5G networks and Huawei, I mean, that's  one of things. </p><p> I wrote about this for Fox News during the week of Thanksgiving, Liz, in  which I said we have to be very careful because there is a proxy battle  being fought right now between United States and China between QUALCOMM and  Huawei over who's going to control that 5G network, and you are right. </p><p> The implications for the internet of things, right now there is about eight  billion internet of things devices. That number is probably going to triple  in the next three years. And who's going to control the networks and the  data is going to be massive as we move forward into the future.</p><p> And on the other front, you're right. I mean, they have been robbing us  blind. We have helped build the largest authoritarian police state in China  with really bad trade deals, and now we have looked the other way as they  literally over the last probably 10 years, Liz, I've seen estimates about  three trillion are in technology theft and between theft and force  technology transfers that we basically incentivize and given them the means  to compete with us on the technology front, but also on the economic front  and they're not shy about it. </p><p> They are gunning for us. They want to replace us as the center of the  economic world. And right now, for in the past, we've been lightening them  get away with it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know what, there's that and there's also this other  geopolitical risk that the White House is trying to address as well, Ned.  Look at this. New satellite images reveal activity and an unidentified  North Korean missile base. </p><p> So that's also a neck of the woods. What's you take on that?</p><p> RYUN:  Well, my take on this, is again, this has been the failure of the  three previous administrations kicking the can down the road of refusing to  actually deal with the North Korean threat. And now Trump has been  confronted with it. He realizes we cannot have this existential threat with  North Korea having nuclear armaments and being able to literally at some  point in the not-too-distant future have the ability to drop warheads on  American cities. </p><p> The key to this, though, Liz, and it's all, again, like you said, it's all  interconnected. We actually need China to play ball with us on North Korea  to deal with this threat. And so, this whole trade dispute taking place  with China, all of this stuff is interconnected. We have to figure out how  to see China accommodate our interest in real life. They've got to  prioritize our interest.</p><p> And so, this whole trade deal is not only tied to bad trade deals and  intellectual theft. It's also tied to how we deal with North Korea as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yes. And to your point, China's military has been boosting the  number of warplane intrusions into South Korea airspace, nearly doubling  the number of times in recent years. Your take on that.</p><p> RYUN:  Well, I mean, China, the amazing part to me is how brash China is  and we're acting, we are letting them get away with this. They have been  waging this economic war. They've been threatening us. They've been doing  building these islands in the South China Seas and we've just been sitting  there as though, we, you know, we don't know what they're up to. We know  exactly what they are up to. And I think it's time. </p><p> Obviously, if we can really deal this economic trade and put them on notice  I think we can start to deal with some of these military threats as well. </p><p> Trump is right to do this and I know that some people are worried about  this tariff fight. I will say this, Liz. If we do not confront China now in  the next few years, I'm convinced we will regret it for the next hundred  years. Because China does not want trade partners. China wants tributary  nations. And if we are not careful, if we deal with this trade threat and  these bad trade deals and this theft of our intellectual property we're not  going to like where we're at in 10 or 15 years.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, you make a great point there. Let's move over to  what's going on in Russia, Ned. I'd like your reaction to Russia doing some  saber rattling, showing off new laser weapons after the U.S. is threatening  to pull out of missile, that missile treaty dating back to the 80s because  of Russia cheating. What's your take on that?</p><p> RYUN:  I go back to, you know, despite all the left screaming buddy  murderer about Trump being too cozy with Putin, he is actually been pretty  aggressive with him, especially on the energy front. Over 50 percent of  Russia's, the Russian governments income comes from oil and gas exports.  And Trump knows what he's doing on this front.</p><p> Obviously, he confronted Merkel on Nord Stream II and Russia importing even  more natural gas to Germany, and Trump said you can't do that. He's also  gone in and address a lot of the middle and eastern and European countries  and the three C's initiative in which he is trying to get them off of  Russian energy. </p><p> Because he realizes, Trump realizes if you can cut off Russian exports in  these energy areas of gas and oil, he's going to undermine all this other  stuff that's taking place. So, he's focused on the right things. He has to  cut off the Europeans from getting or being wholly dependent or  significantly dependent on Russian energy. And if he can do that, I think  he's going to really be able to put Putin in his place.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Thank you, Ned Ryun. Great to see you. Come back soon.</p><p> RYUN:  Thanks, Liz. We'll do.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Next case, this morning 1000 friends and family attended the  funeral service at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston to say a final  farewell to President George H.W. Bush.</p><p> In attendance, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris, baseball legends Nolan  Ryan, and Tommy Lasorda. And also, country singers Crystal Gayle and Larry  Gatlin. The funeral train carry the casket of our 41st president a short  time ago to the presidential library at Texas A&amp;M University. </p><p> The president was laid to rest alongside his wife Barbara.</p><p> We're going to be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. tech execs from Google, Microsoft, and Oracle met  today at the White House with Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Larry Kudlow and  others to talk about securing U.S. manufacturing dominance, and artificial  intelligence, quantum computing, and more. Facebook executives not  attending.</p><p> But to the real fireworks. The fight in D.C. with G.M. G.M. CEO Mary Barra  met again today with lawmakers. They are pretty upset over G.M.'s big tax  breaks in the face of G.M. plants -- plans to shut factories and lay off  14,000 workers.</p><p> Look at this. FiatChrysler, though, plans to open a new factory in  Detroit.</p><p> Let's bring in Republican Ohio Congressman Warren Davidson. Good to see  you, sir. </p><p> REP. WARREN DAVIDSON, (R) OHIO:  Good to talk with you, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, people are upset that G.M. keeps coming all the time  with tin cap in hand getting a lot of federal bailout help, and wait for  it, a lot of state tax breaks and bailout help too. And you know, Ohio gave  G.M. a ton of tax breaks, but now that factories are closing. What's your  take on this?</p><p> DAVIDSON:  You know, it's truly disappointing. And I've been in Congress  now for about two and half years, but prior to that, for the previous 15  years I was in manufacturing. So, when you talk the intersection of big  tech and automotive, they're really more interconnected than you would  imagine. </p><p> So, when Mary Barra came and talked with the Ohio delegation, she really  led with the transformation that the auto industry is confronting. And you  know, one of the points that I wanted to make is, you know, the good news  is, is unlike in '08, '09 when this was happening, Ohio strong and growing.  G.M. is anomaly our states hiring. </p><p> I offered to drive our economic development folks up to do a job fair at  the plant. So, G.M. is offering those folks jobs I'm sure the eighth  district would be happy to have them.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. But here's the thing. We've been watching and I've been  watching G.M. for years. I've been doing business journalism for three  decades. I was at the Wall Street Journal. I was an editor at Forbes. I've  been writing about G.M. for a long time, sir. </p><p> Here's the problem. Here's one of the issues. Ohio in 2008 gave state  income tax breaks to G.M., saying you don't have to pay 75 percent of your  income taxes to the state of Ohio over the next 15 years. </p><p> So, here's the thing. Should elected officials say once and for all, OK,  we'll give you, Mr. car company or Mr. G.M., a tax break, with the caveat  that you have to show us how you will build factories that you can retool  to make -- to make either smaller or bigger vehicles when gas prices go up  or down. Other car companies do that, why can't G.M.?</p><p> DAVIDSON:  Well, the good news is Honda's been doing that. They reinvested,  the Honda Accord wasn't selling as well as they thought. The CRV is selling  way better, I think two-thirds of the cars on the road that are in demand  right now our crossovers, SUVs or trucks. And Honda who is a huge anchor  for Ohio has been very adaptive. </p><p> G.M. not quite as flexible. There's a lot of history behind that. And you  know, frankly, some of the things were the government has been involved  that shows frankly, the government should be not try to run these  companies. We don't need more central planning.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Got that. Check that. Understood. I hear totally what you're  saying. I don't mean to interrupt. But that is agreed upon. We don't want  that. We don't want the government in there. But G.M. does really rapidly  come with a tin cap getting our tax help.</p><p> I mean, it's striking, sir, that we're -- that, you know, that FiatChrysler is now opening a factory in Detroit. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Yes. I mean, that's great. And you know, we'll see where that  goes for G.M. You know, I think they've been outperformed by a number of  companies that's why they have to come hot in hand and begging for help.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Well, that's been going on for decades.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'm telling you that's been going on for decades. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. Not to mention the subsidies that are going on to  try to steer consumers to buy this car or that car.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  And the areas (Ph) of government shouldn't be trying to steer  that. And the good news for G.M. is maybe they finally got the message as,  you are not going to get any more bailouts. The American people don't want  to bail you out nor anyone else, and so you are going to have to take care  of your balance sheet and do the right things.</p><p> So, I was impressed that Mary Barra came and was proactively speaking to us  on the hill. But yes, very sad news about the investment in Lordstown,  Ohio, in particular.</p><p> MACDONALD:  But you know what, but what about putting the feet to the fire.  I understand. I watch Mary Barra. We have a lot of respect for her. She is  a great CEO. But listen closely to what she says, OK. A lot of that is a  lot of P.R. talk. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You got to get to the nuts and bolts. Is she going to move jobs  to other factories in the U.S.? And you know, is she going to stop  outsourcing to Mexico? We understand the economics of it, but we also  understand the economics of giving out tax breaks when you're not, you  know, building factories that are flexible, right? Final word.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. And when you look at where the intellectual property  and the tech is, the good news is a lot of that happened in the U.S. and  when you tie that to what you're talking about earlier is the tech folks  coming to the White House. </p><p> The Foreign Investment Risk Reduction Modernization Act, that was one of  the biggest piece of registration that the House financial services  committee move this past year. It was an honor to work on it. Really our  country is going to be more secure, our country is going to be stronger. </p><p> And frankly, if we can complement that with a good reform to privacy so  that we can make sure that whether it's on the internet or in your car or  in app that you download on the phone it's always your data as a consumer.  And I was impressed that was one of the questions I put to Mary is that it  is an opt in practice for G.M. in the car.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> DAVIDSON:  And so, I hope we can do that more and I hope that they'll see  that the competitive advantage in the United States means they should  continue to invest including in Ohio. We have a tremendous supply chain and  folks are happy to supply them.</p><p> MACDONALD:  There's great people in Ohio. Great people in Michigan, great  people in the heartland. Congressman Warren Davidson, thank you so much. We  really appreciate it. </p><p> DAVIDSON:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's get to other headline news. Search and rescue efforts  still underway after two U.S. military planes collided in midair and crash  off the coast of Japan overnight. It happened during a refueling exercise.  One marine killed, another in fair condition. </p><p> However, five marines still missing. Our thoughts and prayers are with the  families there.</p><p> A Southwest Airlines flight get it off the runway upon landing in heavy  rain at Burbank Airport in California.

We've got one of the best columnists and thinkers out there. Tammy  Bruce is coming up.</p><p> But first, Congress kicked of the can down the road again. Another  temporary spending budget. What are we sending them to D.C. for? It means  you may see a government shut down by just in time for Christmas. We're  going to tell you what they're fighting about now and why this is the best  case for term limits. We're at the bottom of the hour. Stay there. Back in  two.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're watching the Fox Business Network. To  government spending, again, Congress passing a temporary interim spending  bill today that is going to let the government be funded for two more  weeks, really is just kicking the can down the road again. Congress will  have to vote on this again before midnight on December 21st.</p><p> Joining me now, Trump 2020 campaign advisory board member Madison Gesiotto  and Democrat strategist Al Mottur. I know you guys love talking about this.  Madison, look at this, from Pew Research, you're not going to believe it.  Congress has only managed to pass all required appropriations measures on  time, wait for it, just four times since fiscal 1977. Is this an argument  for term limits. I mean, what do we send them into D.C. to do?</p><p> MADISON GESIOTTO, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, NATIONAL  DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP:  It's one of the many arguments for term  limits. I mean, Congress seems repeatedly every single year do not be able  to do their job. I remember last Christmas, we talked about the same thing.</p><p> Every single year, they are never meeting the requirements, they are never  doing their job. It's such a shame that we continue to have to talk about  this. For over 20 years, they haven't met the requirements. So those four  times between 1977 and 1997, it's frustrating.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. So here's the thing, Al. This is what I'm wondering if we  should do. You know what, Congress, it's sort of like telling your children  to go to their room until you get the job done. We're going to sequester  you in D.C., no grandstanding for the cameras, no campaigning, no political  rallies, no fundraising, you got to be quarantined in D.C. and get a  spending bill on time. How about that?</p><p> AL MOTTUR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Hey, we might as well try it. I mean,  look, you're on to something when you say no campaigning, no fundraising.  The politics have taken over the dynamic in the Congress and there is way  too much time spent on the phone dialing for dollars and don't have enough  time doing work for the American people. That's on both sides of the aisle.  There's got to be a way to stop it. Maybe term limits is part of the  answer. I think campaign finance reform is another.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, Pelosi now says she won't accept a pretty decent DACA  deal in exchange for border wall funding. That's what it has come down to  right now. What do you think?</p><p> GESIOTTO:  I think what's frustrating about what she is doing is the fact  that she is unwilling to compromise. I mean, when we look at Congress and  the idea of why we have two parties and why we have Democrats and  Republicans in Congress work together is because they need to compromise to  get to the end solution.</p><p> Sometimes, you are going to have to give a little to get a little. The  Republicans have tried to do that on many issues. Of course, they are not  perfect. But the Democrats slightly have really let their hate for our  president overcome their ability to get anything done.</p><p> MOTTUR:  That's not what is going on here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  It feels like it's going on. Go ahead, Al. Finish your point.</p><p> MOTTUR:  No, it's not. I mean, the parties for two decades have been unable  to do immigration compromise. I agree we have to compromise. It's not  because --</p><p> MACDONALD:  But they are purposely politicizing the border. That's the  issue. We know that for a fact from internal e-mails --</p><p> MOTTUR:  Both sides are politicizing the border, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  We know for a fact from internal e-mails that Democrat Super  PAC say that's the way to go in order to get that voter. But here's the  thing. Democrats, Al, and you've talked about this too, starting in 2005,  2006 and all the way through 2013, said yeah, to border security. Just get  it done. We have this moment in time after the George H.W. Bush funeral,  that there seems to be some kind of unity. Get it done.</p><p> MOTTUR:  I don't think the president would accept the border wall for a  DACA deal, first of all. And second of all, the president --</p><p> MACDONALD:  We did have one. He had a DACA deal, 1.3 million DACA, to do a  border wall. The Americans want it. They don't our security dealt with like  a political football.</p><p> MOTTUR:  I wish we could compromise on immigration. It's not just right  now. It's not hatred for this president. It has been going on for a long  time.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Should get it done now. Should get it done yesterday. How about  that?</p><p> MOTTUR:  I am for it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Go ahead, Madison.</p><p> GESIOTTO:  You know, Al, you are saying that's simply not true, that the  Democrats are willing to compromise. When you look back 10, 20 years, we  just actually talked about this with Liz last week, the Democrats supported  many of the things that they are now going against when it comes to  immigration.</p><p> So that is your perfect and prime example right there as to why their hate  for our president has changed their views and clouded their judgment when  it comes to the immigration issue specifically.</p><p> MOTTUR:  I don't believe it's about hate to the president. I believe it's  on both sides, Republicans and Democrats --</p><p> GESIOTTO:  Obstruction --</p><p> MOTTUR:  -- pulling the football away.</p><p> GESIOTTO:  We can use any word there.</p><p> MOTTUR:  -- Charlie Brown. And Trump does it too.</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK, Al, maybe we can all move beyond that and just tell D.C.,  your voice, Al, and Madison's voice, and the viewer and the people out  there saying, you know what, we're done with you, D.C., we're over it. It's  sort of like you tell a child to go to your room until you clean it. Get it  done.</p><p> MOTTUR:  Maybe if there were thermal on Madison (ph), I can go up there and  get it done.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know, I'll tell you something. It's just astonishing. I  want your reaction, Al. Congress has managed only four times since fiscal  1977, just four times, to pass all of its required spending measures on  time. Really?</p><p> MOTTUR:  It's ridiculous. They ought to be here more than three days a  week. They ought to be here four, five days a week.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> MOTTUR:  And that would help. Fundraising is a problem. Like I said, term  limits could be part of the solution. But there is no incentive for them to  get this done because there is no punishment.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right, because this is term limits. Madison and Al, thank you  so much. Great fun --</p><p> MOTTUR:  Great to be with you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey will testify  privately behind closed doors on Capitol Hill tomorrow. It will be  transcribed and then released to the public within 24 hours. But how will  the media report on that? Will you get to the truth on what James Comey  said? We're going to break it down.</p><p> But first, why a border wall could save thousands of lives every year?  Tammy Bruce on that. We're going to explain after the break. Back in two.  Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  You know when something is staring right at you and you say  eureka (ph) of course, absolutely. My next guest has that moment for you,  says President Trump's border wall could help save thousands of lives.  Joining me now, Fox News political contributor, Independent Women's Voice  president, great columnist, writer, Tammy Bruce.</p><p> TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  I'm glad you got to check.  Thank you, dear. Look, my column is up today. This is not new. This is not  new news. What was shocking to me was the CDC report that came out about  last week, that noted and obviously should alarm all of us, that the drug  overdose deaths and suicides are at historic highs, right?</p><p> In just 2017, over 72,000 people died from drug overdoses. That is more  than the U.S. deaths in the Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. In  one year in this country, suicides are at their historic high, about 49,000  suicides also in 2017.</p><p> The CDC doesn't want to speculate, they say, on the cause. But what they do  recognize also is the importation of drugs, the opioid epidemic, people now  moving from prescription drug dynamic because we are at war with that, so  they turn to heroin. And then there is fentanyl which is now the new  synthetic opioid which kills you pretty much right away. It's a tiny, tiny  amount that will kill you.</p><p> We got single individuals bringing into the country, and somebody was  caught just a few weeks ago, bringing over enough that would kill 300  million Americans, and because it takes so little to end up killing you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> BRUCE:  This is at the border. Eighty percent of the fentanyl in this  country comes in through the southern border, and also China is involved in  that facilitation as well.</p><p> MACDONALD:  It's just two milligrams. We just show that stat, 78 million.  That's based on the amount of fentanyl seized at the border last year and  the first quarter of this year. Life expectancy has been dragged down by  what is going on.</p><p> BRUCE:  That is correct, because you got middle aged individuals, right?  You got -- those are the individuals who are dying too early because of the  drug addiction and because of suicide. Look, one thing we know about  suicide is it's usually not one issue. It can be a multitude of issues. But  when you're also dealing with drug addiction, any addiction, certainly  alcoholism, but the opioid addiction creates hopelessness.</p><p> We've dealt with now -- thank goodness in the economic recovery, but the  last 10 years, people losing their homes, losing their savings, losing  their jobs. That combined with drug addiction. And then of course President  Obama, we lost our hospitals and our doctors and any real access to health  care. That we think of course has contributed to the nature of the suicide  choice. So it is  -- that in it of itself, because of the core of the  people affected is dragging down the U.S. life expectancy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Astonishing, that finding. You know, President Trump is saying  China will try to stop the importation of fentanyl into our country. That's  part of the trade deal. But Thomas Homan, to your point, former acting ICE  director, said, you know, having the troops at the border is making the  drug cartels berserk and crazy. He told us that on the show last week.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yeah. You know, he is -- what they have done is, because of the  caravan, we've obviously boosted up the numbers, and the cartels which have  relied on kind of a lax framework are furious because it is affecting their  ability to move the drugs in.</p><p> This is why when we talk about the wall, it is not just about we need an  orderly framework that happens at the border, but we must take seriously  what's going on and how these drugs are moving into the country, when 80  percent of fentanyl is coming in through the southern border.</p><p> And by the way, the majority of heroin as well is not coming from  Afghanistan, it's grown in Mexico. It's cultivated there and moved in  through Mexico. So the wall is something that not only are we dealing with  keeping bad guys out and killers and all of that and human trafficking, but  to stop this.</p><p> When you got three wars of the deaths combined including Vietnam in one  year, how is this not a war? All the American people deserve to be taken  seriously and to have --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Is it Trump's White House capitalizing on this, what you're  talking about?</p><p> BRUCE:  Look, they have got to talk more about the other issues that are  involving the wall and why this matters. People know the opioid crisis and  the prescription drugs, right, OxyContin. We know that there is a heroin  problem. People don't know that people have gone to street drugs when they  can't get a prescription. And where is that coming from? When you think of  heroin, when you think of a poppy fields in Afghanistan --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> BRUCE:  They got to talk more about this. This transcends political  parties, economic status, all of those things. And I wish the president  would speak more about it.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Tammy Bruce, you're going to be with us later in the show.  Great information there. Wow! We had a jam-packed hour. Coming up, a major  arrest of illegals in Massachusetts. More than 50 illegal immigrants busted  in a multi-day swift (ph) in New England. Look at this. Three of them  wanted for murder.</p><p> But first, it's the testimony we have been waiting for. Tomorrow, former  FBI Director James Comey, he is going to get a Capitol Hill grilling behind  closed doors. But how will the media report on that? That's next. Stay  there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. Tomorrow, House Republicans will finally get  their chance to grill former FBI Director James Comey behind closed doors  about his actions and anti-Trump bias infecting the top levels of the FBI  during the election. Again, behind closed doors. The transcript will be  made public within 24 hours of that sessions. Joe Concha is a media  reporter for The Hill. He joins us now. So how are they going to report on  it? What do you think, Joe?</p><p> JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL:  Well, if it's going to be made  public in 24 hours, then I would imagine something because nothing gets  slip (ph) in Washington. Everything gets slip (ph) in Washington. Within an  hour, somebody is going to have to use the bathroom, there will be a call  from some reporter and then you're going to hear about it. But at least  everything is going to be out in 24 hours, sometimes that doesn't happen.</p><p> I think they got the wrong guy here, Liz. I want to know why Rod Rosenstein  isn't being called before Congress. He is the guy just nine weeks ago who  said, yeah, you know, I think I'll wear a wire and try to trap the  president, try to get him on tape to compel his cabinet to invoke the 25th  Amendment. I would have had him on there instead.</p><p> But, OK, we have Comey. Here's the thing about Comey. He's an open book.  Literally he's an open book. He wrote a book in April. He did a thousand  interviews after that. I might be exaggerating. Most probably dozens and  dozens. So everything seems to be out there already, Liz.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I hear what you're saying because -- let's be clear. This is  about Trump-hating, pro-Hillary FBI director and there are talks about  stopping Trump, impeaching Trump. Really the issue is that FISA warrant to  basically surveil Trump campaign aides because it looks like they really  did break the regulations in getting that FISA warrant, right?</p><p> CONCHA:  It appears that way. Absolutely. So, but I wonder, Comey who is a  very good public speaker, we could agree on that, when he's done his  testimonies, it has been the type of thing where he seems to be pretty  measured in his responses. He is ready for whatever question --</p><p> MACDONALD:  He has got to answer. Did you tell the FISA court that it was  funded by the Democrats, partly, you even said it was unverified on  salacious. Did you know at the time that it was unverified? Did you tell  the court that, right?</p><p> CONCHA:  Right.</p><p> MACDONALD:  You got to get that out of him.</p><p> CONCHA:  And if so, why? Was it because --</p><p> MACDONALD:  Why you --</p><p> CONCHA:  -- the president.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p> CONCHA:  Right, exactly. Why didn't you pursue going down this particular  route? I also want to know why he leaked a private conversation or  conversations that he had with the president over dinner at the White  House, then leaked everything he talked about to a friend at Columbia  University, who then gave it too The New York Times, and he admits for the  sole purpose of compelling a special counsel to be appointed, and it  happened. How is that not illegal?</p><p> MACDONALD:  OK. We want -- can we have you back on to talk about it?</p><p> CONCHA:  Absotively (ph).</p><p> MACDONALD:  Absotively (ph). Joe Concha. That's great. Good to see you,  sir. Coming up, we are going to get to that ICE arrest. More than 50  illegals including three wanted for murder in sanctuary city friendly New  England. We're going to have Tammy Bruce back on that. Stay there.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MACDONALD:  Welcome back. ICE arresting more than 50 illegal immigrants  over the past two days. It happened across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New  Hampshire, and Connecticut. Among those arrested, three immigrants,  illegals from Brazil, wanted there for murder.</p><p> The ICE raids taking place the very same week that the Massachusetts  Republican governor said, you know what, a state judge must temporarily  step down after that judge let an undocumented immigrant here basically  sneak out a backdoor to avoid ICE agents waiting to take him into custody.</p><p> Tammy Bruce is back with us. First on that story, Tammy, great to have you  back.</p><p> BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  That illegal that sneaked out (ph) the backdoor had been  deported multiple times for multiple drug arrests. And now the judge let  him go at the backdoor.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yeah. It is interesting. During the court proceedings, the judge  called them up to the bench, and the judge asked for the recording to stop.  And that is when suddenly when that went back on and they resumed, there  was suddenly some machinations there to have the charges dropped.</p><p> And then somehow, the defense attorney was able to walk the defendant out  through a side door back through which would not have been allowed without  it being facilitated and being able to avoid as there was also (ph) ICE  agents.</p><p> Some judges and immigration advocates of course don't want ICE agents to be  able to go into courthouses. They have argued that they have to stay  outside and that seems to be changing a little bit. There is argument about  that. This is one of the reasons why they want that to be able to be in the  courthouses to deal with this kind of stuff.</p><p> MACDONALD:  What a story. And we have seen another courts.</p><p> BRUCE:  Yes, this judge, understandably, they think the judge should not be  hearing any federal cases because if you are really obstructing law  enforcement, why should you be on the bench? I mean, as a judge, you are  supposed to be implementing the laws.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p> BRUCE:  And adjudicating them as opposed to helping a defendant sneak out  to get away from federal law enforcement. That's crazy.</p><p> MACDONALD:  She hears criminal cases. Are you going to let other criminals  go?</p><p> BRUCE:  Right. No matter -- look, they are human beings. We all have  opinions on the issues. But if you're willing to skirt the law and allow  someone else to do so, what else are you doing that is not fair?</p><p> MACDONALD:  Let's get to the swifts (ph) in New England. The 50 arrested  illegal immigrants selling opioids. You have been talking about that.</p><p> BRUCE:  Oh, yeah. This is our prior discussion. This is the big deal.  Trafficking in heroin. Trafficking in fentanyl. These are not drug users,  these are traffickers. And so this is where -- it is also a reminder to  people what ICE does. This is inside the country. It's the internal  framework.</p><p> They do not handle the border. They deal with criminals, the gangs, the  drug traffickers, sex traffickers, kidnappers, murderers, getting these  three Brazilians who are wanted for murder in that country, that's what ICE  does.</p><p> This is the organization that many Democrats want to abolish. That would be  a mistake because the people that are targeted and affected first and  victimized first are the communities of immigrants.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right, that's a point.</p><p> BRUCE:  This is who we are trying to protect here.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Right. But, you know, here is the other point about the story.  Several towns in Massachusetts here, they're sanctuary cities. It's Boston,  Cambridge, Lawrence and Newton. These are the cities where these  individuals have been detained.</p><p> BRUCE:  That's right. So the people that were scooped up had been in  custody. And then were released. Again, you think, well, was this somebody  who was driving under the influence or somebody who made a mistake? No,  these are drug traffickers. These are very serious individuals.</p><p> MACDONALD:  But the victims of the crimes are treated like rounding errors  in D.C. There is not a human being behind it that is treated --</p><p> BRUCE:  Big government, whether it is about health care or even law  enforcement. When people become the budget and you become a chit on a piece  of paper, you stop being a human being. This is why local law enforcement  matters. You know, judges matter.</p><p> They are supposed to see the individuals and yet they claim it is because  they are sensitive to immigrants, but this kind of action re-victimizes  immigrants. Legal immigrants who are playing by the rules and even  undocumented people who are also playing by the rules. Those are the people  that are protected by ICE.</p><p> MACDONALD:  Great stuff again from Tammy Bruce. You're going to come back  soon.</p><p> BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p> MACDONALD:  I'll look forward to it. Thank you so much for having us in  your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on the  Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It was down nearly 800 points, and then down about 80 points, doing a major rethink after the initial freak out, panicked attack over the arrest that U.S. request in Canada of the CFO of Huawei, that's China's top tech giant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That CFO, the daughter of Huawei's founder, a former Chinese military officer. She's arrested on charges that Huawei broke U.S. sanctions by selling U.S. technology to Iran. We've got details on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Wall Streeters now applauding President Trump's tough line in trade talks with China because China is stealing to make China great again. We've got fresh new details on that. And it has to stop.</p><p>What's going on we've got an insider who has a front row seat on how China has hollowed out entire U.S. industries and taken U.S. jobs. And why Trump is right to fix the problem that elected officials for years have done nothing about.</p><p>The Dow down 8 percent since its October high. But take a breath for some perspective. Historically it is normal to have these kinds of downturns. We bring you what you need to know.</p><p>Plus, tech execs at the White House today on how to beat China and more. But the real firework is a fight in D.C. over G.M. getting not just loathes of federal bailout help but state bailout help and tax breaks too, where it hardly pays any taxes as its closing U.S. factories and laying off thousands of people before Christmastime, sending those factory jobs to Mexico. We've got the back story to FBN's exclusive with CEO Mary Barra.</p><p>Also, Democrat in-fighting over border wall funding. Nancy Pelosi now saying she will not even accept a decent DACA deal in exchange for border wall funding. People sick and tired of D.C. politics.</p><p>This as we bring you two big border scandals now hurting Americans.</p><p>Well, thank you for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money, politics. We got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. The Evening Edit starts right now.</p><p>OK. Let's get to the China outrage over the arrest of Huawei's CFO. They are now demanding her release accusing the U.S. and Canada of quote, \"wrongdoing.\" This is over violating Iran sanctions. But Wall Street analysts point out other countries are saying Huawei is pretty bad.</p><p>Australia, New Zealand, Britain's telecom B.T. all kicked out Huawei over fears that Huawei is stealing and spying giving its ties to China's military. And they say President Trump is right. China for years has been hollowing out U.S. jobs and entire U.S. industries, not funding its own R&amp;D, but instead, stealing our research to make China great again.</p><p>Our companies pay for that research. China then sells cheaper copycats, undercutting us. We're talking nuclear power generators, solar cells, computer hardware, software, and more.</p><p>Let's get to Edward Lawrence in D.C. with more on that Huawei arrest. Edward?</p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Liz. And don't forget, circuit boards. That was a huge thing that Chinese put out. And right now, the arrest of chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou threatens to destabilize the fragile trade negotiations that have been going on between the U.S. and China.</p><p>China calling for Canada to release the Huawei CFO. A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry says, \"The detention of a person without giving a clear reason is of course a violation of the human rights to the person, or of the person.\"</p><p>Now China claims they don't know the reason that she was detained. She is being investigated by the U.S. for possible violations for breaking the sanctions related to Iran. Now, the timing of arrest is interesting. She was being detained in Canada the same day President Donald Trump worked out a path forward on trade talks with China.</p><p>The national security advisor John Bolton told NPR that he was made aware of the arrest and that it would happen. The White House, though, telling us that the president did not know about it before he met with President Xi. Regardless, some senators applauding the U.S. for sticking to its morals.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER, (D) VIRGINIA: My fear is when the Trump administration is going to crumble on Huawei the same way they crumbled on ZTE. And as we think about particularly we move to the next generation of wireless 5G and that transformation is as big as anything that we've seen in the wireless industry. And my fear is that China could be successful at setting the standards and dominating that market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE: And national security advisor John Bolton also told NPR that this is a Justice Department matter and they don't always tell the president what they are doing. Liz?</p><p>MACDONALD: Great to see you, Edward. Thank you so much.</p><p>Joining me now is Zach Mottl, he is a top executive at Atlas Tool Works. This is a company that has had a front row seat for years watching China's high-tech theft. We welcome you to the show, sir. Thank you so much.</p><p>ZACH MOTTL, CHIEF ALIGNMENT OFFICER, ATLAS TOOL WORKS: Great to be here, Elizabeth.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Your company makes precision parts for the internet, radar systems, medical devices. What do you guys seeing, is President Trump right about China stealing to make China great again.</p><p>MOTTL: He's absolutely right. You know, Huawei has built a $90 billion global enterprise based on commercial espionage, theft of western technology. You know, my customers are offered -- my business has been around for 100 years, and for 90 out of the 100 years we were a vendor in the telecom industry. That was a really important sector for myself and many other manufacturers like me.</p><p>And we watched as Chinese manufacturers Huawei ZTE came online, and in 20 years they wiped out every single western competitor. Lucent Technologies, Tellabs, Nortel Networks in Canada. Every one of these companies could not compete against commercial espionage and state subsidized technology.</p><p>MACDONALD: Because they're undercutting us taking our jobs, our R&amp;D that we pay for and then making cheaper copycats. Sir, isn't this a big wake-up call to Congress to say, you know a what, knock it off about the media grandstanding before, you know, the D.C. cameras and get on the stick. Because China has a built-in road project that made in China 2025 project.</p><p>I mean, Obama, President Obama did try to stop China, but it's really up to Congress to get our trade laws updated to knock it, to get it to knock it off, right?</p><p>MOTTL: That's right. This telecom industry was the crown jewel of America and it portray laws and lack of oversight by Congress has allow the Chinese to steal this. Let's not lose one more high-tech industry. And quite frankly, let's bring the telephone manufacturing industry back here.</p><p>We're about to have 5G, and you know, we can worry about the security or we can simply make it here and know that it's good. Because what we've learned with this Huawei case and so many other cases, is that we just can't trust the Chinese. They say one thing, but they do something completely different. So, I'm hoping Congress will step up to the plate here.</p><p>MACDONALD: We hope so too, because this is got to stop, sir. I mean, this should be hair on fire and break the glass time right now in D.C.</p><p>MOTTL: That's right.</p><p>MACDONALD: Because to your point, we just cited these other countries worried about Huawei. Also, you mentioned 5G. China is embedding itself and the fears it's going to go into that new 5G rollout worldwide. That's the internet of things. That's wearable fitness trackers. It's robots, taxis and the like.</p><p>I mean, if China gets to jump on that and starts embedding itself in 5G, wow, game over.</p><p>MOTTL: That's right. And they're counting on, you know, they're taking advantage of the free market. They are going to undercut price and they are going to subsidize it to try to buy the market. We cannot let that happen. We need to put laws in place and we need our other country partners to work with us to shut them out of the market. Because again, we just cannot trust them. And when they say they are not spying I certainly think they are.</p><p>MACDONALD: All this breathtakingly tedious grandstanding in D.C. over it, and they are setting aside what really matters and that's what you're talking about. Because, sir, look what happened to U.S. Steel. U.S. Steel spent tons of money to pioneer a new lighter, higher grade steel product for cars and planes, but then China hacked it and hacked its computers, stole the blueprints and started selling copycats steel at way cheaper prices, right?</p><p>MOTTL: When profit doesn't matter to these companies and they have a government behind them helping them cheat and steal, how can we compete? We need to do it smarter. And what it comes down to is jobs. It's not just about high-tech and innovation. It's about jobs. It's about national security.</p><p>And the employees like mine, you know, when I lost my telecom customers in the early 2000, we have to lay people off. We reinvented ourselves, but a lot of other companies couldn't. Telecom and so many other sectors are really important. We're talking about good jobs for Americans versus growth and good jobs for people in China. I want to see it made here and I want to see it secure and safe so we can trust what's going through our network.</p><p>MACDONALD: And now, we got indications that China made in behind that massive Marriott hack affecting half a billion people potentially. Wow.</p><p>MOTTL: It's pervasive. It is pervasive and everything that they do they just simply play by a different set of rules, so they can tell us one thing but we know they are going to do something else. We can't trust them.</p><p>So, I'm pleased to see President Trump, you know, holding firm. I trust his judgment here and I hope that Congress is going to come along and finally join the wise party because they are really missing the boat by not protecting America and our information.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, you know what, you know, if Congress doesn't it, the voter could and probably will. Zach Mottl of Atlas Tool Works, thanks for coming in. We'd like you to come on again soon, sir.</p><p>MOTTL: We'll see you soon, Elizabeth. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Good to see you. Let's get Ned Ryun's reaction. Ned Ryun is one of the top analysts out there, he's been watching D.C. Ned, I want your reaction to the conversation we just had.</p><p>NED RYUN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY: Well, I got to tell you, I mean, initially, when you have a clip of Senator Warren saying -- Warner saying about the fifth-generation 5G networks and Huawei, I mean, that's one of things.</p><p>I wrote about this for Fox News during the week of Thanksgiving, Liz, in which I said we have to be very careful because there is a proxy battle being fought right now between United States and China between QUALCOMM and Huawei over who's going to control that 5G network, and you are right.</p><p>The implications for the internet of things, right now there is about eight billion internet of things devices. That number is probably going to triple in the next three years. And who's going to control the networks and the data is going to be massive as we move forward into the future.</p><p>And on the other front, you're right. I mean, they have been robbing us blind. We have helped build the largest authoritarian police state in China with really bad trade deals, and now we have looked the other way as they literally over the last probably 10 years, Liz, I've seen estimates about three trillion are in technology theft and between theft and force technology transfers that we basically incentivize and given them the means to compete with us on the technology front, but also on the economic front and they're not shy about it.</p><p>They are gunning for us. They want to replace us as the center of the economic world. And right now, for in the past, we've been lightening them get away with it.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know what, there's that and there's also this other geopolitical risk that the White House is trying to address as well, Ned. Look at this. New satellite images reveal activity and an unidentified North Korean missile base.</p><p>So that's also a neck of the woods. What's you take on that?</p><p>RYUN: Well, my take on this, is again, this has been the failure of the three previous administrations kicking the can down the road of refusing to actually deal with the North Korean threat. And now Trump has been confronted with it. He realizes we cannot have this existential threat with North Korea having nuclear armaments and being able to literally at some point in the not-too-distant future have the ability to drop warheads on American cities.</p><p>The key to this, though, Liz, and it's all, again, like you said, it's all interconnected. We actually need China to play ball with us on North Korea to deal with this threat. And so, this whole trade dispute taking place with China, all of this stuff is interconnected. We have to figure out how to see China accommodate our interest in real life. They've got to prioritize our interest.</p><p>And so, this whole trade deal is not only tied to bad trade deals and intellectual theft. It's also tied to how we deal with North Korea as well.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. And to your point, China's military has been boosting the number of warplane intrusions into South Korea airspace, nearly doubling the number of times in recent years. Your take on that.</p><p>RYUN: Well, I mean, China, the amazing part to me is how brash China is and we're acting, we are letting them get away with this. They have been waging this economic war. They've been threatening us. They've been doing building these islands in the South China Seas and we've just been sitting there as though, we, you know, we don't know what they're up to. We know exactly what they are up to. And I think it's time.</p><p>Obviously, if we can really deal this economic trade and put them on notice I think we can start to deal with some of these military threats as well.</p><p>Trump is right to do this and I know that some people are worried about this tariff fight. I will say this, Liz. If we do not confront China now in the next few years, I'm convinced we will regret it for the next hundred years. Because China does not want trade partners. China wants tributary nations. And if we are not careful, if we deal with this trade threat and these bad trade deals and this theft of our intellectual property we're not going to like where we're at in 10 or 15 years.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, you make a great point there. Let's move over to what's going on in Russia, Ned. I'd like your reaction to Russia doing some saber rattling, showing off new laser weapons after the U.S. is threatening to pull out of missile, that missile treaty dating back to the 80s because of Russia cheating. What's your take on that?</p><p>RYUN: I go back to, you know, despite all the left screaming buddy murderer about Trump being too cozy with Putin, he is actually been pretty aggressive with him, especially on the energy front. Over 50 percent of Russia's, the Russian governments income comes from oil and gas exports. And Trump knows what he's doing on this front.</p><p>Obviously, he confronted Merkel on Nord Stream II and Russia importing even more natural gas to Germany, and Trump said you can't do that. He's also gone in and address a lot of the middle and eastern and European countries and the three C's initiative in which he is trying to get them off of Russian energy.</p><p>Because he realizes, Trump realizes if you can cut off Russian exports in these energy areas of gas and oil, he's going to undermine all this other stuff that's taking place. So, he's focused on the right things. He has to cut off the Europeans from getting or being wholly dependent or significantly dependent on Russian energy. And if he can do that, I think he's going to really be able to put Putin in his place.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you, Ned Ryun. Great to see you. Come back soon.</p><p>RYUN: Thanks, Liz. We'll do.</p><p>MACDONALD: Next case, this morning 1000 friends and family attended the funeral service at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston to say a final farewell to President George H.W. Bush.</p><p>In attendance, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris, baseball legends Nolan Ryan, and Tommy Lasorda. And also, country singers Crystal Gayle and Larry Gatlin. The funeral train carry the casket of our 41st president a short time ago to the presidential library at Texas A&amp;M University.</p><p>The president was laid to rest alongside his wife Barbara.</p><p>We're going to be right back.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. tech execs from Google, Microsoft, and Oracle met today at the White House with Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Larry Kudlow and others to talk about securing U.S. manufacturing dominance, and artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and more. Facebook executives not attending.</p><p>But to the real fireworks. The fight in D.C. with G.M. G.M. CEO Mary Barra met again today with lawmakers. They are pretty upset over G.M.'s big tax breaks in the face of G.M. plants -- plans to shut factories and lay off 14,000 workers.</p><p>Look at this. FiatChrysler, though, plans to open a new factory in Detroit.</p><p>Let's bring in Republican Ohio Congressman Warren Davidson. Good to see you, sir.</p><p>REP. WARREN DAVIDSON, (R) OHIO: Good to talk with you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, people are upset that G.M. keeps coming all the time with tin cap in hand getting a lot of federal bailout help, and wait for it, a lot of state tax breaks and bailout help too. And you know, Ohio gave G.M. a ton of tax breaks, but now that factories are closing. What's your take on this?</p><p>DAVIDSON: You know, it's truly disappointing. And I've been in Congress now for about two and half years, but prior to that, for the previous 15 years I was in manufacturing. So, when you talk the intersection of big tech and automotive, they're really more interconnected than you would imagine.</p><p>So, when Mary Barra came and talked with the Ohio delegation, she really led with the transformation that the auto industry is confronting. And you know, one of the points that I wanted to make is, you know, the good news is, is unlike in '08, '09 when this was happening, Ohio strong and growing. G.M. is anomaly our states hiring.</p><p>I offered to drive our economic development folks up to do a job fair at the plant. So, G.M. is offering those folks jobs I'm sure the eighth district would be happy to have them.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. But here's the thing. We've been watching and I've been watching G.M. for years. I've been doing business journalism for three decades. I was at the Wall Street Journal. I was an editor at Forbes. I've been writing about G.M. for a long time, sir.</p><p>Here's the problem. Here's one of the issues. Ohio in 2008 gave state income tax breaks to G.M., saying you don't have to pay 75 percent of your income taxes to the state of Ohio over the next 15 years.</p><p>So, here's the thing. Should elected officials say once and for all, OK, we'll give you, Mr. car company or Mr. G.M., a tax break, with the caveat that you have to show us how you will build factories that you can retool to make -- to make either smaller or bigger vehicles when gas prices go up or down. Other car companies do that, why can't G.M.?</p><p>DAVIDSON: Well, the good news is Honda's been doing that. They reinvested, the Honda Accord wasn't selling as well as they thought. The CRV is selling way better, I think two-thirds of the cars on the road that are in demand right now our crossovers, SUVs or trucks. And Honda who is a huge anchor for Ohio has been very adaptive.</p><p>G.M. not quite as flexible. There's a lot of history behind that. And you know, frankly, some of the things were the government has been involved that shows frankly, the government should be not try to run these companies. We don't need more central planning.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Got that. Check that. Understood. I hear totally what you're saying. I don't mean to interrupt. But that is agreed upon. We don't want that. We don't want the government in there. But G.M. does really rapidly come with a tin cap getting our tax help.</p><p>I mean, it's striking, sir, that we're -- that, you know, that FiatChrysler is now opening a factory in Detroit.</p><p>DAVIDSON: Yes. I mean, that's great. And you know, we'll see where that goes for G.M. You know, I think they've been outperformed by a number of companies that's why they have to come hot in hand and begging for help.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, that's been going on for decades.</p><p>DAVIDSON: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: I'm telling you that's been going on for decades.</p><p>DAVIDSON: Absolutely. Not to mention the subsidies that are going on to try to steer consumers to buy this car or that car.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right.</p><p>DAVIDSON: And the areas (Ph) of government shouldn't be trying to steer that. And the good news for G.M. is maybe they finally got the message as, you are not going to get any more bailouts. The American people don't want to bail you out nor anyone else, and so you are going to have to take care of your balance sheet and do the right things.</p><p>So, I was impressed that Mary Barra came and was proactively speaking to us on the hill. But yes, very sad news about the investment in Lordstown, Ohio, in particular.</p><p>MACDONALD: But you know what, but what about putting the feet to the fire. I understand. I watch Mary Barra. We have a lot of respect for her. She is a great CEO. But listen closely to what she says, OK. A lot of that is a lot of P.R. talk.</p><p>DAVIDSON: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: You got to get to the nuts and bolts. Is she going to move jobs to other factories in the U.S.? And you know, is she going to stop outsourcing to Mexico? We understand the economics of it, but we also understand the economics of giving out tax breaks when you're not, you know, building factories that are flexible, right? Final word.</p><p>DAVIDSON: Absolutely. And when you look at where the intellectual property and the tech is, the good news is a lot of that happened in the U.S. and when you tie that to what you're talking about earlier is the tech folks coming to the White House.</p><p>The Foreign Investment Risk Reduction Modernization Act, that was one of the biggest piece of registration that the House financial services committee move this past year. It was an honor to work on it. Really our country is going to be more secure, our country is going to be stronger.</p><p>And frankly, if we can complement that with a good reform to privacy so that we can make sure that whether it's on the internet or in your car or in app that you download on the phone it's always your data as a consumer. And I was impressed that was one of the questions I put to Mary is that it is an opt in practice for G.M. in the car.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>DAVIDSON: And so, I hope we can do that more and I hope that they'll see that the competitive advantage in the United States means they should continue to invest including in Ohio. We have a tremendous supply chain and folks are happy to supply them.</p><p>MACDONALD: There's great people in Ohio. Great people in Michigan, great people in the heartland. Congressman Warren Davidson, thank you so much. We really appreciate it.</p><p>DAVIDSON: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's get to other headline news. Search and rescue efforts still underway after two U.S. military planes collided in midair and crash off the coast of Japan overnight. It happened during a refueling exercise. One marine killed, another in fair condition.</p><p>However, five marines still missing. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families there.</p><p>A Southwest Airlines flight get it off the runway upon landing in heavy rain at Burbank Airport in California. There were no reported injuries. Among the 117 passengers, they were evacuated using emergency slides. That's pretty scary stuff.</p><p>And drug company, it's called Tris Pharma, now recalling some of its children's Ibuprofen after it was notified about overly high concentrations of that drug that can affect a child's kidneys. This brand was sold under private label brands at CVS, Wal-Mart and Family Dollar. Check those labels there.</p><p>Now to the border wall. Brand new analysis on how it saves thousands of lives. We've got one of the best columnists and thinkers out there. Tammy Bruce is coming up.</p><p>But first, Congress kicked of the can down the road again. Another temporary spending budget. What are we sending them to D.C. for? It means you may see a government shut down by just in time for Christmas. We're going to tell you what they're fighting about now and why this is the best case for term limits. We're at the bottom of the hour. Stay there. Back in two.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. You're watching the Fox Business Network. To government spending, again, Congress passing a temporary interim spending bill today that is going to let the government be funded for two more weeks, really is just kicking the can down the road again. Congress will have to vote on this again before midnight on December 21st.</p><p>Joining me now, Trump 2020 campaign advisory board member Madison Gesiotto and Democrat strategist Al Mottur. I know you guys love talking about this. Madison, look at this, from Pew Research, you're not going to believe it. Congress has only managed to pass all required appropriations measures on time, wait for it, just four times since fiscal 1977. Is this an argument for term limits. I mean, what do we send them into D.C. to do?</p><p>MADISON GESIOTTO, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, NATIONAL DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP: It's one of the many arguments for term limits. I mean, Congress seems repeatedly every single year do not be able to do their job. I remember last Christmas, we talked about the same thing.</p><p>Every single year, they are never meeting the requirements, they are never doing their job. It's such a shame that we continue to have to talk about this. For over 20 years, they haven't met the requirements. So those four times between 1977 and 1997, it's frustrating.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. So here's the thing, Al. This is what I'm wondering if we should do. You know what, Congress, it's sort of like telling your children to go to their room until you get the job done. We're going to sequester you in D.C., no grandstanding for the cameras, no campaigning, no political rallies, no fundraising, you got to be quarantined in D.C. and get a spending bill on time. How about that?</p><p>AL MOTTUR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Hey, we might as well try it. I mean, look, you're on to something when you say no campaigning, no fundraising. The politics have taken over the dynamic in the Congress and there is way too much time spent on the phone dialing for dollars and don't have enough time doing work for the American people. That's on both sides of the aisle. There's got to be a way to stop it. Maybe term limits is part of the answer. I think campaign finance reform is another.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Pelosi now says she won't accept a pretty decent DACA deal in exchange for border wall funding. That's what it has come down to right now. What do you think?</p><p>GESIOTTO: I think what's frustrating about what she is doing is the fact that she is unwilling to compromise. I mean, when we look at Congress and the idea of why we have two parties and why we have Democrats and Republicans in Congress work together is because they need to compromise to get to the end solution.</p><p>Sometimes, you are going to have to give a little to get a little. The Republicans have tried to do that on many issues. Of course, they are not perfect. But the Democrats slightly have really let their hate for our president overcome their ability to get anything done.</p><p>MOTTUR: That's not what is going on here.</p><p>MACDONALD: It feels like it's going on. Go ahead, Al. Finish your point.</p><p>MOTTUR: No, it's not. I mean, the parties for two decades have been unable to do immigration compromise. I agree we have to compromise. It's not because --</p><p>MACDONALD: But they are purposely politicizing the border. That's the issue. We know that for a fact from internal e-mails --</p><p>MOTTUR: Both sides are politicizing the border, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: We know for a fact from internal e-mails that Democrat Super PAC say that's the way to go in order to get that voter. But here's the thing. Democrats, Al, and you've talked about this too, starting in 2005, 2006 and all the way through 2013, said yeah, to border security. Just get it done. We have this moment in time after the George H.W. Bush funeral, that there seems to be some kind of unity. Get it done.</p><p>MOTTUR: I don't think the president would accept the border wall for a DACA deal, first of all. And second of all, the president --</p><p>MACDONALD: We did have one. He had a DACA deal, 1.3 million DACA, to do a border wall. The Americans want it. They don't our security dealt with like a political football.</p><p>MOTTUR: I wish we could compromise on immigration. It's not just right now. It's not hatred for this president. It has been going on for a long time.</p><p>MACDONALD: Should get it done now. Should get it done yesterday. How about that?</p><p>MOTTUR: I am for it.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD: Go ahead, Madison.</p><p>GESIOTTO: You know, Al, you are saying that's simply not true, that the Democrats are willing to compromise. When you look back 10, 20 years, we just actually talked about this with Liz last week, the Democrats supported many of the things that they are now going against when it comes to immigration.</p><p>So that is your perfect and prime example right there as to why their hate for our president has changed their views and clouded their judgment when it comes to the immigration issue specifically.</p><p>MOTTUR: I don't believe it's about hate to the president. I believe it's on both sides, Republicans and Democrats --</p><p>GESIOTTO: Obstruction --</p><p>MOTTUR: -- pulling the football away.</p><p>GESIOTTO: We can use any word there.</p><p>MOTTUR: -- Charlie Brown. And Trump does it too.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, Al, maybe we can all move beyond that and just tell D.C., your voice, Al, and Madison's voice, and the viewer and the people out there saying, you know what, we're done with you, D.C., we're over it. It's sort of like you tell a child to go to your room until you clean it. Get it done.</p><p>MOTTUR: Maybe if there were thermal on Madison (ph), I can go up there and get it done.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, I'll tell you something. It's just astonishing. I want your reaction, Al. Congress has managed only four times since fiscal 1977, just four times, to pass all of its required spending measures on time. Really?</p><p>MOTTUR: It's ridiculous. They ought to be here more than three days a week. They ought to be here four, five days a week.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right.</p><p>MOTTUR: And that would help. Fundraising is a problem. Like I said, term limits could be part of the solution. But there is no incentive for them to get this done because there is no punishment.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right, because this is term limits. Madison and Al, thank you so much. Great fun --</p><p>MOTTUR: Great to be with you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey will testify privately behind closed doors on Capitol Hill tomorrow. It will be transcribed and then released to the public within 24 hours. But how will the media report on that? Will you get to the truth on what James Comey said? We're going to break it down.</p><p>But first, why a border wall could save thousands of lives every year? Tammy Bruce on that. We're going to explain after the break. Back in two. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know when something is staring right at you and you say eureka (ph) of course, absolutely. My next guest has that moment for you, says President Trump's border wall could help save thousands of lives. Joining me now, Fox News political contributor, Independent Women's Voice president, great columnist, writer, Tammy Bruce.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: I'm glad you got to check. Thank you, dear. Look, my column is up today. This is not new. This is not new news. What was shocking to me was the CDC report that came out about last week, that noted and obviously should alarm all of us, that the drug overdose deaths and suicides are at historic highs, right?</p><p>In just 2017, over 72,000 people died from drug overdoses. That is more than the U.S. deaths in the Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. In one year in this country, suicides are at their historic high, about 49,000 suicides also in 2017.</p><p>The CDC doesn't want to speculate, they say, on the cause. But what they do recognize also is the importation of drugs, the opioid epidemic, people now moving from prescription drug dynamic because we are at war with that, so they turn to heroin. And then there is fentanyl which is now the new synthetic opioid which kills you pretty much right away. It's a tiny, tiny amount that will kill you.</p><p>We got single individuals bringing into the country, and somebody was caught just a few weeks ago, bringing over enough that would kill 300 million Americans, and because it takes so little to end up killing you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>BRUCE: This is at the border. Eighty percent of the fentanyl in this country comes in through the southern border, and also China is involved in that facilitation as well.</p><p>MACDONALD: It's just two milligrams. We just show that stat, 78 million. That's based on the amount of fentanyl seized at the border last year and the first quarter of this year. Life expectancy has been dragged down by what is going on.</p><p>BRUCE: That is correct, because you got middle aged individuals, right? You got -- those are the individuals who are dying too early because of the drug addiction and because of suicide. Look, one thing we know about suicide is it's usually not one issue. It can be a multitude of issues. But when you're also dealing with drug addiction, any addiction, certainly alcoholism, but the opioid addiction creates hopelessness.</p><p>We've dealt with now -- thank goodness in the economic recovery, but the last 10 years, people losing their homes, losing their savings, losing their jobs. That combined with drug addiction. And then of course President Obama, we lost our hospitals and our doctors and any real access to health care. That we think of course has contributed to the nature of the suicide choice. So it is -- that in it of itself, because of the core of the people affected is dragging down the U.S. life expectancy.</p><p>MACDONALD: Astonishing, that finding. You know, President Trump is saying China will try to stop the importation of fentanyl into our country. That's part of the trade deal. But Thomas Homan, to your point, former acting ICE director, said, you know, having the troops at the border is making the drug cartels berserk and crazy. He told us that on the show last week.</p><p>BRUCE: Yeah. You know, he is -- what they have done is, because of the caravan, we've obviously boosted up the numbers, and the cartels which have relied on kind of a lax framework are furious because it is affecting their ability to move the drugs in.</p><p>This is why when we talk about the wall, it is not just about we need an orderly framework that happens at the border, but we must take seriously what's going on and how these drugs are moving into the country, when 80 percent of fentanyl is coming in through the southern border.</p><p>And by the way, the majority of heroin as well is not coming from Afghanistan, it's grown in Mexico. It's cultivated there and moved in through Mexico. So the wall is something that not only are we dealing with keeping bad guys out and killers and all of that and human trafficking, but to stop this.</p><p>When you got three wars of the deaths combined including Vietnam in one year, how is this not a war? All the American people deserve to be taken seriously and to have --</p><p>MACDONALD: Is it Trump's White House capitalizing on this, what you're talking about?</p><p>BRUCE: Look, they have got to talk more about the other issues that are involving the wall and why this matters. People know the opioid crisis and the prescription drugs, right, OxyContin. We know that there is a heroin problem. People don't know that people have gone to street drugs when they can't get a prescription. And where is that coming from? When you think of heroin, when you think of a poppy fields in Afghanistan --</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>BRUCE: They got to talk more about this. This transcends political parties, economic status, all of those things. And I wish the president would speak more about it.</p><p>MACDONALD: Tammy Bruce, you're going to be with us later in the show. Great information there. Wow! We had a jam-packed hour. Coming up, a major arrest of illegals in Massachusetts. More than 50 illegal immigrants busted in a multi-day swift (ph) in New England. Look at this. Three of them wanted for murder.</p><p>But first, it's the testimony we have been waiting for. Tomorrow, former FBI Director James Comey, he is going to get a Capitol Hill grilling behind closed doors. But how will the media report on that? That's next. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. Tomorrow, House Republicans will finally get their chance to grill former FBI Director James Comey behind closed doors about his actions and anti-Trump bias infecting the top levels of the FBI during the election. Again, behind closed doors. The transcript will be made public within 24 hours of that sessions. Joe Concha is a media reporter for The Hill. He joins us now. So how are they going to report on it? What do you think, Joe?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL: Well, if it's going to be made public in 24 hours, then I would imagine something because nothing gets slip (ph) in Washington. Everything gets slip (ph) in Washington. Within an hour, somebody is going to have to use the bathroom, there will be a call from some reporter and then you're going to hear about it. But at least everything is going to be out in 24 hours, sometimes that doesn't happen.</p><p>I think they got the wrong guy here, Liz. I want to know why Rod Rosenstein isn't being called before Congress. He is the guy just nine weeks ago who said, yeah, you know, I think I'll wear a wire and try to trap the president, try to get him on tape to compel his cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment. I would have had him on there instead.</p><p>But, OK, we have Comey. Here's the thing about Comey. He's an open book. Literally he's an open book. He wrote a book in April. He did a thousand interviews after that. I might be exaggerating. Most probably dozens and dozens. So everything seems to be out there already, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: I hear what you're saying because -- let's be clear. This is about Trump-hating, pro-Hillary FBI director and there are talks about stopping Trump, impeaching Trump. Really the issue is that FISA warrant to basically surveil Trump campaign aides because it looks like they really did break the regulations in getting that FISA warrant, right?</p><p>CONCHA: It appears that way. Absolutely. So, but I wonder, Comey who is a very good public speaker, we could agree on that, when he's done his testimonies, it has been the type of thing where he seems to be pretty measured in his responses. He is ready for whatever question --</p><p>MACDONALD: He has got to answer. Did you tell the FISA court that it was funded by the Democrats, partly, you even said it was unverified on salacious. Did you know at the time that it was unverified? Did you tell the court that, right?</p><p>CONCHA: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: You got to get that out of him.</p><p>CONCHA: And if so, why? Was it because --</p><p>MACDONALD: Why you --</p><p>CONCHA: -- the president.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yeah.</p><p>CONCHA: Right, exactly. Why didn't you pursue going down this particular route? I also want to know why he leaked a private conversation or conversations that he had with the president over dinner at the White House, then leaked everything he talked about to a friend at Columbia University, who then gave it too The New York Times, and he admits for the sole purpose of compelling a special counsel to be appointed, and it happened. How is that not illegal?</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. We want -- can we have you back on to talk about it?</p><p>CONCHA: Absotively (ph).</p><p>MACDONALD: Absotively (ph). Joe Concha. That's great. Good to see you, sir. Coming up, we are going to get to that ICE arrest. More than 50 illegals including three wanted for murder in sanctuary city friendly New England. We're going to have Tammy Bruce back on that. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. ICE arresting more than 50 illegal immigrants over the past two days. It happened across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Connecticut. Among those arrested, three immigrants, illegals from Brazil, wanted there for murder.</p><p>The ICE raids taking place the very same week that the Massachusetts Republican governor said, you know what, a state judge must temporarily step down after that judge let an undocumented immigrant here basically sneak out a backdoor to avoid ICE agents waiting to take him into custody.</p><p>Tammy Bruce is back with us. First on that story, Tammy, great to have you back.</p><p>BRUCE: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: That illegal that sneaked out (ph) the backdoor had been deported multiple times for multiple drug arrests. And now the judge let him go at the backdoor.</p><p>BRUCE: Yeah. It is interesting. During the court proceedings, the judge called them up to the bench, and the judge asked for the recording to stop. And that is when suddenly when that went back on and they resumed, there was suddenly some machinations there to have the charges dropped.</p><p>And then somehow, the defense attorney was able to walk the defendant out through a side door back through which would not have been allowed without it being facilitated and being able to avoid as there was also (ph) ICE agents.</p><p>Some judges and immigration advocates of course don't want ICE agents to be able to go into courthouses. They have argued that they have to stay outside and that seems to be changing a little bit. There is argument about that. This is one of the reasons why they want that to be able to be in the courthouses to deal with this kind of stuff.</p><p>MACDONALD: What a story. And we have seen another courts.</p><p>BRUCE: Yes, this judge, understandably, they think the judge should not be hearing any federal cases because if you are really obstructing law enforcement, why should you be on the bench? I mean, as a judge, you are supposed to be implementing the laws.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right.</p><p>BRUCE: And adjudicating them as opposed to helping a defendant sneak out to get away from federal law enforcement. That's crazy.</p><p>MACDONALD: She hears criminal cases. Are you going to let other criminals go?</p><p>BRUCE: Right. No matter -- look, they are human beings. We all have opinions on the issues. But if you're willing to skirt the law and allow someone else to do so, what else are you doing that is not fair?</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's get to the swifts (ph) in New England. The 50 arrested illegal immigrants selling opioids. You have been talking about that.</p><p>BRUCE: Oh, yeah. This is our prior discussion. This is the big deal. Trafficking in heroin. Trafficking in fentanyl. These are not drug users, these are traffickers. And so this is where -- it is also a reminder to people what ICE does. This is inside the country. It's the internal framework.</p><p>They do not handle the border. They deal with criminals, the gangs, the drug traffickers, sex traffickers, kidnappers, murderers, getting these three Brazilians who are wanted for murder in that country, that's what ICE does.</p><p>This is the organization that many Democrats want to abolish. That would be a mistake because the people that are targeted and affected first and victimized first are the communities of immigrants.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right, that's a point.</p><p>BRUCE: This is who we are trying to protect here.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right. But, you know, here is the other point about the story. Several towns in Massachusetts here, they're sanctuary cities. It's Boston, Cambridge, Lawrence and Newton. These are the cities where these individuals have been detained.</p><p>BRUCE: That's right. So the people that were scooped up had been in custody. And then were released. Again, you think, well, was this somebody who was driving under the influence or somebody who made a mistake? No, these are drug traffickers. These are very serious individuals.</p><p>MACDONALD: But the victims of the crimes are treated like rounding errors in D.C. There is not a human being behind it that is treated --</p><p>BRUCE: Big government, whether it is about health care or even law enforcement. When people become the budget and you become a chit on a piece of paper, you stop being a human being. This is why local law enforcement matters. You know, judges matter.</p><p>They are supposed to see the individuals and yet they claim it is because they are sensitive to immigrants, but this kind of action re-victimizes immigrants. Legal immigrants who are playing by the rules and even undocumented people who are also playing by the rules. Those are the people that are protected by ICE.</p><p>MACDONALD: Great stuff again from Tammy Bruce. You're going to come back soon.</p><p>BRUCE: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: I'll look forward to it. Thank you so much for having us in your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on the Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSKRWD-2018120601cb233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RSKRWD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TX3-7KF1-JB20-G1RM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7482\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Evening Edit (formerly Risk &amp;

It  was down nearly 800 points, and then down about 80 points, doing a major  rethink after the initial freak out, panicked attack over the arrest that  U.S. request in Canada of the CFO of Huawei, that's China's top tech giant. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That CFO, the daughter of Huawei's founder, a former Chinese military  officer. She's arrested on charges that Huawei broke U.S. sanctions by  selling U.S. technology to Iran. We've got details on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Wall Streeters now applauding President Trump's tough line in trade  talks with China because China is stealing to make China great again. We've  got fresh new details on that. And it has to stop. </p><p>What's going on we've got an insider who has a front row seat on how China  has hollowed out entire U.S. industries and taken U.S. jobs. And why Trump  is right to fix the problem that elected officials for years have done  nothing about.</p><p>The Dow down 8 percent since its October high. But take a breath for some  perspective. Historically it is normal to have these kinds of downturns. We  bring you what you need to know.</p><p>Plus, tech execs at the White House today on how to beat China and more.  But the real firework is a fight in D.C. over G.M. getting not just loathes  of federal bailout help but state bailout help and tax breaks too, where it  hardly pays any taxes as its closing U.S. factories and laying off  thousands of people before Christmastime, sending those factory jobs to  Mexico. We've got the back story to FBN's exclusive with CEO Mary Barra. </p><p>Also, Democrat in-fighting over border wall funding. Nancy Pelosi now  saying she will not even accept a decent DACA deal in exchange for border  wall funding. People sick and tired of D.C. politics.</p><p>This as we bring you two big border scandals now hurting Americans. </p><p>Well, thank you for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money, politics. We  got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. The  Evening Edit starts right now. </p><p>OK. Let's get to the China outrage over the arrest of Huawei's CFO. They  are now demanding her release accusing the U.S. and Canada of quote,  \"wrongdoing.\" This is over violating Iran sanctions. But Wall Street  analysts point out other countries are saying Huawei is pretty bad. </p><p>Australia, New Zealand, Britain's telecom B.T. all kicked out Huawei over  fears that Huawei is stealing and spying giving its ties to China's  military. And they say President Trump is right. China for years has been  hollowing out U.S. jobs and entire U.S. industries, not funding its own  R&amp;D, but instead, stealing our research to make China great again. </p><p>Our companies pay for that research. China then sells cheaper copycats,  undercutting us. We're talking nuclear power generators, solar cells,  computer hardware, software, and more.</p><p>Let's get to Edward Lawrence in D.C. with more on that Huawei arrest.  Edward? </p><p>EDWARD LAWRENCE, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Liz. And don't forget,  circuit boards. That was a huge thing that Chinese put out. And right now,  the arrest of chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou threatens to destabilize  the fragile trade negotiations that have been going on between the U.S. and  China. </p><p>China calling for Canada to release the Huawei CFO. A spokesperson for the  Chinese foreign ministry says, \"The detention of a person without giving a  clear reason is of course a violation of the human rights to the person, or  of the person.\" </p><p>Now China claims they don't know the reason that she was detained. She is  being investigated by the U.S. for possible violations for breaking the  sanctions related to Iran. Now, the timing of arrest is interesting. She  was being detained in Canada the same day President Donald Trump worked out  a path forward on trade talks with China. </p><p>The national security advisor John Bolton told NPR that he was made aware  of the arrest and that it would happen. The White House, though, telling us  that the president did not know about it before he met with President Xi.  Regardless, some senators applauding the U.S. for sticking to its morals.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. MARK WARNER, (D) VIRGINIA:  My fear is when the Trump administration  is going to crumble on Huawei the same way they crumbled on ZTE. And as we  think about particularly we move to the next generation of wireless 5G and  that transformation is as big as anything that we've seen in the wireless  industry. And my fear is that China could be successful at setting the  standards and dominating that market.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAWRENCE:  And national security advisor John Bolton also told NPR that  this is a Justice Department matter and they don't always tell the  president what they are doing. Liz?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Great to see you, Edward. Thank you so much.</p><p>Joining me now is Zach Mottl, he is a top executive at Atlas Tool Works.  This is a company that has had a front row seat for years watching China's  high-tech theft. We welcome you to the show, sir. Thank you so much. </p><p>ZACH MOTTL, CHIEF ALIGNMENT OFFICER, ATLAS TOOL WORKS:  Great to be here,  Elizabeth.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. Your company makes precision parts for the internet, radar  systems, medical devices. What do you guys seeing, is President Trump right  about China stealing to make China great again. </p><p>MOTTL:  He's absolutely right. You know, Huawei has built a $90 billion  global enterprise based on commercial espionage, theft of western  technology. You know, my customers are offered -- my business has been  around for 100 years, and for 90 out of the 100 years we were a vendor in  the telecom industry. That was a really important sector for myself and  many other manufacturers like me.</p><p>And we watched as Chinese manufacturers Huawei ZTE came online, and in 20  years they wiped out every single western competitor. Lucent Technologies,  Tellabs, Nortel Networks in Canada. Every one of these companies could not  compete against commercial espionage and state subsidized technology.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Because they're undercutting us taking our jobs, our R&amp;D that  we pay for and then making cheaper copycats. Sir, isn't this a big wake-up  call to Congress to say, you know a what, knock it off about the media  grandstanding before, you know, the D.C. cameras and get on the stick.  Because China has a built-in road project that made in China 2025 project.</p><p>I mean, Obama, President Obama did try to stop China, but it's really up to  Congress to get our trade laws updated to knock it, to get it to knock it  off, right?</p><p>MOTTL:  That's right. This telecom industry was the crown jewel of America  and it portray laws and lack of oversight by Congress has allow the Chinese  to steal this. Let's not lose one more high-tech industry. And quite  frankly, let's bring the telephone manufacturing industry back here. </p><p>We're about to have 5G, and you know, we can worry about the security or we  can simply make it here and know that it's good. Because what we've learned  with this Huawei case and so many other cases, is that we just can't trust  the Chinese. They say one thing, but they do something completely  different. So, I'm hoping Congress will step up to the plate here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We hope so too, because this is got to stop, sir. I mean, this  should be hair on fire and break the glass time right now in D.C.</p><p>MOTTL:  That's right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Because to your point, we just cited these other countries  worried about Huawei. Also, you mentioned 5G. China is embedding itself and  the fears it's going to go into that new 5G rollout worldwide. That's the  internet of things. That's wearable fitness trackers. It's robots, taxis  and the like. </p><p>I mean, if China gets to jump on that and starts embedding itself in 5G,  wow, game over.</p><p>MOTTL:  That's right. And they're counting on, you know, they're taking  advantage of the free market. They are going to undercut price and they are  going to subsidize it to try to buy the market. We cannot let that happen.  We need to put laws in place and we need our other country partners to work  with us to shut them out of the market. Because again, we just cannot trust  them. And when they say they are not spying I certainly think they are.</p><p>MACDONALD:  All this breathtakingly tedious grandstanding in D.C. over it,  and they are setting aside what really matters and that's what you're  talking about. Because, sir, look what happened to U.S. Steel. U.S. Steel  spent tons of money to pioneer a new lighter, higher grade steel product  for cars and planes, but then China hacked it and hacked its computers,  stole the blueprints and started selling copycats steel at way cheaper  prices, right?</p><p>MOTTL:  When profit doesn't matter to these companies and they have a  government behind them helping them cheat and steal, how can we compete? We  need to do it smarter. And what it comes down to is jobs. It's not just  about high-tech and innovation. It's about jobs. It's about national  security. </p><p>And the employees like mine, you know, when I lost my telecom customers in  the early 2000, we have to lay people off. We reinvented ourselves, but a  lot of other companies couldn't. Telecom and so many other sectors are  really important. We're talking about good jobs for Americans versus growth  and good jobs for people in China. I want to see it made here and I want to  see it secure and safe so we can trust what's going through our network.</p><p>MACDONALD:  And now, we got indications that China made in behind that  massive Marriott hack affecting half a billion people potentially. Wow.</p><p>MOTTL:  It's pervasive. It is pervasive and everything that they do they  just simply play by a different set of rules, so they can tell us one thing  but we know they are going to do something else. We can't trust them. </p><p>So, I'm pleased to see President Trump, you know, holding firm. I trust his  judgment here and I hope that Congress is going to come along and finally  join the wise party because they are really missing the boat by not  protecting America and our information.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, you know what, you know, if Congress doesn't it, the  voter could and probably will. Zach Mottl of Atlas Tool Works, thanks for  coming in. We'd like you to come on again soon, sir. </p><p>MOTTL:  We'll see you soon, Elizabeth. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Good to see you. Let's get Ned Ryun's reaction. Ned Ryun is one  of the top analysts out there, he's been watching D.C. Ned, I want your  reaction to the conversation we just had.</p><p>NED RYUN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, AMERICAN MAJORITY:  Well, I got to tell you, I  mean, initially, when you have a clip of Senator Warren saying -- Warner  saying about the fifth-generation 5G networks and Huawei, I mean, that's  one of things. </p><p>I wrote about this for Fox News during the week of Thanksgiving, Liz, in  which I said we have to be very careful because there is a proxy battle  being fought right now between United States and China between QUALCOMM and  Huawei over who's going to control that 5G network, and you are right. </p><p>The implications for the internet of things, right now there is about eight  billion internet of things devices. That number is probably going to triple  in the next three years. And who's going to control the networks and the  data is going to be massive as we move forward into the future.</p><p>And on the other front, you're right. I mean, they have been robbing us  blind. We have helped build the largest authoritarian police state in China  with really bad trade deals, and now we have looked the other way as they  literally over the last probably 10 years, Liz, I've seen estimates about  three trillion are in technology theft and between theft and force  technology transfers that we basically incentivize and given them the means  to compete with us on the technology front, but also on the economic front  and they're not shy about it. </p><p>They are gunning for us. They want to replace us as the center of the  economic world. And right now, for in the past, we've been lightening them  get away with it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know what, there's that and there's also this other  geopolitical risk that the White House is trying to address as well, Ned.  Look at this. New satellite images reveal activity and an unidentified  North Korean missile base. </p><p>So that's also a neck of the woods. What's you take on that?</p><p>RYUN:  Well, my take on this, is again, this has been the failure of the  three previous administrations kicking the can down the road of refusing to  actually deal with the North Korean threat. And now Trump has been  confronted with it. He realizes we cannot have this existential threat with  North Korea having nuclear armaments and being able to literally at some  point in the not-too-distant future have the ability to drop warheads on  American cities. </p><p>The key to this, though, Liz, and it's all, again, like you said, it's all  interconnected. We actually need China to play ball with us on North Korea  to deal with this threat. And so, this whole trade dispute taking place  with China, all of this stuff is interconnected. We have to figure out how  to see China accommodate our interest in real life. They've got to  prioritize our interest.</p><p>And so, this whole trade deal is not only tied to bad trade deals and  intellectual theft. It's also tied to how we deal with North Korea as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yes. And to your point, China's military has been boosting the  number of warplane intrusions into South Korea airspace, nearly doubling  the number of times in recent years. Your take on that.</p><p>RYUN:  Well, I mean, China, the amazing part to me is how brash China is  and we're acting, we are letting them get away with this. They have been  waging this economic war. They've been threatening us. They've been doing  building these islands in the South China Seas and we've just been sitting  there as though, we, you know, we don't know what they're up to. We know  exactly what they are up to. And I think it's time. </p><p>Obviously, if we can really deal this economic trade and put them on notice  I think we can start to deal with some of these military threats as well. </p><p>Trump is right to do this and I know that some people are worried about  this tariff fight. I will say this, Liz. If we do not confront China now in  the next few years, I'm convinced we will regret it for the next hundred  years. Because China does not want trade partners. China wants tributary  nations. And if we are not careful, if we deal with this trade threat and  these bad trade deals and this theft of our intellectual property we're not  going to like where we're at in 10 or 15 years.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, you make a great point there. Let's move over to  what's going on in Russia, Ned. I'd like your reaction to Russia doing some  saber rattling, showing off new laser weapons after the U.S. is threatening  to pull out of missile, that missile treaty dating back to the 80s because  of Russia cheating. What's your take on that?</p><p>RYUN:  I go back to, you know, despite all the left screaming buddy  murderer about Trump being too cozy with Putin, he is actually been pretty  aggressive with him, especially on the energy front. Over 50 percent of  Russia's, the Russian governments income comes from oil and gas exports.  And Trump knows what he's doing on this front.</p><p>Obviously, he confronted Merkel on Nord Stream II and Russia importing even  more natural gas to Germany, and Trump said you can't do that. He's also  gone in and address a lot of the middle and eastern and European countries  and the three C's initiative in which he is trying to get them off of  Russian energy. </p><p>Because he realizes, Trump realizes if you can cut off Russian exports in  these energy areas of gas and oil, he's going to undermine all this other  stuff that's taking place. So, he's focused on the right things. He has to  cut off the Europeans from getting or being wholly dependent or  significantly dependent on Russian energy. And if he can do that, I think  he's going to really be able to put Putin in his place.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Thank you, Ned Ryun. Great to see you. Come back soon.</p><p>RYUN:  Thanks, Liz. We'll do.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Next case, this morning 1000 friends and family attended the  funeral service at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston to say a final  farewell to President George H.W. Bush.</p><p>In attendance, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris, baseball legends Nolan  Ryan, and Tommy Lasorda. And also, country singers Crystal Gayle and Larry  Gatlin. The funeral train carry the casket of our 41st president a short  time ago to the presidential library at Texas A&amp;M University. </p><p>The president was laid to rest alongside his wife Barbara.</p><p>We're going to be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. tech execs from Google, Microsoft, and Oracle met  today at the White House with Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Larry Kudlow and  others to talk about securing U.S. manufacturing dominance, and artificial  intelligence, quantum computing, and more. Facebook executives not  attending.</p><p>But to the real fireworks. The fight in D.C. with G.M. G.M. CEO Mary Barra  met again today with lawmakers. They are pretty upset over G.M.'s big tax  breaks in the face of G.M. plants -- plans to shut factories and lay off  14,000 workers.</p><p>Look at this. FiatChrysler, though, plans to open a new factory in  Detroit.</p><p>Let's bring in Republican Ohio Congressman Warren Davidson. Good to see  you, sir. </p><p>REP. WARREN DAVIDSON, (R) OHIO:  Good to talk with you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, people are upset that G.M. keeps coming all the time  with tin cap in hand getting a lot of federal bailout help, and wait for  it, a lot of state tax breaks and bailout help too. And you know, Ohio gave  G.M. a ton of tax breaks, but now that factories are closing. What's your  take on this?</p><p>DAVIDSON:  You know, it's truly disappointing. And I've been in Congress  now for about two and half years, but prior to that, for the previous 15  years I was in manufacturing. So, when you talk the intersection of big  tech and automotive, they're really more interconnected than you would  imagine. </p><p>So, when Mary Barra came and talked with the Ohio delegation, she really  led with the transformation that the auto industry is confronting. And you  know, one of the points that I wanted to make is, you know, the good news  is, is unlike in '08, '09 when this was happening, Ohio strong and growing.  G.M. is anomaly our states hiring. </p><p>I offered to drive our economic development folks up to do a job fair at  the plant. So, G.M. is offering those folks jobs I'm sure the eighth  district would be happy to have them.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. But here's the thing. We've been watching and I've been  watching G.M. for years. I've been doing business journalism for three  decades. I was at the Wall Street Journal. I was an editor at Forbes. I've  been writing about G.M. for a long time, sir. </p><p>Here's the problem. Here's one of the issues. Ohio in 2008 gave state  income tax breaks to G.M., saying you don't have to pay 75 percent of your  income taxes to the state of Ohio over the next 15 years. </p><p>So, here's the thing. Should elected officials say once and for all, OK,  we'll give you, Mr. car company or Mr. G.M., a tax break, with the caveat  that you have to show us how you will build factories that you can retool  to make -- to make either smaller or bigger vehicles when gas prices go up  or down. Other car companies do that, why can't G.M.?</p><p>DAVIDSON:  Well, the good news is Honda's been doing that. They reinvested,  the Honda Accord wasn't selling as well as they thought. The CRV is selling  way better, I think two-thirds of the cars on the road that are in demand  right now our crossovers, SUVs or trucks. And Honda who is a huge anchor  for Ohio has been very adaptive. </p><p>G.M. not quite as flexible. There's a lot of history behind that. And you  know, frankly, some of the things were the government has been involved  that shows frankly, the government should be not try to run these  companies. We don't need more central planning.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Got that. Check that. Understood. I hear totally what you're  saying. I don't mean to interrupt. But that is agreed upon. We don't want  that. We don't want the government in there. But G.M. does really rapidly  come with a tin cap getting our tax help.</p><p>I mean, it's striking, sir, that we're -- that, you know, that FiatChrysler is now opening a factory in Detroit. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Yes. I mean, that's great. And you know, we'll see where that  goes for G.M. You know, I think they've been outperformed by a number of  companies that's why they have to come hot in hand and begging for help.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Well, that's been going on for decades.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'm telling you that's been going on for decades. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. Not to mention the subsidies that are going on to  try to steer consumers to buy this car or that car.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  And the areas (Ph) of government shouldn't be trying to steer  that. And the good news for G.M. is maybe they finally got the message as,  you are not going to get any more bailouts. The American people don't want  to bail you out nor anyone else, and so you are going to have to take care  of your balance sheet and do the right things.</p><p>So, I was impressed that Mary Barra came and was proactively speaking to us  on the hill. But yes, very sad news about the investment in Lordstown,  Ohio, in particular.</p><p>MACDONALD:  But you know what, but what about putting the feet to the fire.  I understand. I watch Mary Barra. We have a lot of respect for her. She is  a great CEO. But listen closely to what she says, OK. A lot of that is a  lot of P.R. talk. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You got to get to the nuts and bolts. Is she going to move jobs  to other factories in the U.S.? And you know, is she going to stop  outsourcing to Mexico? We understand the economics of it, but we also  understand the economics of giving out tax breaks when you're not, you  know, building factories that are flexible, right? Final word.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  Absolutely. And when you look at where the intellectual property  and the tech is, the good news is a lot of that happened in the U.S. and  when you tie that to what you're talking about earlier is the tech folks  coming to the White House. </p><p>The Foreign Investment Risk Reduction Modernization Act, that was one of  the biggest piece of registration that the House financial services  committee move this past year. It was an honor to work on it. Really our  country is going to be more secure, our country is going to be stronger. </p><p>And frankly, if we can complement that with a good reform to privacy so  that we can make sure that whether it's on the internet or in your car or  in app that you download on the phone it's always your data as a consumer.  And I was impressed that was one of the questions I put to Mary is that it  is an opt in practice for G.M. in the car.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>DAVIDSON:  And so, I hope we can do that more and I hope that they'll see  that the competitive advantage in the United States means they should  continue to invest including in Ohio. We have a tremendous supply chain and  folks are happy to supply them.</p><p>MACDONALD:  There's great people in Ohio. Great people in Michigan, great  people in the heartland. Congressman Warren Davidson, thank you so much. We  really appreciate it. </p><p>DAVIDSON:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to other headline news. Search and rescue efforts  still underway after two U.S. military planes collided in midair and crash  off the coast of Japan overnight. It happened during a refueling exercise.  One marine killed, another in fair condition. </p><p>However, five marines still missing. Our thoughts and prayers are with the  families there.</p><p>A Southwest Airlines flight get it off the runway upon landing in heavy  rain at Burbank Airport in California. There were no reported injuries.  Among the 117 passengers, they were evacuated using emergency slides.  That's pretty scary stuff.</p><p>And drug company, it's called Tris Pharma, now recalling some of its  children's Ibuprofen after it was notified about overly high concentrations  of that drug that can affect a child's kidneys. This brand was sold under  private label brands at CVS, Wal-Mart and Family Dollar. Check those labels  there.</p><p>Now to the border wall. Brand new analysis on how it saves thousands of  lives. We've got one of the best columnists and thinkers out there. Tammy  Bruce is coming up.</p><p>But first, Congress kicked of the can down the road again. Another  temporary spending budget. What are we sending them to D.C. for? It means  you may see a government shut down by just in time for Christmas. We're  going to tell you what they're fighting about now and why this is the best  case for term limits. We're at the bottom of the hour. Stay there. Back in  two.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. You're watching the Fox Business Network. To  government spending, again, Congress passing a temporary interim spending  bill today that is going to let the government be funded for two more  weeks, really is just kicking the can down the road again. Congress will  have to vote on this again before midnight on December 21st.</p><p>Joining me now, Trump 2020 campaign advisory board member Madison Gesiotto  and Democrat strategist Al Mottur. I know you guys love talking about this.  Madison, look at this, from Pew Research, you're not going to believe it.  Congress has only managed to pass all required appropriations measures on  time, wait for it, just four times since fiscal 1977. Is this an argument  for term limits. I mean, what do we send them into D.C. to do?</p><p>MADISON GESIOTTO, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN ADVISORY BOARD MEMBER, NATIONAL  DIVERSITY COALITION FOR TRUMP:  It's one of the many arguments for term  limits. I mean, Congress seems repeatedly every single year do not be able  to do their job. I remember last Christmas, we talked about the same thing.</p><p>Every single year, they are never meeting the requirements, they are never  doing their job. It's such a shame that we continue to have to talk about  this. For over 20 years, they haven't met the requirements. So those four  times between 1977 and 1997, it's frustrating.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. So here's the thing, Al. This is what I'm wondering if we  should do. You know what, Congress, it's sort of like telling your children  to go to their room until you get the job done. We're going to sequester  you in D.C., no grandstanding for the cameras, no campaigning, no political  rallies, no fundraising, you got to be quarantined in D.C. and get a  spending bill on time. How about that?</p><p>AL MOTTUR, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Hey, we might as well try it. I mean,  look, you're on to something when you say no campaigning, no fundraising.  The politics have taken over the dynamic in the Congress and there is way  too much time spent on the phone dialing for dollars and don't have enough  time doing work for the American people. That's on both sides of the aisle.  There's got to be a way to stop it. Maybe term limits is part of the  answer. I think campaign finance reform is another.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, Pelosi now says she won't accept a pretty decent DACA  deal in exchange for border wall funding. That's what it has come down to  right now. What do you think?</p><p>GESIOTTO:  I think what's frustrating about what she is doing is the fact  that she is unwilling to compromise. I mean, when we look at Congress and  the idea of why we have two parties and why we have Democrats and  Republicans in Congress work together is because they need to compromise to  get to the end solution.</p><p>Sometimes, you are going to have to give a little to get a little. The  Republicans have tried to do that on many issues. Of course, they are not  perfect. But the Democrats slightly have really let their hate for our  president overcome their ability to get anything done.</p><p>MOTTUR:  That's not what is going on here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It feels like it's going on. Go ahead, Al. Finish your point.</p><p>MOTTUR:  No, it's not. I mean, the parties for two decades have been unable  to do immigration compromise. I agree we have to compromise. It's not  because --</p><p>MACDONALD:  But they are purposely politicizing the border. That's the  issue. We know that for a fact from internal e-mails --</p><p>MOTTUR:  Both sides are politicizing the border, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  We know for a fact from internal e-mails that Democrat Super  PAC say that's the way to go in order to get that voter. But here's the  thing. Democrats, Al, and you've talked about this too, starting in 2005,  2006 and all the way through 2013, said yeah, to border security. Just get  it done. We have this moment in time after the George H.W. Bush funeral,  that there seems to be some kind of unity. Get it done.</p><p>MOTTUR:  I don't think the president would accept the border wall for a  DACA deal, first of all. And second of all, the president --</p><p>MACDONALD:  We did have one. He had a DACA deal, 1.3 million DACA, to do a  border wall. The Americans want it. They don't our security dealt with like  a political football.</p><p>MOTTUR:  I wish we could compromise on immigration. It's not just right  now. It's not hatred for this president. It has been going on for a long  time.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Should get it done now. Should get it done yesterday. How about  that?</p><p>MOTTUR:  I am for it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Go ahead, Madison.</p><p>GESIOTTO:  You know, Al, you are saying that's simply not true, that the  Democrats are willing to compromise. When you look back 10, 20 years, we  just actually talked about this with Liz last week, the Democrats supported  many of the things that they are now going against when it comes to  immigration.</p><p>So that is your perfect and prime example right there as to why their hate  for our president has changed their views and clouded their judgment when  it comes to the immigration issue specifically.</p><p>MOTTUR:  I don't believe it's about hate to the president. I believe it's  on both sides, Republicans and Democrats --</p><p>GESIOTTO:  Obstruction --</p><p>MOTTUR:  -- pulling the football away.</p><p>GESIOTTO:  We can use any word there.</p><p>MOTTUR:  -- Charlie Brown. And Trump does it too.</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK, Al, maybe we can all move beyond that and just tell D.C.,  your voice, Al, and Madison's voice, and the viewer and the people out  there saying, you know what, we're done with you, D.C., we're over it. It's  sort of like you tell a child to go to your room until you clean it. Get it  done.</p><p>MOTTUR:  Maybe if there were thermal on Madison (ph), I can go up there and  get it done.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know, I'll tell you something. It's just astonishing. I  want your reaction, Al. Congress has managed only four times since fiscal  1977, just four times, to pass all of its required spending measures on  time. Really?</p><p>MOTTUR:  It's ridiculous. They ought to be here more than three days a  week. They ought to be here four, five days a week.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>MOTTUR:  And that would help. Fundraising is a problem. Like I said, term  limits could be part of the solution. But there is no incentive for them to  get this done because there is no punishment.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right, because this is term limits. Madison and Al, thank you  so much. Great fun --</p><p>MOTTUR:  Great to be with you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey will testify  privately behind closed doors on Capitol Hill tomorrow. It will be  transcribed and then released to the public within 24 hours. But how will  the media report on that? Will you get to the truth on what James Comey  said? We're going to break it down.</p><p>But first, why a border wall could save thousands of lives every year?  Tammy Bruce on that. We're going to explain after the break. Back in two.  Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  You know when something is staring right at you and you say  eureka (ph) of course, absolutely. My next guest has that moment for you,  says President Trump's border wall could help save thousands of lives.  Joining me now, Fox News political contributor, Independent Women's Voice  president, great columnist, writer, Tammy Bruce.</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, FOX NEWS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR:  I'm glad you got to check.  Thank you, dear. Look, my column is up today. This is not new. This is not  new news. What was shocking to me was the CDC report that came out about  last week, that noted and obviously should alarm all of us, that the drug  overdose deaths and suicides are at historic highs, right?</p><p>In just 2017, over 72,000 people died from drug overdoses. That is more  than the U.S. deaths in the Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined. In  one year in this country, suicides are at their historic high, about 49,000  suicides also in 2017.</p><p>The CDC doesn't want to speculate, they say, on the cause. But what they do  recognize also is the importation of drugs, the opioid epidemic, people now  moving from prescription drug dynamic because we are at war with that, so  they turn to heroin. And then there is fentanyl which is now the new  synthetic opioid which kills you pretty much right away. It's a tiny, tiny  amount that will kill you.</p><p>We got single individuals bringing into the country, and somebody was  caught just a few weeks ago, bringing over enough that would kill 300  million Americans, and because it takes so little to end up killing you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>BRUCE:  This is at the border. Eighty percent of the fentanyl in this  country comes in through the southern border, and also China is involved in  that facilitation as well.</p><p>MACDONALD:  It's just two milligrams. We just show that stat, 78 million.  That's based on the amount of fentanyl seized at the border last year and  the first quarter of this year. Life expectancy has been dragged down by  what is going on.</p><p>BRUCE:  That is correct, because you got middle aged individuals, right?  You got -- those are the individuals who are dying too early because of the  drug addiction and because of suicide. Look, one thing we know about  suicide is it's usually not one issue. It can be a multitude of issues. But  when you're also dealing with drug addiction, any addiction, certainly  alcoholism, but the opioid addiction creates hopelessness.</p><p>We've dealt with now -- thank goodness in the economic recovery, but the  last 10 years, people losing their homes, losing their savings, losing  their jobs. That combined with drug addiction. And then of course President  Obama, we lost our hospitals and our doctors and any real access to health  care. That we think of course has contributed to the nature of the suicide  choice. So it is  -- that in it of itself, because of the core of the  people affected is dragging down the U.S. life expectancy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Astonishing, that finding. You know, President Trump is saying  China will try to stop the importation of fentanyl into our country. That's  part of the trade deal. But Thomas Homan, to your point, former acting ICE  director, said, you know, having the troops at the border is making the  drug cartels berserk and crazy. He told us that on the show last week.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yeah. You know, he is -- what they have done is, because of the  caravan, we've obviously boosted up the numbers, and the cartels which have  relied on kind of a lax framework are furious because it is affecting their  ability to move the drugs in.</p><p>This is why when we talk about the wall, it is not just about we need an  orderly framework that happens at the border, but we must take seriously  what's going on and how these drugs are moving into the country, when 80  percent of fentanyl is coming in through the southern border.</p><p>And by the way, the majority of heroin as well is not coming from  Afghanistan, it's grown in Mexico. It's cultivated there and moved in  through Mexico. So the wall is something that not only are we dealing with  keeping bad guys out and killers and all of that and human trafficking, but  to stop this.</p><p>When you got three wars of the deaths combined including Vietnam in one  year, how is this not a war? All the American people deserve to be taken  seriously and to have --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Is it Trump's White House capitalizing on this, what you're  talking about?</p><p>BRUCE:  Look, they have got to talk more about the other issues that are  involving the wall and why this matters. People know the opioid crisis and  the prescription drugs, right, OxyContin. We know that there is a heroin  problem. People don't know that people have gone to street drugs when they  can't get a prescription. And where is that coming from? When you think of  heroin, when you think of a poppy fields in Afghanistan --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>BRUCE:  They got to talk more about this. This transcends political  parties, economic status, all of those things. And I wish the president  would speak more about it.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Tammy Bruce, you're going to be with us later in the show.  Great information there. Wow! We had a jam-packed hour. Coming up, a major  arrest of illegals in Massachusetts. More than 50 illegal immigrants busted  in a multi-day swift (ph) in New England. Look at this. Three of them  wanted for murder.</p><p>But first, it's the testimony we have been waiting for. Tomorrow, former  FBI Director James Comey, he is going to get a Capitol Hill grilling behind  closed doors. But how will the media report on that? That's next. Stay  there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. Tomorrow, House Republicans will finally get  their chance to grill former FBI Director James Comey behind closed doors  about his actions and anti-Trump bias infecting the top levels of the FBI  during the election. Again, behind closed doors. The transcript will be  made public within 24 hours of that sessions. Joe Concha is a media  reporter for The Hill. He joins us now. So how are they going to report on  it? What do you think, Joe?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, MEDIA REPORTER, THE HILL:  Well, if it's going to be made  public in 24 hours, then I would imagine something because nothing gets  slip (ph) in Washington. Everything gets slip (ph) in Washington. Within an  hour, somebody is going to have to use the bathroom, there will be a call  from some reporter and then you're going to hear about it. But at least  everything is going to be out in 24 hours, sometimes that doesn't happen.</p><p>I think they got the wrong guy here, Liz. I want to know why Rod Rosenstein  isn't being called before Congress. He is the guy just nine weeks ago who  said, yeah, you know, I think I'll wear a wire and try to trap the  president, try to get him on tape to compel his cabinet to invoke the 25th  Amendment. I would have had him on there instead.</p><p>But, OK, we have Comey. Here's the thing about Comey. He's an open book.  Literally he's an open book. He wrote a book in April. He did a thousand  interviews after that. I might be exaggerating. Most probably dozens and  dozens. So everything seems to be out there already, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I hear what you're saying because -- let's be clear. This is  about Trump-hating, pro-Hillary FBI director and there are talks about  stopping Trump, impeaching Trump. Really the issue is that FISA warrant to  basically surveil Trump campaign aides because it looks like they really  did break the regulations in getting that FISA warrant, right?</p><p>CONCHA:  It appears that way. Absolutely. So, but I wonder, Comey who is a  very good public speaker, we could agree on that, when he's done his  testimonies, it has been the type of thing where he seems to be pretty  measured in his responses. He is ready for whatever question --</p><p>MACDONALD:  He has got to answer. Did you tell the FISA court that it was  funded by the Democrats, partly, you even said it was unverified on  salacious. Did you know at the time that it was unverified? Did you tell  the court that, right?</p><p>CONCHA:  Right.</p><p>MACDONALD:  You got to get that out of him.</p><p>CONCHA:  And if so, why? Was it because --</p><p>MACDONALD:  Why you --</p><p>CONCHA:  -- the president.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Yeah.</p><p>CONCHA:  Right, exactly. Why didn't you pursue going down this particular  route? I also want to know why he leaked a private conversation or  conversations that he had with the president over dinner at the White  House, then leaked everything he talked about to a friend at Columbia  University, who then gave it too The New York Times, and he admits for the  sole purpose of compelling a special counsel to be appointed, and it  happened. How is that not illegal?</p><p>MACDONALD:  OK. We want -- can we have you back on to talk about it?</p><p>CONCHA:  Absotively (ph).</p><p>MACDONALD:  Absotively (ph). Joe Concha. That's great. Good to see you,  sir. Coming up, we are going to get to that ICE arrest. More than 50  illegals including three wanted for murder in sanctuary city friendly New  England. We're going to have Tammy Bruce back on that. Stay there.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MACDONALD:  Welcome back. ICE arresting more than 50 illegal immigrants  over the past two days. It happened across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New  Hampshire, and Connecticut. Among those arrested, three immigrants,  illegals from Brazil, wanted there for murder.</p><p>The ICE raids taking place the very same week that the Massachusetts  Republican governor said, you know what, a state judge must temporarily  step down after that judge let an undocumented immigrant here basically  sneak out a backdoor to avoid ICE agents waiting to take him into custody.</p><p>Tammy Bruce is back with us. First on that story, Tammy, great to have you  back.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  That illegal that sneaked out (ph) the backdoor had been  deported multiple times for multiple drug arrests. And now the judge let  him go at the backdoor.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yeah. It is interesting. During the court proceedings, the judge  called them up to the bench, and the judge asked for the recording to stop.  And that is when suddenly when that went back on and they resumed, there  was suddenly some machinations there to have the charges dropped.</p><p>And then somehow, the defense attorney was able to walk the defendant out  through a side door back through which would not have been allowed without  it being facilitated and being able to avoid as there was also (ph) ICE  agents.</p><p>Some judges and immigration advocates of course don't want ICE agents to be  able to go into courthouses. They have argued that they have to stay  outside and that seems to be changing a little bit. There is argument about  that. This is one of the reasons why they want that to be able to be in the  courthouses to deal with this kind of stuff.</p><p>MACDONALD:  What a story. And we have seen another courts.</p><p>BRUCE:  Yes, this judge, understandably, they think the judge should not be  hearing any federal cases because if you are really obstructing law  enforcement, why should you be on the bench? I mean, as a judge, you are  supposed to be implementing the laws.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right.</p><p>BRUCE:  And adjudicating them as opposed to helping a defendant sneak out  to get away from federal law enforcement. That's crazy.</p><p>MACDONALD:  She hears criminal cases. Are you going to let other criminals  go?</p><p>BRUCE:  Right. No matter -- look, they are human beings. We all have  opinions on the issues. But if you're willing to skirt the law and allow  someone else to do so, what else are you doing that is not fair?</p><p>MACDONALD:  Let's get to the swifts (ph) in New England. The 50 arrested  illegal immigrants selling opioids. You have been talking about that.</p><p>BRUCE:  Oh, yeah. This is our prior discussion. This is the big deal.  Trafficking in heroin. Trafficking in fentanyl. These are not drug users,  these are traffickers. And so this is where -- it is also a reminder to  people what ICE does. This is inside the country. It's the internal  framework.</p><p>They do not handle the border. They deal with criminals, the gangs, the  drug traffickers, sex traffickers, kidnappers, murderers, getting these  three Brazilians who are wanted for murder in that country, that's what ICE  does.</p><p>This is the organization that many Democrats want to abolish. That would be  a mistake because the people that are targeted and affected first and  victimized first are the communities of immigrants.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right, that's a point.</p><p>BRUCE:  This is who we are trying to protect here.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Right. But, you know, here is the other point about the story.  Several towns in Massachusetts here, they're sanctuary cities. It's Boston,  Cambridge, Lawrence and Newton. These are the cities where these  individuals have been detained.</p><p>BRUCE:  That's right. So the people that were scooped up had been in  custody. And then were released. Again, you think, well, was this somebody  who was driving under the influence or somebody who made a mistake? No,  these are drug traffickers. These are very serious individuals.</p><p>MACDONALD:  But the victims of the crimes are treated like rounding errors  in D.C. There is not a human being behind it that is treated --</p><p>BRUCE:  Big government, whether it is about health care or even law  enforcement. When people become the budget and you become a chit on a piece  of paper, you stop being a human being. This is why local law enforcement  matters. You know, judges matter.</p><p>They are supposed to see the individuals and yet they claim it is because  they are sensitive to immigrants, but this kind of action re-victimizes  immigrants. Legal immigrants who are playing by the rules and even  undocumented people who are also playing by the rules. Those are the people  that are protected by ICE.</p><p>MACDONALD:  Great stuff again from Tammy Bruce. You're going to come back  soon.</p><p>BRUCE:  Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD:  I'll look forward to it. Thank you so much for having us in  your homes and thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on the  Fox Business Network. Have a good night.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Joining the conversation, Divine Asset Management CEO and founder Danielle Hughes is here. Benchmark managing partner Kevin Kelly is here. And \"The Wall Street Journal's\" wealth management reporter, the host of the \"Secret of Wealthy Women\" podcast, Veronica Dagher.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, WEALTH MANAGEMENT REPORTER, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Great to be here.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: Great to be here.</p><p>I've got -- we've got the update too. Mark Cuban's, you know, Mavericks lost to the Knicks last night. So --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know that. I know that.</p><p>KELLY: I was laughing and he's like, I'm coming back. We're getting the revenge game.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: And, yes, he didn't do it. So.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was close, though.</p><p>KELLY: It was at half.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I looked at the score in the middle of the night just to check it, and it was like just a point between them and then it went.</p><p>KELLY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The Knicks won. Mavericks down. So I'm sure Mark Cuban has a lot to say about it this morning.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. Yes, that was tough.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got a lot to talk about this morning.</p><p>Our top story this morning is the China trade story. Optimism this morning driving markets this morning. Take a look. S&amp;P and the Dow Industrials up on this news that perhaps a deal is, in fact, close. A phase one deal. But there's a lot of debate about that, I just want to say, because, you know, the Chinese yesterday were baulking at buying agriculture and, of course, the U.S. side does not want to take away any tariff increases that are planned in December. Having said that, Larry Kudlow said that they are close. The president is looking at it.</p><p>The S&amp;P, yesterday, hit record territory. White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow says the phase one trade talks are in the final stages, but that President Trump is not quite ready to sign it yet.</p><p>One reason is because the Chinese do not want to agree to a mechanism that actually has consequences if they steel intellectual property.</p><p>Markets are awaiting key economic data this morning. We've got October retail sales coming out in about two and a half hours.</p><p>Danielle, you think we will see a China deal getting done?</p><p>DANIELLE HUGHES, CEO, DIVINE ASSET MANAGEMENT: I think that the market loves being on the edge of its seat about the China deal every single day. I do think that we should get phase one done. I don't know when that's going to happen . I think that, you know, there is a chance that the market sells off on that news. Almost like the rumor -- you know, buy the rumor, sell the news. But I do think that it would be good specifically the manufacturing segment of America, which has really been hurt by the tariffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, the Chinese are not making this easy, Kevin. I mean yesterday I was talking to somebody who knows about this deal and he was saying to me that, look, they keep pushing back on so much. They don't want to have a mechanism that is an enforcement mechanism should they steel intellectual property. They're balling an the forced transfer of technology.</p><p>KELLY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And, of course, they don't want any tariffs in place, and the president is not going to do that. The president has these tariffs in place. He's expecting to raise tariffs on December 15th. And yet maybe we are close, as Larry Kudlow says, but they have to agree to the things that are important to the U.S. side.</p><p>KELLY: You know what's frustrating is that this is the same exact script.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, right.</p><p>KELLY: Last December Larry Kudlow specifically said, hey, we're going to get a trade deal done. We're 95 percent of the way there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And Mnuchin said that as well.</p><p>KELLY: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: Last December. It is the same exact script. The market goes up and then nothing comes away. And I think the most telling points is that the Chinese actually did not buy the soybeans they said they were going to buy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I agree.</p><p>KELLY: Why? Because they want to hit the president hard in the states that he needs to win for the election. The Chinese aren't going to get a deal done, especially when you talk about the enforcement, because they'll sign any deal, but as long as they -- as we can't enforce it, you know, that they -- they won't care. But the problem is, is that they're not going to give up their 2025 plan, their 2035 plan, their 2049 plan and the 2049 plan is we're -- they're the number one military in the world and they can win. So, you know what, for them, they're just trying to wait out this president.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'll tell you, I don't disagree with a lot of what you just said because it just feels like, if they wanted to do a deal, they would have made -- they would have agreed to all of these things. And it does not feel like they want to agree to these things. And now they're baulking about the amount of agriculture they buy? I don't know.</p><p>DAGHER: Right, they won't put a number in writing. So, like, we're going to buy more agriculture, but when you actually put it in a deal, no, we don't want to commit to a specific dollar amount because we want to have flexibility later. Well, that doesn't help our farmers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>DAGHER: We need an idea of what's in store.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Or the whole strategy here is to baulk now and not do it now and then later say, oh, OK, we'll do it, and then come across as if we just got something. Meanwhile, it's the same deal that we've been talking about buying agriculture.</p><p>KELLY: And this goes back -- and this goes back to Iran too because, think about it, they can agree to terms and then complexly enrich as much uranium as they want, right? So the whole idea here is that, you know, we need to enforcement mechanism, and that's the most important part, and they're never going to concede to it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we'll see. We'll see about that.</p><p>I want to talk about capitalism versus socialism with you guys.</p><p>2020 newcomer Deval Patrick already having an answer -- to an questions about his time at private equity firm Bain Capital. The company coming under fire, you might remember, in the 2012 election because then Republican candidate Mitt Romney founded Bain Capital.</p><p>Here's what Patrick said when he was asked about the state of the Democratic Party. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEVAL PATRICK (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I love that the party has moved to the left. I love that we are the party of the woke. I believe that we also have to be the party of the still waking.</p><p>There is a place for private equity in the private economy. There's a place for business in our lives. But there is -- it is also true that capitalism generally has a lot to answer for. That is so (ph). And we need to be able to confront that. And that's exactly the work I've been doing at Bain Capital. But I've done that same work in other business settings before.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Capitalism has a lot to answer to.</p><p>On this program yesterday, I spoke with Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban about the debate capitalism versus socialism. Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK CUBAN, OWNER, DALLAS MAVERICKS: Capitalism's going to win. There's no question about that.</p><p>But, look, I'm never against open discourse. That's what makes this country great, you know, people being able to convey their opinions. Now, I'm not going to agree with all of them. Socialism just doesn't work.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then there's this. Elizabeth Warren, 2020 candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren's capitalizing on her stance against wealth with a new coffee mug and it has a slogan on it, \"Billionaire Tears.\"</p><p>Kevin, this is just rich. She's against capitalism.</p><p>KELLY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: She says, so, OK, I am a capitalist, but she -- she knocks it down at every turn. And then she capitalizes on it.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, exactly. It's the definition of what a cleptocrat (ph) does and that's what she's trying to become. And if we look at the biggest issue that's facing this country is its crony capitalism and it's the government that enables that because they are -- they impose regulations. They also impose taxes. They keep people out of the free market. And that's exactly the problem that we have right now is that the tax code is complex and convoluted and it prohibits businesses from actually operating in the free market.</p><p>So the problem isn't capitalism, it's crony capitalism and it's big government Democrats that want to impose that. And so that's why people are actually talking about socialism today.</p><p>HUGHES: Demonizing billionaires goes exactly against everything that this country, I think, has to offer. It's the American dream. It's the thing that people really want to achieve. And I -- I think that it sells eyeballs though. Everybody wants to look at what you're saying and be all, you know, shocked and afraid and get that mug. But she is absolutely taking advantage of the opportunity that she has.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Yes.</p><p>DAGHER: I hope the money is going to charity. I wonder if it is, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, no, it's going to her campaign.</p><p>DAGHER: It's going to her campaign. Of course it is, yes, for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Right. Yes.</p><p>DAGHER: Right, that's why it's so funny. Yes, you know, since when did wealth become a bad word? That's the point. You know, so many people, they may knock it, but, secretly, they want to --</p><p>KELLY: Well, here's the problem we have. We have a society where it's victimhood. Everyone's a victim. The billionaires didn't earn that. You know, they're -- they're -- that quote/unquote say they're woke.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: But the problem is, is that they're the party of NB (ph). If you risked and took chances, you deserve the rewarded and it's not up to the government to determine how much reward you get if you took that risk.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Exactly.</p><p>KELLY: And that's the problem we have.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to ask you about the anti-trust investigations into big tech this morning. The Google probe reportedly expanding to include the company's search and android business.</p><p>Veronica, this company is in the crosshairs of the government for a number of reasons, not to mention anti-trust, 90 percent market share, also the censoring of conservative conversation.</p><p>Your reaction?</p><p>DAGHER: Not going away any time soon. This company and -- and big tech in general is really a target right now. And I think that's going to stay that way until well into 2020. I think consumers want to see some reform. I'm not sure what kind of regulation they will get. But I think investors are expecting more regulations on these companies because of some of these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I think you're right.</p><p>All right, a quick break. We are just getting started this morning.</p><p>Also on deck this morning, we've got the Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross here on the U.S.-China trade deal. We will find out exactly where we are.</p><p>The chief security officer of Huawei is here, Andy Purdy, on Huawei's FCC national security vote.</p><p>Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton is here on the state of the IPO market and why so many fewer companies are public today than just five or 10 years ago.</p><p>And the president of the Dallas Federal Reserve, Robert Kaplan, on the Fed's outlook on manufacturing and the state of the economic today. Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big three hours coming up.</p><p>We'll slip in a break and then we're looking at the big tech battle. Amazon ready to fight back after the Pentagon awards a huge cloud contract to Microsoft. Details after this.</p><p>And then the fight on the field. Three players ejected after a brutal brawl at last night's Steelers-Browns games. More on the video when we come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>A devastated community gathers for a vigil hours after a deadly high school shooting.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with headlines this morning.</p><p>Chery.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: A frightening day yesterday, Maria. A teenager is accused of killing two people and injuring three more on his birth. The shooting took place at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California. The 16-year-old suspect shot himself in the head. He is now hospitalized, in critical condition. So far there is no known motive to this shooting in California.</p><p>All right, let's switch gear and talks a little Amazon. They've announced that they're going to challenge a $10 billion Pentagon contract awarded to Microsoft. Amazon Web Services has issued this statement. Numerous aspects of the JEDI evaluation process contained clear deficiencies, errors, and unmistakable bias, and it's important that these matters be examined and rectified.</p><p>Well, President Trump, a vocal critic of Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos, has publicly criticized Amazon's fit for the government's business. He actually asked for an investigation of it back in July of this year.</p><p>Well, if you missed it, let's watch it all again, an explosive end to Thursday night football. The Browns-Steelers game erupted into a sidelines clearing brawl.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Beyond words, Joe (ph).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, gosh, that's one of the worst things I've ever seen on a professional sports field.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Unbelievable. Browns defensive lineman Miles Garrett ripped off the helmet of Steelers quarterback, Mason Rudolph, hitting him on the head with it, as you just saw. Garrett almost certainly is facing suspension, along with Pittsburgh center Mike Pouncy, who retaliated, kicking Garrett in the head. The Browns, I'm not even sure it matters, won the game 21-7, Maria.</p><p>I have not seen something this brutal on the football field -- I'm not even sure ever. This was unbelievable last night.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Terrible.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, it really is. And, yes, suspensions are coming. I can tell you that right now.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, but thank goodness he actually didn't hit him with the crown of the helmet.</p><p>CASONE: Right.</p><p>KELLY: And the way that -- the part -- portion of the helmet he hit him, otherwise, I mean, it could have been unbelievably damaging to him.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Definitely.</p><p>DAGHER: Terrible. Nasty.</p><p>KELLY: I mean he should be suspended for the rest of this season irregardless (ph). That's just --</p><p>DAGHER: Yes, that was --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So unprofessional.</p><p>DAGHER: Completely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And just terrible.</p><p>DAGHER: Really.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He could have really -- seriously hurt him.</p><p>How is he, by the way, do we know?</p><p>CASONE: Yes. So -- looks OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is he seriously hurt?</p><p>CASONE: Looks OK. But just, you know, unreal. This is why people get mad at the NFL for things like this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's true.</p><p>DAGHER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It is.</p><p>Thanks, Cheryl.</p><p>A quick break, and then, closer to a deal. The U.S. and China made considerable progress apparently on inking a trade agreement. Why the president is not ready to sign off on it yet.</p><p>Then, day two of the impeachment hearings this morning. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is now accusing the president of bribery.</p><p>Stay with us. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>U.S.-China trade optimism this morning moving markets. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow saying last night that President Trump, quote, likes what he sees but is not ready to sign off on a deal just yet. This after reports that proceedings had hit a snag over farm purchases, that the Chinese were pushing back, they did not want to buy all the agricultural products that the president has said the Chinese would buy.</p><p>Joining us right now is the founder of the Atlas Organization and he is author of the new book \"China's Vision of Victory,\" Jonathan Ward.</p><p>And, Jonathan, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining me.</p><p>JONATHAN D.T. WARD, FOUNDER, ATLAS ORGANIZATION: Good morning, Maria. It's good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So first let's talk about a U.S. and China potential partnership. You've written a lot about China. Do you think the U.S. and China will be able to have a partnership together which is equal?</p><p>WARD: No, I think -- I think -- I think that's not going to happen. I mean this is a country the communist party, this regime seeks to replace us as the dominate super power in the world. They've been absolutely clear about that in all kinds of strategic documents. They see themselves as essentially dominating the 21st century. Engagement with the United States for them is a way to get there. I mean taking our technology, having access essentially to the markets of, you know, the whole world that the United States built after the Cold War, they seek to essentially take that over and run it, ultimately.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you -- you wrote this op-ed about this on foxbusiness.com about how America can stay on top amid the trade impasse. You write this, quote, U.S.-China competition is likely to be the highest geopolitical contest in generations. But it is a contest that the United States can win if we focus on the right objectives.</p><p>Tell us more about that, Jonathan.</p><p>WARD: Absolutely. I mean what we need to do is get through the next decade, the 2020s, working on our own productivity, investing in the United States, investing in the industries of the future, in additive manufacturing, in robotics, in all the key technology that are going to come out and make sure that we're building this at home. I mean we can stay ahead of China if we just get our productivity increases to about 2.5 percent per year each year. We can build the next 10 trillion in U.S. GDP, in annual GDP. That's what we should be focused on. And the more that we're distracted by the China market and the sort of integration with China, the less that we're doing at home and also with our allies. I mean the U.S. sort of allied world and democratic world is two-thirds of the global economy. That's where we should be building and investing, not in an adversary that seeks to replace us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So when you hear Larry Kudlow and Steven Mnuchin say, oh we're close and this is really great that the Chinese are going to open up its market so that financial services companies can get a bigger footprint in China so that they can sell to 1.4 billion people, what do you think is -- this is all about? Because I think for far too long CEOs were more interested in getting their products in front of 1.5 billion people than actually protecting their products. You know, a lot of these people who were working on this deal, they want U.S. companies to have the access to sell to the Chinese people. They're not thinking at other things like national security the way you are.</p><p>WARD: Well, they're not thinking long term either. I mean the whole cost of going into the China market is that you're going to lose essentially intellectual property. I mean this is also a country that's actively cyber hacking and, you know, into every American company. We just saw this in the National Association of Manufacturers. You know, they're going into trade industries and into anything they can to get any kind of advantage, whether that's industrial or informational. So going over there, I mean if CEO's are thinking too short term, I mean they really need to be looking out about a decade and asking where their company is going to be, because you're also -- I mean the communist party is producing what they call national champions to essentially go out around the world with stolen American and multinational intellectual property.</p><p>A great example is Micron and (INAUDIBLE). I mean there's, you know, just massive theft of deep R&amp;D and such. So, you know, there are many examples of this. And that's what the China market really is, you're over there, they're taking from you and they're sending it back into global markets, becoming your competitors with the backing of the Chinese state, fulfilling this broader communist party grand strategy of replacing the United States. And it's very dangerous for U.S. companies.</p><p>KELLY: Yes, and, Jonathan, I think you're hitting a very good point here and how are we going to address the state-owned enterprises that are actually even going out and dumping into those other markets.</p><p>I'll give you a great example. We're going to have Andy Purdy on here later in the show from Huawei. And what does Huawei do, they undercut their rivals by 60 percent. And then the Chinese state-owned banks actually give low financing and cheap financing, where carriers can't resist buying their equipment and then also competitors can't compete.</p><p>WARD: Right. And Huawei is a perfect example of China's sort of national security play. I mean their attempt to sort of dominate undersea cables, 5G, next generation infrastructure, it's going around to geographical areas where the communist party sees its sort of global strategy being built in, you know, the belt and road, the entire sort of Eurasian super continent. They'd like to get Huawei into as much of Europe as possible, if they can't get it to the United States. And, ultimately, they'll have access to everybody's networks. I mean every single --</p><p>KELLY: And how do we prevent that? How do we stop that?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Exactly.</p><p>KELLY: That's the question. It's like how do American companies compete? How do western democracies compete against that? What -- how do we prevent that?</p><p>WARD: Yes, you're going to need free world 5G. I mean we should -- if you can't fund our own, then deal with Nokia and Erickson. I mean we've got to have democratic alternatives. I mean you really need to get the United States, Europe and Japan together thinking about essentially these are the OECD (ph) nations.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WARD: Add India to that. India just walked out of a China-led trade deal for the region, ACEP (ph). India is sitting there right now wanting a trade deal with somebody. I mean that's a big one that we should be working with.</p><p>Do bilaterals if you can't do multilaterals for now. I mean India, Japan, get into, you know, Brexit, as that's happening. I mean give something to the British and start rebuilding the actual free and democratic world that we led China into thinking that China was going to become a responsible stakeholder. That is panned out as completely false. It's never going to happen. So we're going to have to build --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you have to export --</p><p>WARD: Yes, you want a foundation now. So whatever's going on in the negotiations, I mean it may make sense to have this partial or sort of intermediary truce type thing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>WARD: I mean the fact that the Chinese want the tariffs off as some kind of precondition, I mean this is a country -- I mean they're going to lie, they're going to cheat, they're going to steal. I mean they've broken every international agreement they've ever signed up to. That's what Hong Kong's all about. They've broken that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And -- and -- and what do you think about -- what do you think about what's going on? This is -- this is six months now in Hong Kong and now Hong Kong officially falling into recession for the first time in a decade.</p><p>WARD: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the economy shrank by 3.2 percent last quarter, Jonathan. Violent anti-government protests and the U.S.-China trade path (ph) certainly has to have some pressure here on the Chinese, but they're still unwilling to keep the promises that they made in that initial trade deal back in May, which included, you know, having it against the law to steal intellectual property, and -- and -- and other things like forced transfer of technology. They -- I mean, I don't know if they're going to renege on this, but there are -- there are no indications that they're agreeing to -- to any, you know, mechanism to keep them at the table in terms of an enforcement.</p><p>WARD: Yes, they're not going to do that. That's their model. Their model is to steal from us. So that's what you're dealing with and it's why you need leverage. I mean the tariffs are essentially the leverage now. You can get more leverage, I think, by putting in other trading agreements with other partners and start building on towards the future with less dependency on China, but we have to get past this ugly dependency on a communist, you know, totalitarian dictatorship that's committing -- committing, you know, human rights atrocities and Shinjang (ph), you know, challenging the U.S. and all their allies. I mean they're building up a military that's designed to -- to -- for conflict with us. You have to build a foundation now that's about staying ahead of them and making sure they never catch up, because if they do catch up, economically or technologically, all of the big non- negotiable problems in U.S.-China relations only get worse.</p><p>You know, they talk about this now, Maria. It's something called the community of common destiny for mankind.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>WARD: They're basically putting out this idea of what world order looks like with China at the center. I mean if China regains, as they see it, this sort of central position in the world that, you know, they're not putting the concepts together for what the 21st century looks like.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WARD: Which is why they're not negotiating the way we'd like them to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And you --</p><p>WARD: They're very confident that this picture belongs to them.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have to ask yourself -- and the Europeans, you know, they should be asking themselves as well as they hold on to their Huawei equipment, who do we want running the world? Do we the -- do we want a free democracy as the largest super power in the world or do we want communists as the largest super power in the world?</p><p>WARD: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's an important question and we should be -- because that is where they're going.</p><p>Jonathan, it's good to have you this morning.</p><p>And we will check out your op-ed on foxbusiness.com.</p><p>Great to see you this morning, Jonathan.</p><p>WARD: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jonathan Ward joining us, Atlas Organization.</p><p>Stay with us, I'll be speaking with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross about all of this and the chief security officer of Huawei Technologies, Andy Purdy is here in the 7:00 a.m. hour. We will talk more about this.</p><p>First, though, day two of the public impeachment hearings. The ex- ambassador to Ukraine facing a grilling later this morning. What you need to know coming up.</p><p>And then security at the border. We'll introduce you to one company using thermal technology for screenings. Wait till you see this.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: Welcome back. Good Friday morning, everybody. TGIF. Thanks for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Friday, November 15th. Your top stories right now at 6:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>The final stages of phase one, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow says the agreement with China is on the brink of completion, but President Trump is not ready to ink the deal just yet. We are taking a look at exactly where we are here.</p><p>Stocks are climbing on the news. Take a look. Dow futures are up 60 points right now. S&amp;P futures up six and the Nasdaq up 23.</p><p>Yesterday we had another record high for the S&amp;P 500. Take a look. The S&amp;P announced (ph) an all-time high of 3,096, with a gain of just two points. The other major indices were flat. The Dow and the Nasdaq down fractionally.</p><p>European indices this morning are mixed. Take a look. The FT 100 down 43, but the CAC quarante in Paris is up eight and the DAX index in Germany is lower by about a point.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly higher. As you'll see here, the best performer was Korea. The Kospi index up better than 1 percent.</p><p>Cracking down on immigration. The Homeland Security Department deploying new body heat technology to stop trespassers at the southern border. We've got the cameras right here on set. Wait till you see this.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Friday morning, but, first, our top story this half an hour.</p><p>China trade optimism pushing markets higher this morning. As you can see, the Dow Industrials are up 64 points, the S&amp;P 500 adding on to another record high close yesterday. The Dow and the Nasdaq were down fractionally. But as you can see, we've got some -- a firmer tone this morning.</p><p>White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow signaled progress on phase one of the China trade deal, saying that it is in the final stages, but President Trump is not ready to sign off on it.</p><p>Joining us right now is Brandywine Global fixed income portfolio manager Jack McIntyre.</p><p>And, Jack, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks for being here.</p><p>JACK MCINTYRE, FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BRANDYWINE GLOBAL: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How important is a China deal from your standpoint?</p><p>MCINTYRE: So it's important. It's probably more important from a marketing sentiment standpoint. I'm not in the camp that, hey, we get a deal and all of a sudden there's going to be a flood of CapEx, I mean because this -- phase one is the low-hanging fruit. And if we're struggling to get phase one, what does that mean for phase two and phase three. So I really worry about euphoria going into phase one and then reality kind of kicks in.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: Yes, I think one of the biggest things that's impacting the market right now is what's happening in yields. We saw the market sell off all the defensive named, the bond proxies, right? We even had, you know, the fixed income ETF sold off 10 percent. We saw utilities were down 5 percent. Real estate was down 5 percent.</p><p>Where do you think yields are going to go here and are we going to still see this volatility in the rates market because it's happening really episodically?</p><p>MCINTYRE: So, yes, I actually agree, I think we probably will get a little bit more volatility in the context of a range. So I don't see inflation really moving higher. I'm on the same camp with Powell. I think, you know, low inflation means we're going to get a sustainable recovery or expansion. And without inflation, inflation expectations aren't going to be high, so I don't think yields have to be (INAUDIBLE) higher.</p><p>KELLY: Which we saw core inflation yesterday, it came under expectations.</p><p>MCINTYRE: Right. Having said that, though, I don't think it -- I don't think yields are going to go significantly lower without seeing deterioration in the U.S. labor market. So I -- the mindset I have is, you're probably going to earn your coupon from a fixed income standpoint.</p><p>DANIELLE HUGHES, CEO, DIVINE ASSET MANAGEMENT: One of the things that Powell said, Jack, in his comments this week is the debt in the U.S. is growing faster than nominal GDP and ultimately, in the long run, it's not sustainable and our grandkids are going to have to use their tax dollars sustaining the debt.</p><p>What do you think about that?</p><p>MCINTYRE: Yes, I agree, but that's been the story for decades, you know, we've been growing these massive, this debt, running these huge budget deficits. At some point the market are going to send a message, the bond vigilantes are going to say, hey, you guys need to get your act in order. We're not there yet. And I'm not sure what it's going to take. You have to differentiate, you know, where's the debt coming from. It's not in the household sector. So governments, corporations are having a huge amount of debt right now.</p><p>HUGHES: The yield frenzy that's really kind of percolating right now.</p><p>MCINTYRE: And my take is when we have this much debt, it ultimately deflationary. It means that yields can't go significantly higher --</p><p>HUGHES: Right.</p><p>MCINTYRE: Because the cost of servicing that debt gets out of control and then we head into a recession.</p><p>VERONICA DAGHER, WEALTH MANAGEMENT REPORTER, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Some wealthy investors are expecting a big pullback in 2020. I'm wondering what you think of that. As a result, many of those investors are holding a lot more cash.</p><p>So a pullback in sort of risk asset?</p><p>DAGHER: In that market. Yes.</p><p>MCINTYRE: I'm not there yet because I don't -- I just -- I think we're going to have sort of this OK economic backdrop. And I think it's sort of a goldilocks. We're going to get some growth. It's not going to be real strong growth. I think there's probably going to be better growth away from the U.S. and this is where we're kind of contrarian, but I don't think -- I don't see the need for the U.S. equity markets to go under a significant selloff right now.</p><p>DAGHER: Not holding more cash as a result?</p><p>MCINTYRE: No, I think, you know, cash -- cash did well last year. That was the best-performing asset. I don't think that's going to be the case -- it wasn't the case this year and it's not going to be the case next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the chairman yesterday, Fed Chief Jay Powell, was optimistic during day two of his testimony on Capitol Hill. He said rate cuts this year would help offset lingering headwinds, like trade uncertainty. What do you think about that, the trade uncertainty, the CapEx situation where managers started to sit on cash because they're uncertain about what's happening in trade?</p><p>MCINTYRE: Right. So I get my -- a sense that Powell kind of did a little bit of a victory lap. And deservedly so because, hey, the Fed reacted quickly enough, they cut cuts, they -- they're expanding the balance sheet now.</p><p>Again, I don't think, even with the U.S.-China trade deal, that this is going to ignite a wave of CapEx spending because there's still a huge amount of uncertainty. I'm in the camp, this is an economic cold war. Hey, we can move the ball forward, but it's the other issues, phase two and three, the national security issue, the U.S. kind of imposing on China sovereignty issues.</p><p>KELLY: Well, so was -- is it one of the biggest overhangs for American companies is that the strength of the dollar has actually precluded them from competing in the -- on the global scale because it's so expensive that it, you know, we're losing in emerging markets.</p><p>MCINTYRE: So -- and that's a great point and I would advise Powell, yes, things look good, but keep an eye on the dollar because the dollar is the mechanism that lines weak global growth to strong U.S. growth. And if that continues, the dollar is going to appreciate.</p><p>KELLY: Yes.</p><p>MCINTYRE: And that's a tightening of financial conditions. I don't think that's the case. I don't actually expect the U.S. dollar to weaken as that growth sort of in -- outside the U.S. does better than the U.S.</p><p>HUGHES: Right, because the emerging markets have actually -- those central banks have remained and continue to be accommodative. Do you see that -- those markets actually win? They've had a terrible couple of years.</p><p>MCINTYRE: And I -- you're absolutely right, and I actually think that is probably one of the key things to focus on is that globally inflation is low, so that means that it allows central banks and EM to cut rates. The Fed having cut rates opened the door. I think we're at sort of 50 plus central banks cutting rates. So I think that actually is going to help growth. There's a lag effect with that, but that should set a better backdrop for growth in 2020 globally.</p><p>DAGHER: Looking around the world, where do you see more opportunity for investors right now?</p><p>MCINTYRE: So we are skewed more towards the emerging markets. So, from a bond standpoint, those yields are still attractive. Those currencies are very undervalued.</p><p>One of the things that we're watching about -- watching very closely is these -- the protests. We've got to -- because that -- that brings sort of risk into idiosyncratic countries specific as opposed to just sort of U.S.- China trade and the Fed. But, despite that, I still think there's good opportunities in the emerging markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which ones?</p><p>MCINTYRE: So we are still in Mexico, Malaysia. So Latam (ph) has gotten beaten up. I mean you look at Chile, the protests, I think there are opportunities presenting themselves there. We've got to see some type of resolutions on the -- on these protests. But commodity prices have been weak. I expect them to be stable. And I think the commodity producers, which have gotten beaten up significantly, should -- should do OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jack, it's great to have you. Thanks so much.</p><p>MCINTYRE: It's always my pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Jack McIntyre joining us.</p><p>Stay with us, I'll be speaking with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan about the economy in the 8:00 a.m. hour. Don't miss that. He will join us live coming up.</p><p>But, first, tech on the southern border. One company using thermal technology for screenings. More on the ground breaking change coming up.</p><p>Then, 15 minutes of fame over. All three \"Jeopardy\" contestants stumped by this answer. Who they missed coming up.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>The impeachment inquiry hearings entering their second day. today, in a few hours from right now, former Ukrainian Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch will appear on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Fox's Griff Jenkins is live on Capitol Hill this morning with more.</p><p>Griff, good morning to you.</p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>Day two. History in the making. Only one witness, Yovanovich. And we expect her to talk about what she said in her closed door hearings, that she felt, quote, threatened by President Trump and that she believes that the president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, was waging a smear campaign against her. We find out that she cried. She was very emotional during that closed-door deposition and so perhaps Democrats hope she will be emotional as well today while the whole country is watching. We believe that Republicans are interested in really asking about the timeline because Yovanovitch was recalled in May and yet, of course, we know that famous call between President Trump and President Zelensky wasn't until July 25th.</p><p>If you look at sort of how this is going to unfold at 9:00 a.m., they'll gavel in. There will be opening statements swearing in. And then, like we saw on Wednesday, the majority gets 45 minutes of questions, minority gets 45 minutes of questions, and then there's a five-minute round for each member. There's 13 Democrats, 9 Republicans on the committee.</p><p>Meanwhile, Speaker Pelosi changing her language towards what she believes President Trump has done, calling it bribery and even comparing it to Watergate.</p><p>Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): To bribe is to grant or withhold military assistance in return for a public statement of a -- of a fake investigation into the elections.</p><p>The cover-up makes what Nixon did look almost small.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JENKINS: And, Maria, there's also one other thing happening here, another closed-door depositions, this of David Holmes, who is a staffer, an aid to Ambassador Bill Taylor, who we learned on Wednesday apparently Holmes overheard the president speaking with Ambassador Sondland and believes that that was a conversation about the president's interest in investigations into Biden. Perhaps we'll find out more.</p><p>But we're not done today, Maria. We have eight -- eight more witnesses that will go before the opening hearings next week on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.</p><p>Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, what a two weeks, Griff. We will check back. Thanks so much.</p><p>Griff Jenkins on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Coming up, tech and the border. We've got new, ground breaking technology here on set to show you. It uses thermal vision for security screenings. You don't want to miss it. Wait till we show you what they can find out about you.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>New technology transforming border security Thruvision uses body heat cameras to detect concealed items. The technology being deployed all over the world, including at the U.S. southern border.</p><p>Joining us right now is Thruvision U.S. operations head, Kevin Gramer.</p><p>Kevin, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>KEVIN GRAMER, U.S. OPERATIONS HEAD, THRUVISION: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we have this technology here on set. First, tell us about the technology and how it works.</p><p>GRAMER: Right. Through Vision technology is a passive technology, meaning it does not emit any radiation. And we use thermal contrast recognition, which essentially we're measuring the body heat coming from your body and identifying the items that are blocking that energy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So we're going to look at it right now because we've got the technology on set. And what are we seeing right now? We're seeing items in his pocket.</p><p>GRAMER: Yes, you can see Patrick here has some items on him. You see the black areas are the items that are blocking that energy coming from the body. So, Patrick, can you show us say what you have in your midsection there? We have -- the way -- the way the technology works --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ah-hah.</p><p>GRAMER: All right, so this is a money belt. We can see powders, plastics, liquids, gels. You know, a metal detector detects metal. We can detect all other items in -- that a metal detector cannot detect.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So how does this compare to other screening methods that we all know as we go through the airport, for example?</p><p>GRAMER: Yes, good point. Detection at range is new category for security technologies. So we're -- we're screening people from a distance. So usually when you go to the airport or you go through -- you go through a metal detector, you stand in a system and you put your hands up over your head, our system does this from a distance and we do it in a -- basically in a passive way so there's no radiation coming at you. We can see items on the body that are blocking that energy coming from your body. And the officers can make a determination on what to do next.</p><p>KELLY: I think one of the best parts is, we now know fanny packs aren't out of style, but I think the good news is, is that this is currently being deployed actually in London right now, right, to -- as a use case to see one of the biggest problems they have, and that's knife attacks.</p><p>GRAMER: Yes, we did some knife crime trails with the U.K. government in different locations there and it was a very effective use of our technology.</p><p>DAGHER: How far away can you spot something?</p><p>GRAMER: So up to -- it depends on the size of the object, but about 10 meters is kind of a sweet spot for us, so a little bit less if you're looking for smaller items, a little bit further away if you're looking at bigger items. Suicide vests are something that we can detect very well from a much further distance, but we can see down to even much smaller items for, say, airport security.</p><p>HUGHES: So you can see jewelry, you can see anything that's really foreign that's not emitting some kind of heat. So what's to prevent suicide bomber to, you know, put some kind of heat admitting technology around their bomb?</p><p>GRAMER: Yes. Because of the sensitivity of our system and the way it measures that energy coming from there, it would be almost impossible to thermalize something exactly to body temperature.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Can this be deployed anywhere, whereas, you know, people could actually be screened and they don't even know it or, I mean, I know your customers are largely governments, right?</p><p>GRAMER: Right. It can be screened -- you can deploy it in multiple ways. It's a mall enough item to where you can deploy it, like we have it back here where we just literally set it on top of a box. We have systems where you can actually move it around and do a mobile deployment so you can kind of do random and unpredictable screening. We can hang it from the ceiling. I could be --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So people could be screened and they don't even know it at their -- at their own will. I mean --</p><p>GRAMER: Yes, that's completely up to the -- whoever's deploying the technology on that, but, yes, it can -- you can do it overtly or covertly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where is this technology now? How wide scale is it?</p><p>GRAMER: So recently we announced a win that we have with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to deploy on the border. Currently, as you probably know, or may not know, that people crossing the border are not -- there's no technology screening them. So the officers rely on the K9 and their training on there -- we provide them a tool to actually look at the people that are coming across the border. We can --</p><p>KELLY: And it -- when people are moving in motion too, right? So they don't have to be standing there and they can actually deploy it on a -- on a wide-scale --</p><p>GRAMER: Absolutely.</p><p>KELLY: OK.</p><p>GRAMER: Yes, if you think of it as a camera, and what we can just see in a different part of the spectrum and the frequency that we see, essentially clothes disappear, but we do not see any anatomical detail on that.</p><p>KELLY: Right.</p><p>GRAMER: So if somebody's carrying drugs or like say fentanyl or opioids on their body and they're coming across the border, we'll be able to see those.</p><p>HUGHES: There was a big trend with 3D guns, ceramic knives, things like that. Is the technology like this, could that pick that up?</p><p>GRAMER: Absolutely. Good question. The technology, again, looks for the things that are blocking that energy coming from the body. So a 3D printed gun will likely make it right through a metal detector. Anything that's not metal will make it through a metal detector. We see all of those items because they're blocking that. So 3D guns, 3D printed guns, the ceramic knives, carbon fiber, other -- other items as well, and all non-metallics.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And this is at the southern border already?</p><p>GRAMER: We're working with CBP to deploy at the -- at the southern border now. We're also working with TSA and their innovation task force to look at new, faster ways to get people through airports -- the security. So we have airport --</p><p>DAGHER: Thank you for that.</p><p>GRAMER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>HUGHES: Yes.</p><p>GRAMER: Airport -- air travel is actually increasing at 5 to 8 percent a year. The TSA administrator has said that they're not going to people their way out of the problem, so they have to deploy technology to do that. We're in consideration to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're looking at pictures right now when I took the show to the -- to the El Paso border. And I couldn't believe how easy it was to get from Juarez, Mexico, right across -- it was supposed to be a river but there was no water -- right across right into Mexico -- I'm sorry, from Mexico right into the United States, into El Paso, Texas. It was -- there was -- there was nothing.</p><p>GRAMER: Yes. Yes. So we are -- we're deployed at the border. So we used it at the port of entry where people are coming through on there, so the CBP is looking at deploying in a variety of environments.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kevin, it's great to have you. Thanks so much.</p><p>GRAMER: Great. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will be following your -- your technology for sure.</p><p>Kevin Gramer joining us there.</p><p>Still ahead, I'll be speaking with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross next talking phase one of a U.S.-China trade deal.</p><p>Plus, 15 minutes of fame over. All three \"Jeopardy\" contestants stumped by this answer. What they didn't know next hour right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Good Friday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo.</p><p>And it is Friday, November 15th. Your top stories right now just before 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>The final stages of phase one.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, June 4th, your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern. Markets extending gains from Friday a 128-point gain on the Dow futures. Trade worries? Not showing up in the market. Stocks rally on Friday following that much better than expected jobs' report. The unemployment rate falling again at an 18-year low. We have 219-point gain on the blue chips and that green is now showing up in Europe. We have gains across the board to report to start this week in Europe. Same story in Asia overnight, all four major markets there gaining this Monday. Facebook under fire, a new report from The New York Times says the social media giant gave users data to device makers including Apple and Samsung. This raising new privacy concerns surrounding the company and it's weighing on the stock down nearly 1 1/2 percent in premarket trading. This comes as the tech industry is facing scrutiny over censorship not just Facebook, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes had a warning for big tech on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES WITH MARIA\" yesterday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIR, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: I would hope that they, you know, just don't get involved in politics and don't sensor conservatives and Republicans, but if they continue to do it then we have to move obviously to hearings on this issues.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We take a closer look straight ahead. Trade turmoil, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross returns from China with no deal, when it comes as our allies ramp up their threats of retaliation over our steel and aluminum tariffs. And breaking news overnight, a shooting on a football field, five people shot including a pregnant woman who had to have an emergency C- section, we have latest from Texas. Plus, scare in the sky, a flight forced to make an emergency landing after the plane's windshield cracked. And a warning from American Airlines, ticket prices could go higher as that airline faces higher fuel costs. And former President Bill Clinton offering his take on the impeachment debate. He says proceedings would be in full swing for impeachment if a Democrat was in office. All of that and so much more coming up this morning. Fox News Contributor, Kat Timpf is here, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin Kelly, and Maslansky + Partners President Lee Carter. Good morning. We got one hour left. I can't wait to get to all of that. President Clinton not helping the Democrats.</p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: No.</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK: Of course. Can I just say something about the markets? One of the reasons why we're seeing strong market action this morning and we saw it actually strengthen in Friday session is because the manufacturing numbers exceeded expectations. I mean we're well into expansion numbers. I mean we were supposed to get 57-print on the PMI numbers of manufacturing. We got a 58 number.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But except, if you look at the front page of the Journal this morning that global economic growth that the optimism is diming that you have global manufacturing at a nine-month and the Baltic Dry Index that shipping measure peaked last month, copper prices are falling, so there -- there's warning flares --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY: Yes. There's -- there are some warning flares on the global side especially because that's emanating out of Europe, and so Europe is really weighing down the global economy, and so their strike with political discourse. But the problem that you're having is not here in the U.S. We're 25 percent of the world's GDP. We're still strengthening and so I think that's a good thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And let's move onto that Facebook privacy story. It's privacy policy is under scrutiny again amid a new report. This is from The New York Times that Facebook gave phone makers, device makers like Apple and Samsung vast access to user data. Blake Burman is on this story in Washington, D.C. with more. Good morning, Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hello, Dagen. Good morning to you as well. Yes, we're talking about the biggest names here Apple, Blackberry, Samsung, Microsoft, Amazon, just a handful of the roughly 60 device makers that Facebook shared data with according to a brand-new report our this morning from The New York Times. The partnerships according to the report allowed for the use of like buttons and address books and allowed for Facebook to access the data of users' friends without their explicit consent. In a posting in response to the Times article, Facebook defending itself by saying, \"These partners signed agreements that prevented peoples Facebook information for being used for any other purpose than to recreate Facebook like experiences, partners could not integrate the user's Facebook features without their devices or with their devices rather without the user's permission.\" Now, over the weekend, Congressman Devin Nunes was warning tech companies both of reaching into the political arena and whether or not companies need to be regulated.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES: That brings in a whole another set of circumstances. Are these companies Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, etcetera, are they monopolies and should they be reined in? I would hope we don't have to go there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Now, that opens the door to even more questions about Facebook, Dagen, and user privacy when Mark Zuckerberg was testifying on Capitol Hill just a few weeks ago. This issue was not publicly known then, so it was not raised either, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Blake, thank you for that. Blake Burman in Washington for us. Turning to trade tensions, the Trump administration showing no signs of backing down after imposing sweeping tariffs on aluminum and steel imports from Canada, Mexico, and the European Union late last week despite swift pushback from America's allies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL: The national security issue is not about Canada, or China, or Turkey, or any other country that sends us aluminum or steel. National security issue is a flood of imports from 20 countries that are putting our aluminum and steel businesses out of business. And so the national security issue is basically us looking outward defending ourselves against that flood of imports so that these industries can thrive.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joining us now as President and CEO of MagneGas which is focused on the $5 billion metal cutting market, Ermanno Santilli. Ermanno, some of America's closest allies are calling these tariffs insulting, unacceptable even illegal. They're threatening retaliation lining up tariffs on goods that we export to nations like Canada, Mexico, and Europe, how are these tariffs going to impact your business?</p><p>ERMANNO SANTILLI, PRESIDENT AND CEO, MAGNEGAS CORPORATION: Well, MagneGas Corporation is profiling companies that will definitely benefit from these tariffs. (INAUDIBLE) MNGA, we're a small to medium-sized company. We're in the industrial gas sector and we have created industrial gas that is unique, developed here in the United States. It replaces the (INAUDIBLE) and that's used to cut and form metal. So clearly, if this economy in respect to the metal and aluminum starts taking off even more so than it already has I think MagneGas will definitely benefit and we're not alone.</p><p>KELLY: Ermanno or Ermanno, I apologized. How do you face shareholders and talk about the growth going forward and the volatility around the sanctions and your cash flows and managing really shareholder expectations because this may be a temporal situation that only happens for a few quarters?</p><p>SANTILLI: Well, that's a good question. And at the end of the day, our customers of our product are not going to stop welding. They're not going to stop building. They're not going to stop producing automobiles just because the cost of welding where it goes up by 10 percent. I think it's something that and if you look at the industry as a whole, I mean in -- unemployment is down 18-year low, back orders that are 14-year high, industry really isn't that afraid about these tariffs on the whole in my opinion.</p><p>CARTER: Industry is not necessarily concerned but a lot of the individuals out there are because we just heard, and Dagen -- and when Dagen's last interview said there is going to be short-term pain for consumers. So while it might have an impact on jobs, do you think it's going to have an impact on individuals?</p><p>SANTILLI: I think it's high -- if you look at a six pack is going to go up by a few pennies and automobile will go up by -- the price will go up by $40. I honestly don't think it's going to have a huge impact on other consumers. Frankly, I think it's all hype.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it's not just -- it's not just a six pack of beer and it's an automobile, Ermanno, it's everything that follows. It's also the retaliatory tariffs from all these other nations. The administration is looking at automobile tariffs, so if you want to buy a Kia, that Kia might go up by several thousand dollars in cost, so when -- the sum total and it's not just -- again, so you're admitting that consumer prices are going to go up. I mean Peter Navarro was on this show when these tariff were first announced before they were ever implemented saying don't you worry your head. The six pack of beer is not going up that much. But again, it affects the entire supplier chain as well and some manufacturers are left wondering how they're going to source their materials.</p><p>SANTILLI: Yes. I think that's true. I think that there is a risk for some retaliatory tariffs, but tariff mechanisms are used every day by every country in the world, 50 percent of products imported in the United States are subject to some sort of a tariff. Now, it's not 25 percent. It's usually much lower. I think the average is about 2-1/2 percent. Retaliatory tariffs are a concern but hopefully Trump will be using this as sort of a negotiations tool to avoid that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you have any sense? Have you talked to anybody in the administration at all? Do you have a sense of when we might have more certainty on that?</p><p>SANTILLI: No, I have not. I know that my customers and our suppliers, they're just kind of rolling with it. Prices are going up for aluminum and steel. But again, in our sector, we're not going to stop building just because something goes up by a few pennies.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ermanno, thank you for being here. Ermanno Santilli, take care.</p><p>SANTILLI: My pleasure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, President Bill Clinton ramping up his rhetoric. The former President arguing that impeachment hearings would have already started if a Democrat was the commander-in-chief. That's ahead. Plus, a crude awaken, American Airlines warning customers might face higher ticket prices if oil prices stay high. We break down the details, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: At least five people including a pregnant woman shot at a football game in Texas last night. Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. Well, the pregnant woman was shot in the chest and underwent an emergency C-section. The baby reportedly is OK, but the woman herself is in critical condition this morning. Now, this happened after two people opened fire at a football game. It happened in South Dallas. There's injured at least three women and two men. The motive for the shooting still unclear at this point, police are searching for the suspects in this. Well, (INAUDIBLE) this morning, Jordan's Prime Minister Hani Al-Mulki has resigned after several days of protests in that country. \"AL JAZEERA\" is reporting that Jordan's King Abdullah asked the prime minister to step down. These recent demonstrations over tax increases are the biggest in years in that country and a lot of police fired, and tear gas, and blocked roads is now the result of these protests as it really erupted in Jordan as you can see on your screen.</p><p>Well, an American Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing after its windshield was shattered by a powerful hailstorm. One passenger able to get this picture shows. You can see here the excessive damage to the nose of the plane. Luckily, the flight was able to lane safely. No injuries were reported. But meanwhile, American Airlines has warning now that a continued rise in oil prices could result in higher ticket prices for the passengers this summer. The spike in prices also resulting in a somber forecast for global airline profits in general. According to the International Air Transport Association, the industry is expected to post a $33.8 billion profit this year, but that's down $0.12 from the previous forecast. This of course due largely to rising fuel costs for the airline, and may oil reached 730 bucks per barrel for the first time in four years. Now, we're at 65.52. But again, these higher prices if they continue to the summer in particular airlines can only hedge so much, Dagen, you know they can maybe hedge 60 percent, 70 percent, but not whole enchilada, so your ticket may get a little pricier this summer.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Now, all the good news for you this morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Cheryl Casone. Coming up, President Bill Clinton speaking out, why the former President is arguing that impeachment hearings would have already started if a Democrat was commander-in-chief? Plus, tensions bubble over trade ahead of President Trump attending the G7 meeting in Canada. We're breaking down the tariff tussle ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A different kind of double standard, former President Bill Clinton claiming if a Democrat was in office, impeachment proceedings would have already been happening.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think they have tried by and large to cover this investigation based on the facts. I think if roles were reversed now, this is me just talking but based on my experience. If there were a Democratic President in these facts for President, most people on Washington believe impeachment hearings would have begun already.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The President teaming up with author James Patterson, you saw him there for a spy thriller, a fictitious spy thriller involving the President of the United States. Joining me now is Bre Payton, a staff writer for The Federalist. Bre, what do you make of Clinton's comments?</p><p>BRE PAYTON, STAFF WRITER, THE FEDERALIST: Yes. I think he's totally wrong. I think that if the roles were reverse and if the Republican really were a Democrat, I don't even think that there would be an investigation at all to be, you know, quite frank. And, you know what, the part of his comments that bothered me the most was at the end when he said that, you know, the media has been covered this fairly and that their coverage of the Mueller -- ongoing Mueller probe has been, you know, based in fact and all of these sort of things like that. I think that that's totally off base. I think it's clear that a lot of members of the media are active participants in these ongoing investigations, you know, they're not passive recorders of history like Bill Clinton seems to think that they are.</p><p>TIMPF: Bre, hi, it's Kat. Why is Bill Clinton talking? I mean do you really think that having him out there is something that helps Democrats? Do you think that it could be actually doing some harm?</p><p>PAYTON: Yes. I think it could potentially be doing some harm, you know, in the same interview when he was asked if he has ever apologize to Monica Lewinsky, you know, throughout 20 years of having ample opportunity to do so he said that he hadn't, you know, so I think, you know, having out there rehashing a lot of these same things I think it just reminds everyone of what happened 20 years ago, and how not great things were, and have been for Democrats since then.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, and then you throw in Hillary Clinton who -- I, you know, who can't get away from a microphone. It's like a -- there's a magnet that what did she say in one of the recent speeches she gave in the last couple of weeks, I'm not over it.</p><p>PAYTON: No kidding.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Which it should have been the title of her book by the way, Bre.</p><p>PAYTON: Yes. I definitely agree. I think that honestly, you know, it is time to accept the lessons of 2016 on both sides of the aisle except that both parties are radically different now than they were three years ago. It's not the same political environment of America. I mean really it feels like every day we're rehashing the same thing or rehashing November 2016 all over again. I think it would be great if people would take the lessons away from that, and move along, and do what they need to do.</p><p>CARTER: You know, one of the things that I'm curious about. I mean I know that they did covered, did you apologize to Monica Lewinsky? But this President was known to be or may be if we were to look at it in the context of how would be perceived today, his behavior in the Me Too movement all of that, you know, we were talking about this earlier. It's astounding that wasn't brought up during this interview. Why do you think that was?</p><p>PAYTON: I think it wasn't brought up because I think that Bill Clinton gets a free pass along a lot of members of the media. I think you're absolutely right that it is time to revisit what happened to Monica. I mean she was patient zero in all of this, you know, in today's modern media and all these things like that. I definitely think that her story needs to be retold and revisited, and, you know, I think that the fact that they didn't ask him that and gave him a free pass on that goes to show you that the media definitely has a double standard, and that if the roles were reversed that things would not at all be the same.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And now, Bre, I point to the fact that Town &amp; Country invited Monica Lewinsky to this event and then disinvited her once Bill Clinton agreed to show up, and then tried to like offer her up little chicklets if you will to get her to avoid talking about it and I think that just shows you why -- maybe not a whole party, but that man still gets a free pass from a lot of people.</p><p>PAYTON: Oh, yes, absolutely. I mean, you know, I guess in today's environment even after we've had the Me Too movement certain victims of sexual abuse are going to get elevated. Their stories are going to get elevated above others. It's really sad that our country is so politically divided to the point that that is a political issue as well, right? And that if you're a victim of a certain man, you're going to get marginalized and pushed to the sidelines, but if you're a victim of another man, it's going to be wall-to-wall coverage of, you know, this same thing, right? That disparity in and off itself is not fair. We shouldn't not have a double standard when it comes to women who have, you know, suffered at the hands of powerful men.</p><p>KELLY: Bre, it's Kevin Kelly here. And I think the kind of looming situation about Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton keep going out to talk about themselves and what happened in November 2016 is overshadowing the Democrats especially going into this midterm elections, do you think would -- the Clintons are doing is counterproductive to helping the Democrats in the elections coming up?</p><p>PAYTON: Yes, absolutely. I mean I think it's very clear that the base of the Democratic Party has moved past the Clintons. So, you know, I think it would behoove the Democratic Party if they would picked up on that queue, you know, and would say, OK, it's very clear that our voters do not like these people. Let's move on and figure out what they do like who they do want to see on the ticket coming forward who they do want to see on the TV and what issues that they actually do care about. It's very clear that Democrats honestly don't care about many of the factions of the people that they try to pretend to care about or say that they care about, and I think this is just another example of that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So this spy political thriller that President Clinton worked on with James Patterson, it involves cyber espionage and a traitor in the White House, is this a commentary on the current political environment according to Clinton and corner -- and based on what you said, Bre, about the division in this country?</p><p>PAYTON: Yes. I definitely think it could be a not so subtle, you know, swipe at what's going on, you know, I personally I'm kind of tired of fictionalized stories that are kind of rift from the headlines especially regarding this issue just because I personally feel just totally saturated, you know, with coverage of this. I don't think that, you know, the things that I enjoy for fiction and for pleasure reading need to have this as well. Personally, that's how I feel about it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Bre, good to see you. I know that --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The outrage machine in the last week has been and I only know how they're getting the gasoline to keep it charged up --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYTON: Their perpetual revolution marches on as always.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good to see you, Bre. Bre Payton, as always. So President Trump tweeting this morning, this is my 500th day in office and we have accomplished a lot, many believe more than any President in the first 500 days. Kat -- that's Kat Timpf (INAUDIBLE) he lists what he accomplished, massive tax and regulation cuts, military and vet, lower crime, and illegal immigration, stronger boarders, judgeships, best economy and jobs ever, and much more. We had repeal and replace done and the savings to our country of one trillion dollars except for one person, but it is getting done anyway. Individual mandate is gone and greet less expensive plans will be announced this month, drug prices coming down and right to try.</p><p>KELLY: He didn't bring up the wall though.</p><p>TIMPF: Just the way that he tweets and the way that he speaks always makes me laugh. I don't know --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: You can' help it. You can't help it --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TIMPF: Many people believe --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KELLY: But he left the wall out.</p><p>TIMPF: He did leave the wall out.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARTER: He did talk about borders.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, there was no wall funding and the -- for the most part there was replacement fencing funding and the omnibus spending bill, no restrictions on sanctuary cities in that -- in that spending bill. So again, but I will quote Ed Rollins he said that 20/20 bumper sticker should be promises made, promises kept. That's a lot of it whether you agree with the President or not, he has gotten a lot --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARTER: -- look forward on the healthcare. Don't go backwards.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But they've got to come up with a plan because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CARTER: They have to come up with a plan.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Those premium increases are going to get announced in October right before people go to the polls.</p><p>CARTER: So much forward and get something done. Don't look back to what happened.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You don't want Nancy Pelosi as the Speaker of the House.</p><p>CARTER: No.</p><p>TIMPF: Certainly not.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So coming up, Dell reported quarterly earnings before the bell this morning beating revenue expectations. We'll break down those numbers ahead. Plus, high stakes in the soybean industry. We will -- you get a live look with Connell McShane on the farm. The impact of the tariff tussle between the U.S. and China on the farming communities, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, June 4th. Your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Markets still gaining at 139-point gain on Dow futures right now. We're looking at a nice rally to start this new week. This after stocks rallied on Friday, after that much better-than-expected jobs' report. Again, to point that out, job growth accelerated last month from where it's been on average in the last 12 months. It's an incredible in economic expansion that's been going on for more than nine years. Global markets following those gains; look at England, France, and Germany, we have gains across the board there. And in Asia overnight, it was the same story -- buying galore. All four markets, major markets in Asia, up this Monday. Nevertheless, trade turmoil. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross returns from China with no deal and it comes as our allies ramp up the threat of retaliation over steel and aluminum tariffs. The White House Trade Policy Director Peter Navarro standing firm on the need for these tariffs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAVARRO: All the president is doing is defending this country's national security sovereignty and economic security from the flood of imports.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We look at the implications for business and markets straight ahead. Targeting the gas tax. A battle looming in California over a $0.12 hike. How it could impact the midterms as voters there, head to the polls tomorrow? Amazon in focus. One analyst raising its price target to $2000 a share. But where does it put the company in the race to one trillion against Apple? We will tell. Dell arising in the premarket. The company reporting better-than-expected revenue. The details, later this hour. Targeting tariffs. U.S. allies criticizing the Trump administration over its latest round of tariffs ahead of the G7 summit later this week in Quebec, Canada. Farmers are among hardest hit because of the tariffs so far. Connell McShane is in Ogden, Iowa with the very latest details. Hey, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey there, Dagen. Yes. You know, it's interesting, we want to try to make this story come to life as much as we can -- you talk about the trade talks over the weekend, so we come up to this soybean farm in beautiful part of Iowa. And we're just going to get down here and show you the rows of soybeans that are being grown here. And the idea when you think trade with China: look at these rows, they won't be harvest until September that's why they're so low to the ground. One out of every three rows of soybeans that we're looking at, end up going from United States, to China, eventually. The business numbers wise, works out to about $12 billion a year. So, when we talk about trade tensions in the United States, they're felt out here in Iowa. I want to introduce you to Ron Hecht, who's out here with us, a farmer, in Iowa, he's also on the president's advisory council for agriculture. Ron, thanks so much, first of all, for having you out -- having us out to your farm -- a beautiful place.</p><p>RON HECHT, IOWA FARMER: Thank you. It's a great place to be this morning.</p><p>MCSHANE: We were in Beijing there about a month ago or so. And at the time, they were telling us that some of the orders for later of the year had actually stopped -- for soybeans coming from the United States -- but how is your business been impacted by all of this trade talk, trade tensions?</p><p>HECHT: Well, actually, the price of soybeans has gone up since the talks started -- buyers around the rest of the world are stepping up and buying more soybeans than they were. So, we've -- so far, we've had a price increase.</p><p>MCSHANE: How does business work? In other words, this time of the year, they're not normally -- the Chinese buying from United States, right, comes later in the year?</p><p>HECHT: Right. China, is a seasonal buyer. They buy from the United States about six months a year, during our harvest time, and then they buy about six months a year from South America.</p><p>MCSHANE: From Brazil, and Argentina -- the final point, what's your big worry in all of this? Could they shift some that buying to the Brazilians, to the Argentinians, and how do you see the whole thing playing out?</p><p>HECHT: Absolutely. So far, so good. Everything has been fine. But if they shift their purchases during their normal purchasing time from U.S. -- which is starting in September -- that could be a problem for us, and that's when we might feel the price impact.</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. So, watch these trade talks like the rest of us. We'll be talking to Ron and some of the folks out here, Dagen, throughout the day but that's the idea -- they're watching it like all of us but watching it obviously a little bit more intently because this is their livelihood. A $12 billion a year business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Connell, do you mind if -- I'm curious to ask Ron something can you just -- is he making any changes in the way he's managing his farm at all? Has he made any -- is he changing --</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, you know, that's --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You might already know that.</p><p>MCSHANE: It's interesting. We've talked a little bit about that off camera, but Dagen was asking you, and just a quick answer, Ron, if you're making any changes in the way you're managing your farm because of this? I know it's tough to anticipate what's next.</p><p>HECHT: No, I'm not really making any changes, but I'm being more watchful of what's going on in the marketing. But no changes are called for yet. Actually, nothing has happened, so far. And there is a chance that as a result of these negotiations, it will actually be helpful for U.S. and Chinese soybean trade. So, it's hard to know which way to jump right now.</p><p>MCSHANE: And that's kind of a final point, Dagen, is that the Chinese already charged a tax, right? There's a 16 percent tariff on soybeans coming out to United States into China now. Their threat is to make 25. But people like Ron are hoping, obviously, maybe that number at 16 goes lower. So, that's why they're so uncertain -- they may come out on top by the time this is all done. But right now, they just don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I said when you were talking, you do such incredible reporting. So, I'll say that to your face, McShane. Connell McShane, in Iowa.</p><p>MCSHANE: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. Take care. You can catch Connell all day -- actually, for the next few days in Iowa. Rhetoric over Trump tariffs heating up over the weekend with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau calling the president's move an insult. White House Economic Advisor, Larry Kudlow, saying: we must put America first.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR: Mr. Trudeau, I think he's overreacting. I don't want to get in the middle of that. As a fine friend and ally of the United States, nobody denies that. But the point is, we have to protect ourselves. We must protect ourselves.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Larry Kudlow also said this is like a family squabble, a feud. Joining me now with more about this tiff over tariffs, Brandywine Global Portfolio Manager, Jack McIntyre. Jack, to be clear, Friday, today, there is no worry showing up in the stock market here at home.</p><p>JACK MCINTYRE, GLOBAL PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BRANDYWINE: Yes, that's correct, because we know the U.S. economy is doing well. There's a strong employment report. Right. The risk obviously is from trade standpoint: is it going to escalate? I think the markets are kind of keying off Kudlow and Mnuchin versus Navarro and Lighthizer. As long as that's the case, I think the equity market will do OK.</p><p>KELLY: Jack, you know, one of the interesting things -- it's Kevin Kelly here. One of the interesting things that's been a theme this year for the markets is the rising rate environment we've seen. We've touched 3.15 on the 10-year treasury on an intraday basis. What are your worries for the fixed income markets, and are they going to be exacerbated given trade talks, given kind of what's happening right now with our ballooning deficit with -- as well as bunch of other -- structural things like are going to be happening the next decade where we have to issue tons of debt?</p><p>MCINTYRE: Yes. No, it's a great point. You know, the back end of that, about the -- budget deficit increasing trade deficit deteriorate. I mean, ultimately, that should be weaker or drive U.S. dollar lower, which to me is part of the solution that would help, maybe, alleviate some of the trade tension in there. But so, I think -- from a fixed-income investor standpoint. I don't see a lot of inflation pressures building right now. The fed is going to go slow. I think they've kind of given as the road map. So, yes, yields are going to drift higher, but not to the point where it's going to derail the U.S. economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jack, there is a front-page story in the Wall Street Journal, today talking about global economic -- the growth story globally is fading. Dimming markets' optimism is the headline -- the global manufacturing, the index there, nine-month low. Baltic dry index, a measure of shipping costs, down 22 percent since peak last month. Copper prices, also down. Can the U.S. keep growing at a clip that the Atlanta fed thinks this quarter is going to be 4.8 percent growth which is extraordinary? Can we keep growing at that kind of pace if the rest of the world is slowing?</p><p>MCINTYRE: So, yes, I'm not sure we're going to actually print four percent in the U.S. But, so I think -- if you look at China, and the U.S. and combine those, those are two big, obviously, economies where data is still coming in better than expected. That's why I take the other side of that article because I think global economy still on solid footing yet Q1 was sort of a little bit slower. I suspect we'll see a little uptick in growth. I don't see global inventory overhang. The key is, the corporate sector CAPEX. I suspect, we'll see CAPEX cycle tying in trade sensations, though, that creates uncertainty in a business community, and if it accelerates then corporate might not build up CAPEX quite to the degree that they would absent those trade sensations. But bottom line, I think the global economy is still on very solid footing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, on that note, there's a survey from the National Association of Business Economics shows many are worried about a recession, by 2020. Your take on that report? Because again, a -- we're more than nine years into this expansion. That would be -- that would be -- a recession by 2020 would be an expansion of 12 years. But what's your take? Because again, to introduce the worry of tariffs and what that will do to business that you know, prices and business activity here in the U.S.</p><p>MCINTYRE: Right. So, I don't think expansion have to die of old age. And the one characteristic of this expansion, as you pointed out, it's been long. But it's been a pretty slow expansion. So, it's not strong but it is long. But you're right, there's risk from on the trade standpoint. Clearly, if this escalates into a trade war, that's going to bring forward the next recession. But if I'm right about CAPEX, kind of coming to the forefront -- and inflation not getting out of hand, because you know the fed obviously ends up ending a lot of these expansions and if inflation remains tame the fed won't do it this time around. So, it is a possibility. It's you know, 18 months away, but I don't think it has to happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Jack. Good to see you, Jack McIntyre. The president continues to tweet this morning, writing this: \"As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolutely right to pardon myself. But why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never-ending witch hunt led by 13 very angry and conflicted Democrats and others, continues into mid-terms.\" And he tweeted this again. Mr. President, are you watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA? \"China already charges a tax of 16 percent on soybeans; Canada has all sorts of trade barriers on our agricultural products. Not acceptable.\" Because that's exactly what Connell McShane was just talking about with that soybean farmer. So, it could go to 25 percent, at least that's the U.S. threat, but could it go lower than 16 percent? We'll be right back.</p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, TENNIS CHANNEL REPORTER: Welcome back to Tennis Channel Court Report a special presentation for Fox Business. I'm Dani Klupenger. It was a great day for the red, white, and blue at Ronald-Garros with two American women reaching the quarter finals for the first time in their careers.</p><p>Sloane Stephens' blasted in that (INAUDIBLE) off the court to punch her ticket into the elite eight. The U.S Open champion took the last 11 games of the match to wrap up the impressive win in under an hour.</p><p>Earlier, Madison Keys comfortably took care of business against Romania's Mihaela Buzarnescu to set up a quarterfinal meeting with Yulia Putintseva Kuznetsova. Four aces and 17 winners for last year's finals at flushing meadows.</p><p>Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova renewed their rivalry, Monday, in Harrisburg Place in the quarter, and you can watch it live on Tennis Channel. Our coverage from Ronald-Garros ticks the air at 5:00 a.m. Eastern. I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The President still tweeting this morning, \"The U.S. has made such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only win!\"</p><p>Shares of Dell, meantime, up two percent this morning, after beating first- quarter revenue expectations. Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange with much more. Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good Monday morning, Dagen. That's right, so we're watching Delta this morning -- Dell to the upside this morning after the revenue really wowed Wall Street. The stock is up about two percent, so they saw the pc shipments on the rise. In fact, products overall, saw an increase of 22 percent. And that's the -- that is the motherload of what they do for revenue, about 78 percent of the revenue comes from products. So, that's where they saw the increase of 22 percent. Service revenue also gained and so with that, you see, it was a winning quarter. The stock over 52 weeks is up about 24 percent.</p><p>And then Amazon. When we're watching Amazon, we had some positive comments from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. The analyst there puts a $2000 price target. This is the fourth time this year that he's uped his price target. He actually is liking private label for the company. That would include Amazon's Echo essentials apparel, Elements nutritional supplements, but when will it get to that trillion-dollar market cap. Will it beat out Apple to do so? Well, in fact, if you want to see Amazon in the trillion- dollar market cap, it would have to trade at 2060.89, so not quite here but -- yet, but it's had five record closes in a row, looking at a sixth this morning. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Nicole. Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Google in hot water, and now some are calling for a probe of the tech company in the wake of Google listing Nazism as an ideology of the California Republican Part. Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Pretty strong stuff I'd say. When you're bandying about labels like Nazis and a South Carolina State Senator -- or North Carolina State Senator was called a bigot. That was stamped across her picture. This is all part of the Google picture at the moment, and I think is one of the reasons, why Google is underperforming the other tech stocks. You may notice, Dagen, that recently, Microsoft passed Google in terms of overall market value. That was a surprise. And there's other things going on as well. I remember the \"60 Minutes'\" piece one week ago, where -- well, it emerged that Google is watching you, knows everything about you, but who is watching Google?</p><p>Well, now, Representative Devin Nunes says, look, you're operating like a monopoly. Keep going like this and we're going to have hearings into you. Well, that's interesting because that's a real threat to Alphabet's business, Google's business going forward. It's profitability going forward, I think they're pressing for the breakup of the company. This is something to watch, because big tech is so powerful, they're just asking the politicians to rein them in.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And they've gotten away with a lot in recent years, and we just sat back and did nothing.</p><p>VARNEY: That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Stuart, great to see you.</p><p>VARNEY: You, too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Always, my dear Sir, 9:00 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday, Stuart Varney, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\" You can't miss a minute.</p><p>Coming up, a fight over California's $0.12 gas tax intensifies. We head live to Orange County, California where a midterm battle to repeal the state's gas tax is brewing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A midterm battle over California's $0.12 gas tax is brewing. Hillary Vaughn is live in Orange County, California with the very latest. Hey, Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Dagen. Well, National Democrats tell me their pathway to the majority in November runs right here through California. They are targeting 10 seats in the state, four right here in Orange County, but National Republicans says this, $0.12 tax -- gas tax increase at the pumps that state Democrats pushed through is actually going to pump the brakes on their road to victory in November because Republicans say it's energizing their base.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATT GORMAN, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, RNC: There's a lot of energy on the Republican side. People want to talk about how Democrats are enthused. Well, I don't see Democrats marching in the streets overpaying upwards of $5.00 a gallon for gasoline. And I think this is going to resonate with voters not just now but as well in the fall.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: Voters are so fired up over this gas tax issue that one state senator is facing a recall vote tomorrow to kick him out of office for voting for the tax. But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is convinced voters aren't going to be worried about rising transportation costs when weighing who to support for Congress and instead are focused on what's happening in D.C.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW GODINICH, SPOKESMAN, DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE: I think that when voters are going to the polls this week, the issues that they are thinking about when they're voting for Congress are the issues that they're seeing coming out of Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: There is one tax Democrat say voters are worried about the GOP tax plan that they say has hit voters in California the hardest. The California Republican leadership says Democrats in the state are to blame for the high taxes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM BRULTE, CHAIRMAN, CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY: I think there's a collective Democrat strategy to blame Washington, D.C., and Donald Trump for all of the ills in California. The fact of the matter is the Democrats own California, they've had total control of it for over seven years, and they don't want to take credit for their record here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: Dagen, this $52-billion tax plan is meant to push cars off the road, but the GOP hopes it will push Democrats off the ballot in November. Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Hillary. Hillary Vaughn for us in Orange County, California. Coming up, final thoughts from our all-stars. We'll be right back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A giant fake hug to Kevin Kelly and Lee Carter for being with me this morning. So much to talk about trade, but these markets are loving what's coming out of Washington, at least so far. That does it for MORNINGS WITH MARIA. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is up right now. Stuart, it is all yours, Sir.</p><p>VARNEY: All right. We're off and we are running this Monday morning. Looks like kind of a follow on from last week. Good morning, everyone. Our allies are united on this, they don't like the tariffs we're imposing on them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018060403cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SGG-YNH1-JB20-G4MC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7229\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 4, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001TIV</classCode><className>AMERICAN AIRLINES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Dagen  McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's Monday, June 4th, your top stories  at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Markets extending gains from Friday a 128-point gain  on the Dow futures.  Trade worries?  Not showing up in the market.  Stocks  rally on Friday following that much better than expected jobs' report.  The  unemployment rate falling again at an 18-year low.  We have 219-point gain  on the blue chips and that green is now showing up in Europe.  We have  gains across the board to report to start this week in Europe.  Same story  in Asia overnight, all four major markets there gaining this Monday.   Facebook under fire, a new report from The New York Times says the social  media giant gave users data to device makers including Apple and Samsung.   This raising new privacy concerns surrounding the company and it's weighing  on the stock down nearly 1 1/2 percent in premarket trading.  This comes as  the tech industry is facing scrutiny over censorship not just Facebook,  House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes had a warning for big  tech on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES WITH MARIA\" yesterday. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIR, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  I would hope  that they, you know, just don't get involved in politics and don't sensor  conservatives and Republicans, but if they continue to do it then we have  to move obviously to hearings on this issues. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We take a closer look straight ahead.  Trade turmoil, Commerce  Secretary Wilbur Ross returns from China with no deal, when it comes as our  allies ramp up their threats of retaliation over our steel and aluminum  tariffs.  And breaking news overnight, a shooting on a football field, five  people shot including a pregnant woman who had to have an emergency C- section, we have latest from Texas.  Plus, scare in the sky, a flight  forced to make an emergency landing after the plane's windshield cracked.   And a warning from American Airlines, ticket prices could go higher as that  airline faces higher fuel costs.  And former President Bill Clinton  offering his take on the impeachment debate.  He says proceedings would be  in full swing for impeachment if a Democrat was in office.  All of that and  so much more coming up this morning.  Fox News Contributor, Kat Timpf is  here, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin Kelly, and Maslansky + Partners  President Lee Carter.  Good morning.  We got one hour left.  I can't wait  to get to all of that.  President Clinton not helping the Democrats. </p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  No.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  No. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Of course.  Can I just say  something about the markets?  One of the reasons why we're seeing strong  market action this morning and we saw it actually strengthen in Friday  session is because the manufacturing numbers exceeded expectations.  I mean  we're well into expansion numbers.  I mean we were supposed to get 57-print  on the PMI numbers of manufacturing.  We got a 58 number.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But except, if you look at the front page of the Journal this  morning that global economic growth that the optimism is diming that you  have global manufacturing at a nine-month and the Baltic Dry Index that  shipping measure peaked last month, copper prices are falling, so there --  there's warning flares -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  There's -- there are some warning flares on the global side  especially because that's emanating out of Europe, and so Europe is really  weighing down the global economy, and so their strike with political  discourse.  But the problem that you're having is not here in the U.S.   We're 25 percent of the world's GDP.  We're still strengthening and so I  think that's a good thing. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And let's move onto that Facebook privacy story.  It's privacy  policy is under scrutiny again amid a new report.  This is from The New  York Times that Facebook gave phone makers, device makers like Apple and  Samsung vast access to user data.  Blake Burman is on this story in  Washington, D.C. with more.  Good morning, Blake. </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hello, Dagen.  Good  morning to you as well.  Yes, we're talking about the biggest names here  Apple, Blackberry, Samsung, Microsoft, Amazon, just a handful of the  roughly 60 device makers that Facebook shared data with according to a  brand-new report our this morning from The New York Times.  The  partnerships according to the report allowed for the use of like buttons  and address books and allowed for Facebook to access the data of users'  friends without their explicit consent.  In a posting in response to the  Times article, Facebook defending itself by saying, \"These partners signed  agreements that prevented peoples Facebook information for being used for  any other purpose than to recreate Facebook like experiences, partners  could not integrate the user's Facebook features without their devices or  with their devices rather without the user's permission.\"  Now, over the  weekend, Congressman Devin Nunes was warning tech companies both of  reaching into the political arena and whether or not companies need to be  regulated. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  That brings in a whole another set of circumstances.  Are these  companies Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, etcetera, are they monopolies  and should they be reined in?  I would hope we don't have to go there. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Now, that opens the door to even more questions about Facebook,  Dagen, and user privacy when Mark Zuckerberg was testifying on Capitol Hill  just a few weeks ago.  This issue was not publicly known then, so it was  not raised either, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Blake, thank you for that.  Blake Burman in Washington for us.   Turning to trade tensions, the Trump administration showing no signs of  backing down after imposing sweeping tariffs on aluminum and steel imports  from Canada, Mexico, and the European Union late last week despite swift  pushback from America's allies. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL:  The national security  issue is not about Canada, or China, or Turkey, or any other country that  sends us aluminum or steel.  National security issue is a flood of imports  from 20 countries that are putting our aluminum and steel businesses out of  business.  And so the national security issue is basically us looking  outward defending ourselves against that flood of imports so that these  industries can thrive. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now as President and CEO of MagneGas which is focused  on the $5 billion metal cutting market, Ermanno Santilli.  Ermanno, some of  America's closest allies are calling these tariffs insulting, unacceptable  even illegal.  They're threatening retaliation lining up tariffs on goods  that we export to nations like Canada, Mexico, and Europe, how are these  tariffs going to impact your business? </p><p>ERMANNO SANTILLI, PRESIDENT AND CEO, MAGNEGAS CORPORATION:  Well, MagneGas  Corporation is profiling companies that will definitely benefit from these  tariffs.  (INAUDIBLE) MNGA, we're a small to medium-sized company.  We're  in the industrial gas sector and we have created industrial gas that is  unique, developed here in the United States.  It replaces the (INAUDIBLE)  and that's used to cut and form metal.  So clearly, if this economy in  respect to the metal and aluminum starts taking off even more so than it  already has I think MagneGas will definitely benefit and we're not alone. </p><p>KELLY:  Ermanno or Ermanno, I apologized.  How do you face shareholders and  talk about the growth going forward and the volatility around the sanctions  and your cash flows and managing really shareholder expectations because  this may be a temporal situation that only happens for a few quarters?</p><p>SANTILLI:  Well, that's a good question.  And at the end of the day, our  customers of our product are not going to stop welding.  They're not going  to stop building.  They're not going to stop producing automobiles just  because the cost of welding where it goes up by 10 percent.  I think it's  something that and if you look at the industry as a whole, I mean in --  unemployment is down 18-year low, back orders that are 14-year high,  industry really isn't that afraid about these tariffs on the whole in my  opinion. </p><p>CARTER:  Industry is not necessarily concerned but a lot of the individuals  out there are because we just heard, and Dagen -- and when Dagen's last  interview said there is going to be short-term pain for consumers.  So  while it might have an impact on jobs, do you think it's going to have an  impact on individuals? </p><p>SANTILLI:  I think it's high -- if you look at a six pack is going to go up  by a few pennies and automobile will go up by -- the price will go up by  $40.  I honestly don't think it's going to have a huge impact on other  consumers.  Frankly, I think it's all hype. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it's not just -- it's not just a six pack of beer and it's  an automobile, Ermanno, it's everything that follows.  It's also the  retaliatory tariffs from all these other nations.  The administration is  looking at automobile tariffs, so if you want to buy a Kia, that Kia might  go up by several thousand dollars in cost, so when -- the sum total and  it's not just -- again, so you're admitting that consumer prices are going  to go up.  I mean Peter Navarro was on this show when these tariff were  first announced before they were ever implemented saying don't you worry  your head.  The six pack of beer is not going up that much.  But again, it  affects the entire supplier chain as well and some manufacturers are left  wondering how they're going to source their materials. </p><p>SANTILLI:  Yes.  I think that's true.  I think that there is a risk for  some retaliatory tariffs, but tariff mechanisms are used every day by every  country in the world, 50 percent of products imported in the United States  are subject to some sort of a tariff.  Now, it's not 25 percent.  It's  usually much lower.  I think the average is about 2-1/2 percent.   Retaliatory tariffs are a concern but hopefully Trump will be using this as  sort of a negotiations tool to avoid that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you have any sense?  Have you talked to anybody in the  administration at all?  Do you have a sense of when we might have more  certainty on that? </p><p>SANTILLI:  No, I have not.  I know that my customers and our suppliers,  they're just kind of rolling with it.  Prices are going up for aluminum and  steel.  But again, in our sector, we're not going to stop building just  because something goes up by a few pennies.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ermanno, thank you for being here.  Ermanno Santilli, take care. </p><p>SANTILLI:  My pleasure.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, President Bill Clinton ramping up his rhetoric.  The  former President arguing that impeachment hearings would have already  started if a Democrat was the commander-in-chief.  That's ahead.  Plus, a  crude awaken, American Airlines warning customers might face higher ticket  prices if oil prices stay high.  We break down the details, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  At least five people including a pregnant woman shot at a  football game in Texas last night.  Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  Well, the pregnant  woman was shot in the chest and underwent an emergency C-section.  The baby  reportedly is OK, but the woman herself is in critical condition this  morning.  Now, this happened after two people opened fire at a football  game.  It happened in South Dallas.  There's injured at least three women  and two men.  The motive for the shooting still unclear at this point,  police are searching for the suspects in this.  Well, (INAUDIBLE) this  morning, Jordan's Prime Minister Hani Al-Mulki has resigned after several  days of protests in that country.  \"AL JAZEERA\" is reporting that Jordan's  King Abdullah asked the prime minister to step down.  These recent  demonstrations over tax increases are the biggest in years in that country  and a lot of police fired, and tear gas, and blocked roads is now the  result of these protests as it really erupted in Jordan as you can see on  your screen. </p><p>Well, an American Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing  after its windshield was shattered by a powerful hailstorm.  One passenger  able to get this picture shows.  You can see here the excessive damage to  the nose of the plane.  Luckily, the flight was able to lane safely.  No  injuries were reported.  But meanwhile, American Airlines has warning now  that a continued rise in oil prices could result in higher ticket prices  for the passengers this summer.  The spike in prices also resulting in a  somber forecast for global airline profits in general.  According to the  International Air Transport Association, the industry is expected to post a  $33.8 billion profit this year, but that's down $0.12 from the previous  forecast.  This of course due largely to rising fuel costs for the airline,  and may oil reached 730 bucks per barrel for the first time in four years.   Now, we're at 65.52.  But again, these higher prices if they continue to  the summer in particular airlines can only hedge so much, Dagen, you know  they can maybe hedge 60 percent, 70 percent, but not whole enchilada, so  your ticket may get a little pricier this summer. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl. </p><p>CASONE:  Now, all the good news for you this morning.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl Casone.  Coming up, President Bill Clinton  speaking out, why the former President is arguing that impeachment hearings  would have already started if a Democrat was commander-in-chief?  Plus,  tensions bubble over trade ahead of President Trump attending the G7  meeting in Canada.  We're breaking down the tariff tussle ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A different kind of double standard, former President Bill  Clinton claiming if a Democrat was in office, impeachment proceedings would  have already been happening. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think they have  tried by and large to cover this investigation based on the facts.  I think  if roles were reversed now, this is me just talking but based on my  experience.  If there were a Democratic President in these facts for  President, most people on Washington believe impeachment hearings would  have begun already. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President teaming up with author James Patterson, you saw  him there for a spy thriller, a fictitious spy thriller involving the  President of the United States.  Joining me now is Bre Payton, a staff  writer for The Federalist.  Bre, what do you make of Clinton's comments? </p><p>BRE PAYTON, STAFF WRITER, THE FEDERALIST:  Yes.  I think he's totally  wrong.  I think that if the roles were reverse and if the Republican really  were a Democrat, I don't even think that there would be an investigation at  all to be, you know, quite frank.  And, you know what, the part of his  comments that bothered me the most was at the end when he said that, you  know, the media has been covered this fairly and that their coverage of the  Mueller -- ongoing Mueller probe has been, you know, based in fact and all  of these sort of things like that.  I think that that's totally off base.   I think it's clear that a lot of members of the media are active  participants in these ongoing investigations, you know, they're not passive  recorders of history like Bill Clinton seems to think that they are. </p><p>TIMPF:  Bre, hi, it's Kat.  Why is Bill Clinton talking?  I mean do you  really think that having him out there is something that helps Democrats?   Do you think that it could be actually doing some harm? </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes.  I think it could potentially be doing some harm, you know,  in the same interview when he was asked if he has ever apologize to Monica  Lewinsky, you know, throughout 20 years of having ample opportunity to do  so he said that he hadn't, you know, so I think, you know, having out there  rehashing a lot of these same things I think it just reminds everyone of  what happened 20 years ago, and how not great things were, and have been  for Democrats since then. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and then you throw in Hillary Clinton who -- I, you know,  who can't get away from a microphone.  It's like a -- there's a magnet that  what did she say in one of the recent speeches she gave in the last couple  of weeks, I'm not over it. </p><p>PAYTON:  No kidding. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which it should have been the title of her book by the way, Bre. </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes.  I definitely agree.  I think that honestly, you know, it is  time to accept the lessons of 2016 on both sides of the aisle except that  both parties are radically different now than they were three years ago.   It's not the same political environment of America.  I mean really it feels  like every day we're rehashing the same thing or rehashing November 2016  all over again.  I think it would be great if people would take the lessons  away from that, and move along, and do what they need to do. </p><p>CARTER:  You know, one of the things that I'm curious about.  I mean I know  that they did covered, did you apologize to Monica Lewinsky?  But this  President was known to be or may be if we were to look at it in the context  of how would be perceived today, his behavior in the Me Too movement all of  that, you know, we were talking about this earlier.  It's astounding that  wasn't brought up during this interview.  Why do you think that was? </p><p>PAYTON:  I think it wasn't brought up because I think that Bill Clinton  gets a free pass along a lot of members of the media.  I think you're  absolutely right that it is time to revisit what happened to Monica.  I  mean she was patient zero in all of this, you know, in today's modern media  and all these things like that.  I definitely think that her story needs to  be retold and revisited, and, you know, I think that the fact that they  didn't ask him that and gave him a free pass on that goes to show you that  the media definitely has a double standard, and that if the roles were  reversed that things would not at all be the same. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And now, Bre, I point to the fact that Town &amp; Country invited  Monica Lewinsky to this event and then disinvited her once Bill Clinton  agreed to show up, and then tried to like offer her up little chicklets if  you will to get her to avoid talking about it and I think that just shows  you why -- maybe not a whole party, but that man still gets a free pass  from a lot of people. </p><p>PAYTON:  Oh, yes, absolutely.  I mean, you know, I guess in today's  environment even after we've had the Me Too movement certain victims of  sexual abuse are going to get elevated.  Their stories are going to get  elevated above others.  It's really sad that our country is so politically  divided to the point that that is a political issue as well, right?  And  that if you're a victim of a certain man, you're going to get marginalized  and pushed to the sidelines, but if you're a victim of another man, it's  going to be wall-to-wall coverage of, you know, this same thing, right?   That disparity in and off itself is not fair.  We shouldn't not have a  double standard when it comes to women who have, you know, suffered at the  hands of powerful men. </p><p>KELLY:  Bre, it's Kevin Kelly here.  And I think the kind of looming  situation about Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton keep going out to talk  about themselves and what happened in November 2016 is overshadowing the  Democrats especially going into this midterm elections, do you think would  -- the Clintons are doing is counterproductive to helping the Democrats in  the elections coming up? </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes, absolutely.  I mean I think it's very clear that the base of  the Democratic Party has moved past the Clintons.  So, you know, I think it  would behoove the Democratic Party if they would picked up on that queue,  you know, and would say, OK, it's very clear that our voters do not like  these people.  Let's move on and figure out what they do like who they do  want to see on the ticket coming forward who they do want to see on the TV  and what issues that they actually do care about.  It's very clear that  Democrats honestly don't care about many of the factions of the people that  they try to pretend to care about or say that they care about, and I think  this is just another example of that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So this spy political thriller that President Clinton worked on  with James Patterson, it involves cyber espionage and a traitor in the  White House, is this a commentary on the current political environment  according to Clinton and corner -- and based on what you said, Bre, about  the division in this country? </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes.  I definitely think it could be a not so subtle, you know,  swipe at what's going on, you know, I personally I'm kind of tired of  fictionalized stories that are kind of rift from the headlines especially  regarding this issue just because I personally feel just totally saturated,  you know, with coverage of this.  I don't think that, you know, the things  that I enjoy for fiction and for pleasure reading need to have this as  well.  Personally, that's how I feel about it. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bre, good to see you.  I know that -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The outrage machine in the last week has been and I only know  how they're getting the gasoline to keep it charged up --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PAYTON:  Their perpetual revolution marches on as always. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you, Bre.  Bre Payton, as always.  So President  Trump tweeting this morning, this is my 500th day in office and we have  accomplished a lot, many believe more than any President in the first 500  days.  Kat -- that's Kat Timpf (INAUDIBLE) he lists what he accomplished,  massive tax and regulation cuts, military and vet, lower crime, and illegal  immigration, stronger boarders, judgeships, best economy and jobs ever, and  much more.  We had repeal and replace done and the savings to our country  of one trillion dollars except for one person, but it is getting done  anyway.  Individual mandate is gone and greet less expensive plans will be  announced this month, drug prices coming down and right to try. </p><p>KELLY:  He didn't bring up the wall though. </p><p>TIMPF:  Just the way that he tweets and the way that he speaks always makes  me laugh.  I don't know -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can' help it.  You can't help it -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TIMPF:  Many people believe -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  But he left the wall out.</p><p>TIMPF:  He did leave the wall out. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARTER:  He did talk about borders. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, there was no wall funding and the -- for the most part  there was replacement fencing funding and the omnibus spending bill, no  restrictions on sanctuary cities in that -- in that spending bill.  So  again, but I will quote Ed Rollins he said that 20/20 bumper sticker should  be promises made, promises kept.  That's a lot of it whether you agree with  the President or not, he has gotten a lot -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARTER:  -- look forward on the healthcare.  Don't go backwards. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they've got to come up with a plan because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARTER:  They have to come up with a plan.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Those premium increases are going to get announced in October  right before people go to the polls. </p><p>CARTER:  So much forward and get something done.  Don't look back to what  happened. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You don't want Nancy Pelosi as the Speaker of the House.  </p><p>CARTER:  No.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Certainly not. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So coming up, Dell reported quarterly earnings before the bell  this morning beating revenue expectations.  We'll break down those numbers  ahead.  Plus, high stakes in the soybean industry.  We will -- you get a  live look with Connell McShane on the farm.  The impact of the tariff  tussle between the U.S. and China on the farming communities, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, June 4th.  Your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets still  gaining at 139-point gain on Dow futures right now.  We're looking at a  nice rally to start this new week.  This after stocks rallied on Friday,  after that much better-than-expected jobs' report.  Again, to point that  out, job growth accelerated last month from where it's been on average in  the last 12 months.  It's an incredible in economic expansion that's been  going on for more than nine years.  Global markets following those gains;  look at England, France, and Germany, we have gains across the board there.   And in Asia overnight, it was the same story -- buying galore.  All four  markets, major markets in Asia, up this Monday.  Nevertheless, trade  turmoil.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross returns from China with no deal  and it comes as our allies ramp up the threat of retaliation over steel and  aluminum tariffs.  The White House Trade Policy Director Peter Navarro  standing firm on the need for these tariffs.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NAVARRO:  All the president is doing is defending this country's national  security sovereignty and economic security from the flood of imports.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We look at the implications for business and markets straight  ahead.  Targeting the gas tax.  A battle looming in California over a $0.12  hike.  How it could impact the midterms as voters there, head to the polls  tomorrow?  Amazon in focus.  One analyst raising its price target to $2000  a share.  But where does it put the company in the race to one trillion  against Apple?  We will tell.  Dell arising in the premarket.  The company  reporting better-than-expected revenue.  The details, later this hour.   Targeting tariffs.  U.S. allies criticizing the Trump administration over  its latest round of tariffs ahead of the G7 summit later this week in  Quebec, Canada.  Farmers are among hardest hit because of the tariffs so  far.  Connell McShane is in Ogden, Iowa with the very latest details.  Hey,  Connell.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey there, Dagen.  Yes.  You  know, it's interesting, we want to try to make this story come to life as  much as we can -- you talk about the trade talks over the weekend, so we  come up to this soybean farm in beautiful part of Iowa.  And we're just  going to get down here and show you the rows of soybeans that are being  grown here.  And the idea when you think trade with China: look at these  rows, they won't be harvest until September that's why they're so low to  the ground.  One out of every three rows of soybeans that we're looking at,  end up going from United States, to China, eventually.  The business  numbers wise, works out to about $12 billion a year.  So, when we talk  about trade tensions in the United States, they're felt out here in Iowa.   I want to introduce you to Ron Hecht, who's out here with us, a farmer, in  Iowa, he's also on the president's advisory council for agriculture.  Ron,  thanks so much, first of all, for having you out -- having us out to your  farm -- a beautiful place.  </p><p>RON HECHT, IOWA FARMER:  Thank you.  It's a great place to be this morning.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  We were in Beijing there about a month ago or so.  And at the  time, they were telling us that some of the orders for later of the year  had actually stopped -- for soybeans coming from the United States -- but  how is your business been impacted by all of this trade talk, trade  tensions?  </p><p>HECHT:  Well, actually, the price of soybeans has gone up since the talks  started -- buyers around the rest of the world are stepping up and buying  more soybeans than they were.  So, we've -- so far, we've had a price  increase.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  How does business work?  In other words, this time of the year,  they're not normally -- the Chinese buying from United States, right, comes  later in the year?  </p><p>HECHT:  Right.  China, is a seasonal buyer.  They buy from the United  States about six months a year, during our harvest time, and then they buy  about six months a year from South America.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  From Brazil, and Argentina -- the final point, what's your big  worry in all of this?  Could they shift some that buying to the Brazilians,  to the Argentinians, and how do you see the whole thing playing out?  </p><p>HECHT:  Absolutely.  So far, so good.  Everything has been fine.  But if  they shift their purchases during their normal purchasing time from U.S. --  which is starting in September -- that could be a problem for us, and  that's when we might feel the price impact.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  So, watch these trade talks like the rest of us.   We'll be talking to Ron and some of the folks out here, Dagen, throughout  the day but that's the idea -- they're watching it like all of us but  watching it obviously a little bit more intently because this is their  livelihood.  A $12 billion a year business.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Connell, do you mind if -- I'm curious to ask Ron something can  you just -- is he making any changes in the way he's managing his farm at  all?  Has he made any -- is he changing --</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, you know, that's --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You might already know that.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  It's interesting.  We've talked a little bit about that off  camera, but Dagen was asking you, and just a quick answer, Ron, if you're  making any changes in the way you're managing your farm because of this?  I  know it's tough to anticipate what's next.  </p><p>HECHT:  No, I'm not really making any changes, but I'm being more watchful  of what's going on in the marketing.  But no changes are called for yet.   Actually, nothing has happened, so far.  And there is a chance that as a  result of these negotiations, it will actually be helpful for U.S. and  Chinese soybean trade.  So, it's hard to know which way to jump right now.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  And that's kind of a final point, Dagen, is that the Chinese  already charged a tax, right?  There's a 16 percent tariff on soybeans  coming out to United States into China now.  Their threat is to make 25.   But people like Ron are hoping, obviously, maybe that number at 16 goes  lower.  So, that's why they're so uncertain -- they may come out on top by  the time this is all done.  But right now, they just don't know.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said when you were talking, you do such incredible reporting.   So, I'll say that to your face, McShane.  Connell McShane, in Iowa.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  Take care.  You can catch Connell all day --  actually, for the next few days in Iowa.  Rhetoric over Trump tariffs  heating up over the weekend with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  calling the president's move an insult.  White House Economic Advisor,  Larry Kudlow, saying: we must put America first.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR:  Mr. Trudeau, I think he's  overreacting.  I don't want to get in the middle of that.  As a fine friend  and ally of the United States, nobody denies that.  But the point is, we  have to protect ourselves.  We must protect ourselves.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Larry Kudlow also said this is like a family squabble, a feud.   Joining me now with more about this tiff over tariffs, Brandywine Global  Portfolio Manager, Jack McIntyre.  Jack, to be clear, Friday, today, there  is no worry showing up in the stock market here at home.  </p><p>JACK MCINTYRE, GLOBAL PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BRANDYWINE:  Yes, that's correct,  because we know the U.S. economy is doing well.  There's a strong  employment report.  Right.  The risk obviously is from trade standpoint: is  it going to escalate?  I think the markets are kind of keying off Kudlow  and Mnuchin versus Navarro and Lighthizer.  As long as that's the case, I  think the equity market will do OK.  </p><p>KELLY:  Jack, you know, one of the interesting things -- it's Kevin Kelly  here.  One of the interesting things that's been a theme this year for the  markets is the rising rate environment we've seen.  We've touched 3.15 on  the 10-year treasury on an intraday basis.  What are your worries for the  fixed income markets, and are they going to be exacerbated given trade  talks, given kind of what's happening right now with our ballooning deficit  with -- as well as bunch of other -- structural things like are going to be  happening the next decade where we have to issue tons of debt?  </p><p>MCINTYRE:  Yes.  No, it's a great point.  You know, the back end of that,  about the -- budget deficit increasing trade deficit deteriorate.  I mean,  ultimately, that should be weaker or drive U.S. dollar lower, which to me  is part of the solution that would help, maybe, alleviate some of the trade  tension in there.  But so, I think -- from a fixed-income investor  standpoint.  I don't see a lot of inflation pressures building right now.   The fed is going to go slow.  I think they've kind of given as the road  map.  So, yes, yields are going to drift higher, but not to the point where  it's going to derail the U.S. economy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jack, there is a front-page story in the Wall Street Journal,  today talking about global economic -- the growth story globally is fading.   Dimming markets' optimism is the headline -- the global manufacturing, the  index there, nine-month low.  Baltic dry index, a measure of shipping  costs, down 22 percent since peak last month.  Copper prices, also down.   Can the U.S. keep growing at a clip that the Atlanta fed thinks this  quarter is going to be 4.8 percent growth which is extraordinary?  Can we  keep growing at that kind of pace if the rest of the world is slowing?  </p><p>MCINTYRE:  So, yes, I'm not sure we're going to actually print four percent  in the U.S.  But, so I think -- if you look at China, and the U.S. and  combine those, those are two big, obviously, economies where data is still  coming in better than expected.  That's why I take the other side of that  article because I think global economy still on solid footing yet Q1 was  sort of a little bit slower.  I suspect we'll see a little uptick in  growth.  I don't see global inventory overhang.  The key is, the corporate  sector CAPEX.  I suspect, we'll see CAPEX cycle tying in trade sensations,  though, that creates uncertainty in a business community, and if it  accelerates then corporate might not build up CAPEX quite to the degree  that they would absent those trade sensations.  But bottom line, I think  the global economy is still on very solid footing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, on that note, there's a survey from the National  Association of Business Economics shows many are worried about a recession,  by 2020.  Your take on that report?  Because again, a -- we're more than  nine years into this expansion.  That would be -- that would be -- a  recession by 2020 would be an expansion of 12 years.  But what's your take?   Because again, to introduce the worry of tariffs and what that will do to  business that you know, prices and business activity here in the U.S.  </p><p>MCINTYRE:  Right.  So, I don't think expansion have to die of old age.  And  the one characteristic of this expansion, as you pointed out, it's been  long.  But it's been a pretty slow expansion.  So, it's not strong but it  is long.  But you're right, there's risk from on the trade standpoint.   Clearly, if this escalates into a trade war, that's going to bring forward  the next recession.  But if I'm right about CAPEX, kind of coming to the  forefront -- and inflation not getting out of hand, because you know the  fed obviously ends up ending a lot of these expansions and if inflation  remains tame the fed won't do it this time around.  So, it is a  possibility.  It's you know, 18 months away, but I don't think it has to  happen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Jack.  Good to see you, Jack McIntyre.  The president  continues to tweet this morning, writing this: \"As has been stated by  numerous legal scholars, I have the absolutely right to pardon myself.  But  why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?  In the meantime, the  never-ending witch hunt led by 13 very angry and conflicted Democrats and  others, continues into mid-terms.\"  And he tweeted this again.  Mr.  President, are you watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA?  \"China already charges a  tax of 16 percent on soybeans; Canada has all sorts of trade barriers on  our agricultural products.  Not acceptable.\"  Because that's exactly what  Connell McShane was just talking about with that soybean farmer.  So, it  could go to 25 percent, at least that's the U.S. threat, but could it go  lower than 16 percent?  We'll be right back.  </p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, TENNIS CHANNEL REPORTER:  Welcome back to Tennis Channel  Court Report a special presentation for Fox Business.  I'm Dani Klupenger.

Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange with much more.  Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Monday morning,  Dagen.  That's right, so we're watching Delta this morning -- Dell to the  upside this morning after the revenue really wowed Wall Street.  The stock  is up about two percent, so they saw the pc shipments on the rise.  In  fact, products overall, saw an increase of 22 percent.  And that's the --  that is the motherload of what they do for revenue, about 78 percent of the  revenue comes from products.  So, that's where they saw the increase of 22  percent.  Service revenue also gained and so with that, you see, it was a  winning quarter.  The stock over 52 weeks is up about 24 percent.  </p><p>And then Amazon.  When we're watching Amazon, we had some positive comments  from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.  The analyst there puts a $2000 price  target.  This is the fourth time this year that he's uped his price target.   He actually is liking private label for the company.  That would include  Amazon's Echo essentials apparel, Elements nutritional supplements, but  when will it get to that trillion-dollar market cap.  Will it beat out  Apple to do so?  Well, in fact, if you want to see Amazon in the trillion- dollar market cap, it would have to trade at 2060.89, so not quite here but  -- yet, but it's had five record closes in a row, looking at a sixth this  morning.

Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Pretty strong stuff I'd say.   When you're bandying about labels like Nazis and a South Carolina State  Senator -- or North Carolina State Senator was called a bigot.  That was  stamped across her picture.  This is all part of the Google picture at the  moment, and I think is one of the reasons, why Google is underperforming  the other tech stocks.  You may notice, Dagen, that recently, Microsoft  passed Google in terms of overall market value.  That was a surprise.  And  there's other things going on as well.  I remember the \"60 Minutes'\" piece  one week ago, where -- well, it emerged that Google is watching you, knows  everything about you, but who is watching Google?</p><p>Well, now, Representative Devin Nunes says, look, you're operating like a  monopoly.  Keep going like this and we're going to have hearings into you.   Well, that's interesting because that's a real threat to Alphabet's  business, Google's business going forward.  It's profitability going  forward, I think they're pressing for the breakup of the company.  This is  something to watch, because big tech is so powerful, they're just asking  the politicians to rein them in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they've gotten away with a lot in recent years, and we just  sat back and did nothing.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart, great to see you.</p><p>VARNEY:  You, too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Always, my dear Sir, 9:00 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday,  Stuart Varney, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  You can't miss a minute.</p><p>Coming up, a fight over California's $0.12 gas tax intensifies.

They are targeting 10 seats in the state,  four right here in Orange County, but National Republicans says this, $0.12  tax -- gas tax increase at the pumps that state Democrats pushed through is  actually going to pump the brakes on their road to victory in November  because Republicans say it's energizing their base.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MATT GORMAN, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, RNC:  There's a lot of energy on the  Republican side.  People want to talk about how Democrats are enthused.   Well, I don't see Democrats marching in the streets overpaying upwards of  $5.00 a gallon for gasoline.  And I think this is going to resonate with  voters not just now but as well in the fall.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUGHN:  Voters are so fired up over this gas tax issue that one state  senator is facing a recall vote tomorrow to kick him out of office for  voting for the tax.  But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is  convinced voters aren't going to be worried about rising transportation  costs when weighing who to support for Congress and instead are focused on  what's happening in D.C.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDREW GODINICH, SPOKESMAN, DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE:  I  think that when voters are going to the polls this week, the issues that  they are thinking about when they're voting for Congress are the issues  that they're seeing coming out of Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUGHN:  There is one tax Democrat say voters are worried about the GOP tax  plan that they say has hit voters in California the hardest.  The  California Republican leadership says Democrats in the state are to blame  for the high taxes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JIM BRULTE, CHAIRMAN, CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY:  I think there's a  collective Democrat strategy to blame Washington, D.C., and Donald Trump  for all of the ills in California.  The fact of the matter is the Democrats  own California, they've had total control of it for over seven years, and  they don't want to take credit for their record here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUGHN:  Dagen, this $52-billion tax plan is meant to push cars off the  road, but the GOP hopes it will push Democrats off the ballot in November.   Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Hillary.  Hillary Vaughn for us in Orange County,  California.  Coming up, final thoughts from our all-stars.  We'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A giant fake hug to Kevin Kelly and Lee Carter for being with me  this morning.  So much to talk about trade, but these markets are loving  what's coming out of Washington, at least so far.  That does it for  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is up right now.  Stuart, it is  all yours, Sir.</p><p>VARNEY:  All right.  We're off and we are running this Monday morning.   Looks like kind of a follow on from last week.  Good morning, everyone.   Our allies are united on this, they don't like the tariffs we're imposing  on them.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Same story  in Asia overnight, all four major markets there gaining this Monday.   Facebook under fire, a new report from The New York Times says the social  media giant gave users data to device makers including Apple and Samsung.

And breaking news overnight, a shooting on a football field, five  people shot including a pregnant woman who had to have an emergency C- section, we have latest from Texas.  Plus, scare in the sky, a flight  forced to make an emergency landing after the plane's windshield cracked.   And a warning from American Airlines, ticket prices could go higher as that  airline faces higher fuel costs.  And former President Bill Clinton  offering his take on the impeachment debate.

Fox News Contributor, Kat Timpf is  here, Benchmark Managing Partner Kevin Kelly, and Maslansky + Partners  President Lee Carter.  Good morning.  We got one hour left.  I can't wait  to get to all of that.  President Clinton not helping the Democrats. </p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  No.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  No. </p><p>KEVIN KELLY, MANAGING PARTNER, BENCHMARK:  Of course.  Can I just say  something about the markets?  One of the reasons why we're seeing strong  market action this morning and we saw it actually strengthen in Friday  session is because the manufacturing numbers exceeded expectations.  I mean  we're well into expansion numbers.  I mean we were supposed to get 57-print  on the PMI numbers of manufacturing.  We got a 58 number.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But except, if you look at the front page of the Journal this  morning that global economic growth that the optimism is diming that you  have global manufacturing at a nine-month and the Baltic Dry Index that  shipping measure peaked last month, copper prices are falling, so there --  there's warning flares -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  Yes.  There's -- there are some warning flares on the global side  especially because that's emanating out of Europe, and so Europe is really  weighing down the global economy, and so their strike with political  discourse.  But the problem that you're having is not here in the U.S.   We're 25 percent of the world's GDP.  We're still strengthening and so I  think that's a good thing. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And let's move onto that Facebook privacy story.  It's privacy  policy is under scrutiny again amid a new report.  This is from The New  York Times that Facebook gave phone makers, device makers like Apple and  Samsung vast access to user data.  Blake Burman is on this story in  Washington, D.C. with more.  Good morning, Blake. </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hello, Dagen.  Good  morning to you as well.  Yes, we're talking about the biggest names here  Apple, Blackberry, Samsung, Microsoft, Amazon, just a handful of the  roughly 60 device makers that Facebook shared data with according to a  brand-new report our this morning from The New York Times.  The  partnerships according to the report allowed for the use of like buttons  and address books and allowed for Facebook to access the data of users'  friends without their explicit consent.  In a posting in response to the  Times article, Facebook defending itself by saying, \"These partners signed  agreements that prevented peoples Facebook information for being used for  any other purpose than to recreate Facebook like experiences, partners  could not integrate the user's Facebook features without their devices or  with their devices rather without the user's permission.\"  Now, over the  weekend, Congressman Devin Nunes was warning tech companies both of  reaching into the political arena and whether or not companies need to be  regulated. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NUNES:  That brings in a whole another set of circumstances.  Are these  companies Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, etcetera, are they monopolies  and should they be reined in?  I would hope we don't have to go there. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  Now, that opens the door to even more questions about Facebook,  Dagen, and user privacy when Mark Zuckerberg was testifying on Capitol Hill  just a few weeks ago.  This issue was not publicly known then, so it was  not raised either, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Blake, thank you for that.  Blake Burman in Washington for us.   Turning to trade tensions, the Trump administration showing no signs of  backing down after imposing sweeping tariffs on aluminum and steel imports  from Canada, Mexico, and the European Union late last week despite swift  pushback from America's allies. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL TRADE COUNCIL:  The national security  issue is not about Canada, or China, or Turkey, or any other country that  sends us aluminum or steel.  National security issue is a flood of imports  from 20 countries that are putting our aluminum and steel businesses out of  business.  And so the national security issue is basically us looking  outward defending ourselves against that flood of imports so that these  industries can thrive. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining us now as President and CEO of MagneGas which is focused  on the $5 billion metal cutting market, Ermanno Santilli.  Ermanno, some of  America's closest allies are calling these tariffs insulting, unacceptable  even illegal.  They're threatening retaliation lining up tariffs on goods  that we export to nations like Canada, Mexico, and Europe, how are these  tariffs going to impact your business? </p><p>ERMANNO SANTILLI, PRESIDENT AND CEO, MAGNEGAS CORPORATION:  Well, MagneGas  Corporation is profiling companies that will definitely benefit from these  tariffs.  (INAUDIBLE) MNGA, we're a small to medium-sized company.  We're  in the industrial gas sector and we have created industrial gas that is  unique, developed here in the United States.  It replaces the (INAUDIBLE)  and that's used to cut and form metal.  So clearly, if this economy in  respect to the metal and aluminum starts taking off even more so than it  already has I think MagneGas will definitely benefit and we're not alone. </p><p>KELLY:  Ermanno or Ermanno, I apologized.  How do you face shareholders and  talk about the growth going forward and the volatility around the sanctions  and your cash flows and managing really shareholder expectations because  this may be a temporal situation that only happens for a few quarters?</p><p>SANTILLI:  Well, that's a good question.  And at the end of the day, our  customers of our product are not going to stop welding.  They're not going  to stop building.  They're not going to stop producing automobiles just  because the cost of welding where it goes up by 10 percent.  I think it's  something that and if you look at the industry as a whole, I mean in --  unemployment is down 18-year low, back orders that are 14-year high,  industry really isn't that afraid about these tariffs on the whole in my  opinion. </p><p>CARTER:  Industry is not necessarily concerned but a lot of the individuals  out there are because we just heard, and Dagen -- and when Dagen's last  interview said there is going to be short-term pain for consumers.  So  while it might have an impact on jobs, do you think it's going to have an  impact on individuals? </p><p>SANTILLI:  I think it's high -- if you look at a six pack is going to go up  by a few pennies and automobile will go up by -- the price will go up by  $40.  I honestly don't think it's going to have a huge impact on other  consumers.  Frankly, I think it's all hype. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But it's not just -- it's not just a six pack of beer and it's  an automobile, Ermanno, it's everything that follows.  It's also the  retaliatory tariffs from all these other nations.  The administration is  looking at automobile tariffs, so if you want to buy a Kia, that Kia might  go up by several thousand dollars in cost, so when -- the sum total and  it's not just -- again, so you're admitting that consumer prices are going  to go up.  I mean Peter Navarro was on this show when these tariff were  first announced before they were ever implemented saying don't you worry  your head.  The six pack of beer is not going up that much.  But again, it  affects the entire supplier chain as well and some manufacturers are left  wondering how they're going to source their materials. </p><p>SANTILLI:  Yes.  I think that's true.  I think that there is a risk for  some retaliatory tariffs, but tariff mechanisms are used every day by every  country in the world, 50 percent of products imported in the United States  are subject to some sort of a tariff.  Now, it's not 25 percent.  It's  usually much lower.  I think the average is about 2-1/2 percent.   Retaliatory tariffs are a concern but hopefully Trump will be using this as  sort of a negotiations tool to avoid that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you have any sense?  Have you talked to anybody in the  administration at all?  Do you have a sense of when we might have more  certainty on that? </p><p>SANTILLI:  No, I have not.  I know that my customers and our suppliers,  they're just kind of rolling with it.  Prices are going up for aluminum and  steel.  But again, in our sector, we're not going to stop building just  because something goes up by a few pennies.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Ermanno, thank you for being here.  Ermanno Santilli, take care. </p><p>SANTILLI:  My pleasure.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up, President Bill Clinton ramping up his rhetoric.  The  former President arguing that impeachment hearings would have already  started if a Democrat was the commander-in-chief.  That's ahead.  Plus, a  crude awaken, American Airlines warning customers might face higher ticket  prices if oil prices stay high.  We break down the details, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  At least five people including a pregnant woman shot at a  football game in Texas last night.  Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl. </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  Well, the pregnant  woman was shot in the chest and underwent an emergency C-section.  The baby  reportedly is OK, but the woman herself is in critical condition this  morning.  Now, this happened after two people opened fire at a football  game.  It happened in South Dallas.  There's injured at least three women  and two men.  The motive for the shooting still unclear at this point,  police are searching for the suspects in this.  Well, (INAUDIBLE) this  morning, Jordan's Prime Minister Hani Al-Mulki has resigned after several  days of protests in that country.  \"AL JAZEERA\" is reporting that Jordan's  King Abdullah asked the prime minister to step down.  These recent  demonstrations over tax increases are the biggest in years in that country  and a lot of police fired, and tear gas, and blocked roads is now the  result of these protests as it really erupted in Jordan as you can see on  your screen. </p><p>Well, an American Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing  after its windshield was shattered by a powerful hailstorm.  One passenger  able to get this picture shows.  You can see here the excessive damage to  the nose of the plane.  Luckily, the flight was able to lane safely.  No  injuries were reported.  But meanwhile, American Airlines has warning now  that a continued rise in oil prices could result in higher ticket prices  for the passengers this summer.  The spike in prices also resulting in a  somber forecast for global airline profits in general.  According to the  International Air Transport Association, the industry is expected to post a  $33.8 billion profit this year, but that's down $0.12 from the previous  forecast.  This of course due largely to rising fuel costs for the airline,  and may oil reached 730 bucks per barrel for the first time in four years.   Now, we're at 65.52.  But again, these higher prices if they continue to  the summer in particular airlines can only hedge so much, Dagen, you know  they can maybe hedge 60 percent, 70 percent, but not whole enchilada, so  your ticket may get a little pricier this summer. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl. </p><p>CASONE:  Now, all the good news for you this morning.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Cheryl Casone.  Coming up, President Bill Clinton  speaking out, why the former President is arguing that impeachment hearings  would have already started if a Democrat was commander-in-chief?  Plus,  tensions bubble over trade ahead of President Trump attending the G7  meeting in Canada.  We're breaking down the tariff tussle ahead. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A different kind of double standard, former President Bill  Clinton claiming if a Democrat was in office, impeachment proceedings would  have already been happening. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BILL CLINTON, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think they have  tried by and large to cover this investigation based on the facts.  I think  if roles were reversed now, this is me just talking but based on my  experience.  If there were a Democratic President in these facts for  President, most people on Washington believe impeachment hearings would  have begun already. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President teaming up with author James Patterson, you saw  him there for a spy thriller, a fictitious spy thriller involving the  President of the United States.  Joining me now is Bre Payton, a staff  writer for The Federalist.  Bre, what do you make of Clinton's comments? </p><p>BRE PAYTON, STAFF WRITER, THE FEDERALIST:  Yes.  I think he's totally  wrong.  I think that if the roles were reverse and if the Republican really  were a Democrat, I don't even think that there would be an investigation at  all to be, you know, quite frank.  And, you know what, the part of his  comments that bothered me the most was at the end when he said that, you  know, the media has been covered this fairly and that their coverage of the  Mueller -- ongoing Mueller probe has been, you know, based in fact and all  of these sort of things like that.  I think that that's totally off base.   I think it's clear that a lot of members of the media are active  participants in these ongoing investigations, you know, they're not passive  recorders of history like Bill Clinton seems to think that they are. </p><p>TIMPF:  Bre, hi, it's Kat.  Why is Bill Clinton talking?  I mean do you  really think that having him out there is something that helps Democrats?   Do you think that it could be actually doing some harm? </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes.  I think it could potentially be doing some harm, you know,  in the same interview when he was asked if he has ever apologize to Monica  Lewinsky, you know, throughout 20 years of having ample opportunity to do  so he said that he hadn't, you know, so I think, you know, having out there  rehashing a lot of these same things I think it just reminds everyone of  what happened 20 years ago, and how not great things were, and have been  for Democrats since then. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and then you throw in Hillary Clinton who -- I, you know,  who can't get away from a microphone.  It's like a -- there's a magnet that  what did she say in one of the recent speeches she gave in the last couple  of weeks, I'm not over it. </p><p>PAYTON:  No kidding. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which it should have been the title of her book by the way, Bre. </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes.  I definitely agree.  I think that honestly, you know, it is  time to accept the lessons of 2016 on both sides of the aisle except that  both parties are radically different now than they were three years ago.   It's not the same political environment of America.  I mean really it feels  like every day we're rehashing the same thing or rehashing November 2016  all over again.  I think it would be great if people would take the lessons  away from that, and move along, and do what they need to do. </p><p>CARTER:  You know, one of the things that I'm curious about.  I mean I know  that they did covered, did you apologize to Monica Lewinsky?  But this  President was known to be or may be if we were to look at it in the context  of how would be perceived today, his behavior in the Me Too movement all of  that, you know, we were talking about this earlier.  It's astounding that  wasn't brought up during this interview.  Why do you think that was? </p><p>PAYTON:  I think it wasn't brought up because I think that Bill Clinton  gets a free pass along a lot of members of the media.  I think you're  absolutely right that it is time to revisit what happened to Monica.  I  mean she was patient zero in all of this, you know, in today's modern media  and all these things like that.  I definitely think that her story needs to  be retold and revisited, and, you know, I think that the fact that they  didn't ask him that and gave him a free pass on that goes to show you that  the media definitely has a double standard, and that if the roles were  reversed that things would not at all be the same. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And now, Bre, I point to the fact that Town &amp; Country invited  Monica Lewinsky to this event and then disinvited her once Bill Clinton  agreed to show up, and then tried to like offer her up little chicklets if  you will to get her to avoid talking about it and I think that just shows  you why -- maybe not a whole party, but that man still gets a free pass  from a lot of people. </p><p>PAYTON:  Oh, yes, absolutely.  I mean, you know, I guess in today's  environment even after we've had the Me Too movement certain victims of  sexual abuse are going to get elevated.  Their stories are going to get  elevated above others.  It's really sad that our country is so politically  divided to the point that that is a political issue as well, right?  And  that if you're a victim of a certain man, you're going to get marginalized  and pushed to the sidelines, but if you're a victim of another man, it's  going to be wall-to-wall coverage of, you know, this same thing, right?   That disparity in and off itself is not fair.  We shouldn't not have a  double standard when it comes to women who have, you know, suffered at the  hands of powerful men. </p><p>KELLY:  Bre, it's Kevin Kelly here.  And I think the kind of looming  situation about Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton keep going out to talk  about themselves and what happened in November 2016 is overshadowing the  Democrats especially going into this midterm elections, do you think would  -- the Clintons are doing is counterproductive to helping the Democrats in  the elections coming up? </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes, absolutely.  I mean I think it's very clear that the base of  the Democratic Party has moved past the Clintons.  So, you know, I think it  would behoove the Democratic Party if they would picked up on that queue,  you know, and would say, OK, it's very clear that our voters do not like  these people.  Let's move on and figure out what they do like who they do  want to see on the ticket coming forward who they do want to see on the TV  and what issues that they actually do care about.  It's very clear that  Democrats honestly don't care about many of the factions of the people that  they try to pretend to care about or say that they care about, and I think  this is just another example of that. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So this spy political thriller that President Clinton worked on  with James Patterson, it involves cyber espionage and a traitor in the  White House, is this a commentary on the current political environment  according to Clinton and corner -- and based on what you said, Bre, about  the division in this country? </p><p>PAYTON:  Yes.  I definitely think it could be a not so subtle, you know,  swipe at what's going on, you know, I personally I'm kind of tired of  fictionalized stories that are kind of rift from the headlines especially  regarding this issue just because I personally feel just totally saturated,  you know, with coverage of this.  I don't think that, you know, the things  that I enjoy for fiction and for pleasure reading need to have this as  well.  Personally, that's how I feel about it. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Bre, good to see you.  I know that -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The outrage machine in the last week has been and I only know  how they're getting the gasoline to keep it charged up --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PAYTON:  Their perpetual revolution marches on as always. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good to see you, Bre.  Bre Payton, as always.  So President  Trump tweeting this morning, this is my 500th day in office and we have  accomplished a lot, many believe more than any President in the first 500  days.  Kat -- that's Kat Timpf (INAUDIBLE) he lists what he accomplished,  massive tax and regulation cuts, military and vet, lower crime, and illegal  immigration, stronger boarders, judgeships, best economy and jobs ever, and  much more.  We had repeal and replace done and the savings to our country  of one trillion dollars except for one person, but it is getting done  anyway.  Individual mandate is gone and greet less expensive plans will be  announced this month, drug prices coming down and right to try. </p><p>KELLY:  He didn't bring up the wall though. </p><p>TIMPF:  Just the way that he tweets and the way that he speaks always makes  me laugh.  I don't know -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can' help it.  You can't help it -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TIMPF:  Many people believe -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>KELLY:  But he left the wall out.</p><p>TIMPF:  He did leave the wall out. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARTER:  He did talk about borders. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, there was no wall funding and the -- for the most part  there was replacement fencing funding and the omnibus spending bill, no  restrictions on sanctuary cities in that -- in that spending bill.  So  again, but I will quote Ed Rollins he said that 20/20 bumper sticker should  be promises made, promises kept.  That's a lot of it whether you agree with  the President or not, he has gotten a lot -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARTER:  -- look forward on the healthcare.  Don't go backwards. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they've got to come up with a plan because --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CARTER:  They have to come up with a plan.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Those premium increases are going to get announced in October  right before people go to the polls. </p><p>CARTER:  So much forward and get something done.  Don't look back to what  happened. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You don't want Nancy Pelosi as the Speaker of the House.  </p><p>CARTER:  No.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Certainly not. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So coming up, Dell reported quarterly earnings before the bell  this morning beating revenue expectations.  We'll break down those numbers  ahead.  Plus, high stakes in the soybean industry.  We will -- you get a  live look with Connell McShane on the farm.  The impact of the tariff  tussle between the U.S. and China on the farming communities, next. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Monday, June 4th.  Your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets still  gaining at 139-point gain on Dow futures right now.  We're looking at a  nice rally to start this new week.  This after stocks rallied on Friday,  after that much better-than-expected jobs' report.  Again, to point that  out, job growth accelerated last month from where it's been on average in  the last 12 months.  It's an incredible in economic expansion that's been  going on for more than nine years.  Global markets following those gains;  look at England, France, and Germany, we have gains across the board there.   And in Asia overnight, it was the same story -- buying galore.  All four  markets, major markets in Asia, up this Monday.  Nevertheless, trade  turmoil.  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross returns from China with no deal  and it comes as our allies ramp up the threat of retaliation over steel and  aluminum tariffs.  The White House Trade Policy Director Peter Navarro  standing firm on the need for these tariffs.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NAVARRO:  All the president is doing is defending this country's national  security sovereignty and economic security from the flood of imports.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We look at the implications for business and markets straight  ahead.  Targeting the gas tax.  A battle looming in California over a $0.12  hike.  How it could impact the midterms as voters there, head to the polls  tomorrow?  Amazon in focus.  One analyst raising its price target to $2000  a share.  But where does it put the company in the race to one trillion  against Apple?  We will tell.  Dell arising in the premarket.  The company  reporting better-than-expected revenue.  The details, later this hour.   Targeting tariffs.  U.S. allies criticizing the Trump administration over  its latest round of tariffs ahead of the G7 summit later this week in  Quebec, Canada.  Farmers are among hardest hit because of the tariffs so  far.  Connell McShane is in Ogden, Iowa with the very latest details.  Hey,  Connell.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey there, Dagen.  Yes.  You  know, it's interesting, we want to try to make this story come to life as  much as we can -- you talk about the trade talks over the weekend, so we  come up to this soybean farm in beautiful part of Iowa.  And we're just  going to get down here and show you the rows of soybeans that are being  grown here.  And the idea when you think trade with China: look at these  rows, they won't be harvest until September that's why they're so low to  the ground.  One out of every three rows of soybeans that we're looking at,  end up going from United States, to China, eventually.  The business  numbers wise, works out to about $12 billion a year.  So, when we talk  about trade tensions in the United States, they're felt out here in Iowa.   I want to introduce you to Ron Hecht, who's out here with us, a farmer, in  Iowa, he's also on the president's advisory council for agriculture.  Ron,  thanks so much, first of all, for having you out -- having us out to your  farm -- a beautiful place.  </p><p>RON HECHT, IOWA FARMER:  Thank you.  It's a great place to be this morning.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  We were in Beijing there about a month ago or so.  And at the  time, they were telling us that some of the orders for later of the year  had actually stopped -- for soybeans coming from the United States -- but  how is your business been impacted by all of this trade talk, trade  tensions?  </p><p>HECHT:  Well, actually, the price of soybeans has gone up since the talks  started -- buyers around the rest of the world are stepping up and buying  more soybeans than they were.  So, we've -- so far, we've had a price  increase.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  How does business work?  In other words, this time of the year,  they're not normally -- the Chinese buying from United States, right, comes  later in the year?  </p><p>HECHT:  Right.  China, is a seasonal buyer.  They buy from the United  States about six months a year, during our harvest time, and then they buy  about six months a year from South America.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  From Brazil, and Argentina -- the final point, what's your big  worry in all of this?  Could they shift some that buying to the Brazilians,  to the Argentinians, and how do you see the whole thing playing out?  </p><p>HECHT:  Absolutely.  So far, so good.  Everything has been fine.  But if  they shift their purchases during their normal purchasing time from U.S. --  which is starting in September -- that could be a problem for us, and  that's when we might feel the price impact.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  So, watch these trade talks like the rest of us.   We'll be talking to Ron and some of the folks out here, Dagen, throughout  the day but that's the idea -- they're watching it like all of us but  watching it obviously a little bit more intently because this is their  livelihood.  A $12 billion a year business.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Connell, do you mind if -- I'm curious to ask Ron something can  you just -- is he making any changes in the way he's managing his farm at  all?  Has he made any -- is he changing --</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, you know, that's --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You might already know that.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  It's interesting.  We've talked a little bit about that off  camera, but Dagen was asking you, and just a quick answer, Ron, if you're  making any changes in the way you're managing your farm because of this?  I  know it's tough to anticipate what's next.  </p><p>HECHT:  No, I'm not really making any changes, but I'm being more watchful  of what's going on in the marketing.  But no changes are called for yet.   Actually, nothing has happened, so far.  And there is a chance that as a  result of these negotiations, it will actually be helpful for U.S. and  Chinese soybean trade.  So, it's hard to know which way to jump right now.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  And that's kind of a final point, Dagen, is that the Chinese  already charged a tax, right?  There's a 16 percent tariff on soybeans  coming out to United States into China now.  Their threat is to make 25.   But people like Ron are hoping, obviously, maybe that number at 16 goes  lower.  So, that's why they're so uncertain -- they may come out on top by  the time this is all done.  But right now, they just don't know.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I said when you were talking, you do such incredible reporting.   So, I'll say that to your face, McShane.  Connell McShane, in Iowa.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  All right.  Take care.  You can catch Connell all day --  actually, for the next few days in Iowa.  Rhetoric over Trump tariffs  heating up over the weekend with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau  calling the president's move an insult.  White House Economic Advisor,  Larry Kudlow, saying: we must put America first.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR:  Mr. Trudeau, I think he's  overreacting.  I don't want to get in the middle of that.  As a fine friend  and ally of the United States, nobody denies that.  But the point is, we  have to protect ourselves.  We must protect ourselves.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Larry Kudlow also said this is like a family squabble, a feud.   Joining me now with more about this tiff over tariffs, Brandywine Global  Portfolio Manager, Jack McIntyre.  Jack, to be clear, Friday, today, there  is no worry showing up in the stock market here at home.  </p><p>JACK MCINTYRE, GLOBAL PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BRANDYWINE:  Yes, that's correct,  because we know the U.S. economy is doing well.  There's a strong  employment report.  Right.  The risk obviously is from trade standpoint: is  it going to escalate?  I think the markets are kind of keying off Kudlow  and Mnuchin versus Navarro and Lighthizer.  As long as that's the case, I  think the equity market will do OK.  </p><p>KELLY:  Jack, you know, one of the interesting things -- it's Kevin Kelly  here.  One of the interesting things that's been a theme this year for the  markets is the rising rate environment we've seen.  We've touched 3.15 on  the 10-year treasury on an intraday basis.  What are your worries for the  fixed income markets, and are they going to be exacerbated given trade  talks, given kind of what's happening right now with our ballooning deficit  with -- as well as bunch of other -- structural things like are going to be  happening the next decade where we have to issue tons of debt?  </p><p>MCINTYRE:  Yes.  No, it's a great point.  You know, the back end of that,  about the -- budget deficit increasing trade deficit deteriorate.  I mean,  ultimately, that should be weaker or drive U.S. dollar lower, which to me  is part of the solution that would help, maybe, alleviate some of the trade  tension in there.  But so, I think -- from a fixed-income investor  standpoint.  I don't see a lot of inflation pressures building right now.   The fed is going to go slow.  I think they've kind of given as the road  map.  So, yes, yields are going to drift higher, but not to the point where  it's going to derail the U.S. economy.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jack, there is a front-page story in the Wall Street Journal,  today talking about global economic -- the growth story globally is fading.   Dimming markets' optimism is the headline -- the global manufacturing, the  index there, nine-month low.  Baltic dry index, a measure of shipping  costs, down 22 percent since peak last month.  Copper prices, also down.   Can the U.S. keep growing at a clip that the Atlanta fed thinks this  quarter is going to be 4.8 percent growth which is extraordinary?  Can we  keep growing at that kind of pace if the rest of the world is slowing?  </p><p>MCINTYRE:  So, yes, I'm not sure we're going to actually print four percent  in the U.S.  But, so I think -- if you look at China, and the U.S. and  combine those, those are two big, obviously, economies where data is still  coming in better than expected.  That's why I take the other side of that  article because I think global economy still on solid footing yet Q1 was  sort of a little bit slower.  I suspect we'll see a little uptick in  growth.  I don't see global inventory overhang.  The key is, the corporate  sector CAPEX.  I suspect, we'll see CAPEX cycle tying in trade sensations,  though, that creates uncertainty in a business community, and if it  accelerates then corporate might not build up CAPEX quite to the degree  that they would absent those trade sensations.  But bottom line, I think  the global economy is still on very solid footing.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, on that note, there's a survey from the National  Association of Business Economics shows many are worried about a recession,  by 2020.  Your take on that report?  Because again, a -- we're more than  nine years into this expansion.  That would be -- that would be -- a  recession by 2020 would be an expansion of 12 years.  But what's your take?   Because again, to introduce the worry of tariffs and what that will do to  business that you know, prices and business activity here in the U.S.  </p><p>MCINTYRE:  Right.  So, I don't think expansion have to die of old age.  And  the one characteristic of this expansion, as you pointed out, it's been  long.  But it's been a pretty slow expansion.  So, it's not strong but it  is long.  But you're right, there's risk from on the trade standpoint.   Clearly, if this escalates into a trade war, that's going to bring forward  the next recession.  But if I'm right about CAPEX, kind of coming to the  forefront -- and inflation not getting out of hand, because you know the  fed obviously ends up ending a lot of these expansions and if inflation  remains tame the fed won't do it this time around.  So, it is a  possibility.  It's you know, 18 months away, but I don't think it has to  happen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Jack.  Good to see you, Jack McIntyre.  The president  continues to tweet this morning, writing this: \"As has been stated by  numerous legal scholars, I have the absolutely right to pardon myself.  But  why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?  In the meantime, the  never-ending witch hunt led by 13 very angry and conflicted Democrats and  others, continues into mid-terms.\"  And he tweeted this again.  Mr.  President, are you watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA?  \"China already charges a  tax of 16 percent on soybeans; Canada has all sorts of trade barriers on  our agricultural products.  Not acceptable.\"  Because that's exactly what  Connell McShane was just talking about with that soybean farmer.  So, it  could go to 25 percent, at least that's the U.S. threat, but could it go  lower than 16 percent?  We'll be right back.  </p><p>DANI KLUPENGER, TENNIS CHANNEL REPORTER:  Welcome back to Tennis Channel  Court Report a special presentation for Fox Business.  I'm Dani Klupenger.   It was a great day for the red, white, and blue at Ronald-Garros with two  American women reaching the quarter finals for the first time in their  careers.  </p><p>Sloane Stephens' blasted in that (INAUDIBLE) off the court to punch her  ticket into the elite eight.  The U.S Open champion took the last 11 games  of the match to wrap up the impressive win in under an hour.  </p><p>Earlier, Madison Keys comfortably took care of business against Romania's  Mihaela Buzarnescu to set up a quarterfinal meeting with Yulia Putintseva  Kuznetsova.  Four aces and 17 winners for last year's finals at flushing  meadows.  </p><p>Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova renewed their rivalry, Monday, in  Harrisburg Place in the quarter, and you can watch it live on Tennis  Channel.  Our coverage from Ronald-Garros ticks the air at 5:00 a.m.  Eastern.  I'm Dani Klupenger.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The President still tweeting this morning, \"The U.S. has made  such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only win!\"</p><p>Shares of Dell, meantime, up two percent this morning, after beating first- quarter revenue expectations.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange with much more.  Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Monday morning,  Dagen.  That's right, so we're watching Delta this morning -- Dell to the  upside this morning after the revenue really wowed Wall Street.  The stock  is up about two percent, so they saw the pc shipments on the rise.  In  fact, products overall, saw an increase of 22 percent.  And that's the --  that is the motherload of what they do for revenue, about 78 percent of the  revenue comes from products.  So, that's where they saw the increase of 22  percent.  Service revenue also gained and so with that, you see, it was a  winning quarter.  The stock over 52 weeks is up about 24 percent.  </p><p>And then Amazon.  When we're watching Amazon, we had some positive comments  from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.  The analyst there puts a $2000 price  target.  This is the fourth time this year that he's uped his price target.   He actually is liking private label for the company.  That would include  Amazon's Echo essentials apparel, Elements nutritional supplements, but  when will it get to that trillion-dollar market cap.  Will it beat out  Apple to do so?  Well, in fact, if you want to see Amazon in the trillion- dollar market cap, it would have to trade at 2060.89, so not quite here but  -- yet, but it's had five record closes in a row, looking at a sixth this  morning.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Nicole.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.  </p><p>Google in hot water, and now some are calling for a probe of the tech  company in the wake of Google listing Nazism as an ideology of the  California Republican Part.  Joining me now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Pretty strong stuff I'd say.   When you're bandying about labels like Nazis and a South Carolina State  Senator -- or North Carolina State Senator was called a bigot.  That was  stamped across her picture.  This is all part of the Google picture at the  moment, and I think is one of the reasons, why Google is underperforming  the other tech stocks.  You may notice, Dagen, that recently, Microsoft  passed Google in terms of overall market value.  That was a surprise.  And  there's other things going on as well.  I remember the \"60 Minutes'\" piece  one week ago, where -- well, it emerged that Google is watching you, knows  everything about you, but who is watching Google?</p><p>Well, now, Representative Devin Nunes says, look, you're operating like a  monopoly.  Keep going like this and we're going to have hearings into you.   Well, that's interesting because that's a real threat to Alphabet's  business, Google's business going forward.  It's profitability going  forward, I think they're pressing for the breakup of the company.  This is  something to watch, because big tech is so powerful, they're just asking  the politicians to rein them in.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they've gotten away with a lot in recent years, and we just  sat back and did nothing.</p><p>VARNEY:  That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Stuart, great to see you.</p><p>VARNEY:  You, too.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Always, my dear Sir, 9:00 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday,  Stuart Varney, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  You can't miss a minute.</p><p>Coming up, a fight over California's $0.12 gas tax intensifies.  We head  live to Orange County, California where a midterm battle to repeal the  state's gas tax is brewing.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A midterm battle over California's $0.12 gas tax is brewing.   Hillary Vaughn is live in Orange County, California with the very latest.   Hey, Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Dagen.  Well,  National Democrats tell me their pathway to the majority in November runs  right here through California.  They are targeting 10 seats in the state,  four right here in Orange County, but National Republicans says this, $0.12  tax -- gas tax increase at the pumps that state Democrats pushed through is  actually going to pump the brakes on their road to victory in November  because Republicans say it's energizing their base.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MATT GORMAN, COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, RNC:  There's a lot of energy on the  Republican side.  People want to talk about how Democrats are enthused.   Well, I don't see Democrats marching in the streets overpaying upwards of  $5.00 a gallon for gasoline.  And I think this is going to resonate with  voters not just now but as well in the fall.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUGHN:  Voters are so fired up over this gas tax issue that one state  senator is facing a recall vote tomorrow to kick him out of office for  voting for the tax.  But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is  convinced voters aren't going to be worried about rising transportation  costs when weighing who to support for Congress and instead are focused on  what's happening in D.C.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDREW GODINICH, SPOKESMAN, DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE:  I  think that when voters are going to the polls this week, the issues that  they are thinking about when they're voting for Congress are the issues  that they're seeing coming out of Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUGHN:  There is one tax Democrat say voters are worried about the GOP tax  plan that they say has hit voters in California the hardest.  The  California Republican leadership says Democrats in the state are to blame  for the high taxes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JIM BRULTE, CHAIRMAN, CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY:  I think there's a  collective Democrat strategy to blame Washington, D.C., and Donald Trump  for all of the ills in California.  The fact of the matter is the Democrats  own California, they've had total control of it for over seven years, and  they don't want to take credit for their record here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>VAUGHN:  Dagen, this $52-billion tax plan is meant to push cars off the  road, but the GOP hopes it will push Democrats off the ballot in November.   Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Hillary.  Hillary Vaughn for us in Orange County,  California.  Coming up, final thoughts from our all-stars.  We'll be right  back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  A giant fake hug to Kevin Kelly and Lee Carter for being with me  this morning.  So much to talk about trade, but these markets are loving  what's coming out of Washington, at least so far.  That does it for  MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" is up right now.  Stuart, it is  all yours, Sir.</p><p>VARNEY:  All right.  We're off and we are running this Monday morning.   Looks like kind of a follow on from last week.  Good morning, everyone.   Our allies are united on this, they don't like the tariffs we're imposing  on them.</p><p>END</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Check out General Electric. The company reported earnings in the last hour. They were better than expected on revenue. The stock has been rising ever since the report's out. It is now up 4.5 percent. That is going to certainly impact markets this morning. GE up 4.5 percent on the heels of revenue coming in better than expected for the fourth quarter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're watching big tech today. Facebook soaring on a record profit last night even in the face of the privacy scandal. As you see, Facebook shares are up almost 12 percent right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The one to watch this afternoon is Amazon. It's reporting after the close tonight.</p><p>As you can see, Tesla down almost 5 percent, CFO stepping down, weaker than expected results there.</p><p>Microsoft down 2 percent this morning, also on earnings.</p><p>Raytheon missing estimates this morning at $2.93 a share versus an estimate of $2.89 a share on earnings.</p><p>We will keep following all the numbers that are hitting the tape as we speak.</p><p>Futures pointing to a mixed open this morning. Dow Industrials are down 7 points. The S&amp;P 500 up 3. And the Nasdaq right now up 32 as you can see there.</p><p>After a sharp rally on Wall Street yesterday on the heels of the Federal Reserve basically saying it's on hold dependent on data for interest rate hikes. Dow Industrials shot up 500 points midday, up 434 points at the close, 1.75 percent. The S&amp;P was up 41. And the Nasdaq up 155 points, 2.25 percent higher at the close yesterday.</p><p>Boeing and Apple really set the tone early in the session yesterday and even the Fed fueling even more gains late in the day. The central bank saying that it is done raising interest rates for now which is something Bridgewater's Ray Dalio told me just last week in Davos.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAY DALIO, BRIDGEWATER: I think you will see a slowing that is more than they would expect and I think it will be a global he slowing because we have to look at ourselves within the context of Europe, it's slowing; China, it's slowing.</p><p>And when those things happen and connected, I think that it's -- they won't raise rates.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: In fact, he said that as early as November that he was expecting the Federal Reserve to change its stance.</p><p>European markets this morning are higher across the board. FT 100 up 43 points, two-thirds of 1 percent. CAC 40 in Paris is up 11 points, that's quarter of a percent. And the DAX index up 11 points as well, fractional gain in Germany this morning.</p><p>In Asia overnight, mixed performances, take a look. best performer was Hong Kong and Japan, each up better than 1 percent.</p><p>And then back in the U.S. there's this. The arctic blast has turned deadly. Temperatures across the Midwest falling to the lowest levels in decades. We're going to take you there. It is really an incredible story this morning on weather.</p><p>Countdown to the Super Bowl meanwhile just three days away. We're taking a look at the big business of gambling and how it's changing the sports world.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down. Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street Journal's\" assistant editorial page editor James Freeman, and former Arkansas governor, Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. Good to see you this morning.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Good to be with you. Thank you.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, ASSISTANT EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Going to be interesting. We've heard a lot about how the shutdown was supposed to have a big impact on the economy. And we're going to start getting some numbers. Got the ADP report number yesterday, maybe not so big.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. The ADP numbers were very strong.</p><p>FREEMAN: Better than expected. Job creation in the private sector.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll see if the jobs numbers tomorrow, actually, meet what we saw yesterday from the ADP numbers.</p><p>FREEMAN: That's right. And we'll get the NFIB small business numbers on our \"Journal\" Web site later this morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: We had a discussion about Howard Schultz's comments about the economy, what the tax cuts did for the economy, President Trump's policies.</p><p>But I'll say this. We finally have wages growing. And we're going to hear this tomorrow. Wages growing north of 3 percent in this country which is not something that we've seen in a decade. Not during all the years that President Obama was president did wages in this nation grow north of 3 percent. And that's a really -- that's a very positive sign and people are feeling it.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes. And I think it's a very, very important sign that employment for minorities, both Hispanics and African Americans, are at record highs. And that is very significant because there's nothing that is more stimulating to the economy than people having employment and having a job.</p><p>It not only cuts the cost of government where the government has to subsidize people, but it empowers people and gives them something that they can put on the table for their families that otherwise they couldn't.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a very good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think that in this presidential election as all these Democrats get their -- sharpen their elbows and start basically sticking each other in the neck, that that's going to be -- and the attacks on Howard Schultz by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, that he didn't climb the ladder -- I'm paraphrasing --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's ridiculous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- this is what it's going to come down to. Do you root for the success of individuals in this country and is our policy and our regulation, is it set up to basically encourage that success, to climb out of a housing project in Canarsie, to run and basically create one of the greatest American success stories of the last 50 years which is what Howard Schultz did.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You're right.</p><p>HUCKABEE: And the question of socialism is ultimately does it lead to equality or does it lead to mediocrity. And if you look around the world historically it does not lead to equality. Equality lifting everybody's boat. It leads to mediocrity if not disaster. And Venezuela is a wonderful example of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. There was a time Venezuela was quite vibrant.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Oh, incredible. Prosperous.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. But let me just tell you that the earnings have come out. Blackstone Group reporting better than expected revenue -- $505 million, versus $381 million estimate. The revenue was better than expected.</p><p>The UPS numbers are better than expected on the earnings line, $1.94 versus an estimate of $1.91.</p><p>We've got a mixed story. The Industrial Average has worsened here. Dow is now down 25 points. But the S&amp;P and the Nasdaq are higher as we do get some mixed stories in terms of fourth quarter earnings this morning.</p><p>All right. We'll take a short break.</p><p>When we come back Wisconsin Congressman Sean Duffy is here. Former New Mexico governor and ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson is here. As well as the CEO of FanDuel, Matthew King. Popsockets CEO David Barnett is with us along with Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Ross Stripling.</p><p>Don't miss a moment it. We've got a big show. And we want to kick it off right here with our top story this hour. And that is big tech on tap. A slew of technology giants reporting earnings this week. We already heard from Facebook last night and the stock is soaring this morning. It posted a record profit.</p><p>It reported last night. It comes after a rocky year for the social media company over privacy concerns. That stock is up 11 and two-thirds percent.</p><p>We are watching Amazon this morning because it is set to report after the close tonight. We want to know how Amazon did in the fourth quarter certainly, not just because of the Amazon numbers but because it is an indicator of how the economy did for the holiday season. It's up one and two-thirds percent right now and Amazon, as you see, at $1,697.</p><p>Check Tesla rattling investors yesterday after falling short on earnings and announcing the exit of its chief financial officer. The company did however post back to back profits for the first time in its 15 year history. The stock is down 4.5 percent. CEO Elon Musk announcing his goal for the year is to see profit in every quarter.</p><p>Let's talk more about that, as we talk with ARK Invest analyst Tasha Keeney. Tasha -- good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>TASHA KEENEY, ANALYST, ARK INVEST: Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what's most important in your portfolio of companies in terms of an indicator of more than just that company?</p><p>KEENEY: So, yes. When we look at the tech industry overall, so first of all, we're focused on disruptive innovation. So in times I'd say of economic distress, we often find that the fundamentals of our companies are improving even if, you know, there's more volatility in the market. And we actually like to take advantage of that volatility.</p><p>So particularly when earnings comes around we have sort of a mixed earnings season, you'll see us doing that through our trading.</p><p>So in particular for Tesla, you know, a lot of people are concerned, the CFO is leaving. You could take that as he now thinks that the company is sort of ready to fly without him.</p><p>You know, it went through a tough period and he's now ready to head out. So does it change our long-term thesis that Tesla's going to be a leader in autonomous electric vehicles? No.</p><p>FREEMAN: When you talk about Tesla and autonomous technology, this is -- I know you see it, a lot of people see it as a huge market. But what is it that Tesla has that gives them a specific edge in autonomous transportation?</p><p>KEENEY: Yes. So actually last night on the call Musk highlighted this. We think that their advantage is really in data collection. They're the only automaker that is collecting data from its cars on the road.</p><p>So last night Musk said that he thinks every other player that's collecting autonomous data has 5 percent of what Tesla has. That's what you use to train your machine learning algorithm and ultimately make the car improve. So really with that, we think Tesla can speed away from the competition.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>Yes. Because that's going to inform on insurance. That's going to have a lot of implications in terms of all that data that you can get from the car.</p><p>KEENEY: Exactly. There are a lot of off-shooting effects of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are you expecting from Amazon? Tell us your reaction to Facebook.</p><p>KEENEY: Yes. So Amazon, you know, I'd say overall -- you know, we don't necessarily make quarter to quarter predictions but I will say as we're talking about Tesla, Amazon -- I mean, this is a company that's also moving into the autonomous space. They're really transforming logistics.</p><p>So we expect them to continue to disrupt companies like UPS, like the other carriers. So we're excited to see what's coming.</p><p>For Facebook, you know, mobile ad revenue surprised. It grew 36 percent, more than expected. This shows that their ad products are really best in class, you know, no matter the controversy that we're seeing in the news.</p><p>And actually from my perspective, Facebook is an interesting company because they could see more viewership or more customers in the back seat of autonomous cars.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Why is Facebook up? I don't get that. Because there's so many things going wrong with them in terms of the invasion of privacy, selling of private data, yet their stocks are up. So explain that for me.</p><p>KEENEY: Yes. You know, again, I'd say that this quarter really shows that their ad products are just best in class. And they're one of the only ways to reach users on a widespread basis in today's sort of Internet age.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because the metrics are telling you so much about the customer, telling the advertisers so much, so you can really target who you want to talk to.</p><p>KEENEY: Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And those users are sticky and they have Instagram which is increasingly popular.</p><p>One really interesting thing that happened yesterday, we talked about it on this program about this Facebook app that they were pushing on young adults and teens to gather information. They were paying them like $20 a pop to do that.</p><p>And I think we talked about this yesterday. Apple has banned that app used by Facebook from its -- basically said that you can't -- they revoked Facebook's permission to maintain that research app that targeted teens and young adults.</p><p>This is really important because this is self-regulation. We keep talking about the regulation of these technology companies and the regulation by Washington of like Facebook and other social media giants.</p><p>This is self-regulation. Apple's stepping in and saying no more. And I think that's very telling about what the road ahead might look like.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. When you've been saying they need to self-regulate for a long time.</p><p>By the way, you mentioned Instagram. I have been so active on Instagram @MariaBartiromo.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're blowing it up.</p><p>FREEMAN: Oh yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Check it out. Today is throwback Thursday and I put a picture there, back from 1985 and I want to he see your throwback Thursday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I posted it. And it's really --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok. @MariaBartiromo, @DagenMcDowell, @MorningsMaria.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's really, really awful but I did it for you. My photo is absolutely hideous.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Don't give it away. We're going o talk about it later on in the show. Hey, do have you a throwback Thursday photo that you want to share?</p><p>FREEMAN: I'm working on it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE: I was a child in the 1980s. I don't remember it very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Come on. I'm loving Instagram. I'm having fun with it.</p><p>Tasha -- good to see you.</p><p>KEENEY: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Tasha Keeney joining us.</p><p>Make sure you tune in tomorrow. We'll be bringing you live coverage of the January jobs report. It starts at 8:00 a.m. Eastern tomorrow right where we identify where the jobs are right now.</p><p>Before we take a break, check out President Trump's tweet this morning. He just tweeted, \"He said so great to watch and listen to all these people who write books and talk about my presidential campaign and so many other things related to winning and how I should be doing it. As I take it all in, I then sit back, look around and say gee, I'm in the White House and they're not.\"</p><p>Yes, the President just wrote that a moment ago.</p><p>We're going to take a break. When we come back, yes, it is deadly cold -- the record-breaking temperatures causing chaos across the country. We have the very latest.</p><p>Then the big business of sports betting, millions of Americans will be watching the big game on Sunday, hoping to make some money. We'll take a look at how the gambling industry is changing the sports world, right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A deadly polar vortex is sweeping through the Midwest right now.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now -- Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: It is cold and it is dangerous. At least nine people have died in causes related to this arctic blast. One 18-year-old college student found dead outside of a building on the University of Iowa campus.</p><p>The wind chill temps fell to minus 50 degrees in Chicago and, get this, near minus 70 across parts of the upper Midwest. Flight Aware says that since yesterday there have been more than 21,000 flight delays plus more than 6,000 cancellations.</p><p>Seven people, take a look at this video, stranded in an ice shack, safely rescued without injuries despite brutally cold temperatures in Wisconsin. Temperatures in the area were about minus 4 degrees and on the water, with a wind chill of minus 30. Coast Guard officials say the seven people were near Surgeon Bay, Wisconsin near Lake Michigan but they couldn't get back to shore because of problems with their vehicle.</p><p>General Motors plants in Michigan are halting production due to the extremely cold weather. And there's shortage of natural gas following a fire out of a compressor station. A dozen plants in all are affected. The utility there is asking customers to voluntarily reduce their use of natural gas.</p><p>Take a look at General Motors' stock, down 10 percent from a year ago.</p><p>And this, firefighters battle a massive blaze at a historic factory in below freezing temperatures. The Markel Paper Plant burning overnight in New Jersey. The bitter cold forcing firefighters to let the blaze burn itself out as high winds sparked small fires at nearby homes. No injuries reported. It's unclear how the fire started.</p><p>The 86-year=old paper factory has survived several fires in the past but this one happening in the cold weather, pretty historic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. that is incredible how fierce this fire is even in these incredible temperatures.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes. And then it spread because of the strong wind.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. Of course. Yes.</p><p>All right. Thank you so much, Lauren. Well, lot of stories over the cold. Dagen -- your reaction?</p><p>MCDOWELL: We see these stories, we report them and it's always a reminder to think about our first responders, the people who put their lives on the line to protect us all and go out and whether it's police officers, whether it's firefighters, particularly in these horrific weather conditions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: For sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Save people's lives.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Quick break.</p><p>Place your bets, next up. Sports betting in focus with the Super Bowl this Sunday. Millions expected to place a wager on the big game. The business ramifications next.</p><p>And then hitting board games -- luxury hitting board games, Fashion designer Louis Vuitton with a new twist on Jenga. Plus a robot who taught himself to play the game.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>President Trump just tweeting. He says this, \"Large sections of the wall have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go. Renovation of existing walls is also a very big part of the plan to finally after many decades properly secure our border. The wall is getting done one way or another,\" writes the President.</p><p>Well, \"let's just call them walls from now on and stop playing political games, a wall is a wall,\" writes the President.</p><p>All right. Super Bowl LIII is just three days away now. The big game of the season for the Rams and the Patriots. Also the biggest gaming event, gambling event of the year for fans. The American Gaming Association projecting Americans will bet upwards of $6 billion legally and illegally on the NFL finale.</p><p>Joining us right now is the CEO of FanDuel, Matthew King. Matthew -- it's great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MATTHEW KING, CEO, FANDUEL: Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How big of a deal is the Super Bowl for FanDuel?</p><p>KING: Super Bowl is a huge deal. If you look across all of our product lines, in the fantasy business we run one of our largest fantasy contests of the year on the Super Bowl.</p><p>We also have big game bingo for those people that aren't interested in fantasy or sports betting. And then for sports betting, since this is the first year we're going through it in New Jersey, nobody knows how big it's going to be.</p><p>What we know is that it's going to be a huge season for people to try the product for the first time. It's also going to be a place where in time where people will do more (INAUDIBLE) than they've ever done before. So it's betting on all the different things. So we have --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Like how many times Trump will tweet during the game. That's a prop that you can make. I don't know. I just wanted to raise that issue like it's become that granular.</p><p>KING: It is. I'm sure we can set a line on that. I don't if we can get approval for it. We'll have over 450 things you can bet on during the game.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are some of the more popular ones?</p><p>KING: Everybody loves the coin toss because it's the first thing. Most of the volume will still be on the big markets, the money line and the spread. But then we have a lot of just fun things like who's going to catch the first pass, who makes the first touchdown.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cool.</p><p>FREEMAN: And how many times does Gronk get targeted, et cetera. Do you have to be in New Jersey to bet through FanDuel.</p><p>KING: You absolutely have to. You have to be in New Jersey.</p><p>FREEMAN: In other words, the software will not let you bet if you're, saying you're from somewhere else.</p><p>KING: If you're literally on one side of the bridge, it will let you bet. If you're on the other side of the bridge, it won't let you bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's on the wrong side of the New Jersey tunnel bridge.</p><p>FREEMAN: I can get a taxi.</p><p>KING: We can go. You know, I am happy to escort you to New Jersey after that.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Who sits down and thinks of the things to bet on? And then who sits down and decides here's what the line is going to be?</p><p>KING: So in terms of the things to bet on, we have a global expertise across a number of markets because we're part of the Paddy Power BetFair portfolio of families. And so we have decades of bookmaking experience and our marquee is how many things can we think of?</p><p>And so we literally have hundreds of people thinking up what all can you bet on. And then we also frankly listen to users. And so we'll talk a lot about what do they want to bet on. And if they come up with a good idea, we'll set a line for it. So it's the beauty of having a bunch of analysts and kind of modelers who can really set a line on anything.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How has this business changed in the last, I don't know, two years or so? I mean your business has gotten much bigger.</p><p>KING: It has gotten a lot bigger. So as an industry we've continued to grow the fantasy business. As a company, we merged our business with Paddy Power BetFair's U.S. subsidiary. We created the largest online real money gaming business in the U.S. by factor of two. So really kind of span all of the product verticals that are available. And then with sports betting we've built the largest online sports betting business in the country in a very quick fashion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: After the Supreme Court --</p><p>KING: After the Supreme Court.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- decision overturning the federal ban on sports betting.</p><p>KING: Yes. So it's been quite a run in the last six months. We opened our retail location at the meadowlands in July. It's quickly become one of the largest sports books in the world from a standing start. And then the Web site has just taken off. You know, orders of magnitude beyond our expectations.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What about working with some sports leagues to try and improve their popularity? I mean I raise the issue of Nascar. Nascar is in dire need of something to really get people re-engaged with the sport and make them excited about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Even baseball on a smaller level.</p><p>KING: So baseball, we're going to see -- you know, half a season of baseball. And baseball was actually a great case study in how betting can help the sport. If you think about baseball, because you have different innings, it creates a very easy, digestible kind of instance for people to bet on.</p><p>So we actually have people betting on the first five innings. We have people betting on each inning. Baseball was really the surprise for us in terms of how much more engagement you could palpably see with people as they went through the sport, just because it makes each game so much more exciting.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Ask Pete Rose how that worked out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about Nascar?</p><p>KING: Nascar, again, every sport has an opportunity to work together.</p><p>MCDOWELL: First to wreck. First to wreck -- classic bet.</p><p>KING: A lot of it comes down to also helping the leagues with their data, right. So a lot of the leagues have all of this new data that's available and in some cases they're not 100 percent sure what to do with it. But that's actually our core business, right.</p><p>So if you think about what we've done in fantasy, what we do in sports betting, what we do in horse racing, it's use data and create ways for fans to more deeply engage with the games that they love.</p><p>FREEMAN: You take a bet up to the person's credit card limit or what is the limit here? Is there a limit?</p><p>KING: So we do have limits and we look at it from the perspective of -- the issue kind of revolves around responsible gaming. And it's an issue we take very, very serious and so we have a standard set of limits. And then we actually have an entire function that actually thinks about and works with users to make sure that people are playing within their limits because at the end of the day this is a fun product and it should be a fun product. But we have to be cognizant of responsible gaming issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What were you going to say -- Governor?</p><p>HUCKABEE: I was just going to say when talking about baseball, I said how did that work out for Pete Rose? It didn't work out real well for him.</p><p>FREEMAN: Not so much.</p><p>KING: But I think you also have to -- I mean there has to be integrity of the sport. We work very closely with the leagues around how we maintain integrity. And again, that's a place where we leverage our global expertise.</p><p>I think the other piece is, it highlights the need for regulated gaming, right, because what you see and you can see it in the AGA stats, a majority of what's going to be bet on the Super Bowl is in the illegal markets. And so part of the reason to push legislation is actually bring that betting activity into the regulated markets where it can be more closely controlled.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Gambling and marijuana, we've come a long way in the last 20 years in terms of what's acceptable and what's legal.</p><p>KING: It is: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Perfectly legal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Matthew -- thank you so much.</p><p>KING: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good stuff. We'll be watching the big game and FanDuel. Matthew King.</p><p>Remember our own Cheryl Casone will be live in Atlanta tomorrow for the big game. We'll talk with the legendary Joe Theismann and Shaquille O'Neal with Cheryl tomorrow. So stay with us for that.</p><p>First -- before we take a break, President Trump is tweeting this morning. He just said this. \"Very sadly murder cases in Mexico in 2018 rose 33 percent from 2017 -- to just 33,341. this is a big contributor to the humanitarian crisis taking place on our southern border and then spreading throughout the country, worse even than Afghanistan, much caused by drugs. Wall is being built,\" writes the President.</p><p>Quick break and then trade talks in focus, the U.S. and China working on a deal, day two of those talks today.</p><p>Plus security concerns in Europe over Huawei. We'll talk about it.</p><p>Then big money real estate, Chinese billionaire Xian Jin (ph) who I spoke with in Davos last week at a center of a mega real estate deal.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Thursday morning. Welcome back everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Thursday, January 31st. Your top stories right now 7:32 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Earnings season in high gear now, DowDuPont and General Electric making big moves in the premarket this morning after reporting their fourth quarter. DowDuPont down 5-3/4 percent right now. General Electric up 7-1/2 percent, revenue better than estimates, up $0.68 a share at 9.78 on G.E.</p><p>Mixed action for Futures this morning. Take a look at what we're expecting at the open. Dow Industrials now at the low of the morning, down 45 points, fractional move but nonetheless had been fractionally lower earlier. S&amp;P is up just by about a point and the NASDAQ is up 31 points right now, one-half of one percent.</p><p>Celgene hitting the tape, revenue above expectations as earnings on Celgene. This after the major indices surged yesterday on the Federal Reserve's dovish approach to raising rates for the rest of the year. Basically the Fed said they're on hold, data-dependent. Dow Industrials were up better than 500 points at their best at the close. The Dow closed up 434 points, 1-3/4 percent. The S&amp;P 500 was up 1-1/2 percent, 41 points higher and the NASDAQ up 155 points at the close, 2-a quarter percent higher on NASDAQ.</p><p>In Europe this morning, mixed story there. Take a look, mostly higher, FT- 100 is up about 30 points, one-half a percent. The CAC Quarante in Paris is up five points, the DAX Index is lower by 22.</p><p>Asian markets mostly higher overnight, as you'll see here with the exception of Korea.</p><p>Parents beware, what you need to know about the expanding ibuprofen recall for infants. We've got the story.</p><p>And so much for the Chinese pulling out of U.S. real estate, Chinese billionaire Zhang Xin who I spoke within Davos last week, reportedly ready to spend big money for an apartment in New York. We'll tell you how much.</p><p>And the next step for artificial intelligence, a robot taught itself to play Jenga. See if you'll stack up later this hour.</p><p>All those stories coming up, but first our top story this half an hour, trade tensions, it is now day two of the U.S.-China trade talks in Washington D.C. President Trump set to meet with China's trade negotiator later today. Last week, China, a very big topic throughout the World Economic Forum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FANG XINGHAI, VICE CHAIRMAN, CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY COMMISSION: As China right now seems to focus on you know, macro demand management. The supply side policy has not been stopped and then we continue to push forward for supply-side, well because supply-side structural reform.</p><p>AXEL WEBER, CHAIRMAN, UBS: China is at the moment reacting with demand side measures, both easier monetary and fiscal policy to cushion the economy against cooling. But the more important measures that China is taking is all the supply side reforms in opening the market, that creates a lot of growth potential, that creates productivity enhancement.</p><p>DR. KEYU JIN, PROFESSOR, LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE: Let us be reminded that only two years ago, China was considered to be a ticking financial bomb. So what we're seeing as a recent slowdown is simply a consequence of the government's very successful effort to deleverage.</p><p>WEI SUN CHRISTIANSON, CEO, MORGAN STANLEY CHINA: I think the China's slowdown is a short-term and it's largely driven by the deleveraging initiative of the government and also the trade tension and weakened sentiment. But I think if you look at this government reaction to the slowdown is very interesting. In the past, that they will take it the easy way out and by resorting to this credit-driven stimulus tools and to boost the economy.</p><p>But now, they're more careful because they want to preserve the good result of the deleveraging and the financial sector cleanup.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was some comments from Davos last week. One of the few comments in the -- in the panel related to whether or not China is going to open-up its market, governor, I want to get your take on this. Because what I found from Dr. Fang, who is one of the officials from China running the financial services industry last week, he showed a real willingness to open up the markets in financial services but is that going to be enough? That doesn't impact the Trump manufacturing regions of the country. It doesn't certainly address some of the bigger issues like espionage, like forced transfer of tech and I.P. theft.</p><p>HUCKABEE: But after decades of going the wrong direction, we're taking steps in the right direction. And I think the pressure that the president has put on China is incredibly positive and people need to give him some air here on this because China is hurting more than the United States is hurting. They have to play ball. They're going to have to come to the table and start playing fair. They haven't done it in decades because nobody made them. This is a president that's forcing them to have to rethink the way they do trade. The results is, there's 33,000 new manufacturing jobs. That's a lot of manufacturing when we were told manufacturing is dead in America. Well, it isn't anymore.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, the editorial board yesterday had a piece on the separating the Huawei issues from the I.P. theft and the -- and the forced transfer of technology. James, explain this. Because I don't understand how you can separate these two. I mean, if you're talking about stealing trade secrets isn't that what Huawei did?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I think you separate them in the sense that asking another country to obey the criminal laws of the United States is kind of baseline. It should be expected of everyone regardless of what the particulars of a trade agreement are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point.</p><p>FREEMAN: So, I think -- and I think enforcing our laws is a great step in holding China to account. But what we're really after is not just don't come here and break our laws, but in your country, give our businesses a fair opportunity, respect our technology and I think part of the sales pitch to China has to be look at the upside for you if you start respecting intellectual property. It will encourage and energize your entrepreneurs who lately are not that excited about the communist government taking a tighter grip of the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I just wonder if it's too late. I mean, I just wonder if at this point China has stolen what it is going to steal, forced enough transfer of technology and now they've invested in patents, they've invested in innovation, they're probably on their way to being number one in all of these industries that the U.S. wanted to be number one in, like robotics and like block chain and the rest.</p><p>FREEMAN: I think you look at the earnings of our great semiconductor companies, you look at Apple, you look at various measures, the answer would be it's not over yet. The value is still being created in the United States.</p><p>Long-term, obviously we don't know but I don't think it's a -- and this is maybe a reason why this is the moment as the governor said, we are still the world's preeminent economy and preeminent creator of new technology. Maybe we won't be forever, but this is the time to strike a deal.</p><p>HUCKABEE: But we're still innovating and they're still having to steal. That's the big difference. And I do believe that entrepreneurship is alive and well in the United States and it needs to continue. That's the key is making the incentive there and the incentive is still there, at least for now, for American companies to innovate and create something that's disruptive and globe changing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: To do that -- to that point, and this is (INAUDIBLE) this morning when I was reading the Wall Street Journal, this is the number one story on the Wall Street Journal website that the United States is changing the visa process for highly skilled workers. These are the H-1B visas and that starting this April it will basically offer more changes to how the visas are for people who have master's degrees. Mre than 5,000 more immigrants with master's degrees or higher will get selected for this type of visa. We need to make sure -- and this is part of the overall immigration issue, make sure that these smart people stay here in the United States.</p><p>And one other thing, Maria, because the Journal also writes about this and you've been talking about this, with all of your guests, particularly at Davos. That one area where we can push our businesses into China is through services, through banking, through insurance, through consulting. It remains to be seen whether President Trump will be satisfied with that because he likes to focus on goods.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that's the question I asked the governor, right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Soybeans, pork. Because when he talks about the (INAUDIBLE) our trade relationship with Canada, I remembered he say we'll have a trade deficit. Yes, with goods. But if you include the services which and we're a service economy, we have a trade surplus with Canada. So, will a greater export of services into China satisfy President Trump?</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, it's not going to satisfy. The -- what I know is that China wants to open its markets. It's willing to open its markets in financial services. Already UBS has gotten the go-ahead. They own 51 percent of a bank in China. They're going to be able to own 100 percent of that company within three years.</p><p>Number one, Steven Mnuchin said to me yesterday or two days ago when I was in D.C., well, why are we waiting three years for 100 percent? They want it sooner, not in three years and financial services doesn't really address President Trump's base, the manufacturing base.</p><p>So, I think China -- we'll see. I mean, if it's a shell and it's nothing in between, but definitely I think China is willing to do financial services 100 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And by the way, Foxconn backed off its plans to add manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin. That they're going to focus on research, development and design jobs but they said to make these liquid crystal displays in Wisconsin, that it's too expensive. So, I don't know how that plays with trade negotiations.</p><p>HUCKABEE: And never forget one important thing, people also want to live in the United States more than they want to live in China for the freedom, for the opportunities. The most important thing that we in this country that we export to the world --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But will we accept those immigrants?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, that's right.</p><p>HUCKABEE: -- is liberty, never forget that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Will we accept those immigrants? That is the core of what is going on in Washington right now. Do we have open arms and will we raise the number of people we allow to immigrate to this country legally every year?</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, that's a --</p><p>MCDOWELL: As we crackdown on illegal immigrants.</p><p>FREEMAN: If China won't embrace the entrepreneurial economy, let's recruit their talent. And this White House policy, what he's doing is he's reshuffling the existing slots. What the president ought to say in the State of the Union is we're going to increase the number of PhD engineers that we bring in from China, India and elsewhere.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, all right, we'll take a short break. When we come back, parents beware, big story here, infant ibuprofen recalled over potential dangers. We've got the story and the details next.</p><p>And then a major real estate play, Chinese billionaire Zhang Xin who I spoke with in Davos last week building her portfolio in the United States, she continues to expand, details on the price tag, next up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A nationwide infant ibuprofen recall has been expanded. Lauren Simonetti with the details and headlines now, Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Parents listen up, Tris Pharma is expanding avoluntary recall of its infant ibuprofen because the product might contain a higher concentration of ibuprofen than labeled. The company has added three more lots to the recall list, they were manufactured for CVS and Walmart. Tris Pharma says there have been no reports of any illness.</p><p>A Chinese billionaire in talks to buy a $60 million apartment in New York City. The New York post says Zhang Xin is close to acquiring a full floor unit at 432 Park Ave. the tallest residential building in the Western Hemisphere. Zhang is the co-founder and CEO of China's largest property developer SOHO China. And Maria, you talked with Zhang about real estate at the World Economic Forum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZHANG XIN, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, SOHO CHINA: Chinese have such a habit of putting money into real estate, buying real estate, and so -- and but now they're worrying on the other side, you know, the economy slowing down. So then, what does the government do and you know, to ease the credit, let the real estate continue and then people will with the credit put money into real estate, buying real estate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: The New York Posts says two other units at 432 Park Avenue on the market for $40 million are currently under contract.</p><p>And this, researchers at MIT are showing off their new robot that taught itself to play Jenga. Using a camera for ayes and two small prongs for fingers. It can gently remove the pieces. The robot determines which move is the best one to make by touching the pieces first, testing them out.</p><p>And speaking of Jenga, Louis Vuitton is releasing a $2,400 luxury Jenga set, the 54 L.V. monogrammed pieces are made from plexiglass, not wood. So, if you ever need an expensive gift, there you go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cool. Thank you, Lauren. Coming up, making the world better through business, the story of pop sockets and how it's using sales to help charities around the world. Good story next, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Pop sockets are taking over cell phones. They stick to your device to help you get a better grip and make it easier to watch videos. Today the company is launching the next phase of Poptivism, which it says is aimed at making the world better.</p><p>Here now in an exclusive interview is the CEO and founder of PopSockets, David Barnett. David, great to see you.</p><p>DAVID BARNETT, CEO AND FOUNDER, POPSOCKETS: Thanks very much for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. And PopSockets, what a great idea. How did you come up with this idea?</p><p>BARNETT: Well, back in 2010, I was tired of my headset tangling in my pocket. Each time I took it out, it was tangled. So, I went down to the nearest fabric store and glued a couple of huge clothing buttons to the backside of my iPhone 3 and wrapped my head set around them, it looked ridiculous. I got made fun of. And so, I started tinkering with mechanisms to get the button to expand and collapse, so that it would look a little more respectable and have more functionality, act as a stand, and act as a grip for the phone. Eventually --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you started off thinking you could just put your headphones around it, but then you realized there were so many other ideas.</p><p>BARNETT: That was the initial problem which is a lesson for me, that the problem that motivates you start tinkering is not always the problem you end up solving. So, the current product does solve for that problem. But that's not what most people use it for. So, I ended up settling on this accordion mechanism. And we just finished our fifth year of business. So, I started out of my garage, in Boulder, Colorado. And we've sold about a hundred million of these so far.</p><p>BARTIROMO: A hundred million pop sockets, wow.</p><p>FREEMAN: You were a philosophy professor.</p><p>BARNETT: That is correct. I'm ready for questions.</p><p>FREEMAN: When was the moment where you decided iPhone accessories were a better line of work?</p><p>BARNETT: Yes, all it was -- I would say some -- half of the philosophy professors watching this are laughing at me. And the other half are probably pretty jealous.</p><p>So, it is -- it can be a lot more fun than being a philosophy professor and sometimes, the problems we're dealing with are a little bit easier, usually.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Yes, but an assassin is the mother of invention and you invent something out of necessity. And I just love entrepreneurial ideas that come from necessity. You created something. I'm absolutely in awe of people who do something so simple and when I see it, I say why didn't I think of that?</p><p>MCDOWELL: But how are you giving back?</p><p>BARNETT: Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARNETT: Sure, today, I'd love to share with you. Today we launched our Poptivism program to the public. And it encourages anybody sitting here to go to our website, you create your own grip. So, you upload your own art work, hopefully it work with an artist, unless you're a natural artist. So, you upload some beautiful graphic and then you can tag any charity you want. So, any five O's, 503 --</p><p>FREEMAN: 501(c)(3)</p><p>BARNETT: 501(c)(3), thank you, that you would like. So we have a bunch already lined up for you. And 50 percent of every sale of that product will go to that charity. So we have --</p><p>MCDOWELL: 50 percent of the sale, not the --</p><p>BARNETT: Not the profit.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- income, not the profit, which is a huge amount of money.</p><p>BARNETT: Yes. I don't know any other -- any other brand giving this much away and allowing you to design the product. So it's customized impact. We have a bunch of different categories of charities including some charities around veteran services, so the Wounded Warrior, Bob Woodruff Foundation, The Mission Continues. Anyway, long list.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How great. And what are this retail for pop grips?</p><p>BARNETT: They start at $10.00 for the graphics and they go up to -- there's Swarovski for $50.00. I have a marble on my -- a genuine marble on my phone today. And it's -- I believe it's $30.00 for the marble.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you give these to influencers so they use them? Because I see them all over like reality television.</p><p>BARNETT: So, the virality of this is partly explained by the fact that celebrities got a hold of them organically. We don't -- we don't seed the influencers. We've made some -- we've had some partnerships with influencers but originally this blew up around Los Angeles because celebrities we saw Gigi Hadid and Ryan Seacrest. And it's just a long list of celebrities using them and that really led to their -- to their growth, quickly.</p><p>FREEMAN: And that's because it's a great handle for a selfie?</p><p>BARNETT: Sorry, I should explain it, yes.</p><p>FREEMAN: Or was it mainly a fashion?</p><p>BARTIROMO: let me see the (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARNETT: I haven't yet even explained it, you're right. It collapses and expands and it allows you to move your hand away from the backside of your phone. I have one of our wallets underneath it. It allows you to move your hand away. Once you do that, you can access your whole screen with your thumb.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very cool.</p><p>BARNETT: Without having to drop your phone. You can take selfies, photographs much more easily.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're going to be doing that.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019013102cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9X-3JM1-DXH2-6008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7554\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 31, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000299K</classCode><className>GENERAL ELECTRIC CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002T15</classCode><className>RAYTHEON CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS336412 AIRCRAFT ENGINE &amp;

Good  morning, ladies.  Thank you so much and good morning, everyone.  Happy  Monday to you.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us.  And it is  Monday, October 29th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. one the East Coast.   Investors looking to start the week on a strong note.  Take a look at where  we stand with futures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As you just heard, Dow Industrials set to open up about 50 points this  morning, that's a quarter of a percent higher.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The S&amp;P 500 is up 11, almost one-half of percent.  </p><p> And the NASDAQ, up 62 points right now, that is up almost one percent.  </p><p> This after major the indices capped off a volatile week last week with  sharp declines.  When all was said and done, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 down,  better than one percent on Friday alone.</p><p> Meanwhile, the NASDAQ sliding another two percent on Friday.  On the heels  of disappointing results from Amazon and Alphabet, NASDAQ officially in  correction territory now, that's down 10 percent from highs.</p><p> Global markets this morning, a firmer tone there as well.  The FT-100's up  1-1/4 percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a quarter of a percent, and  the DAX Index in Germany right now up now 1-1/2 percent, 160 points higher  in Germany.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower at the close, with the  exception of Hong Kong.  As you can see there, the worst performer was  China.  Then another two percent overnight on the Shanghai Composite.</p><p> Earnings, of course, setting the tone on Wall Street this morning.  Several  Dow Components, including Apple, set to report this upcoming week.   Investors are watching General Electric as well.</p><p> The Wall Street Journal reporting another dividend cut may be on the way  for GE.  That will not be good news for the stock.  We will watch that this  morning.</p><p> A little bit of a merger Monday on Wall Street this morning.  IBM is  acquiring Red Hat for roughly $33 billion.  That is IBM's largest  acquisition ever.  How the deal will drive growth of the struggling  technology giant, of course, it's all about the cloud which we heard a lot  from, well, Larry Ellison, last week on the cloud computing business.</p><p> Breaking news overnight, a plane crashes shortly after takeoff in  Indonesia.  Nearly 200 people were onboard.  We have the very latest on the  search efforts going on this morning.  Stay with us on that.</p><p> Plus, honoring the victims of the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting.   Thousands filling the streets last night after President Trump condemned  the attack on Saturday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This evil, Anti-Semitic  attack is an assault on all of us, it's an assault on humanity.  It will  require all of us working together to extract the hateful poison of Anti- Semitism from our world.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest as the alleged shooter is set to appear  in court today.  We will bring you that coming up.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Monday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PwC Partner, Mitch  Roschelle, and the President of maslansky + partners, Lee Carter, is here.   Great to see you.</p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning, everybody.  Happy Monday.</p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Good morning.  Happy Monday.  Sad weekend,  though.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Very sad.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  So tragic.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  For sure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tough week, actually.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Exactly.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, what to make of it all, because, again, it doesn't seem  like the political rhetoric from any -- either side is really being muted  whatsoever.</p><p> And that, if anything, this violence has amplified it somewhat, and I don't  know.  I'm curious.  </p><p> I mean there's much to be said about that, and the fallout for the country,  and quite frankly, the world at large.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm. </p><p> CARTER:  You know, it's a really sad time for our country.  And when we  have these kinds of attacks happening, I mean these are terrorist attacks  and historically, we've come together at times of tragedy, in times of  crisis and we can rise above the partisanship and that doesn't seem to be  happening now.  </p><p> And I don't think what it's going to take for our nation to heal.  We've  been through such terrible times and these terrorists need to be stopped  and we need to come together to find a way to make sure that this never  happens again.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And more evidence that there's a mental problem in the United  States.  And that also needs to be addressed.</p><p> By the way, different story, a victory in Brazil for the far-right  candidate.  Interesting to see what's taking place in other places away  from America in terms of the people voting for more conservative  leadership.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  What they don't want to wind up being Venezuela quite frankly.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Correct.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And they see how devastating socialism can be to a country and  to everybody that it doesn't lift all votes and I think that that's part of  what's at play here. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And Mr. Bolsonaro is being compared to Donald Trump in Brazil  so we'll -- </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Well, more populism and more nationalism themes in a lot of  these elections around the world, too.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  So it seems like it's certainly a trend right now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Italy as well, another one.  We will take a look at all of this  coming up and we have a lot coming up in the next three hours.  </p><p> Our top story right now is about earnings.  The earnings keep on coming,  Apple, Starbucks, General Electric, Facebook, ExxonMobil, all reporting  their third quarter earnings this week.  This is going to be another busy  woke.</p><p> The October jobs report is also coming out this week on Friday.   Expectations, 190,000 jobs to have been added to the economy last month  with the unemployment remaining unchanged, 3.7 percent.  That is the  expectation.  </p><p> Of course, we are beginning the month of November this week, so Friday,  we'll get those jobs numbers first Friday of every month.  </p><p> Here now, the National Investment Consultant at U.S. Bank Wealth  Management, Dan Heckman joining us.  Dan, good to see you.  Thanks very  much for joining us.  </p><p> DAN HECKMAN, NATIONAL INVESTMENT CONSULTANT, U.S. BANK WEALTH  MANAGEMENT:   Good morning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So let's talk about the backdrop for investing today and that  would be earnings in the economic story.  </p><p> Your expectations for earnings, how would you assess things so far and the  upcoming jobs report?</p><p> HECKMAN:  Well, earnings have been actually pretty good, Maria.  The top  line's growing on average about eight percent, 50 percent of the S&amp;P 500  companies have reported so far.  </p><p> And, again, eight percent on the top line on the average.  And on the  bottom line, it's been up over 20 percent.</p><p> So earnings have not been, you know, all of that bad.  I just think there's  been a lot of high expectations going into this quarter.  And any kind of  disappointment, whatsoever, is being very much punished.</p><p> The market's gone through a very we'll say severe correction.  S&amp;P 500 is  down about 9 percent, the Nasdaq almost 11 percent. </p><p> Out of the last 25 trading days, we've been down 20 days of those 25.  And  so, you know, our works is just that we're probably pretty much through the  majority of this correction.  We may have some continued volatility, but  there's been some great opportunities created in this decline in the  markets.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you would expect we'll start to get clarity after the  midterm elections in terms of the President's agent and whether it gets  executed.  </p><p> Part of that is tax cuts coming, the upcoming midterms after the midterms.</p><p> House Ways and Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady, told me yesterday on  Sunday morning futures that they are, in fact, working on a second tax cut  plan, not only extending the individual cuts, but also lowering taxes for  the middle class and additional 10 percent.  </p><p> Here's Kevin Brady yesterday.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  The  economy is booming.  We're on track for the first total year over year plus  three percent economic growth in more than a decade.  </p><p> We're seeing jobs coming back, paychecks going up.  Main Street is hiring  again.  So the President's really about -- focused on more of that economic  growth.</p><p> I think permanence really depends on this election, if Republicans and --  are -- retain control of the house, and the senate, next year we will do  reconciliation and make these tax cuts permanent.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So Mitch, he did say that it's a separate thing, the 10 percent  cut, additional cut in taxes, separate from the -- making the individual  cuts permanent, so it is a second tax cut plan that they're working on.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Right.  The thing that we haven't heard a lot about is how this  is getting paid for.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  The President talked about doing it from a budgetary  perspective with cutting all of the departmental budgets by 5 percent, but  from a tax policy perspective, I don't know if they're going to have to  unwind something from the previous plan in order to pay for this.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, half of Americans already paid no net federal income tax,  number one, and I think a lot of people are all for making the individual  tax cuts permanent, which could have been done potentially if Democrats got  on board -- </p><p> CARTER:  They'd -- </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Right, right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- with the tax reforms in the first place.  But I think you  have to be -- if you're in Washington, be very careful about anything at  this point that drives up a deficit and the debt even more.</p><p> Because what kicked off this recent -- this bout of volatility and the down  -- the downward move in the market earlier in October, it was worries about  higher interest rates.  </p><p> So if you do anything in Washington in terms of spending and not paying for  it and that five percent cut to all these departments is less than one  percent -- </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- because discretionary spending makes up what -- discretionary  spending acts defense -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- is a very small part of our annual spending, so I'd be very - - they need to tread very, very cautiously in in D.C.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  To the point.  </p><p> CARTER:  I also think that it's a -- it's a very -- it's a fine line that  they're walking right now between tax cuts and the deficit because so many  traditional conservatives want to see us get spending under control.  </p><p> And so if they don't have a plan that address both sides of it, I think  that you're going to lose a lot of traditional conservatives' enthusiasm  especially going into the midterms.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  Now, this trillion dollar budget deficit is not a good  thing for this country, period.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And something has to get done to fix that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think about that, Dan?</p><p> HECKMAN:  Well, we are very concerned about the projection of the deficit  going out forward and we think the additional supply, which has been a 63  percent increase in the second half of treasury securities' year over year  has certainly weighed on the bond market and one factor, in our opinion, of  why rates have risen so much here in the second half.</p><p> So we are certainly concerned about the budget deficit.  I think we share - - your other guests' earlier comments about, how are you going to pay for  it?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> HECKMAN:  So rising deficits are going to be an issue that the market is  going to be focused on and I think they have already talked about it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So there's -- so there's debt and deficits, and then there's  the China story and the tariffs.  I spoke with Senate Homeland Security  Chairman Ron Johnson yesterday.  </p><p> He said, very bluntly, there is a real threat from China.  Listen to this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI), CHAIRMAN, SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY:  Let's face  it, China has been stealing hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of our  industrial secrets, as well as our military secrets.  And that is really, I  think, one -- the biggest threat that we face in terms of our relationship  with China.</p><p> If we have a unified rest of the world when it comes to trade in our  dealings with China -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> JOHNSON:  -- we'll discipline them to begin, you know, really adhering to  the norms of the rest of the world trading system.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So a moment ago, Dan, you seem believe that this market was  sort of stabilizing at this point and you suggested you would be putting  new money to work in stocks, is that right, or do you worry about debt and  the China story as cutting into that?</p><p> HECKMAN:  Well, we really think there are some great opportunities in the  market right now.  The P/E average right now on stocks is about 17 times,  that's near the historical 25-year average.  </p><p> So, you know, many of these stock have just been hammered to the point  where they look like pretty attractive values and we are pleased to see the  bond market kind of calm down here, so to speak.  </p><p> The 10-year yield has come back down, but regarding China, it's been, I  think, no big secret that they have been diminished in their activities in  the -- our treasury auctions.</p><p> Last week, we had very weak bid to cover ratios, so it needs to be  monitored here, there's no question about that, Maria.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  One thing that I'll add and to tie the earning season into  what's been going on, so Apple is -- many people are looking at Apple  hoping that Apple can somehow rescue this overall market.</p><p> You saw how Alphabet and Amazon got hammered up after they reported just  slower sales growth or tepid sales growth however you want to characterize  it.  Apple -- listen for Apple on Thursday when they report to talk about  china because they are chained to China in terms of a manufacturing hub.</p><p> They can't really extricate themselves from that, that's what -- one that  people are going to be listening for from Tim Cook and others on the call.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And specifically inventories.  Remember Dan Niles joined us  last week and he said that inventories at Apple are up 89 percent.</p><p> And, you know, when you have that kind of a product inventory, you're  really --- you're really reliant on selling those phones, and are you going  to be able to sell a thousand dollar XPhone into China where the economy is  slowing down to get those inventories cleaned up.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So that's going to be something I want to watch as well on -- </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Let's not lose sight of the fact that the dollar's song and the  one is weal, so you're also selling those in a -- in a period of time where  they're sort of more expensive as well.  So, that's another thing to  consider.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I'm surprised we haven't heard more about currency from  quarterly earnings.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  I think it's --I think it's a big issue across the board.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And I think you should hear more of it in guidance, they're  talking more about tariffs because they're politicizing a little bit, but  currency's a big issue.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> CARTER:  Uh-hmm. </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And maybe the two are interrelated to some degree, but  currency's a major issue for corporate earnings.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I'm sure you're right.  Dan, good to see you this  morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p> HECKMAN:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dan Heckman joining us.  And be sure to join us for full  election coverage next week.  We are -- we are now eight days away.   MORNINGS WITH MARIA will start an hour earlier at 5:00 a.m. Eastern on  November 7th, the day after the big midterm elections on Tuesday night, the  6th.  </p><p> I'm going to get your reaction to what you're seeing, Lee Carter, this  morning.  I want to get your sense of where we are eight days from the  midterm elections, so we'll get into that this morning.  Stay with us on  that.</p><p> But first, a nation is mourning this morning.  The victims of the  Pittsburgh Synagogue attack are remembered.  The alleged shooter will  appear in court today.  We will have the very latest there after this  break.  </p><p> And then a multibillion dollar deal to tell you about, IBM and Red Hat team  up to become the world's number one cloud provider, that's next.  Back in a  moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p> Tragedy at the Tree of Life Synagogue, thousands of people attending a  vigil honoring the victims of this massacre where 11 people were killed,  six others injured, and the alleged killer set to appear to court today.</p><p> Fox News' David Miller -- David Lee Miller is live in Pittsburgh this  morning.  David, good morning to you.  </p><p> DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  We  are in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood.  Behind me, over my shoulder, the  Tree of Life Synagogue.  </p><p> At this hour, it is still a crime scene.  This despite the fact the  shooting took place almost 48 hours ago.  You can see the yellow police  tape around the perimeter of the building.</p><p> It was early Saturday morning that 46-year-old Robert Bowers, authorities  say, entered that building and killed 11 people.  He entered with three  handguns and an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle.  They say he used all  four weapons in his rampage.  </p><p> An FBI affidavit quotes Bowers during his gunfight with police saying,  \"They are committing genocide to my people.  I just want to kill Jews.\"</p><p> The U.S. Attorney has now stated that the process is in place to seek the  death penalty.</p><p> Meanwhile now, for the first time, survivors are speaking out.  Barry  Werber was only feet away from the gunman inside this synagogue Saturday  morning when he went unnoticed.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARRY WERBER, SHOOTING WITNESS:  He didn't see us.  Thank God.  The only  thing I had in my hand was a cell phone and it's a dumb phone so it doesn't  light up when I'm talking on it.</p><p> I could see that he looked around only because there was a shaft of light  as he opened the door.  He stepped over Mel's body, didn't pay any  attention, stepped back and walked out.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MILLER:  At last word we were told that Bowers was in fair condition being  treated for gunshots at a local hospital.  Later today, he will be in  court.  Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I will be watching that, David.  Thanks very much, David Lee  Miller this morning in Pittsburgh.</p><p> Quick break and then air disaster, a massive recovery operation underway  this morning after a jet crashes into the sea in Indonesia, details coming  up.</p><p> And then third time's a charm, I guess.  Hillary Clinton hints at another  run for president.  What she said, stay with us. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A massive recovery mission underway this morning  after a passenger jet crashed in Indonesia.  Cheryl Casone with the details  and headlines now.  Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  The Lion  Air Boeing 737 with 189 passengers and crew onboard went down into the  waters off the coast of Indonesia.</p><p> Indonesian officials now say they do not expect to find new survivors.  The  plane went missing just 13 minutes after it left for an island off of  Sumatra.  All that rescue crews have found so far are ID cards, some  personal belongings, and aircraft debris.</p><p> We're going to continue to follow up this developing story as they are  looking into cause of that crash.</p><p> Well, the Florida man accused of sending at least 14 pipe bombs to  prominent Democrats is set to make his first court appearance in Miami  today.</p><p> 56-year-old Cesar Sayoc faces five federal charges up to 48 years in  prison.</p><p> He was arrested on Friday, four days after the first package was found in  New York.  A single fingerprint led the FBI to his arrest.</p><p> U.S. Marshals are also expected to transfer Sayoc to New York City where  the Justice Department wants to try him in the U.S. Attorney's Southern  District.</p><p> Well, IBM making its biggest acquisition ever.  The company buying software  and services company, Red Hat, for 33 billion.</p><p>IBM attempted to become the world's largest hybrid cloud provider.  A  hybrid cloud is when a company keeps some of its data in a public cloud  service and some of its data on servers on its own premises.</p><p>IBM CEO, Ginni Rometty, calls this acquisition a \"game changer\".  She  believes this is the next chapter of the cloud.  </p><p> Taking a look at shares of IBM, they are lower in the premarket, down more  than five percent, but take a look at Red Hat, the stock is soaring in the  premarket, 50 percent in change, Maria.  There you go.  Big news in the  tech world.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sure is.  And, of course, we've heard all about the  cloud and the potential for big growth numbers from the cloud from Oracle  Cofounder, Larry Ellison, last week -- </p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- when he sat down with me for an exclusive interview.  We  discussed cloud opportunities.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  I think computing -- I think computing  -- cloud computing is going to change, you know.  All these data centers  that people have been building are going to -- are going to gradually  wither away, and we're going to have a small number of huge these cloud  networks.  </p><p> And because every other network looks like that.  They're -- you know,  people don't generate their own electricity, people don't have wells for  their own water.  OK, in a few cases, they do but in the most case, we use  the network to buy electricity, the network to buy water.</p><p> We're going use network to buy computing, and business applications, and  information.  It's going to be on a handful of clouds and most of the  data's going to be in an Oracle database.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  There's such a competition here.  Amazon wants in, Mitch.   Obviously, Oracle has the most lines market share for big corporations.  </p><p> But IBM with Red Hat is obviously a player.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Cloud is where it's at because all of the applications that are  used by business tend to have a mobile end to them and the way for them to  work efficiently is to have them host it on the cloud.  </p><p> But what's happening here with this hybrid is there are some companies of  the cost of migration to the cloud and moving all those applications over  is very pricey, so the hybrid model where some of the On-Premises server  and some of the cloud is really an alternative and that's why they're doing  those acquisitions.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And you see the market share increasing for even somebody  like an Amazon who is also in this business.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  The AWS, you have Microsoft is in the business, big time,  and a lot of the growth in Amazon is from AWS, which is their cloud- computing platform.  </p><p> The growth rate -- and you covered it well in that interview, the growth  rate for cloud-computing is just exponential.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Let's see how IBM manages this acquisition, though, because,  again, you have to have a management team and structure in place to  continue the growth.  </p><p> And very often, when a very large company buys one this size, then it  struggles because they don't have integrated.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  We'll watch that.  Obviously, the stocks are moving,  50 percent on Red Hat higher there and IBM shares are lower as you just  saw.  </p><p> Take a break.  When we come back, the Trump effect hits Brazil, a far-right  candidate, who's been compared to President Trump, define the odds to win  the election as President of Brazil.  The fallout later this hour coming  up.  </p><p> And then in the history books, the Boston Red Sox winning their fourth  World Series since 2004.  All the highlights in sports, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  Happy Monday, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday,  October 29th, your top stories right now at 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast on  the button.</p><p> Wall Street looking to turn around last week's losses this morning.  The  possible tech -- help from technology, we've got more tech giants reporting  earnings this week, and that's certainly will set the tone.</p><p> Right now, Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading, with the Dow  Industrials up about 40 points, the S&amp;P 500, up 12, and the NASDAQ, up 59  points, almost one percent higher on the NASDAQ.  This after a rough week,  last week, the major indices finished the day, Friday, lower, and the week,  the Dow and the S&amp;P, now back in negative territory, for the year.</p><p> This morning, as you see, the Dow was down one percent on Friday, almost  two percent on the S&amp;P, and the NASDAQ, down better than two percent on  Friday.</p><p> In Europe this morning, the indices are higher, we got a bounce going on,  this morning, across the world, FT 100 up one and a third percent, the CAC  Quarante up a quarter of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany, up one  and two-thirds percent.</p><p> Asian markets, finishing mostly lower, overnight, following Wall Street's  cue last week.  The Shanghai Composite in China, the worst performer, down  better than two percent, overnight.</p><p> Closing in, a caravan of thousands of Honduran migrants inching toward the  U.S. border, President Trump vowing to repel the caravan with military  force, Congressman John Ratcliffe, breaking down the delicate issue with  me, on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\"</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE (R-TX), CHAIR OF HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE:   The nation of immigrants, we want to be as generous and compassionate as  possible, than we are.</p><p> We let a million immigrants into this country, legally, every year, that's  more than any other country in the world, to ignore a horde of folks that  from unknown origins with unknown intense -- intentions other than to come  into this country, illegally, is just plain reckless.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We will have a live update from the border, coming up in just a  few minutes.  Stay with us on that.  And then, voting to the right, Brazil,  electing a far right candidate, who some have compared to President Trump.   The President has called Mr. Bolsonaro and congratulated him for his  victory, this morning.  We will break it down for you.</p><p> And then, going public, a private interview of Deputy Attorney General Rod  Rosenstein could now become a public hearing.  We've got the details.   We're expecting that hearing after the midterms.</p><p> Then, taking the series, the Boston Red Sox beating the L.A. Dodgers last  night, to take the World Series, we have all of the highlights coming up,  in sports.</p><p> Scaring up the money, Michael Myers, going toe to toe with Lady Gaga, at  the box office, we will tell you who took the top spot, this past weekend,  coming up.</p><p> All of those stories coming up, but first, our top story this half an hour,  eight days until the midterm elections, truly countdown mode now.  A  presidential question is already being asked, Hillary 2020.  Here's what  Hillary Clinton said over the weekend, about a possible third run.  Watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> KARA SWISHER, CO-FOUNDER OF RECODE:  Do you want to run again?</p><p> HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  No.  No.</p><p> SWISHER:  There was a pause.</p><p> CLINTON:  Well, I'd like to be president.</p><p> SWISHER:  OK.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me now, Washington Examiner Editorial Director, Hugo  Gurdon, Hugo, good to see you.  So, she wants to be president but she  doesn't want to go through all the running again, and the campaign, I  guess.</p><p> HUGO GURDON, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR AT WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  Yes.  She doesn't  want to go through it again, and she's obviously, not very successful.  And  in fact, she has proved herself to be historically unsuccessful as a  presidential candidate.</p><p> There was a joke going around on Twitter this morning, that it's the  Republicans who are shouting at her to run and the Democrats were shouting  lock her up.  They don't want her as their candidate.  There must be 20 or  so people who are muted as a candidate and she's already failed twice.   She'd love to be president, but I don't think that either she or her Party,  think that she can win.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's your take on the midterm elections, Hugo, now, eight  days away?  How does it look in terms of both sides from your standpoint?</p><p> GURDON:  I think that the Republican majority could increase in the Senate.   But I certainly think that the Republicans will hold back.  I think the  odds are that the Democrats will take the House and so, we'll have a split  on Capitol Hill.</p><p> You know, as far as that -- those results are concerned, those might not  suit President Trump too badly.  It'll mean that he'll still be able to  confirm judges in the Senate and he'll still be able to, you know, at  least, he'll have a good chance of confirming cabinet members, if he needs  to replace those.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think this is a really important point that you're making  because if the Republicans keep the Senate, that's a huge and increase this  number of seats in the Senate, that's a huge victory for the President  because right off the bat, he'll probably change attorney generals.</p><p> He'll get his new A.G. confirmed, and once he has got a new A.G. in place,  it really doesn't matter if the House is going to be, you know, not doing  the investigations that the Republicans were pursuing like the FBI and the  DOJ.  You've a different A.G. in place, so that's certainly one thing  people are talking about.  You make the right point.</p><p> But let's talk about something else, and that is the administration  turnover.  Politico is reporting that a Trump cabinet exodus will happen  after the midterms.  Now, we know that the A.G. is likely to go.</p><p> The reports says an addition to the departure of Nikki Haley, we'll see  Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Defense Secretary James Mattis and Interior  Secretary Ryan Zinke, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Homeland Security  Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, will leave the administration as well.  Your  reaction, do you expect this kind of turnover?</p><p> GURDON:  Yes.  I think it's very likely that after the midterms, there will  be a certain cleaning house by the President.  Look, his administration has  never had this, sort of, air of stability and, sort of, permanence about  it.</p><p> I think that it's pretty harrowing or at least wearing for people to be in  this administration, you know it's a constant state of -- I wouldn't say  crisis exactly, but nevertheless, there's certainly not peace in settlement  here.</p><p> I think that, you know there's been a lot of talk about the Defense  Secretary Mr. Mattis, leaving, I hadn't heard about Ryan Zinke.  Wilbur  Ross has done a great deal already, in terms of on trade and tariffs, which  the President has wanted.</p><p> So, I think there's very likely to see a substantial turnover and of  course, the President wants to put in the cabinet that he goes into the  2020 election with.  The final point I'd make on this, is that it's  perfectly normal after the first two years, after the midterms, for  administration to change up like this.  It's something that's happened with  previous presidencies and I think it's very likely to happen again.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, I think, number one to go would be Jeff Sessions.   The President has made no secret of the fact that he's highly disappointed  in Jeff Sessions, partly, because he recused himself on the Russia probe,  and that's why he will get a new attorney general in there.</p><p> Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's closed door interview was  postponed last week, leading to speculation that we may see him questions,  in a public hearing.  House Judiciary Member Congressman John Ratcliffe was  on with me yesterday, on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" -- Here's what he said  about that.  Listen to this, Hugo.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RATCLIFFE:  You know, a lot of folks were unhappy that it was going to be  so limited in terms of who was going to get access to asking questions.   But I think that this is more likely going to be a public hearing where  more members of Congress will be able to ask some of the questions that I  just raised directly to the Deputy Attorney General.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And we should expect that after the midterms some time in  November, you think?</p><p> RATCLIFFE:  Yes.  I don't think it's likely to happen in the next week  before the midterms.  But I know that, you know, hopefully, the sooner the  better.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll see.  My sources were saying that he has agreed to after  November 15th, Hugo, your thoughts on that?</p><p> GURDON:  Yes.  I think that it's very likely that Rod Rosenstein will  testify, probably, in public.  There were some concerned that the time  allotted for the questioning in private was not going to allow enough  questions and there's enormous number of questions to ask him.</p><p> Most notably, the story that was been going around now for several weeks,  that he talked about wearing a wire and recording President Trump and using  the 25th amendment to get rid of him.  Now, it said that he was just  joking, but we already have -- </p><p> The Congress has already heard testimony from the top lawyer at the FBI,  that the FBI officials who are hearing, listening to Rosenstein, didn't  take it as a joke, so this is a real scandal and I'm sure that Congress  wants to get to the bottom of it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hugo, isn't it interesting that an ex-army captain won Brazil's  presidential election, really perhaps shifting Latin America's largest  nature in country to the right.  You're seeing this take place in other  countries as well, away from United States.  They are comparing him to  Donald Trump.</p><p> GURDON:  Yes.  There are a lot of comparisons that -- and he certainly  shoots from the left.  He said a number of rather extraordinary things  which have turned a lot of people off.  However, I would not say he's very  far right, any more than his opponent, is very far left.</p><p> Brazil was making a decision after, at least, a couple of decades of left  wing rule, highly corrupt and ineffective rule from the left, to turn to  someone who I, sort of, Trumpy in his persona.  And, you know, they think  that what they're going to get is someone who is straight talking, even if  very rough talking, and that is a very strong comparison to President  Trump.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I think that's really important point that you just made, I  agree with that, that far right, but certainly, leading toward  conservative.  But, you know, this is the guy who was stabbed during the  campaign, talk about vitriol going on.  He was stabbed while he was  campaigning, got back -- got back on his feet, and won the election.</p><p> GURDON:  Yes.  He's obviously -- that kind of attack, will actually appeal  and produce a, sort of, sympathy vote.  He's, you know, he's been in  Congress, actually, I think, it's seven terms in a row, so he's not exactly  new to people, but his -- and he's got good recognition.</p><p> But you know, when you're talking the way that President Trump does and Mr.  Bolsonaro has, and, you know, then you get attacked, then people start to  sympathize with you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Hugo, good to see you this morning, thanks so much.</p><p> GURDON:  Thanks a lot.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hugo Gurdon, joining us there.  Be sure to join us for our  election coverage, next week.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA will begin an hour  earlier, at 5 a.m. Eastern on November 7th, the day after the election.

We have got all of the details, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A far right candidate wins Brazil's presidential  election, Cheryl Casone on headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p> CASONE:  Yes.  Quite an election, Maria, thousands flooded the streets of  Brazil overnight, to celebrate the nation's new president-elect, Jair  Bolsonaro, winning a runoff election just weeks after he was stabbed on the  campaign trail and he nearly died.</p><p> Bolsonaro has often been compared to President Trump, he's promised to  crack down on corruption and crime, but his opponents are concerned that  he's going to roll back civil liberties. President Trump did call to  congratulate him yesterday.</p><p> Well, this morning we have to say congratulations to the Boston Red Sox,  who are the kings of baseball once again.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Red Sox win the World Series, 5-1 the final tonight! </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  The Sox, taking the series from the Los Angeles Dodgers in five  games; it is their fourth world series win since 2004.

He's waiting for me.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We waited for him.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  And \"A Star is Born\" remains in second with 14 million.

This is the highest hall for October over.  Rounding out the top  five, \"Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween,\" and \"Hunter Killer.\"  Boo, Maria,  a lot of scary names on that list for you.  Geez.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, I don't really like Halloween movies.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about you, Lee?  </p><p> CARTER:  There's enough scary things in the world to watch.  I don't need  to watch, but I watch my film.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's all Gaga and Bradley Cooper, though, that's -- you went  to see it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I did.  I loved it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Tammy Miller, our producer went to see it.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  I saw it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I loved it.</p><p> CARTER:  Dagen, I'm dying to see it.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Choked up, I didn't cry.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It was fantastic.  I did.  I cried. </p><p> CARTER:  I love the sound tracks.  It's good.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's really are good.  She was excellent and he was excellent.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Yes, they were both really, really good.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I hope she gets an Oscar.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Me too.  She did really well.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  She really deserves it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  She does.  And about him?  That was his first directorial -- he  directed.</p><p> CARTER:  It's amazing.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And he can sing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> CARTER:  Who knew?</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Who knew?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Wait, so you got your Boston Globe.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Yes, I got a Boston Globe.  As a Yankee fan, it galls me to  hold this up --</p><p> CARTER:  Me too.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  But they did win.  Hats off.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congrats to the Red Sox.</p><p> CARTER:  My stepdad is a huge, huge fan.  So, I'm really happy for him.  He  is so excited.  He's been up.  He stayed up until 3:30 in the morning the  other night watching the game, so congratulations Red Sox.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You mean the 18-inning game the other night?  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right coming up, the growing caravan crisis clashes  breaking at the border as U.S. bound migrants force through a barrier.  We  will take you there live to Mexico next, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Now, the latest on the migrant caravan crisis.   One group of migrants inching closer to the United States again after  stopping to take a break yesterday, another group clashing with Mexican  officers after trying to enter the country from Guatemala.  Fox News  Correspondent Griff Jenkins joins us now, he's at the southern -- he's in  Southern Mexico, near the border.  Griff, good morning to you.  </p><p> GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Yes,  the migrant caravan is back on the move after a day of rest.  You see them  behind me there in (INAUDIBLE), a city in (INAUDIBLE), one of the first  cities that came to the (INAUDIBLE) state.  And they're headed to another  town about 30 miles away Niltepec, and it's interesting, Maria, because  Niltepec has a population of 4,000, of course, the caravan is about 4,000.   Which is certainly going to strain on resources, food, water and these  sorts of things.  But Funes -- Lenon Funes -- I met one of the migrants, he  speaks English.  Lenon, where were you -- you're living in the U.S. and you  had a work permit?  </p><p> LENON FUNES, MIGRANT:  Yes, sir.  I live in USA for 20 years.  I get my  work permit for every year, renewal, and they told me, Nomas, you can go  back to country -- because your paper work is filed.</p><p> JENKINS:  And today, you're a part of this caravan, but why don't you just  do it in a legal way and apply for another work permit in Guatemala instead  of getting in the caravan.  </p><p> FUNES:  I have to get my visa, my work permit, and they say no, because --  Nomas, you live in USA for 20 years, you can get your visa.  </p><p> JENKINS:  And Lenon, one last question, Mexico's President Pena Nieto  offering for you just to have asylum stop here, Wahaca, and take temporary  employment, will you take his offer or you continue to the U.S.?  </p><p> FUNES:  Well, I'll continue to Mexico, and they say, you can stay in Mexico  for year and we can get you working but I'm going to the border, U.S.  border, because I want to go back to USA.  </p><p> JENKINS:  OK, Lenon, thank you very much.  </p><p> FUNES:  OK, sir.</p><p> JENKINS:  Be well.  Be well.  Buenos.  So, you know, Maria, it's very  interesting to talk to the folks out here because they hear the admonitions  from Secretary Neilsen and from President Trump saying don't come to the  border, you're not going to get in. But in this case, it's interesting  because, Mr. Funes, just not able to get any headway started in his town,  as you see.  The migrant caravan moving here, and actually, interesting  enough, what you're seeing in the distance is an immigration checkpoint, as  you can see, they're not checking anything at the immigration checkpoint,  Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, that's the immigration checkpoint going where?  What's  taking place right there as they go to that check point, Griff?  </p><p> JENKINS:  It would normally be a check point that they have between the  towns of San Pedro to Niltepec in moving towards (INAUDIBLE), and the next  big one in Oaxaca.  They have check points all across the Southern Mexico,  but the immigration officials here and the police just letting them pass,  rather than check anything.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I see.  All right, Griff, thanks very much.  Griff Jenkins is  in Mexico this morning, really, incredible pictures to look at this caravan  and amazing that it is eight days before election, Dagen, because it sort  of crystallizes one of the major issues for voters.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Wait, and I pushback on this that people -- that President  Trump's opponents want to characterize this, and the coverage of this as  stoking fear of immigrants coming into this country.  That is not it.  It  is the fact that people see in this country -- feel like that there's a  rule of law and we have immigration laws.  And they are concerned about  people coming into the United States, floods of people even those coming in  illegally that put a great financial burden on these communities.  If you  look all along the border, in terms of the cost to provide health care to  them, to provide education for all of the children who are in this country  even illegally which is again, with based on a Supreme Court decision.   That's what people are concerned about.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Is basically enforcing rule of law in this country.  And our  hearts go out to these individuals; they want to be in the U.S. because  it's a wonderful place.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's not forget that as John Ratcliffe told us this weekend,  the U.S. -- lets in a million foreign every year, legally.  So, that's the  point, we are letting in outsiders of million people strong every year in a  legal structure, Lee.  But you know, the idea that they can just come and  get in their front of the line, well, people are actually waiting having  done it and going through the steps you need to go through to get in here  legal, it makes no sense.  </p><p> CARTER:  I think that it's really important that people understand that a  majority of Americans are concerned about immigration, and what they're  concerned about is illegal immigration for the reasons exactly you're  talking about people want legal immigration.  People want what the American  dream was founded on, but what they don't want is people taking advantage.   And that doesn't mean that these people are bad people.  This is the  majority of Americans who feel this way, so I think that we need to try and  understand and be more empathetic to what are their concerns and try to  look at it and give them the benefit of the doubt.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I wonder if this doesn't highlight, though, that fact that the  Republicans haven't done more in terms of fully funding the wall, in terms  of depriving money from sanctuary cities in this country.  I wonder if it  doesn't go in the other direction.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Senator Ron Johnson, he said, well, part of it is because the  Democrats, when we went to have the conversation about this, the Democrats  wanted a comprehensive change including the DACA recipients; they wanted  much bigger than what was the issue just for the specific immigration  story. </p><p> All right, still ahead, there this: The man accused of sending multiple  suspicious explosive packages faces a judge later this morning.  We have  details on that coming up on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Thanks so much for joining us this  morning.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday, October 29th.</p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> Investors are looking to start the new week on a high note.  Take a look at  futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of better than 100 points  on the Dow, 21 points higher on the S&amp;P, and 70 points higher on the  Nasdaq, better than 1 percent higher on the Nasdaq right now.</p><p> This, after the major indices capped off a volatile week last week with  sharp declines -- the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 down better than 1 percent on  Friday alone.  The Nasdaq down another 2 percent on Friday on the heels of  disappointing results from Amazon and Alphabet.  The Nasdaq is now in  correction territory.</p><p> Global markets this morning are bouncing nonetheless, taking a cue from  Wall Street.  The FT 100 is up 1.5 percent.  The CAC 40 is up a quarter of  a percent.  And the DAX index in Germany up almost 2 percent this morning,  1.89 percent higher.</p><p> In Asia overnight markets were mostly lower with the exception of Hong  Kong.  Worst performer was China, down better than -- down better than 2  percent, rather on the Shanghai composite.</p><p> Earnings, of course, setting the tone -- third quarter earnings continue to  flow out.  This morning, we have number of companies reporting.  And this  week is a big one.  Dow components, Apple among others, will report  earnings this week -- as you can see the big list coming out this week.</p><p> And we have this -- breaking news overnight.  A plane crashes shortly after  takeover in Indonesia.  Nearly 200 people were on board.  We have the very  latest on the search efforts this morning taking place.</p><p> Honoring the victims of the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting, meanwhile --  thousands filled the streets last night after Pittsburgh's mayor weighed in  on the possible motive.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MAYOR BILL PEDUTO, PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA:  We're dealing with irrational  behavior.  There is no way that you can rationalize a person walking into a  synagogue during services and taking the lives of 11 people.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  The suspect set to appear in court later today.</p><p> Also in court today, the alleged sender of the pipe bombs to prominent  Democrats.  The details and the charges that he faces, coming up.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it  all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PWC partner Mitch  Roschelle, and the president of Maslansky and Partners Lee Carter is here.   Great to see you this morning.  </p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  So good to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I've got to give a big shout out to law enforcement -- how  quickly they found the sender of those pipe bombs.  They did an excellent  job.  And that is why America has the greatest law enforcement ever on the  planet right here.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  And even postal workers --  people working in mail rooms down at the Tribeca offices of Robert De  Niro's film operation.  It's really incredible how alert people were and  we're all thankful that no one was hurt by those pipe bombs -- </p><p> CARTER:  Absolutely.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- most definitely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But the law enforcement did great.  I mean -- it took  them a day and they zeroed in on who did it.  It was really impressive.   And I just want to make sure we give a shout out.  </p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  All off of a finger print.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And because he already had one in the system.  So it wasn't too  hard to find the guy.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  He's hiding in plain sight.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What else is on your mind this morning?  Obviously e4arnings  driving the story.  We've got a bounce going on after that rough week last  week in stocks.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So it's still the revenue disappointments that are front and  center -- 43 percent of the nearly half of the S&amp;P 500 that have reported  so far; 43 percent have missed revenue expectations.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Three months ago it was only 18 percent missing revenue on that.   Apple, a big name to watch Thursday.</p><p> But we've got the jobs report coming out.  So the narrative that has been  developing that you were way ahead of this narrative is that people are  looking into next year, worrying about slowing growth and even possibly a  recession.</p><p> You started talking about it, I think at the beginning of this year. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That is going to be one thing to watch for in terms of the job  growth.  I think the expectation is 188,000 jobs added last month; 3.7  percent unemployment holding at that near 50-year low -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- which is a great number.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But you need to see that job growth, the wage growth still in  place in order to keep people's spirits -- believe (ph) about the strength  of the economy.  </p><p> CARTER:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And when I spoke to Kevin Brady, chairman of House Ways and  Means, this weekend, he was not suggesting that things are slowing down so  far.  I mean, you know, he said yes, we've got a GDP which is 3.5 percent  versus 4.2 percent in the second quarter.  But he continues to see the tax  cut plan and the rollback in regulations having a runway in terms of its  impact on growth -- Lee.  </p><p> CARTER:  You know, I really think though, the big picture things look good.   The macro level and people are looking at their statements, their balances,  there's some volatility right now.  </p><p> The thing I have found fascinating is voter sentiment has been tracking the  stock market very, very closely.  When you see a volatile market like this,  I can't help but wonder what the impact is going to be on the midterms.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Really interesting.  Because people do look at their -- tens of  millions of Americans who are invested in the stock market through their  401(k)s, they do look at their 401(k) balances.  </p><p> CARTER:  Absolutely.  I was just on vacation with a huge number of my  family members.  And a lot of people were talking about might have to roll  back the spending a little bit this year because look at what's happening  to my balance.  I've lost $20,000 this week or whatever amount of money it  was that people have lost.</p><p> And that is going to have an impact because people are looking at the  economy and saying it's so strong, it's so good.  This is why I'm going to  keep voting Republican.</p><p> But right now, when I look at my pocketbook, I'm not so sure.  So what's  that going to mean for voter turnout?  I'm not so sure.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I don't know.  It's a week.  It's a couple of weeks of  market volatility.  I mean I would push back on that because markets go up  and markets go down. </p><p> But you do have this narrative that the worry that economic growth slows  down but you're still talking about very good numbers, I mean 3 percent.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  There's no question though, there's linkage between people look  at account balances and their spending habits and their confidence as  consumers.  So if the -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And they're addicted to behavior.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And we're also going into the holiday shopping season.  And  that's a big barometer for not only future earnings for the retail industry  but just what the year ahead looks like because our economy is so consumer- dependent.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it is.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank God for the consumer and that GDP report last Friday --  that 4 percent growth.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  If it wasn't for that consumer -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Again, it was a good portion of the GDP report.</p><p> ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it's 70 percent of the economy, obviously.</p><p> All right.  All of that coming up this morning.</p><p> But first, united in grief -- the suspect in the shooting at the Tree of  Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh where 11 people were killed, six others  injured -- he will appear in court today.</p><p> President Trump says the law needs to change.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This was an anti-Semitic  attack at its worst.  And when you have crimes like this, whether it's this  one or another one on another group, we have to bring back the death  penalty.</p><p> They have to pay the ultimate price.  They have to pay the ultimate price.   They can't do this.  They can't do this to our country.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  The Department of Justice is considering the death  penalty against suspect Robert Bowers.</p><p> Joining me right now is Republican Congressman Scott Perry from  Pennsylvania.  Congressman -- thanks very much for joining us.  And our  condolences to -- </p><p> REP. SCDOTT PERRY (R), PENNSYLVANIA:  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- everyone there, your constituents in Pennsylvania as the  entire country is mourning for the victims of this horrible fatality.  </p><p> PERRY:  Yes, we are in mourning in Pennsylvania.  Of course we just can't  imagine that this occurs in a synagogue, in a church -- kind of the epitome  of innocence.  I understand one of the victims was a Holocaust survivor, in  her synagogue.</p><p> BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p> PERRY:  Just -- we are just completely grief-stricken and condemn these  actions in the strongest terms.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You heard the President there.  Do you want to see the death  penalty here?  </p><p> PERRY:  Yes.  I'm a supporter of the death penalty.  I think it is a  deterrent.  And in Pennsylvania we've got a governor that has seen fit to  not exercise his authority to use the death penalty even in horrific cases  such as this.  And so I think that certainly it deserves another look, if  nothing else.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me switch gears and ask you about some of the economic  issues going on.  The President has been keeping the pressure on China at a  rally in Indianapolis.  The President laid down a sticking point he has  with Beijing and America's trade dealings with them.</p><p> Listen to what he said.  I've got to get your reaction here -- sir.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  Chinese companies have tried to steal our trade secrets.  China has  taken many of those great, brilliant things that you've come up with and  they've stolen it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I don't think anybody -- I mean many people agree with that  statement, Congressman -- that China has been stealing from the United  States for decades.  But what do you do about it?  I mean you serve on the  House Committee on Foreign Affairs -- your thoughts here.</p><p> PERRY:  Well, there's got to be strict penalties for those types of things,  number one.  Number two, I think that China's got to understand from an  economic standpoint that we won't stand for it and there's going to be  consequences on the larger -- on a macro level.</p><p> And so when the President says that he's going to rein China in and isolate  China from an economic standpoint, I think that that's part of it.  We  could certainly be more reasonable on other issues regarding tariffs,  regarding trade, regarding the World Trade Organization.</p><p> But we cannot be reasonable with the outright theft, the lawlessness and  the theft of our intellectual property in the United States and the west in  general by China.  And they have to suffer economically for that.  They  have to see that there's a correlation between stealing other countries'  intellectual property and their prosperity.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  But they haven't done anything about it, right.  I mean  this fight now has gone on, more than a year, I guess.  And the President  is pushing back, rightly so, for this theft.</p><p> PERRY:  Right.  Right.  Well -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  He's a dictator for life in China and he's not changing his  behavior, is he?  </p><p> PERRY:  Well, and I think that the President is right to be patient because  this is -- it's gone on for much longer than a year.  This president is  finally the one that has said we've had enough of it and we're going to do  something about it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> PERRY:  I think it requires -- it requires a measured response over time  that escalates and lets China know that if it continues, there's going to  be benchmarks that you're going to have to deal with all across the  spectrum of opportunities that the administration and the United States and  the world has.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And we find it unacceptable -- continue to highlight it as a  problem.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- the President is also outlining a new tax break  for the middle class.  Congressman Kevin Brady joined me yesterday on  \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" and told me that this is separate and apart from  making the individual cuts permanent.</p><p> Listen to what he said -- got to get your reaction here.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. KEVIN BRADY (R), TEXAS:  It's really about keeping the momentum going.   Obviously the economy is booming.  We're on track for the first total year  over year plus 3 percent economic growth in more than a decade.</p><p> We're seeing jobs coming back, paychecks going up.  Main Street is hiring  again.  So the President's really about focused on more of that economic  growth.</p><p> The House has passed 2.0 before we left for October with 44 Democrat votes  for this three-bill package.  It's now over in the Senate.</p><p> And I think permanence really depends on this election.  If Republicans  retain control of the House and the Senate next year we will do  reconciliation and make these tax cuts permanent.</p><p> The President wants to go even farther.  He's really focused on the middle  class.  He just believes they're the ones who get squeezed the most.  He's  asked us and we worked with him on developing another 10 percent middle  class tax cuts for workers and families.  And so we'll be ready to move  with that as well.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So Congressman -- what do you think of the plan in terms of an  additional tax cut?  And what about the pushback that we continue to see  deficits -- $800 billion deficit this year and trillion dollar deficits for  as long as you can look.  </p><p> PERRY:  Right.  Well, Maria -- I always think that letting people keep more  of what they earn is a good thing and that the government misuses the tax  dollars in some respects that are sent in.  So that's always a good thing.</p><p> And also, on the deficit side, I've been there on the deficit side, voting  against bloated deficits and bloated deficit spending.  But let's not  correlate the two so directly.  You don't fix your overspending problem by  taxing people more.  You fix that by spending less.</p><p> And so that's what we really need to focus on.  The President offered a  budget that spent less and we didn't take much or any of it up.  As a  matter of fact, the tax proposal that the House sent the Senate I think  saved about $400 billion but yet the Senate sent it back with a trillion  dollars additional spending.</p><p> And unfortunately to get something that allows the people to keep more of  what they earn has to make it through the Senate.  As long as that's full  of liberal folks that don't want to cut spending we're going to have this  problem.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> PERRY:  We want to fix that here in about seven days.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- real quick, tell me how the seven days is  looking to you in terms of the midterm elections?  Are you expecting to  keep the majority in the House or do you think that that goes to the Dems?  </p><p> PERRY:  No, I think that that's clearly doable.  I've been out on the  streets, knocking on doors.  It's been a really, really positive response.   So I think people are correlating more money kept in their pocket, more  money that they've earned at their disposal, as long as Republicans are in  charge.</p><p> They also know that if Nancy Pelosi is in charge that she's going to vote  for tax increases.  She's going to pull all that back.  They don't like  that unpredictability anymore than businesses don't like that  unpredictability.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Congressman -- we'll leave it there.  Good to see  you this morning Thanks very much.</p><p> PERRY:  Thank you.  Good morning.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman Scott Perry joining us.</p><p> MORNINGS WITH MARIA will begin an hour early at 5:00 a.m. Eastern on  November 7th, the day after the midterm elections.  We are bringing you the  results from the midterms.</p><p> We've got all hands on deck, so join us on November 7th for an early start.</p><p> First though, horror after takeoff -- the search for survivors this morning  after an Indonesian plan crashes into the sea.  We've got the details,  next.</p><p> And then the pipe bomb suspect is headed to court.  Details on his expected  appearance later today.</p><p> Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All passengers and crew on board a Lion Air passenger jet  feared dead this morning.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details.  Cheryl -- what a terrible story.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It really is -- Maria.</p><p> We're getting some new details right now on this.  Rescue officials in  Indonesia have found some human remains as one of those officials is  predicting there will be no survivors.  The Lion Air Boeing 737 had 189  passengers and crew on board.  It went down off the Indonesian coast  shortly after taking off this morning from Jakarta for an island off  Sumatra. </p><p> In addition to the human remains that were found, search and rescue crews  have found ID cards, personal belongings and aircraft debris.  The accident  is the first reported incident involving a new version of Boeing's very  popular 737.</p><p> Well, the English football world is mourning the loss of Leicester City's  team owner and four others who were killed in a fiery helicopter crash on  Saturday.  The helicopter carrying the 60-year-old billionaire Vichai  Srivaddhanaprabha burst into flames shortly after taking off from the team  stadium.</p><p> Vichai made his fortune with the duty-free retail giant King Power.  He  bankrolled Leicester's improbably league title triumph back in 2016.  An  investigation into the cause of that crash is continuing this morning.</p><p> Well, the Florida man accused of sending at least 14 pipe bombs to  prominent Democrats is set to make his first court appearance in Miami  today.  Fifty-six-year-old Cesar Sayoc faces five federal charges of up to  48 years in prison.</p><p> He was arrested on Friday, four days after the first package was found in  New York.  A single finger print led the FBI to his arrest.  U.S. Marshals  are expected to transfer Sayoc to New York City where the Justice  Department wants to try him in the U.S. Attorney's southern district.</p><p> A lot of busy headlines over the weekend -- Maria.  Back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p> Coming up, a new strategy for Sam's Club -- details on the retailer's plans  to open its own version of Amazon Go stores.  That's coming up.</p><p> Then an incredible win for the Boston Red Sox, the highlights from the  World Series coming up right here later this hour.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Fed fallout -- the Federal Reserve raising interest rates; it is taking a  toll on the housing market.  Growth in existing home sales is slowing.  As  a result my next guest says rental demand is soaring.</p><p> Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Marcos and Millichap  CEO Hessam Nadji.  Hessam -- good to see you this morning, thanks so much  for joining us.</p><p> HESSAM NADJI, CEO, MARCOS AND MILLICHAP:  Good morning -- Maria.  Great to  be with you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, we know that when interest rates move it has all  sorts of effect.  We've got this volatility in the stock market as now some  investors are looking at real opportunities in fixed income on the short  end certainly with the two-year now all the way up to 3 percent.  Tell us  about the impact on housing.  </p><p> NADJI:  Well, as you mentioned, the effect of interest rates is direct on a  number of sectors in real estate, especially residential housing prices are  affected.  Sales have slowed.  And that's not really a surprise.</p><p> But we have to remember, even before interest rates began to really  increase, we saw consumers prefer to rent.  The demographics have changed.   The financial crisis was a very hard hit to the consumer on the housing  front.</p><p> So we've seen the apartment rental market show incredible strength.  And it  continues to show strength because of the fact that now you have this  compounding effect of higher interest rates and price appreciation on the  housing side pushing more people into the rental market.</p><p> But Maria -- I have to say that if you look at commercial real estate  broadly, we're still seeing very little over-building.  We still see the  absence of bad loans about to create a problem on the leverage side of the  equation.  So the industry looks very good.</p><p> But again, rising interest rates pressure prices.  and the fact that the  tax reform was so favorable toward commercial real estate, it still hasn't  had time to work its way through.</p><p> So investors are mostly concerned about rising interest rates and frankly,  trade wars is another concern.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Hessam -- Mitch Roschelle, good morning.</p><p> One that you talked about, demand for apartments which is great.  You also  mentioned commercial real estate and the strong fundamentals.  What I don't  really understand is why the REITs aren't behaving the way the underlying  fundamentals of real estate are behaving.  So maybe you can explain a  little bit why the REITS seem to be oversold right now.</p><p> NADJI:  Well, Mitch -- we've seen many instances of interest rates rising  and creating an overhang on the REIT side and over-punishing REIT just  because interest rates are rising despite the fundamentals.  I think the  sector is really caught up again in that phenomenon.</p><p> But as you said the fundamentals are extremely strong and REITs are very  good operators and create all kinds of benefits in terms of economies of  scale and the way they manage property and keep occupancies high.</p><p> But I think the other concern is that given the fact that the Fed  inevitably has to raise interest rates to normalize rates along with a  very, very strong economy, the investment community is telling us that  they're hoping there is a little bit of a pause because it takes six to  nine months for the effect of the higher interest rates to work its way  through the economy. </p><p> And we're really hearing from a lot of investors, they're concerned about  the Fed going too far, too fast and maybe creating too much of an adverse  effect whether it's on REITs or the housing market, you know, both.  </p><p> CARTER:  You know, I think it's interesting too, that the housing market --  you're talking a lot about interest rates but also tax reform took away the  ability for people to write off local taxes, property taxes, as much as  they did before on their mortgage.  I think that could have some impact on  purchase behavior as well.</p><p> So you're talking about the trends but what do you think is going to happen  long-term if this is the way things are looking?  And also, it's going to  have an impact on individual wealth, if people aren't going to buy homes.  </p><p> NADJI:  You're totally right in that the tax reform was much more favorable  toward investing in commercial real estate.  There is a number of  provisions that were preserved and a number of provision that were added  that makes commercial real estate investing very favorable.</p><p> It takes time for that to come through the marketplace.  And we're just  seeing investors complete their 2017 taxes and so we need a cycle or two to  see the benefits.</p><p> But you're right.  On the housing front clearly, the tax reform does reduce  demand both at the lower end of the market and, of course, the higher end  of the market and it just compounds this long-term trend we've seen of more  and more consumers wanting the flexibility of renting, wanting the  flexibility of, you know, moving around to chase jobs, especially among the  younger adults, the 30-somethings that are capturing a lot of the  professional service jobs that are being created in urban areas.  That  segment in particular prefers to rent right now.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Hessam -- thanks very much  for the info.  We so appreciate it.  Good to see you.  </p><p> NADJI:  Great to be with you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Hessam Nadji there.</p><p> Coming up, iPhone versus Android, which one?  Why a shocking study claims  those who use apple products are happier -- later this hour.</p><p> Then Halloween at the White House -- more of the incredible decorations on  the south lawn to show you.  Check this out</p><p> Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 29th.  Your  top stories right now 7:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> A market turnaround this morning.  We are expecting a big rally at the  start of trading.  Right here, this is the high of the morning.  Dow  Industrials are up 170 points, two thirds of one percent.  S&amp;P 500 up 29  points, that's better than one percent, and the NASDAQ is up 93 points  right now, that's 1-1/3 percent higher on the NASDAQ.  </p><p> Very strong start is expected this morning after the major indices finished  lower on Friday after a volatile week.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 now back in  negative territory for the year after that selloff on Friday as you can  see.  </p><p> In Europe this morning, we've got a bit of a bounce as well.  As you can  see, this is the high of the morning in Europe as well, FT-100 up 128  points, that's almost two percent higher right now in London.  The CAC  Quarante in Paris up better than one percent and the DAX Index in Germany  up better than two percent right now, 237 points higher in Germany.  </p><p> Asian markets meanwhile, mostly lower overnight.  The Shanghai Composite  down better than two percent on the session.  </p><p> The way of the Futures, Sam Club -- Sam's Club is going head to head with  Amazon, details of the retailer's new high tech store coming up.  </p><p> And then, the proof is in the phone, not all smartphones are the same and  the users are just as different as the gadgets, apparently.  What your  phone says about you, coming up.  </p><p> Then, taking the series, the Boston Red Sox beating the L.A. Dodgers to win  the World Series yesterday.  We've got all the highlights.  </p><p> And Halloween at the White House, the president and the first lady greeting  trick or treaters.  More of the White House decorations coming up.  Wow,  that looks good.</p><p> All those stories coming up this Monday morning.  But first, our top story,  counting down to the midterms.  We are now eight days away.  President  Trump is on a campaign rally blitz with just eight days until voters head  to the polls.  Fox News correspondent Kevin Corke at the White House this  morning with the very latest.  Kevin, good morning to you.  </p><p> KEVIN CORKE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Blitz is the perfect  word.  Now, it's a relatively quiet start to the week for the president.   He does have an Intel briefing later this morning.  But as you point out,  he has certainly been a rogue warrior for the GOP ahead of the midterms,  another rally in Illinois over the weekend.  And there are more rallies in  the (INAUDIBLE) as we head down the stretch, which is eight days ago before  the midterms.  </p><p> In fact on the schedule, the president now has stops set up in the Sunshine  and show me states, Florida with those huge races for the Senate and  governor, that are getting plenty of national attention.  </p><p> Meanwhile, over in Missora, as we like to say, I can say it, I'm from  Missouri.  Democrat Senator Claire McCaskill trailing her Republican  challenger Josh Hawley.  He's the attorney general in the state.  Latest  polls showing Hawley up 49-45.  </p><p> Also this morning here at the White House, we expect to hear what  administration officials have to say about German chancellor Angela  Merkel's decision to not seek re-election as chancellor.  Though she has  stated this morning that she'd like to remain in her post until 2021.  </p><p> One more thing that we're certainly keeping a very close eye on in addition  to the markets, we're watching what may happen in terms of border security  later this week, Maria.  The president sort of tipped his hand last week,  said that we should expect something big.  We'll keep an eye on it for you,  but for now, back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, great reporting.  Kevin, as always, thank you.   Kevin Corke at the White House.  </p><p> Let's talk about this, eight days away from the November elections, Lee  Carter, you've been doing dials -- give us a sense of what you see going  into the election on Tuesday night.  </p><p> CARTER:  So, I see more tribalism than we've ever had before.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p> CARTER:  I didn't think it was possible.  But it was in 2016.  But there's  no doubt, that right now, if you support the president, you support him no  matter what.  If you hate the president, you hate him no matter what.  An  independence are completely disenfranchised.  </p><p> They were for a while, tracking with Republicans.  Sometimes they've  tracked with Democrats.  What they're doing right now is they are neutral,  and they are tuned out -- tuned off, and saying we want something  different.  </p><p> So, a lot of polling that you'll see is saying that we want a different  kind of leadership, we want something different to happen in Washington,  D.C.  And that's not necessarily just directed at the president.  That's  politics in general.  </p><p> They looked at what happened with Kavanaugh and they said, you know what, I  do not like the way the Senate handled this on either side.  And I am  disillusion.  </p><p> So, what's going to happen is you have to look at this very locally.   Because individual races are being run very, very different than what  you're seeing nationwide.  </p><p> Nationwide, we're seeing a party of the Democrats running on resist,  resist, resist, we hate Trump at all costs.  Locally, if you look at  advertising what people are talking about is health care.  And health care  is the number one issue that's important to the American voter right now.   So, you see a very different thing playing out when you get close to voters  than you do seeing what's happening nationwide.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But some of these Democrats are running on something that is  essentially made up when it comes to health care.  They're running on --  their messaging is Republicans want to take away your coverage for pre- existing conditions.  </p><p> CARTER:  That's right.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's what Republicans want to do.  And that's just not true.   Pre-existing conditions are still covered.  Despite the rollback of some  elements of Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act, despite the opening up  and allowing people to maybe buy plans in some states that don't have all  the benefits, that would be cheaper for individuals.  </p><p> So again, it's just astonishing to me that health care's number one but the  Democrats are messaging something that isn't true.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And don't forget that the economy is right there.  I mean,  you're talking 58 percent to 54 percent.  So, the economy is just almost as  equal as -- in terms of importance.  </p><p> CARTER:  That's right.  And I think that it's really, really important that  we understand that.  As we're looking at jobs numbers coming out this  Friday, as we're looking at people's income, wages, those kind of things  are going to be changing I think for the better right now.  That's  something that matters a lot to the American voter.  </p><p> And they're -- I think the other thing that a lot of people are talking  about right now is confidence right now in the economic future and you see  that, you're seeing a big change and a big shift.  And that plays out for  the Republicans as well.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  To that -- to that point, The Wall Street Journal poll that they  did last week, Republicans had a 15 percentage point advantage on the  economy.  50 percentage points, I think that that is the highest percentage  in this advantage in the cycle so far.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And it is a very clear difference in terms of what they're  doing.  The Republicans want to lower taxes and roll back regulations.  And  the Democrats want to do the opposite.  They want to -- they didn't vote  for the tax cut plan.  They want to raise taxes as has been said by Nancy  Pelosi.  And they don't like the rollback in regulations.  These are the  two key things that have moved the needle on economic growth.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  The thing I worry about with all the market volatility that  we've have in the month October is there's the basic voter and these  independents who are very undecided.  Can they decouple what's going on in  the stock market from what's fundamentally going on in the economy?  What's  going on -- going on in the economy is good.  What's going on in the stock  market right now is uncertain.  And I hope they can understand the  difference.  </p><p> CARTER:  Yes, I think that it is going to be a big question.  Because we  have people who do check their 401-k balances all the time, like I was  talking about earlier.  And then there's people who don't, who are looking  at the bigger -- there are people employed, are -- you know, how does it  feel out there.  So, we're going to see something different depending on  how people -- you know, behave and that's something that's going to be a  case by case basis.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You know what we aren't hearing that's different is you still  hear from the left, from some Democrats that basket of deplorables  narrative.</p><p> CARTER:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  That if you support, you might -- that if you support President  Trump, then you are essentially evil and it goes back to -- and this is  quoting from The Wall Street Journal editorial on the massacre at the Tree  of Life Synagogue called the oldest hatred.  The Wall Street Journal wrote,  Americans would do well to ignore this toxic habit.  A political blame for  murderous acts by the racist anti-Semitic or mentally disturb.  But this is  not the narrative that you hear from some people on the left, some people  in the media even.  And I wonder if that doesn't basically push people  closer to President Trump and even have them dig in over their support for  him.  </p><p> CARTER:  It absolutely -- it absolutely does.  I think outside of the  polling the thing that you really need to look at is the rhetoric.  And the  voter enthusiasm on the Republican side was waning, no question about it.   Kavanaugh hearings came out and you said if you stand with Kavanaugh, you  stand against women and what happened, Republicans came out said, don't  tell me what to do, don't tell me how to behave.  And right now, you're  saying if you stand with Republicans you stand with the president, you're  anti-Semitic, that you're racist, that you're fascist.  That you're all of  these things.  And what ends up happening, people say no, I'm not.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> CARTER:  And that is not -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, this is the new charge now, you know, that you're hearing  a lot about.  Let's not forget the success that people are expecting from  the Republicans in the Senate.  Congressman John Ratcliffe detailed his  predictions for the midterms yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".  He was  optimistic, watch this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE (R-TX), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:  I will tell  you, Maria, I feel really good a week out from the midterms.  I think a lot  of what Senator Graham was just saying will come to fruition.  </p><p> There is no blue wave in the Senate.  We are going to keep the Senate and  in fact we're going to pick up seats in the Senate, at least one, hopefully  two or three.  </p><p> The House is going to be -- it's going to be tight.  History is against us,  Maria, but there are things that are working for us.  One of those is the  president who is out on a daily basis working his tail off to help  Republicans in tough races.  The other thing that's working for us, Maria,  is I think it's being crystalized in these last few weeks, the choice that  Americans have between Republicans and Democrats.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think it's important to recognize what's about to happen in  the Senate.  Because if they gain seats in the Senate, the president will  have an easier time getting his appointees through.</p><p> CARTER:  That's right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  His nominations.  And you know he's about to change attorney  generals.  So, he will probably get his A.G. through the Senate easily and  that changes a lot for this president.  </p><p> CARTER:  That changes a lot for this president.  And I think that you can  almost take it for granted that at this point the Republicans are going to  keep the Senate and gain seats.  And you know, the difference -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a big victory for the president.  </p><p> CARTER:  That's a really, really big victory for the president.  I think  it's also fascinating, the last time you saw a split like this where the  Senate went one way and the House went another play was in the early '80s.   So, we have a real fracture here.  And the House has to really look at  itself and try to figure out why they're having such an issue.  Because,  you know, there's 99 seats right now at play in the House.  </p><p> The last time in 2016 there were only 39 seats at play.  In 2014, there  were only 44 seats at play.  This is a lot of seats at play.  And I think  the House has to take a look at itself and figure out why is it that they  are really being disrupted right now, why is it that things are so  different for them and everywhere else.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And the Democrats only have to flip what, 23 seats or so to  actually get a majority.  But let's not forget, Mitch, they also have to  defend their current seats.  It's not just the 23 seats.  They've got to  defend what they already have.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  And think about how many congress men and women decided not to  run again which is -- which is --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, there's more than 40 resignations on the Republicans.   43.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Right.  Which is contributing to why perhaps we have 99 right  now.</p><p> CARTER:  Yes.  I also think the thing that's going to make this so hard to  predict is voter volatility and how they're going to vote, it's something  that we haven't seen in a long time.  Even though we have tribalism, based  on events that happen, whether you're talking about Kavanaugh, whether  you're talking about the events that happened last week, people's  indignation and their desire to go out and vote and their -- you know, and  their enthusiasm has really changed.  </p><p> Now we're looking at a neck in neck race where you've got 68 percent of  Republicans enthusiastic likely to vote, 72 percent of Democrats.  That's  really a virtual tie.  </p><p> The last time, and the closest that we've ever had, this kind of voter  enthusiasm is about 20 years ago.  So, this is -- this is really a  significant time.  And people need to get out there and vote.  This is --  this is unlike -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  If the -- if the Dems win the House by only a couple of seats,  there's really not a mandate.  </p><p> CARTER:  No.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you know, it's so tight, it is so tight in the House.  </p><p> CARTER:  Yes.  I mean, we are -- we are a country divided.  But you know,  the Republicans are hanging in there and it's -- you know, if you were to  just read the newspapers, if you were just to -- you know, look at the  mainstream media right now, you would think that the Republicans are  persona non gratas.  That's not the case.  They've got the White House --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They're getting the wrong story for the mainstream media.</p><p> CARTER:  Well, I just want to be clear.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We know that.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, if anybody was flipping channels around the weekend, they  would have seen some people in the most highly offensive way trying to take  exploit the massacre at the tree of life Synagogue --</p><p> CARTER:  Absolutely.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- for their own political gain.  That was some of what was  going on.  It is shaming of people who consider themselves to be  conservatives.  So, I'm curious.  That changes.</p><p> CARTER:  Well, they say -- and they say this election is going to be won by  suburban women.  And when you're voting -- you know, when you're running an  election, when you're saying that if you -- if you stand with Republicans,  that you are racist, you are anti-feminist, you're anti women, you are  anti-Semitic and all these things.  You're asking these women and say that  my children, my husband, my brother, my father, I agree with you.  They're  all those people and they're not going to do that.  Nobody likes to be told  -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Above and beyond women like and want financial security.  And  we're going to find out this Friday potentially that wages average hourly  earnings are growing more than three percent first time in 9-1/2 years.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That would be a huge thing if we see that on Friday on the jobs  report.  </p><p> Stay with Fox Business for a special midterm election coverage beginning in  November 6 at 7:00 p.m. Eastern.  We are all hands on deck at night and  then, MORNINGS WITH MARIA the next day will start an early -- an hour  earlier at 5:00 a.m. Eastern the next day to bring you the results from the  midterm elections.

First baseman Steve Pearce named World Series MVP after  hammering three home runs and eight RBIs in the five games.  This is the  Red Sox's fourth World Series wins since 2014, their ninth overall.  </p><p> And President Trump and first lady Melania Trump marking Halloween at the  White House yesterday.  The pictures are great.  There are plenty of  treats, no tricks.  The couple just handed out candy to the kids on the  south lawn.  Children were dressed up as astronauts, superheroes, first  responders.  They stood in line, they got Twizzlers and Hershey bars from  President Trump and the first lady, who by the way, didn't dress up, Maria.   I don't know, they could have done something, a little something.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, that's true.</p><p> CASONE:  Just a thought.  You know, my opinion.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p> Coming up, a different type of personality test.  Check this out, the  surprising study on the differences between iPhone and Android users.   Which one are you?  Back in a minute.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK, so, forget the differences between dog and cat people.   There are also disparities between iPhone and Android users.  According to  a new study by online company Slickdeals, those using Apple's smart phone  are 27 percent more likely to say they are very happy with their lives.   Joining us right now is the cyber guy, Kurt Knutsson.  Kurt, good to see  you.  OK, so first things first.</p><p> KURT KNUTSSON, THE CYBER GUY:  Good to see you, Maria.  You know, I'm very  happy with this.  But I'm --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you an iPhone or Android boy?  </p><p> KNUTSSON:  I'm both.  I am both.  Now, I'm embarrassed (INAUDIBLE) I think  my Android phone.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Now I'm confused.  </p><p> KNUTSSON:  I now have a complex, right?  What about these figures?   Incredible.  A thousand of people were asked on the Android side.  And then  they asked a thousand iPhone owners all sorts of things, not just the happy  quotient.  </p><p> And by the way, are you happy with your job?  33 percent of those with an  iPhone said yes, I am.  And only was it 20-22 -- 20 percent with an Android  should say they're actually happy with their job.  </p><p> Spending pretty incredible, in terms of like Maria I'm assuming have an  iPhone, just because you look dynamite all the time.  Spending on clothing  $117 versus really just $62.00 for Android users.  The same in the makeup  and beauty category and also when it comes to tech, pretty incredible  spending differences here.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Wow.</p><p> KNUTSSON:  So clearly, if you own an Android you may not be the life of the  party but you're going to be the smart, frugal one for the long haul.  OK?   That's what I'm hearing out of this whole story.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you think about this, Mitch?  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Well, I'm trying to get -- Kurt, so what influences the  decision to buy one versus the other?  How much of it is personal choice?   How much of it is what companies will reimburse for?  What's really  influencing this?  I'm trying to get behind these numbers and figure out  whether or not there's cause and effect.  </p><p> KNUTSSON:  That would be our next study, right?  That's what we have to do  with that one.  The fact is though, people that buy an iPhone clearly are a  different kind of person in someone who's buying an Android device at this  point.</p><p> And this study right here all be it 2,000 people being sample still as  pretty telling about you know, symbolically what these phones mean in our  lives.  </p><p> The amount of time we're spending on them also, people with an iPhone  apparently spending five hours a day plus, a little bit more than an  Android.  And then, there's figure on that, 58 tweets on average from  iPhone users versus just down into the 20s for someone on an Android.  </p><p> And so people with an iPhone, also 12 selfies a day is the average, only  five selfies a day if you've got an Android.  </p><p> CARTER:  So, you're happy you can take more selfies?</p><p> KNUTSSON:  Are they less narcissistic?  That's the next question.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wait, does that have to do with the camera or the selfie?  I  mean, the picture that you're taking?  </p><p> KNUTSSON:  Right or your skill set and being able to take the picture.  I  don't know.  I think it's interesting to take a look at it's fun  information.  And yet again, Apple's selling phones like crazy with their  three introduced phones this quarter.  </p><p> CARTER:  But, I mean, it's a really fun study.  With 2,000 is a significant  sample.  I mean, that would be -- that would be a really good poll.  So, I  -- is there anything in there about voter preference?  Are we more likely  to be Republican or Democrat?  </p><p> KNUTSSON:  Not in this particular study.  But that'd be interesting.   That's one you can do.  </p><p> CARTER:  I know right?  I'm fascinated by brand identity and politics.   Seems to be getting more and more, you know, you double down on those kinds  of things.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Kurt, Apple's hosting another event in Brooklyn  after the unveiling of its new iPhones last month.  They're reportedly  expected to reveal what's next for the iPad.  What do you think about what  we'll hear?  </p><p> KNUTSSON:  Yes, you're right.  I think, you know, very interesting, so away  from Cupertino an hour on the East Coast.  We're at the creation kind of  location.  The Brooklyn Academy of Music, and it's all about using words  about the making.  So, I think what we're going to see is on the hardware  side, we're going to see two refreshes of the iPad Pro, edge to edge  screens, maybe a new MacBook Air and then something big coming that Reed  Hastings at Netflix may want to keep his eye on.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK, we'll watch that.  That makes me happy.  Kurt, thank you.   Kurt Knutsson joining us there.  </p><p> Still ahead, IBM's largest acquisition ever, details on the company's $33  billion deal for Red Hat.

Good Monday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Monday to you.  I'm Maria Bartiromo  and it is Monday, October 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on  the button.  It is looking like a pretty good start to trading this  morning.  Investors expected to start the new week on a strong note with  Dow industrials up 126 points right now.  That's a half of a percent  higher.</p><p> The S&amp;P is up almost one percent and the NASDAQ right now 71-point move  higher is up better than one percent.  This after the major indices capped  off a volatility week last week with sharp declines on Friday.  The Dow and  the S&amp;P 500 were down better than one percent on Friday.  The NASDAQ down  better than two percent on the heels of disappointing earnings from Amazon  and Alphabet.</p><p> Global markets this morning have a firmer tone, European indices higher  across the board, FT-100 up almost two percent, 125 points higher.  CAC  quarante in Paris is up almost one percent and the DAX Index in Germany up  almost two percent, 198 points higher in Germany.  In Asia overnight,  markets finished mostly lower as you see there with the exception, Hong  Kong.  Shanghai Composite down sharply down better than two percent  overnight.</p><p> Meanwhile, earnings certainly settling the tone from Wall Street this  morning, several Dow components including Apple will be reporting their  quarterly numbers this week.  Investors are watching also G.E., the Wall  Street Journal is reporting this morning that the company may be forced to  cut its dividend again.  One of the top stories in the Journal.  Bit of a  merger Monday on Wall Street to tell you about.</p><p>IBM is acquiring Red Hat for $33 billion.  This is IBM's largest  acquisition ever.  Red Hat shares are up 52 percent on the news.  IBM  shares off of the lows down 3-1/4 percent.  Coming up.  How the deal will  drive growth at the struggling technology companies coming up.  </p><p> Breaking news overnight.  A plane crashes shortly after in Indonesia.   Nearly 200 were onboard.  We have the very latest on the search effort  happening right now. </p><p> And then honoring the victims of the Tree Of Life Synagogue shooting.   Thousands of people filling the streets last night in Pittsburgh after  President Trump condemned the attack on Saturday.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: This evil anti-semitic attack is  an assault on all of us, it's an assault on humanity.  It will require all  of us working together to extract the hateful poison of anti-semitism from  our world.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest coming up as the alleged shooter is set  to appear in court today.  All those stories coming up this Monday morning  and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  PwC Partner Mitch Roschelle and the president of Maslansky and Partners,  Lee Carter.  Good to see you.  Great show so far guys.</p><p> LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.   Interesting times for sure.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Sure is.  </p><p> MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Yes.  We've got -- we've got a lot of news  and we've got an election in days.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Exactly. Well, and that could change a lot in terms of  the agenda whether or not we see the economic agenda like another tax cut  plan in place, Dagen, the rollback in regulations could be reversed.  I  don't know.  I know the victory in the Senate side is going to be a big win  for this president but certainly the House could do investigation after  investigation of President Trump and his taxes and all that stuff.</p><p> That's what Jerry Nadler said as his priority if in fact he becomes the  chairman of Oversight.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  A lot -- you will see  a lot of investigation that are for show and nothing else if the Democrats  win the House, but there is still some races in the Senate that are  extremely, extremely close.  Watching Nevada for example, Dean Heller in  Nevada, the seat is up for grabs in State of Arizona between Martha McSally  and Kyrsten Sinema, that's really important to watch.</p><p> So there are look -- they - it looks like there are some real Republican  wins afoot in the Senate but it's still going to be a nail-biter of what?   Eight days from now.  </p><p> CARTER:  No question because you've seen the polling flip, you know, we  were certain things are going one way and then the next week you see that  they're, you know, that same candidate is seven points ahead of somebody  that they were behind.  So, they were going to really have to watch this  case-by-case, moment-by-moment.  And as things are happening, the way that  the candidates, the way that the parties are reacting to these big events,  like the events that happened this weekend.</p><p> The sad, tragic event at the Synagogue this weekend.  The way that people  react to this is going to dictate how people behave.  It really is.  And we  want to heal right and we want to see healers.  We don't want to see finger  pointing.  And so I think that real leadership is tested this week.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  People are shutting down the hate, they don't want it anymore.  </p><p> CARTER:  No.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All of that coming up this hour.  We got a big hour coming up.   But first, this top story this hour and that is earning season is rolling  on.  Largely, we are in the second busiest week of the quarter in terms of  earnings, Apple, Starbucks, General Electric, Facebook and ExxonMobil all  reporting this week.  That will set the tone for markets for sure.  And  we've got the October jobs' report coming out this Friday.</p><p> Expectations call for 190,000 jobs added to economy last month with the  unemployment rate remaining steady at 3.7 percent.  This would be for the  month of October.  Of course, November begins this week.  Joining us now to  talk all economics is JMP Securities President Mark Lehmann.  And Mark, it  is good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p> MARK LEHMANN, PRESIDENT, JMP SECURITIES:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on the backdrop for investing right now.   Earnings and this upcoming jobs' report.  What do you expect?</p><p> LEHMANN:  Well, the market has been dominated by news not by earnings as of  -- as October has progressed and obviously last week was not a great week  for the markets and October has been awful month.  I think we're seeing the  futures point a little higher, I think, you know, the VIX trading as high  as it has.  I think -- I think we've seen the highs of the year and the  lows of the year so far.</p><p> And I think we're going to recover a little bit here going into the  election and going into the fourth quarter.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So more volatility is what you're -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> LEHMANN:  I think volatility is going to reign supreme.  I think we have a  headline-driven market to date.  I think investors for the first time in a  while are not reacting to some good numbers.  And that tells me something.   We're seeing IPO pricing denigrate, go down a little bit here.  We've seen  some deals that have been cut in half in size and the deals are not really  popping anymore.  We've seen some deals break price.</p><p> SurveyMonkey which is high profile IPO in the third quarter broke price and  sees trading below their IPO price.  Those are warnings science that will  tell you, we'll see a little bit of a tampering of the market but I'm not  worried about the market going in '19, I think better days are still ahead.  </p><p> ROSCHELLE:  The market shook off so much news all year.  Every day there  was something in the news cycle and the news cycle in the month of October  if you look at it versus rest of the year isn't that much different but why  is it that anything going on right now, the markets almost gone hyperbolic  in terms of how they react to it.  </p><p> LEHMANN:  I think you said it well.  I think we shook off a lot of bad  news, and I think we shook off a lot of fear, let's use the China tensions  that we've seen through the year and that continues to be in our backdrop  and I think nobody expects that to end quickly and I think the specter of  more tariffs and more back-and-forth is in front of us.  I think there is  also a question about the tax cuts and results on earnings.</p><p> What that means for comparisons going into '19, we have great comparisons  18 over 17, one of the comparisons looking at '19.  And I just think more  of more of that has grown into the market specter and that specter now is a  little bit more cautious.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You have a major overreaction by investors to a little sliver of  bad news.  We've been talking about sales missing expectations for a  revenue missing expectations for weeks now, but if you look at Amazon and  the Wall Street Journal points this out today, that on Thursday evening, it  posted a record -- a firm with a record third-quarter profit, right?  It  was 11 times more the profit was than the period a year earlier.</p><p> But it sales came up a little bit shorter of expectations.  There were  concerns about the forecast for the holiday season.  But shares fell almost  eight percent on Friday and that S&amp;P was only down 1.7 percent.  Amazon  stock is down 18 percent so far in the month October.  That seems like an  overreaction.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But is it enough big since?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It is but -- and their concern is evaluation is what happens to  stocks that people deem earlier over value.  But that seems like a bit  much, doesn't it?  </p><p> LEHMANN:  (INAUDIBLE) Saturday night is of exact same thing.  So, what I'll  -- what I'll tell you is --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And he is a farmer. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> LEHMANN:  No, listen.  You're correct.  And I think that's what happens  when markets are tense and we have a very, very tense market.  Stocks down  20 percent or $200 billion from its peak which is kind of an inspiring  number.  But you're right.  People are a little bit nervous.  I think the  guidance that they give and they don't give long range guidance, they give  very short guidance.  Amazon is not one who guides two or three years in  advance.</p><p> And I think they would loathe to go out on a limb here and say things are  perfect.  I don't think that make sense to them.  I also think my money is  on that company and another big tech company is who I really defining  what's going on in this marketplace.  Look at how much Red Hat just got  acquired for because if they want to compete with Amazon web services, does  that Amazon web services is worth 30 percent more than it was worth two  days ago?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, that is exactly.  And when you start zeroing in where the  growth is, part of the growth story in this economy is cloud computing.   And that's what you've got going on this morning.  IBM acquiring software  and services company Red Hat for $33 billion.  Huge premium, stock is up 50  percent.  It's part of this efforts to boost the could computing services  which Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison told us about last week.</p><p> He emphasized the importance of cloud technology in the future.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  I think computing, I think computing --  cloud computing is going to -- you know, all these data centers that people  have been building are going to gradually wither away and we're going to  have a small number of these huge cloud networks.  And because every other  network looks like that, you know, people don't generate their own  electricity.</p><p> People don't have wells for their own water.  OK.  In a few cases they do,  but in the most case, we use the networks to buy electricity, the network  to buy water, we're going to use network to buy computing and business  applications and information.  This is going to be on handful of clouds and  most of the data is going to be in the Oracle database.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, Mark, we know this cloud computing is one of the growth  spots.  You just said something interesting about IPOs, a lot of these  companies that wanted to go public are the pulling back, lowering the  pricing, one broke price.  Does that tell you anything about where growth  is or isn't right now?  What's behind this IPO issue?  </p><p> LEHMANN:  Yes.  I don't think it tells me there is any big fear that the  best and biggest can't go public, what it tells me is the ability for -- I  won't say any company but the companies we've seen to price at this kind of  extraordinary premiums and trade it up as much as they have has been  tempered.  And that's --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So they stopped because market conditions?  </p><p> LEHMANN:  Market conditions and just because paying the kind of premiums  and paying hand multiples I think -- and that had worked, like you said  that had worked for a very long time.  We saw every single cloud computing  software company up that we took public, it was up 50, 70, 90 percent.   That's going to slow down.  That's fine.  We don't -- we need a little bit  of that tempering.</p><p> I think the greatest -- and we've seen headlines like Lyft and Uber all of  those that may test 2019 IPO market, that's not going to slow that down.   It's going to make other companies think about what's the proper valuation.   You know, my banks recede a little bit on that (INAUDIBLE) and I think  that's OK.  </p><p> CARTER:  So, I think it's something you said that you think that we've seen  the highs and the lows this year.  What makes you think that we've seen  lows?  And what should people be doing with the money right now?  Where  would you like to put it to work?</p><p> LEHMANN:  Well, we've had a couple corrections like this back in the  spring.  If you look at your charts from February and couple months later,  we had this kind of pullbacks that found a level and I think we're getting  close to that.  We've tested the lows of this cycle.  Hopefully, going into  election.  I think people are going to look at what they've owned year-to- date, and surmise the last few weeks they've been selling.</p><p> I still think the growth of the market is in tech and you're seeing the  kind of premium that IBM paid to acquire Red Hat.  You know, the  shareholders of that company who obviously are going to garner huge premium  today making big investments to tech and I think you're going to reanalyze  some of these companies were down 20, 30, 40.  The number of tech companies  in tech correction land are very, very high.</p><p> And I think people are going to take stock that look -- there is lots of  capital on the sidelines.  There's tons of money out for the M&amp;A market.   And now you have a 20 to 50 percent off some of a lot of tech companies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Will the tax cut plan 2.0, the second tax cut plan, will that  resonate with investors?  This weekend, House Ways and Means Committee  Chairman Kevin Brady told me he is, in fact, working on a second tax cut  plan.  Here is what he said.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  The  President wants to go even farther.  He's really focused on the middle  class.  He disbelieves they're the ones who get squeezed the most.  He's  asked us and we worked with him on developing another 10 percent.  Middle- class tax cuts for workers and families.  And so we'll be ready to move  with that as well.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what -- so what you're saying -- I mean, the President sort  of suggested that we were going to hear about this before the midterm  elections.  Obviously, there's nine days left then you're out of session,  you're not going to be voting on this in the next nine days but are you  saying that you're working on an additional 10 percent tax cut perhaps to  be announced and to bring to a vote after midterm elections sometime fourth  quarter?  </p><p> BRADY:  Perhaps but what the President was referring to and I wish some of  his critics would have just simply asked, what he was talking about was  when best do we introduce the bill or nonbinding resolution laying out, our  commitment as Republicans to doing that which we talked about doing  sometime in the next month or so.  But in truth, the lame-duck is so  unpredictable.</p><p> That period between the election in the end of the Congress, it really  common sense tells you this is something that as Republicans retain the  House and Senate that we'll advance in the new Congress.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Will this resonate with investors get the markets to move  higher or do you think worries about deficits and debt are going to be the  driver for markets?  </p><p> LEHMANN:  It feels the latter to me.  You know, this obviously surprised a  lot of people when the announcement came when the President said it.  I  think the tax cuts as far as I can tell and as far as the pundits that I  read, that hasn't been a winner issue right now for middle class of this  country, saying the second historic tax cut is the middle-class tax cut  tells me that the first tax cut wasn't the tax cuts for the middle class.</p><p> And I think that doesn't resonate I think with investors right now.  That's  what it tells me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Interesting.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, I don't think investors are reacting to it at all because  I don't think that it's going to get done quite frankly.  And people are  treating this second tax cut and the new tax cut for the middle class as it  just political talk and not reality.  And if anything, if they really try  to put it -- push it through, it will ignite even more worries about the  debt and the deficit quite frankly.</p><p> President Trump talked about cutting discretionary spending on five  percent, that's ex-defense less than one percent of the Federal budget.  It  doesn't make -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And, you know, the problem is spending.  Mark, it's good to see  you.</p><p> LEHMANN:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Mark Lehmann.  Stay with us.  Our jobs in  America coverage Friday morning, 8:00 a.m. Eastern as we identify where the  jobs are.  That's coming up Friday morning.  But first, the nation is in  mourning this morning.  The latest details on the Pittsburgh Synagogue  attack as the suspect is due in court today.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The president just tweeted this.  Here it is,  \"There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate, and even  fraudulent reporting of the news.  The fake news media, the true enemy of  the people must stop the open and obvious hostility and report the news  accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and  outrage.  And we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and  harmony.  Fake news must end.\"  Writes the president.</p><p> Meanwhile, there is this tragedy at the Tree of Life synagogue, and the  mourning continues.  Thousands attending a vigil honoring the victims of  the massacre.  11 people were killed, six others were injured.  The suspect  is set to appear in court today.  Fox News' David Lee Miller is live in  Pittsburgh this morning with more.  David, good morning to you.</p><p> DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  The U.S.  Attorney here in Pittsburgh has now started the process to seek the death  penalty for 46-year-old Robert Bowers.  Ultimately, that's a decision that  is going to rest with the Attorney General Jeff Sessions.</p><p> Now, among other things, Bowers is charged with a hate crime, obstructing  exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death.  He also faces 11 state  counts of homicide.  And as you mentioned, at 1:30 this afternoon, he is  going to make his initial court appearance here in Pittsburgh.  It will be  before a federal magistrate.</p><p> Meanwhile, Pittsburgh continues to grieve and recover from the tragedy.   Last night, thousands turned out for an interfaith prayer vigil.  And now,  for the first time, survivors of the massacre are speaking out.</p><p> Barry Werber, who was only feet away from the shooter inside the synagogue  miraculously went unnoticed.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARRY WERBER, SURVIVOR, SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING:  He didn't see us.  Thank God.   The only thing I had in my hand was the cell phone and it's a dumb phone,  so it doesn't light up when I'm talking on it.</p><p> I could see that he looked around only because there was a shaft of light  as he opened the door.  He stepped over Mel's body, didn't pay any  attention, step back and walked out.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MILLER:  On Sunday, authorities released the names of all 11 people who  died.  Among them we are told, there were at eight men and three women.   They range in age from 54 to 97 years old.  There were two brothers, as  well as a married couple.  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very sad to look at and to re-talk about the statement.  Thank  you, David Lee Miller, in Pittsburgh this morning.</p><p> Coming up, taking on technology, Google and Facebook may face billions of  dollars in new taxes.  We got the details there, coming up.  And Elon Musk  versus the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Why the CEO of Tesla now  says, $20 million fine against his company, it was all worth it.  Later  this hour, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  All 189 passengers and crew on board a Lion Air  passenger jet are feared dead this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the  details.  Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Maria, rescue officials  in Indonesia finding some human remains.  As one of those officials  predicts there will be no survivors from this.  The brand-new Lion Air  Boeing 737 crashed into the Java Sea of the Indonesian coast.</p><p> The plane went down just minutes after taking off from Jakarta for an  island off of Sumatra.  The Transportation Ministry, says the pilot had  asked for permission to return to the Jakarta Airport before the plane was  lost on radar.</p><p> In addition to the human remains that were found, search and rescue crews  have also found I.D. cards, personal belongings, and aircraft debris.  This  is the first known crash of the newer version of the 737.</p><p> While the Florida man accused of sending at least 14 pipe bombs to  prominent Democrats is said to make his first court appearance in Miami  today.  56-year-old Cesar Sayoc is facing five federal charges and up to 48  years in prison.</p><p> He was arrested Friday, four days after the first package was found in New  York.  Single fingerprint led to the FBI -- led the FBI to his arrest.   U.S. marshals are expected to transfer Sayoc to New York City, where the  Justice Department wants to trial him in the U.S. Attorney's Southern  District.</p><p> Well, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will not be seeking re-election as  party chairwoman.  She has been Germany's leader since 2005.  She told  leaders of her Christian Democratic Union Party that she wants to remain  Chancellor only until 2021 when the next federal election is due.  And this  comes after her party lost significant ground in yesterday's regional  elections in Germany.</p><p> Well, Google and Facebook could soon be hit with major tax hikes.  The Wall  Street Journal reports dozens of countries are stepping up efforts to levy  new taxes on technology giants.  They're hoping to capture revenue as  economic activity increasingly shifts to online.</p><p>South Korea, India and, at least, seven other Asia-Pacific countries are  exploring these new taxes as our Mexico, Chile, and other Latin American  countries.  Take a look at shares of Facebook and Google, they're higher in  the pre-market, Maria.</p><p> But you know, the IMF warned about the economies of emerging markets having  problems.  I guess this is their fix.  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, right.  Now, go where the money is, right.  Cheryl, thank  you.  Coming up, countdown to the midterm elections.  We break down how the  economy may impact decisions for voters, coming up.</p><p> And then, an incredible win for the Boston Red Sox yesterday, the  highlights from the World Series all here, stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 29th, your  top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Personal income and  spending reports just hitting the tape.  Personal income, coming out now,  not a major market reaction but we are just getting the numbers right here,  and we are awaiting these numbers.  It has not typically been a market  mover.  Markets are up 151 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as  you can see.  Personal income up was two-tenths of a percent versus an  estimate of up three-tenths of a percent.</p><p> Meanwhile, personal spending, is up four-tenths of a percent versus an  expected increase of four-tenths, so it is right in line with the  estimates.  Futures, as you can see, trading higher this morning.  Dow  Industrials up 164 points, that's two-thirds of one percent.  S&amp;P500 is up  better than one percent, and the NASDAQ up 1-1/4 percent on the morning  this morning.  Futures indicating a pretty good opening for the Broader  Averages after a tough week last week.  </p><p> European indices also higher this morning.  Take a look at European indices  with the FTSE100 higher by 141 points, that's better than two percent --  this is the high of the morning right here.  Things have been improving all  morning.  CAC Quarante in Paris is up 1-1/4 percent and the Dax, in  Germany, up better than two percent right now.  As we said, personal income  up two-tenths of a percent versus three-tenths of a percent; and personal  spending right in line with the estimates, up four-tenths of one percent.   Asian markets overnight -- and futures, as you can see, are higher.  Asian  markets overnight, were mostly lower.  As you can see, with the exception  of Hong Kong up a fraction; Shanghai Composite down better than two percent  overnight.  </p><p> Voting to the right.  Brazil electing a conservative candidate, who some  have compared to President Trump.  Of course, the alternative was the  socialist candidate.  We're breaking it all down for you this morning.  </p><p> The $20 million tweet.  Why Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the tweet that cost  him all that money was actually worth it.  </p><p> Plus, Boston's big win.  The Red Sox beating the L.A. Dodgers to the take  the World Series yesterday.  We have all the highlights in sports.  </p><p> And then, place your bets.  Details on the latest sports team to strike a  sport gambling deal, coming up this morning as well.  </p><p> All those stories coming up this morning, as we continue.  President Trump  just tweeting on Brazil's election, meanwhile, here is what he said, the  president: \"Had a very good conversation with newly elected president of  Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, who won his race by a substantial margin.  We  agreed Brazil and the United States will work closely together on trade,  military, and everything else.  Excellent call.  Wished him  congratulations,\" says the president.  All that coming up, on Brazil.  </p><p> But first, our top story this half an hour: 8 days to go until the midterm  elections.  President Trump, has been hitting the campaign trail every day  to rally before the midterms.  The recent economic swings put at forefront  for voters.  Joining us now, is Douglas Holtz-Eaken, he is former CBO  Director from a McCain Economic Advisory and American Action Forum  President.  Douglas, good to see you.  Thanks for joining us this morning.  </p><p> DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKEN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM:  Good morning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's your outlook for the midterms, Doug?  </p><p> EAKEN:  Well, I think I don't know much more than the experts.  And they  suggest that the Republicans are going to lose control of the House, the  Democrats will control the House.  Republicans could pick up a seat in the  Senate and that will leave us with a Congress that probably won't have the  ability to get a whole lot of legislation done over the next few years.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean if you were to see, the Democrats take the House  which is largely expected, does the agenda that the president has been  putting out, come to a halt?  </p><p> EAKEN:  It looks that way to me.  It's very unlikely that they're going to  pass anything to make the tax cuts permanent for example, which is going to  be a very good idea.  I don't see any real hope for further legislation  other than, you know, getting the spending bills done, and that's keeping  the government running, and that could run into something difficult.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I want to talk about this spending and these tax cuts  because I know that you've been a deficit hawk and we want to talk about  where we are in terms the debt and deficits, but we are looking at a  potential tax break for middle class which is in the works.  Pennsylvania  Congressman Scott Perry joined us earlier, he said he's in favor of more  tax cuts, congress needs to focus on less spending first, listen to this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. SCOTT PERRY (R), PENNSYLVANIA:  You don't fix your overspending  problem by taxing people more, you fix that by spending less, and so that's  what we really need to focus on.  The president, offered a budget that  spent less and we didn't take much or any of it up being.  As a matter of  fact, the tax proposal that House sent, the Senate, I think, saved $400  billion, but yet the Senate sent it back with a trillion dollars additional  spending.  And unfortunately, to get something that allows the people to  keep more what they earned has to make it through Senate as so long as  that's full of liberal folks that don't want to cut spending, we're going  to have this problem.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about that, Doug, can they stop spending?  Or cut down on  spending?  </p><p> EAKEN:  There's no evidence to that so far.  No evidence so far.  I mean,  you and I had this conversation before.  They're concentrating on the  annual spending which is a third of the budget.  No one is even talking  about the two-thirds of the budget that's growing at -- you know, growth  rates for the next 10 years of six percent for Social Security, 5.8 for  Medicare, 5.2 for Medicaid.  </p><p> Those are enormous growth rates, they have to come down, that's where the  money is and there's no conversation about that.  So, I'm sympathetic to  the idea that we need a tax code that's permanent, this idea with of  temporary tax cuts from the middle class makes no sense.  They could do  some things that are built on the success last December, but they really do  have to get serious on the spending side, and they haven't.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, so, where are the opportunities to spend less?  Let's talk  about that, because you know, Maya MacGuineas form the Committee for  Responsible Budget is saying that the budget is in an unsustainable long- term trajectory.  She writes, the federal debt already high and rising.   The country's fiscal outlook in medium and long terms are both extremely  troubling.  And they're looking at long term outlook, where is the  opportunity to cut spending, Doug?  </p><p> EAKEN:  Well, for the record, Maya is a crazy optimist -- it's a little  worse than that, in my view.  So, look, it's not complicated.  The Social  Security program, for example, is promising to cut benefits across the  board by 25 percent, for people in retirement, in 12 years when it runs out  of money.  That's a terrible way to run a pension program.  So, we should  fix Social Security, we should fix Social Security right now.  </p><p> There have been six or seven bipartisan commissions that put together  proposals to get that done.  That should be the number one objection for  anybody.  Why would we want to have something that retirees can't count on?   Then you move over to the next big ones: Medicare and Medicaid.  Those are  programs that don't serve the beneficiaries very well at all.  I mean, we  know that our seniors don't get the health outcomes that other country  seniors do, yet we spend so much money, indeed it has an unrestricted draw  in the U.S. Treasury.  </p><p> So, the first thing to do is put those programs on budget, make them live  within a finite amount of money and serve the beneficiaries.  And then, we  can just move across the board, go to the farm programs, go to annual  spending.  There's lots of waste in there.  And really, get serious about  running these programs effectively.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, you need courage to be able to come out during an election  year, and say, we're cutting back on your Social Security checks and your  pension.  But, clearly, you've got to go where money is.  And then, there  is this global market worrying over trade and tariffs, Senator Ron Johnson  told me on Sunday that the president should keep the pressure on China  since they pose more than just an economic threat, but is tariffs the  answer?  Here's what he said, Doug, listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SEN. RON JOHNSON (R), WISCONSIN:  Let's face it, China has been stealing  hundreds of billions of dollars-worth of our industrial secrets, as well as  our military secrets, and that is really, I think, the biggest threat that  we face in terms of our relationship with China.  </p><p> I think the good news is because of public awareness, the gap between those  on offense and those of us on defense, is quite honestly narrowing.  And  hopefully, if we have a unified rest of the world when it comes to trade  and our dealings with China, we'll discipline them to begin -- you know,  really, adhering to norms of the rest of the world trading system.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your take, Doug, is China going to adhere to the norms -- the  rules of the world on the global basis or not?  </p><p> EAKEN:  Not without a lot of pressure.  I think China really does not  understand how far it is out of line with acceptable behavior.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right.  </p><p> EAKEN:  I think the important phrase there with Senator Johnson was a  \"unified world,\" I don't think we have that.  The administration has  correctly identified China as problem, has been very aggressive in a  bilateral fashion and trying to get China to change this behavior, that's  been utterly unsuccessful.  I think it will be unsuccessful but acting  alone.  The key is to get a multilateral approach where all of our key  allies in Europe, and in Japan, and in other parts of the world agree to  enforce better discipline on China.  That's not happening right now, that's  the missing piece in this strategy.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I wonder if as he continues to do trade deals and confirms  these deals with others, like a deal with E.U., you know, like when the new  president in Mexico gets into place where you as actually see the commerce  back-and-forth from the new USMCA deal, will that bring these countries  together in a unified front against China?  </p><p> EAKEN:  It may, but it's a big if.  They are the -- negotiated USMCA has a  provision that says: \"Anyone who signs this cannot negotiate a free trade  agreement with nonmarket economy,\" aimed directly at China.  So, that makes  sense.  If you can get to those deals in place, and I'll point out, Canada  and Mexico haven't signed that deal yet, there's been a lot of talk about  it, but there's no signature, and it still -- we have to go through  Congress as well.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> EAKEN:  Going -- getting a deal with Europe takes time.  So, all of these  things are very time-consuming, and quite frankly, China has a much greater  capacity, just wait us out.  President Xi is a president for life, their  capacity to directly intervene in the economy is enormous.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> EAKEN:  And so, I worry about the time tables here, and I worry about  whether there's enough pressure from enough countries to get things moving  quickly.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll be watching that.  Doug, it's always a pleasure to  see you, thanks so much.  </p><p> EAKEN:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Douglas Holtz-Eaken joining us there.  Stay with Fox Business  for a special midterm election coverage, it begins on November 6, at 7:00  p.m. Eastern, we are all hands-on deck.  And then the next morning,  MORNINGS WITH MARIA will start an hour early at 5:00 a.m. Eastern, that's  on November 7th.  So, join us, as we bring you all the results from  midterms.</p><p> First, though, Elon Musk is firing back.  Why the Tesla CEO says 20- million-dollar fine against this his company was, well, it was worth,  straight ahead.  Then Brazil's next president; Stuart Varney weighs in on  the country's elections back in a moment right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Check out Tesla shares up this morning as CEO  Elon Musk brushes off worries about an investigation into the infamous  funding secure tweet.  Susan Li is on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange with details there.  Good morning, Susan.  </p><p> SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria.  That is  right, the Tesla's CEO, well, still CEO, Elon Musk, says it was worth it,  the $20 million in fines that he had to pay and Tesla had to pay for those  tweets back in August, when he said funding was secured, he was taking the  company private and that was at $420.  </p><p> Well, don't forget, the SEC, of course, a part of that settlement says that  Elon Musk, if he's going to tweet about Tesla, he has to go through the  company's communications channels, so not sure if he's adhering to those  procedures but he did say late on Friday after that tweet, less than an  hour later, he says he's going to take a few days off the Twittersphere.</p><p> OK.  Let's also talk about Wal-Mart.  And I guess in this case, what Amazon  can do, Wal-Mart will try to do better if they can, so they are launching  their own cashier-less stores.  They're testing something called Sam's Club  Now, that will open in Dallas next week.  They told us about this back in  June, and it's pretty much similar to what Amazon Go is doing.  So, they're  employing mobile checkout, camera-like systems for inventory management,  and I guess, they're still playing catchup to Amazon at this point.  Back  to you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Susan, thank you.  We are watching markets today.   We'll be watching you with a big rally expected at the opening of trading.   Meanwhile, Brazil's next president, big story, conservative candidate Jair  Bolsonaro is claiming victory this morning in his country's election.   Joining us now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  Good  morning to you, Stu.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Look, I  don't think that the election of Jair Bolsonaro is going to have that much  effect on our daily lives in America or our economy or our market, but it  really is another marker on an extraordinarily populist trend.  I think it  started with Brexit, it continued with the election of Donald Trump in  November 2016, then it's the five-star movement in Italy, a populist  movement, which runs Italy, and which may well break up the European Union.   And now, Brazil, it's the largest country in Latin America, 210 million  Brazilians, the largest economy in Latin America, and it's going to be run  by a conservative.  This is quite something.  So, it's in with the new,  which seems to be populism, and out with the old.  I'm sure you've reported  it, Maria, but Angela Merkel, she's stepping down as the leader of her  party, and will try to finish out her term as Chancellor of Germany.  But  whether she makes that or not is another story.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> VARNEY:  She is out, and the populists in Brazil, Italy, America, elsewhere  are in.  What a trend.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think -- I think it's also important to note that look what  the alternative was, Stu, if you didn't vote in Brazil for Bolsonaro, you  were voting for a socialist.  So, once again, socialism was tested here.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We're looking at socialism sort of testing the waters across  the world.  People are not having it.</p><p> VARNEY:  I wonder if it has an implication for our elections in eight days  here.  After all, the Democrats could be characterized as moving rapidly  towards socialism, and President Trump, you could characterize him as a  populist, if you like.  That's the contest that we face in eight days'  time.  I just wonder if these worldwide trends will play out here, all over  again.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It really seems like it is taking a hold across the  world.  In people -- in places you didn't expect like Italy, as you  mentioned.  </p><p> VARNEY:  Oh, yes.  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stu, I know you're going to have a lot more in 10 minutes.  We  will see you then.</p><p> VARNEY:  Yes, you will.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour  9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Do not miss Stuart after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  </p><p> But first, there's this, hockey's new bet, details on the partnership  between the New Jersey Devils and sports book operator William Hill.  Back  in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  So, the New Jersey Devils getting into the legal  gambling business.  The NHL team making a multi-year deal with William  Hill, to provide legalized gambling inside the Prudential Center, where  they play.  Joining us now is the CEO of William Hill U.S., Joe Asher.   Joe, great to see you this morning, thanks so much for being here.</p><p> JOE ASHER, CEO, WILLIAM HILL U.S.:  Hey, good morning.  Nice to be with  you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, congratulations.!  This has been a long-term investment for  William Hill, right?</p><p> ASHER:  Well, it is.  You know, we've been working towards the day when  sports betting would become legal outside Nevada, and of course, that day  came about five months ago when the Supreme Court overturned the federal  law that had prevented that.  And we are going to New Jersey pretty shortly  thereafter, and recently announced the deal with the Devils and we're  excited about it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How much -- what kind of revenue are you talking about?  What  are you expecting in terms of the revenue that this will bring in?</p><p> ASHER:  Well, across the country, I mean, you're looking at a market that  the estimates are somewhere between 150 to $400 billion in the amount  waged; figured about five or six percent that comes into revenue.  So, it's  a substantial market across the country, but of course, that's going to  develop over a period of years, as states begin to legalize sports betting  at the state level.  You know, the Supreme Court basically turned the issue  back to the states.  States like Delaware, NEW Jersey, Mississippi, West  Virginia got going quickly, and others are in the process, and it will  develop over the next few years.</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  Joe, Mitch Roschelle, good morning.  Is the plan to expand  across multiple states or is the plan in New Jersey to expand in the State  of New Jersey?</p><p> ASHER:  Well, our plan, of course, is to do both, Mitch.  We've opened  already at about a dozen locations in Mississippi, one in West Virginia.   We're gearing up to get going in the not too distant future in Pennsylvania  and in Rhode Island.  And in New Jersey, we've just opened up our third  retail location, but also in New Jersey, you can bet online by just  downloading the app in the App Store, and you can bet from anywhere within  the state, but you do have to be present within the State of New Jersey in  that case to place your bets.  You know, out here in Nevada, you've been  able to bet on sports for decades, and you go into a casino, you sign up  for your mobile account here in the State of Nevada and then you can bet  anywhere within the state.  Right now, we do about two-thirds of our  business on mobile.</p><p> CARTER:  So, you're just betting on the -- you know, you're at -- you're at  a Devils game, you're just betting on that game or can you bet on all  sports?  Can you tell me a little bit about what it's like for them?</p><p> ASHER:  Sure, you can bet -- you can bet on all sports within the -- within  the State of New Jersey.  Just like, you know, like I was at the Golden  Knights game here in Las Vegas last night, really, really exciting game and  they do a great job there, but not only were people betting on the Golden  Knights game, they're betting on other hockey games that are going on.  And  now, of course, this is a busy time in the sporting calendar, last night,  you had the last game of the World Series, basketball is getting going,  we're in the middle of football season.  So, there's a lot of -- there's a  lot going on in the sporting calendar, which makes it a busy time of the  year for us.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joe, it's Dagen McDowell, name a sport that people might be  surprised that people bet on so much.  Like -- go ahead.</p><p> ASHER:  No, I was going to say one of -- one of the big -- so, right now,  we do about -- here in Nevada, we do about 37 percent of our business on  what we call \"in-play sports,\" or betting after the game has started.  The  number one sport for in-play by far is Major League Baseball, because the  pace of the game is so conducive to it.  But also, tennis is a -- is a big  game that -- or a big sport for in-play wagering.</p><p> LEE:  I would not expect tennis.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But people -- but again, it's -- because it's only two  players, and/or in singles as two players, you can see if somebody looks  fatigued.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Has gotten inside of their own head.  And so, that's when you  place in in-play bet maybe.</p><p> ASHER:  Oh, you know, it's got --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) from experience.</p><p> ASHER:  Yes, you know, look, it allows you to take a bigger game then chop  it down into a much shorter interval.  So, for instance, in baseball,  people like to bet will there be run scored in the next inning, yes or no.   There's an actual break period in between innings, and we'll have people  bet substantial sums of moment just on the next inning.  You're taking a  three-hour game, you're chopping it down to a 20-minute game.  Tennis, same  sort of thing, people will bet set by set or game by game, and you're  taking a longer event and chopping it down into a much shorter event so  people can make their bet, know whether they won or loss in a short period  of time. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very cool.  Joe, great to have you, thanks so much.  We'll be  watching.</p><p> ASHER:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joe Asher, joining us there.  Coming up, final thoughts from  this all-star panel.  Stay with us.  Back in moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Lee  Carter.</p><p> CARTER:  I am looking forward to seeing how this week plays out in polling  coming out to the midterms.  I think that this week could surprise us all,  and I think it's going to be a week that's going to lean Republican.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really?  All right.</p><p> CARTER:  They do.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Eight days away from the Midterms.  Mitch?</p><p> ROSCHELLE:  The Fed's preferred inflation measure, PCE, just came out, it's  still flat at two percent which is the Fed's target.  So, let's see if the  Fed holds off and doesn't continue to raise rates.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why do we need a rate hike in December, Dagen?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Exactly. </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Jon Hilsenrath has co-wrote an article in the Wall Street  Journal that starts at \"What If That Was as Good as It Gets In Terms of the  Economy?\"  Well, we're looking at 3.1 percent wage growth coming up this  Friday for last month, that would be the best in 9-1/2 years.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Which is good stuff.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Have a great day, everybody.  Go seize the day!   Dagen McDowell, Mitch Roschelle, Lee Carter, great to see you.  Let's get  right to Stuart.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it  away.</p><p> VARNEY:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Good  morning, ladies.  Thank you so much and good morning, everyone.  Happy  Monday to you.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  Thanks for joining us.  And it is  Monday, October 29th.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now just before 6:00 a.m. one the East Coast.   Investors looking to start the week on a strong note.  Take a look at where  we stand with futures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As you just heard, Dow Industrials set to open up about 50 points this  morning, that's a quarter of a percent higher.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The S&amp;P 500 is up 11, almost one-half of percent.  </p><p>And the NASDAQ, up 62 points right now, that is up almost one percent.  </p><p>This after major the indices capped off a volatile week last week with  sharp declines.  When all was said and done, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 down,  better than one percent on Friday alone.</p><p>Meanwhile, the NASDAQ sliding another two percent on Friday.  On the heels  of disappointing results from Amazon and Alphabet, NASDAQ officially in  correction territory now, that's down 10 percent from highs.</p><p>Global markets this morning, a firmer tone there as well.  The FT-100's up  1-1/4 percent, the CAC Quarante in Paris is up a quarter of a percent, and  the DAX Index in Germany right now up now 1-1/2 percent, 160 points higher  in Germany.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mostly lower at the close, with the  exception of Hong Kong.  As you can see there, the worst performer was  China.  Then another two percent overnight on the Shanghai Composite.</p><p>Earnings, of course, setting the tone on Wall Street this morning.  Several  Dow Components, including Apple, set to report this upcoming week.   Investors are watching General Electric as well.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reporting another dividend cut may be on the way  for GE.  That will not be good news for the stock.  We will watch that this  morning.</p><p>A little bit of a merger Monday on Wall Street this morning.  IBM is  acquiring Red Hat for roughly $33 billion.  That is IBM's largest  acquisition ever.  How the deal will drive growth of the struggling  technology giant, of course, it's all about the cloud which we heard a lot  from, well, Larry Ellison, last week on the cloud computing business.</p><p>Breaking news overnight, a plane crashes shortly after takeoff in  Indonesia.  Nearly 200 people were onboard.  We have the very latest on the  search efforts going on this morning.  Stay with us on that.</p><p>Plus, honoring the victims of the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting.   Thousands filling the streets last night after President Trump condemned  the attack on Saturday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This evil, Anti-Semitic  attack is an assault on all of us, it's an assault on humanity.  It will  require all of us working together to extract the hateful poison of Anti- Semitism from our world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest as the alleged shooter is set to appear  in court today.  We will bring you that coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning.  And joining me to break  it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PwC Partner, Mitch  Roschelle, and the President of maslansky + partners, Lee Carter, is here.   Great to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning, everybody.  Happy Monday.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Good morning.  Happy Monday.  Sad weekend,  though.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Very sad.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  So tragic.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  For sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tough week, actually.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, what to make of it all, because, again, it doesn't seem  like the political rhetoric from any -- either side is really being muted  whatsoever.</p><p>And that, if anything, this violence has amplified it somewhat, and I don't  know.  I'm curious.  </p><p>I mean there's much to be said about that, and the fallout for the country,  and quite frankly, the world at large.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  Uh-hmm. </p><p>CARTER:  You know, it's a really sad time for our country.  And when we  have these kinds of attacks happening, I mean these are terrorist attacks  and historically, we've come together at times of tragedy, in times of  crisis and we can rise above the partisanship and that doesn't seem to be  happening now.  </p><p>And I don't think what it's going to take for our nation to heal.  We've  been through such terrible times and these terrorists need to be stopped  and we need to come together to find a way to make sure that this never  happens again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And more evidence that there's a mental problem in the United  States.  And that also needs to be addressed.</p><p>By the way, different story, a victory in Brazil for the far-right  candidate.  Interesting to see what's taking place in other places away  from America in terms of the people voting for more conservative  leadership.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  What they don't want to wind up being Venezuela quite frankly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Correct.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And they see how devastating socialism can be to a country and  to everybody that it doesn't lift all votes and I think that that's part of  what's at play here. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Mr. Bolsonaro is being compared to Donald Trump in Brazil  so we'll -- </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Well, more populism and more nationalism themes in a lot of  these elections around the world, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  So it seems like it's certainly a trend right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Italy as well, another one.  We will take a look at all of this  coming up and we have a lot coming up in the next three hours.  </p><p>Our top story right now is about earnings.  The earnings keep on coming,  Apple, Starbucks, General Electric, Facebook, ExxonMobil, all reporting  their third quarter earnings this week.  This is going to be another busy  woke.</p><p>The October jobs report is also coming out this week on Friday.   Expectations, 190,000 jobs to have been added to the economy last month  with the unemployment remaining unchanged, 3.7 percent.  That is the  expectation.  </p><p>Of course, we are beginning the month of November this week, so Friday,  we'll get those jobs numbers first Friday of every month.  </p><p>Here now, the National Investment Consultant at U.S. Bank Wealth  Management, Dan Heckman joining us.  Dan, good to see you.  Thanks very  much for joining us.  </p><p>DAN HECKMAN, NATIONAL INVESTMENT CONSULTANT, U.S. BANK WEALTH  MANAGEMENT:   Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So let's talk about the backdrop for investing today and that  would be earnings in the economic story.  </p><p>Your expectations for earnings, how would you assess things so far and the  upcoming jobs report?</p><p>HECKMAN:  Well, earnings have been actually pretty good, Maria.  The top  line's growing on average about eight percent, 50 percent of the S&amp;P 500  companies have reported so far.  </p><p>And, again, eight percent on the top line on the average.  And on the  bottom line, it's been up over 20 percent.</p><p>So earnings have not been, you know, all of that bad.  I just think there's  been a lot of high expectations going into this quarter.  And any kind of  disappointment, whatsoever, is being very much punished.</p><p>The market's gone through a very we'll say severe correction.  S&amp;P 500 is  down about 9 percent, the Nasdaq almost 11 percent. </p><p>Out of the last 25 trading days, we've been down 20 days of those 25.  And  so, you know, our works is just that we're probably pretty much through the  majority of this correction.  We may have some continued volatility, but  there's been some great opportunities created in this decline in the  markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you would expect we'll start to get clarity after the  midterm elections in terms of the President's agent and whether it gets  executed.  </p><p>Part of that is tax cuts coming, the upcoming midterms after the midterms.</p><p>House Ways and Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady, told me yesterday on  Sunday morning futures that they are, in fact, working on a second tax cut  plan, not only extending the individual cuts, but also lowering taxes for  the middle class and additional 10 percent.  </p><p>Here's Kevin Brady yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  The  economy is booming.  We're on track for the first total year over year plus  three percent economic growth in more than a decade.  </p><p>We're seeing jobs coming back, paychecks going up.  Main Street is hiring  again.  So the President's really about -- focused on more of that economic  growth.</p><p>I think permanence really depends on this election, if Republicans and --  are -- retain control of the house, and the senate, next year we will do  reconciliation and make these tax cuts permanent.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Mitch, he did say that it's a separate thing, the 10 percent  cut, additional cut in taxes, separate from the -- making the individual  cuts permanent, so it is a second tax cut plan that they're working on.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Right.  The thing that we haven't heard a lot about is how this  is getting paid for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The President talked about doing it from a budgetary  perspective with cutting all of the departmental budgets by 5 percent, but  from a tax policy perspective, I don't know if they're going to have to  unwind something from the previous plan in order to pay for this.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, half of Americans already paid no net federal income tax,  number one, and I think a lot of people are all for making the individual  tax cuts permanent, which could have been done potentially if Democrats got  on board -- </p><p>CARTER:  They'd -- </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Right, right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- with the tax reforms in the first place.  But I think you  have to be -- if you're in Washington, be very careful about anything at  this point that drives up a deficit and the debt even more.</p><p>Because what kicked off this recent -- this bout of volatility and the down  -- the downward move in the market earlier in October, it was worries about  higher interest rates.  </p><p>So if you do anything in Washington in terms of spending and not paying for  it and that five percent cut to all these departments is less than one  percent -- </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- because discretionary spending makes up what -- discretionary  spending acts defense -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- is a very small part of our annual spending, so I'd be very - - they need to tread very, very cautiously in in D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To the point.  </p><p>CARTER:  I also think that it's a -- it's a very -- it's a fine line that  they're walking right now between tax cuts and the deficit because so many  traditional conservatives want to see us get spending under control.  </p><p>And so if they don't have a plan that address both sides of it, I think  that you're going to lose a lot of traditional conservatives' enthusiasm  especially going into the midterms.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  Now, this trillion dollar budget deficit is not a good  thing for this country, period.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And something has to get done to fix that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about that, Dan?</p><p>HECKMAN:  Well, we are very concerned about the projection of the deficit  going out forward and we think the additional supply, which has been a 63  percent increase in the second half of treasury securities' year over year  has certainly weighed on the bond market and one factor, in our opinion, of  why rates have risen so much here in the second half.</p><p>So we are certainly concerned about the budget deficit.  I think we share - - your other guests' earlier comments about, how are you going to pay for  it?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HECKMAN:  So rising deficits are going to be an issue that the market is  going to be focused on and I think they have already talked about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So there's -- so there's debt and deficits, and then there's  the China story and the tariffs.  I spoke with Senate Homeland Security  Chairman Ron Johnson yesterday.  </p><p>He said, very bluntly, there is a real threat from China.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI), CHAIRMAN, SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY:  Let's face  it, China has been stealing hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of our  industrial secrets, as well as our military secrets.  And that is really, I  think, one -- the biggest threat that we face in terms of our relationship  with China.</p><p>If we have a unified rest of the world when it comes to trade in our  dealings with China -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>JOHNSON:  -- we'll discipline them to begin, you know, really adhering to  the norms of the rest of the world trading system.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So a moment ago, Dan, you seem believe that this market was  sort of stabilizing at this point and you suggested you would be putting  new money to work in stocks, is that right, or do you worry about debt and  the China story as cutting into that?</p><p>HECKMAN:  Well, we really think there are some great opportunities in the  market right now.  The P/E average right now on stocks is about 17 times,  that's near the historical 25-year average.  </p><p>So, you know, many of these stock have just been hammered to the point  where they look like pretty attractive values and we are pleased to see the  bond market kind of calm down here, so to speak.  </p><p>The 10-year yield has come back down, but regarding China, it's been, I  think, no big secret that they have been diminished in their activities in  the -- our treasury auctions.</p><p>Last week, we had very weak bid to cover ratios, so it needs to be  monitored here, there's no question about that, Maria.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  One thing that I'll add and to tie the earning season into  what's been going on, so Apple is -- many people are looking at Apple  hoping that Apple can somehow rescue this overall market.</p><p>You saw how Alphabet and Amazon got hammered up after they reported just  slower sales growth or tepid sales growth however you want to characterize  it.  Apple -- listen for Apple on Thursday when they report to talk about  china because they are chained to China in terms of a manufacturing hub.</p><p>They can't really extricate themselves from that, that's what -- one that  people are going to be listening for from Tim Cook and others on the call.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And specifically inventories.  Remember Dan Niles joined us  last week and he said that inventories at Apple are up 89 percent.</p><p>And, you know, when you have that kind of a product inventory, you're  really --- you're really reliant on selling those phones, and are you going  to be able to sell a thousand dollar XPhone into China where the economy is  slowing down to get those inventories cleaned up.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So that's going to be something I want to watch as well on -- </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Let's not lose sight of the fact that the dollar's song and the  one is weal, so you're also selling those in a -- in a period of time where  they're sort of more expensive as well.  So, that's another thing to  consider.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm surprised we haven't heard more about currency from  quarterly earnings.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I think it's --I think it's a big issue across the board.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And I think you should hear more of it in guidance, they're  talking more about tariffs because they're politicizing a little bit, but  currency's a big issue.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>CARTER:  Uh-hmm. </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And maybe the two are interrelated to some degree, but  currency's a major issue for corporate earnings.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I'm sure you're right.  Dan, good to see you this  morning.  Thanks so much.</p><p>HECKMAN:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dan Heckman joining us.  And be sure to join us for full  election coverage next week.  We are -- we are now eight days away.   MORNINGS WITH MARIA will start an hour earlier at 5:00 a.m. Eastern on  November 7th, the day after the big midterm elections on Tuesday night, the  6th.  </p><p>I'm going to get your reaction to what you're seeing, Lee Carter, this  morning.  I want to get your sense of where we are eight days from the  midterm elections, so we'll get into that this morning.  Stay with us on  that.</p><p>But first, a nation is mourning this morning.  The victims of the  Pittsburgh Synagogue attack are remembered.  The alleged shooter will  appear in court today.  We will have the very latest there after this  break.  </p><p>And then a multibillion dollar deal to tell you about, IBM and Red Hat team  up to become the world's number one cloud provider, that's next.  Back in a  moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  </p><p>Tragedy at the Tree of Life Synagogue, thousands of people attending a  vigil honoring the victims of this massacre where 11 people were killed,  six others injured, and the alleged killer set to appear to court today.</p><p>Fox News' David Miller -- David Lee Miller is live in Pittsburgh this  morning.  David, good morning to you.  </p><p>DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  We  are in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood.  Behind me, over my shoulder, the  Tree of Life Synagogue.  </p><p>At this hour, it is still a crime scene.  This despite the fact the  shooting took place almost 48 hours ago.  You can see the yellow police  tape around the perimeter of the building.</p><p>It was early Saturday morning that 46-year-old Robert Bowers, authorities  say, entered that building and killed 11 people.  He entered with three  handguns and an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle.  They say he used all  four weapons in his rampage.  </p><p>An FBI affidavit quotes Bowers during his gunfight with police saying,  \"They are committing genocide to my people.  I just want to kill Jews.\"</p><p>The U.S. Attorney has now stated that the process is in place to seek the  death penalty.</p><p>Meanwhile now, for the first time, survivors are speaking out.  Barry  Werber was only feet away from the gunman inside this synagogue Saturday  morning when he went unnoticed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARRY WERBER, SHOOTING WITNESS:  He didn't see us.  Thank God.  The only  thing I had in my hand was a cell phone and it's a dumb phone so it doesn't  light up when I'm talking on it.</p><p>I could see that he looked around only because there was a shaft of light  as he opened the door.  He stepped over Mel's body, didn't pay any  attention, stepped back and walked out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MILLER:  At last word we were told that Bowers was in fair condition being  treated for gunshots at a local hospital.  Later today, he will be in  court.  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I will be watching that, David.  Thanks very much, David Lee  Miller this morning in Pittsburgh.</p><p>Quick break and then air disaster, a massive recovery operation underway  this morning after a jet crashes into the sea in Indonesia, details coming  up.</p><p>And then third time's a charm, I guess.  Hillary Clinton hints at another  run for president.  What she said, stay with us. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A massive recovery mission underway this morning  after a passenger jet crashed in Indonesia.  Cheryl Casone with the details  and headlines now.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  The Lion  Air Boeing 737 with 189 passengers and crew onboard went down into the  waters off the coast of Indonesia.</p><p>Indonesian officials now say they do not expect to find new survivors.  The  plane went missing just 13 minutes after it left for an island off of  Sumatra.  All that rescue crews have found so far are ID cards, some  personal belongings, and aircraft debris.</p><p>We're going to continue to follow up this developing story as they are  looking into cause of that crash.</p><p>Well, the Florida man accused of sending at least 14 pipe bombs to  prominent Democrats is set to make his first court appearance in Miami  today.</p><p>56-year-old Cesar Sayoc faces five federal charges up to 48 years in  prison.</p><p>He was arrested on Friday, four days after the first package was found in  New York.  A single fingerprint led the FBI to his arrest.</p><p>U.S. Marshals are also expected to transfer Sayoc to New York City where  the Justice Department wants to try him in the U.S. Attorney's Southern  District.</p><p>Well, IBM making its biggest acquisition ever.  The company buying software  and services company, Red Hat, for 33 billion.</p><p>IBM attempted to become the world's largest hybrid cloud provider.  A  hybrid cloud is when a company keeps some of its data in a public cloud  service and some of its data on servers on its own premises.</p><p>IBM CEO, Ginni Rometty, calls this acquisition a \"game changer\".  She  believes this is the next chapter of the cloud.  </p><p>Taking a look at shares of IBM, they are lower in the premarket, down more  than five percent, but take a look at Red Hat, the stock is soaring in the  premarket, 50 percent in change, Maria.  There you go.  Big news in the  tech world.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sure is.  And, of course, we've heard all about the  cloud and the potential for big growth numbers from the cloud from Oracle  Cofounder, Larry Ellison, last week -- </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- when he sat down with me for an exclusive interview.  We  discussed cloud opportunities.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  I think computing -- I think computing  -- cloud computing is going to change, you know.  All these data centers  that people have been building are going to -- are going to gradually  wither away, and we're going to have a small number of huge these cloud  networks.  </p><p>And because every other network looks like that.  They're -- you know,  people don't generate their own electricity, people don't have wells for  their own water.  OK, in a few cases, they do but in the most case, we use  the network to buy electricity, the network to buy water.</p><p>We're going use network to buy computing, and business applications, and  information.  It's going to be on a handful of clouds and most of the  data's going to be in an Oracle database.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's such a competition here.  Amazon wants in, Mitch.   Obviously, Oracle has the most lines market share for big corporations.  </p><p>But IBM with Red Hat is obviously a player.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Cloud is where it's at because all of the applications that are  used by business tend to have a mobile end to them and the way for them to  work efficiently is to have them host it on the cloud.  </p><p>But what's happening here with this hybrid is there are some companies of  the cost of migration to the cloud and moving all those applications over  is very pricey, so the hybrid model where some of the On-Premises server  and some of the cloud is really an alternative and that's why they're doing  those acquisitions.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And you see the market share increasing for even somebody  like an Amazon who is also in this business.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Yes.  The AWS, you have Microsoft is in the business, big time,  and a lot of the growth in Amazon is from AWS, which is their cloud- computing platform.  </p><p>The growth rate -- and you covered it well in that interview, the growth  rate for cloud-computing is just exponential.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's see how IBM manages this acquisition, though, because,  again, you have to have a management team and structure in place to  continue the growth.  </p><p>And very often, when a very large company buys one this size, then it  struggles because they don't have integrated.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Uh-hmm.  We'll watch that.  Obviously, the stocks are moving,  50 percent on Red Hat higher there and IBM shares are lower as you just  saw.  </p><p>Take a break.  When we come back, the Trump effect hits Brazil, a far-right  candidate, who's been compared to President Trump, define the odds to win  the election as President of Brazil.  The fallout later this hour coming  up.  </p><p>And then in the history books, the Boston Red Sox winning their fourth  World Series since 2004.  All the highlights in sports, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  Happy Monday, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday,  October 29th, your top stories right now at 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast on  the button.</p><p>Wall Street looking to turn around last week's losses this morning.  The  possible tech -- help from technology, we've got more tech giants reporting  earnings this week, and that's certainly will set the tone.</p><p>Right now, Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading, with the Dow  Industrials up about 40 points, the S&amp;P 500, up 12, and the NASDAQ, up 59  points, almost one percent higher on the NASDAQ.  This after a rough week,  last week, the major indices finished the day, Friday, lower, and the week,  the Dow and the S&amp;P, now back in negative territory, for the year.</p><p>This morning, as you see, the Dow was down one percent on Friday, almost  two percent on the S&amp;P, and the NASDAQ, down better than two percent on  Friday.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the indices are higher, we got a bounce going on,  this morning, across the world, FT 100 up one and a third percent, the CAC  Quarante up a quarter of a percent, and the DAX Index in Germany, up one  and two-thirds percent.</p><p>Asian markets, finishing mostly lower, overnight, following Wall Street's  cue last week.

JOHN RATCLIFFE (R-TX), CHAIR OF HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE:   The nation of immigrants, we want to be as generous and compassionate as  possible, than we are.</p><p>We let a million immigrants into this country, legally, every year, that's  more than any other country in the world, to ignore a horde of folks that  from unknown origins with unknown intense -- intentions other than to come  into this country, illegally, is just plain reckless.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will have a live update from the border, coming up in just a  few minutes.  Stay with us on that.  And then, voting to the right, Brazil,  electing a far right candidate, who some have compared to President Trump.   The President has called Mr. Bolsonaro and congratulated him for his  victory, this morning.  We will break it down for you.</p><p>And then, going public, a private interview of Deputy Attorney General Rod  Rosenstein could now become a public hearing.  We've got the details.   We're expecting that hearing after the midterms.</p><p>Then, taking the series, the Boston Red Sox beating the L.A. Dodgers last  night, to take the World Series, we have all of the highlights coming up,  in sports.</p><p>Scaring up the money, Michael Myers, going toe to toe with Lady Gaga, at  the box office, we will tell you who took the top spot, this past weekend,  coming up.</p><p>All of those stories coming up, but first, our top story this half an hour,  eight days until the midterm elections, truly countdown mode now.  A  presidential question is already being asked, Hillary 2020.  Here's what  Hillary Clinton said over the weekend, about a possible third run.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KARA SWISHER, CO-FOUNDER OF RECODE:  Do you want to run again?</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  No.  No.</p><p>SWISHER:  There was a pause.</p><p>CLINTON:  Well, I'd like to be president.</p><p>SWISHER:  OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me now, Washington Examiner Editorial Director, Hugo  Gurdon, Hugo, good to see you.  So, she wants to be president but she  doesn't want to go through all the running again, and the campaign, I  guess.</p><p>HUGO GURDON, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR AT WASHINGTON EXAMINER:  Yes.  She doesn't  want to go through it again, and she's obviously, not very successful.  And  in fact, she has proved herself to be historically unsuccessful as a  presidential candidate.</p><p>There was a joke going around on Twitter this morning, that it's the  Republicans who are shouting at her to run and the Democrats were shouting  lock her up.  They don't want her as their candidate.  There must be 20 or  so people who are muted as a candidate and she's already failed twice.   She'd love to be president, but I don't think that either she or her Party,  think that she can win.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your take on the midterm elections, Hugo, now, eight  days away?  How does it look in terms of both sides from your standpoint?</p><p>GURDON:  I think that the Republican majority could increase in the Senate.   But I certainly think that the Republicans will hold back.  I think the  odds are that the Democrats will take the House and so, we'll have a split  on Capitol Hill.</p><p>You know, as far as that -- those results are concerned, those might not  suit President Trump too badly.  It'll mean that he'll still be able to  confirm judges in the Senate and he'll still be able to, you know, at  least, he'll have a good chance of confirming cabinet members, if he needs  to replace those.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think this is a really important point that you're making  because if the Republicans keep the Senate, that's a huge and increase this  number of seats in the Senate, that's a huge victory for the President  because right off the bat, he'll probably change attorney generals.</p><p>He'll get his new A.G. confirmed, and once he has got a new A.G. in place,  it really doesn't matter if the House is going to be, you know, not doing  the investigations that the Republicans were pursuing like the FBI and the  DOJ.  You've a different A.G. in place, so that's certainly one thing  people are talking about.  You make the right point.</p><p>But let's talk about something else, and that is the administration  turnover.  Politico is reporting that a Trump cabinet exodus will happen  after the midterms.  Now, we know that the A.G. is likely to go.</p><p>The reports says an addition to the departure of Nikki Haley, we'll see  Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Defense Secretary James Mattis and Interior  Secretary Ryan Zinke, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Homeland Security  Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, will leave the administration as well.  Your  reaction, do you expect this kind of turnover?</p><p>GURDON:  Yes.  I think it's very likely that after the midterms, there will  be a certain cleaning house by the President.  Look, his administration has  never had this, sort of, air of stability and, sort of, permanence about  it.</p><p>I think that it's pretty harrowing or at least wearing for people to be in  this administration, you know it's a constant state of -- I wouldn't say  crisis exactly, but nevertheless, there's certainly not peace in settlement  here.</p><p>I think that, you know there's been a lot of talk about the Defense  Secretary Mr. Mattis, leaving, I hadn't heard about Ryan Zinke.  Wilbur  Ross has done a great deal already, in terms of on trade and tariffs, which  the President has wanted.</p><p>So, I think there's very likely to see a substantial turnover and of  course, the President wants to put in the cabinet that he goes into the  2020 election with.  The final point I'd make on this, is that it's  perfectly normal after the first two years, after the midterms, for  administration to change up like this.  It's something that's happened with  previous presidencies and I think it's very likely to happen again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, I think, number one to go would be Jeff Sessions.   The President has made no secret of the fact that he's highly disappointed  in Jeff Sessions, partly, because he recused himself on the Russia probe,  and that's why he will get a new attorney general in there.</p><p>Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's closed door interview was  postponed last week, leading to speculation that we may see him questions,  in a public hearing.  House Judiciary Member Congressman John Ratcliffe was  on with me yesterday, on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" -- Here's what he said  about that.  Listen to this, Hugo.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RATCLIFFE:  You know, a lot of folks were unhappy that it was going to be  so limited in terms of who was going to get access to asking questions.   But I think that this is more likely going to be a public hearing where  more members of Congress will be able to ask some of the questions that I  just raised directly to the Deputy Attorney General.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we should expect that after the midterms some time in  November, you think?</p><p>RATCLIFFE:  Yes.  I don't think it's likely to happen in the next week  before the midterms.  But I know that, you know, hopefully, the sooner the  better.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see.  My sources were saying that he has agreed to after  November 15th, Hugo, your thoughts on that?</p><p>GURDON:  Yes.  I think that it's very likely that Rod Rosenstein will  testify, probably, in public.  There were some concerned that the time  allotted for the questioning in private was not going to allow enough  questions and there's enormous number of questions to ask him.</p><p>Most notably, the story that was been going around now for several weeks,  that he talked about wearing a wire and recording President Trump and using  the 25th amendment to get rid of him.  Now, it said that he was just  joking, but we already have -- </p><p>The Congress has already heard testimony from the top lawyer at the FBI,  that the FBI officials who are hearing, listening to Rosenstein, didn't  take it as a joke, so this is a real scandal and I'm sure that Congress  wants to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hugo, isn't it interesting that an ex-army captain won Brazil's  presidential election, really perhaps shifting Latin America's largest  nature in country to the right.  You're seeing this take place in other  countries as well, away from United States.  They are comparing him to  Donald Trump.</p><p>GURDON:  Yes.  There are a lot of comparisons that -- and he certainly  shoots from the left.  He said a number of rather extraordinary things  which have turned a lot of people off.  However, I would not say he's very  far right, any more than his opponent, is very far left.</p><p>Brazil was making a decision after, at least, a couple of decades of left  wing rule, highly corrupt and ineffective rule from the left, to turn to  someone who I, sort of, Trumpy in his persona.  And, you know, they think  that what they're going to get is someone who is straight talking, even if  very rough talking, and that is a very strong comparison to President  Trump.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I think that's really important point that you just made, I  agree with that, that far right, but certainly, leading toward  conservative.  But, you know, this is the guy who was stabbed during the  campaign, talk about vitriol going on.  He was stabbed while he was  campaigning, got back -- got back on his feet, and won the election.</p><p>GURDON:  Yes.  He's obviously -- that kind of attack, will actually appeal  and produce a, sort of, sympathy vote.  He's, you know, he's been in  Congress, actually, I think, it's seven terms in a row, so he's not exactly  new to people, but his -- and he's got good recognition.</p><p>But you know, when you're talking the way that President Trump does and Mr.  Bolsonaro has, and, you know, then you get attacked, then people start to  sympathize with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Hugo, good to see you this morning, thanks so much.</p><p>GURDON:  Thanks a lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hugo Gurdon, joining us there.  Be sure to join us for our  election coverage, next week.  MORNINGS WITH MARIA will begin an hour  earlier, at 5 a.m. Eastern on November 7th, the day after the election.

I don't need  to watch, but I watch my film.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's all Gaga and Bradley Cooper, though, that's -- you went  to see it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I did.  I loved it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Tammy Miller, our producer went to see it.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  I saw it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I loved it.</p><p>CARTER:  Dagen, I'm dying to see it.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Choked up, I didn't cry.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was fantastic.

We  will take you there live to Mexico next, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Now, the latest on the migrant caravan crisis.   One group of migrants inching closer to the United States again after  stopping to take a break yesterday, another group clashing with Mexican  officers after trying to enter the country from Guatemala.  Fox News  Correspondent Griff Jenkins joins us now, he's at the southern -- he's in  Southern Mexico, near the border.  Griff, good morning to you.  </p><p>GRIFF JENKINS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Yes,  the migrant caravan is back on the move after a day of rest.  You see them  behind me there in (INAUDIBLE), a city in (INAUDIBLE), one of the first  cities that came to the (INAUDIBLE) state.  And they're headed to another  town about 30 miles away Niltepec, and it's interesting, Maria, because  Niltepec has a population of 4,000, of course, the caravan is about 4,000.   Which is certainly going to strain on resources, food, water and these  sorts of things.  But Funes -- Lenon Funes -- I met one of the migrants, he  speaks English.  Lenon, where were you -- you're living in the U.S. and you  had a work permit?  </p><p>LENON FUNES, MIGRANT:  Yes, sir.  I live in USA for 20 years.  I get my  work permit for every year, renewal, and they told me, Nomas, you can go  back to country -- because your paper work is filed.</p><p>JENKINS:  And today, you're a part of this caravan, but why don't you just  do it in a legal way and apply for another work permit in Guatemala instead  of getting in the caravan.  </p><p>FUNES:  I have to get my visa, my work permit, and they say no, because --  Nomas, you live in USA for 20 years, you can get your visa.  </p><p>JENKINS:  And Lenon, one last question, Mexico's President Pena Nieto  offering for you just to have asylum stop here, Wahaca, and take temporary  employment, will you take his offer or you continue to the U.S.?  </p><p>FUNES:  Well, I'll continue to Mexico, and they say, you can stay in Mexico  for year and we can get you working but I'm going to the border, U.S.  border, because I want to go back to USA.  </p><p>JENKINS:  OK, Lenon, thank you very much.  </p><p>FUNES:  OK, sir.</p><p>JENKINS:  Be well.  Be well.  Buenos.  So, you know, Maria, it's very  interesting to talk to the folks out here because they hear the admonitions  from Secretary Neilsen and from President Trump saying don't come to the  border, you're not going to get in. But in this case, it's interesting  because, Mr. Funes, just not able to get any headway started in his town,  as you see.  The migrant caravan moving here, and actually, interesting  enough, what you're seeing in the distance is an immigration checkpoint, as  you can see, they're not checking anything at the immigration checkpoint,  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, that's the immigration checkpoint going where?  What's  taking place right there as they go to that check point, Griff?  </p><p>JENKINS:  It would normally be a check point that they have between the  towns of San Pedro to Niltepec in moving towards (INAUDIBLE), and the next  big one in Oaxaca.  They have check points all across the Southern Mexico,  but the immigration officials here and the police just letting them pass,  rather than check anything.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I see.  All right, Griff, thanks very much.  Griff Jenkins is  in Mexico this morning, really, incredible pictures to look at this caravan  and amazing that it is eight days before election, Dagen, because it sort  of crystallizes one of the major issues for voters.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Wait, and I pushback on this that people -- that President  Trump's opponents want to characterize this, and the coverage of this as  stoking fear of immigrants coming into this country.  That is not it.  It  is the fact that people see in this country -- feel like that there's a  rule of law and we have immigration laws.  And they are concerned about  people coming into the United States, floods of people even those coming in  illegally that put a great financial burden on these communities.  If you  look all along the border, in terms of the cost to provide health care to  them, to provide education for all of the children who are in this country  even illegally which is again, with based on a Supreme Court decision.   That's what people are concerned about.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is basically enforcing rule of law in this country.  And our  hearts go out to these individuals; they want to be in the U.S. because  it's a wonderful place.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's not forget that as John Ratcliffe told us this weekend,  the U.S. -- lets in a million foreign every year, legally.  So, that's the  point, we are letting in outsiders of million people strong every year in a  legal structure, Lee.  But you know, the idea that they can just come and  get in their front of the line, well, people are actually waiting having  done it and going through the steps you need to go through to get in here  legal, it makes no sense.  </p><p>CARTER:  I think that it's really important that people understand that a  majority of Americans are concerned about immigration, and what they're  concerned about is illegal immigration for the reasons exactly you're  talking about people want legal immigration.  People want what the American  dream was founded on, but what they don't want is people taking advantage.   And that doesn't mean that these people are bad people.  This is the  majority of Americans who feel this way, so I think that we need to try and  understand and be more empathetic to what are their concerns and try to  look at it and give them the benefit of the doubt.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I wonder if this doesn't highlight, though, that fact that the  Republicans haven't done more in terms of fully funding the wall, in terms  of depriving money from sanctuary cities in this country.  I wonder if it  doesn't go in the other direction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator Ron Johnson, he said, well, part of it is because the  Democrats, when we went to have the conversation about this, the Democrats  wanted a comprehensive change including the DACA recipients; they wanted  much bigger than what was the issue just for the specific immigration  story. </p><p>All right, still ahead, there this: The man accused of sending multiple  suspicious explosive packages faces a judge later this morning.  We have  details on that coming up on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Thanks so much for joining us this  morning.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Monday, October 29th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Investors are looking to start the new week on a high note.  Take a look at  futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of better than 100 points  on the Dow, 21 points higher on the S&amp;P, and 70 points higher on the  Nasdaq, better than 1 percent higher on the Nasdaq right now.</p><p>This, after the major indices capped off a volatile week last week with  sharp declines -- the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 down better than 1 percent on  Friday alone.  The Nasdaq down another 2 percent on Friday on the heels of  disappointing results from Amazon and Alphabet.  The Nasdaq is now in  correction territory.</p><p>Global markets this morning are bouncing nonetheless, taking a cue from  Wall Street.  The FT 100 is up 1.5 percent.  The CAC 40 is up a quarter of  a percent.  And the DAX index in Germany up almost 2 percent this morning,  1.89 percent higher.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mostly lower with the exception of Hong  Kong.  Worst performer was China, down better than -- down better than 2  percent, rather on the Shanghai composite.</p><p>Earnings, of course, setting the tone -- third quarter earnings continue to  flow out.  This morning, we have number of companies reporting.  And this  week is a big one.  Dow components, Apple among others, will report  earnings this week -- as you can see the big list coming out this week.</p><p>And we have this -- breaking news overnight.  A plane crashes shortly after  takeover in Indonesia.  Nearly 200 people were on board.  We have the very  latest on the search efforts this morning taking place.</p><p>Honoring the victims of the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting, meanwhile --  thousands filled the streets last night after Pittsburgh's mayor weighed in  on the possible motive.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR BILL PEDUTO, PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA:  We're dealing with irrational  behavior.  There is no way that you can rationalize a person walking into a  synagogue during services and taking the lives of 11 people.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The suspect set to appear in court later today.</p><p>Also in court today, the alleged sender of the pipe bombs to prominent  Democrats.  The details and the charges that he faces, coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it  all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PWC partner Mitch  Roschelle, and the president of Maslansky and Partners Lee Carter is here.   Great to see you this morning.  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  So good to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I've got to give a big shout out to law enforcement -- how  quickly they found the sender of those pipe bombs.  They did an excellent  job.  And that is why America has the greatest law enforcement ever on the  planet right here.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  And even postal workers --  people working in mail rooms down at the Tribeca offices of Robert De  Niro's film operation.  It's really incredible how alert people were and  we're all thankful that no one was hurt by those pipe bombs -- </p><p>CARTER:  Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- most definitely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But the law enforcement did great.  I mean -- it took  them a day and they zeroed in on who did it.  It was really impressive.   And I just want to make sure we give a shout out.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER:  All off of a finger print.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And because he already had one in the system.  So it wasn't too  hard to find the guy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  He's hiding in plain sight.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What else is on your mind this morning?  Obviously e4arnings  driving the story.  We've got a bounce going on after that rough week last  week in stocks.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So it's still the revenue disappointments that are front and  center -- 43 percent of the nearly half of the S&amp;P 500 that have reported  so far; 43 percent have missed revenue expectations.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Three months ago it was only 18 percent missing revenue on that.   Apple, a big name to watch Thursday.</p><p>But we've got the jobs report coming out.  So the narrative that has been  developing that you were way ahead of this narrative is that people are  looking into next year, worrying about slowing growth and even possibly a  recession.</p><p>You started talking about it, I think at the beginning of this year. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is going to be one thing to watch for in terms of the job  growth.  I think the expectation is 188,000 jobs added last month; 3.7  percent unemployment holding at that near 50-year low -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- which is a great number.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But you need to see that job growth, the wage growth still in  place in order to keep people's spirits -- believe (ph) about the strength  of the economy.  </p><p>CARTER:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And when I spoke to Kevin Brady, chairman of House Ways and  Means, this weekend, he was not suggesting that things are slowing down so  far.  I mean, you know, he said yes, we've got a GDP which is 3.5 percent  versus 4.2 percent in the second quarter.  But he continues to see the tax  cut plan and the rollback in regulations having a runway in terms of its  impact on growth -- Lee.  </p><p>CARTER:  You know, I really think though, the big picture things look good.   The macro level and people are looking at their statements, their balances,  there's some volatility right now.  </p><p>The thing I have found fascinating is voter sentiment has been tracking the  stock market very, very closely.  When you see a volatile market like this,  I can't help but wonder what the impact is going to be on the midterms.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Really interesting.  Because people do look at their -- tens of  millions of Americans who are invested in the stock market through their  401(k)s, they do look at their 401(k) balances.  </p><p>CARTER:  Absolutely.  I was just on vacation with a huge number of my  family members.  And a lot of people were talking about might have to roll  back the spending a little bit this year because look at what's happening  to my balance.  I've lost $20,000 this week or whatever amount of money it  was that people have lost.</p><p>And that is going to have an impact because people are looking at the  economy and saying it's so strong, it's so good.  This is why I'm going to  keep voting Republican.</p><p>But right now, when I look at my pocketbook, I'm not so sure.  So what's  that going to mean for voter turnout?  I'm not so sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I don't know.  It's a week.  It's a couple of weeks of  market volatility.  I mean I would push back on that because markets go up  and markets go down. </p><p>But you do have this narrative that the worry that economic growth slows  down but you're still talking about very good numbers, I mean 3 percent.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  There's no question though, there's linkage between people look  at account balances and their spending habits and their confidence as  consumers.  So if the -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And they're addicted to behavior.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And we're also going into the holiday shopping season.  And  that's a big barometer for not only future earnings for the retail industry  but just what the year ahead looks like because our economy is so consumer- dependent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it is.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank God for the consumer and that GDP report last Friday --  that 4 percent growth.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  If it wasn't for that consumer -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Again, it was a good portion of the GDP report.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's 70 percent of the economy, obviously.</p><p>All right.  All of that coming up this morning.</p><p>But first, united in grief -- the suspect in the shooting at the Tree of  Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh where 11 people were killed, six others  injured -- he will appear in court today.</p><p>President Trump says the law needs to change.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  This was an anti-Semitic  attack at its worst.  And when you have crimes like this, whether it's this  one or another one on another group, we have to bring back the death  penalty.</p><p>They have to pay the ultimate price.  They have to pay the ultimate price.   They can't do this.  They can't do this to our country.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  The Department of Justice is considering the death  penalty against suspect Robert Bowers.</p><p>Joining me right now is Republican Congressman Scott Perry from  Pennsylvania.  Congressman -- thanks very much for joining us.  And our  condolences to -- </p><p>REP. SCDOTT PERRY (R), PENNSYLVANIA:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- everyone there, your constituents in Pennsylvania as the  entire country is mourning for the victims of this horrible fatality.  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes, we are in mourning in Pennsylvania.  Of course we just can't  imagine that this occurs in a synagogue, in a church -- kind of the epitome  of innocence.  I understand one of the victims was a Holocaust survivor, in  her synagogue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>PERRY:  Just -- we are just completely grief-stricken and condemn these  actions in the strongest terms.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You heard the President there.  Do you want to see the death  penalty here?  </p><p>PERRY:  Yes.  I'm a supporter of the death penalty.  I think it is a  deterrent.  And in Pennsylvania we've got a governor that has seen fit to  not exercise his authority to use the death penalty even in horrific cases  such as this.  And so I think that certainly it deserves another look, if  nothing else.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me switch gears and ask you about some of the economic  issues going on.  The President has been keeping the pressure on China at a  rally in Indianapolis.  The President laid down a sticking point he has  with Beijing and America's trade dealings with them.</p><p>Listen to what he said.  I've got to get your reaction here -- sir.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  Chinese companies have tried to steal our trade secrets.  China has  taken many of those great, brilliant things that you've come up with and  they've stolen it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't think anybody -- I mean many people agree with that  statement, Congressman -- that China has been stealing from the United  States for decades.  But what do you do about it?  I mean you serve on the  House Committee on Foreign Affairs -- your thoughts here.</p><p>PERRY:  Well, there's got to be strict penalties for those types of things,  number one.  Number two, I think that China's got to understand from an  economic standpoint that we won't stand for it and there's going to be  consequences on the larger -- on a macro level.</p><p>And so when the President says that he's going to rein China in and isolate  China from an economic standpoint, I think that that's part of it.  We  could certainly be more reasonable on other issues regarding tariffs,  regarding trade, regarding the World Trade Organization.</p><p>But we cannot be reasonable with the outright theft, the lawlessness and  the theft of our intellectual property in the United States and the west in  general by China.  And they have to suffer economically for that.  They  have to see that there's a correlation between stealing other countries'  intellectual property and their prosperity.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  But they haven't done anything about it, right.  I mean  this fight now has gone on, more than a year, I guess.  And the President  is pushing back, rightly so, for this theft.</p><p>PERRY:  Right.  Right.  Well -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's a dictator for life in China and he's not changing his  behavior, is he?  </p><p>PERRY:  Well, and I think that the President is right to be patient because  this is -- it's gone on for much longer than a year.  This president is  finally the one that has said we've had enough of it and we're going to do  something about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>PERRY:  I think it requires -- it requires a measured response over time  that escalates and lets China know that if it continues, there's going to  be benchmarks that you're going to have to deal with all across the  spectrum of opportunities that the administration and the United States and  the world has.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we find it unacceptable -- continue to highlight it as a  problem.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- the President is also outlining a new tax break  for the middle class.  Congressman Kevin Brady joined me yesterday on  \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" and told me that this is separate and apart from  making the individual cuts permanent.</p><p>Listen to what he said -- got to get your reaction here.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R), TEXAS:  It's really about keeping the momentum going.   Obviously the economy is booming.  We're on track for the first total year  over year plus 3 percent economic growth in more than a decade.</p><p>We're seeing jobs coming back, paychecks going up.  Main Street is hiring  again.  So the President's really about focused on more of that economic  growth.</p><p>The House has passed 2.0 before we left for October with 44 Democrat votes  for this three-bill package.  It's now over in the Senate.</p><p>And I think permanence really depends on this election.  If Republicans  retain control of the House and the Senate next year we will do  reconciliation and make these tax cuts permanent.</p><p>The President wants to go even farther.  He's really focused on the middle  class.  He just believes they're the ones who get squeezed the most.  He's  asked us and we worked with him on developing another 10 percent middle  class tax cuts for workers and families.  And so we'll be ready to move  with that as well.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So Congressman -- what do you think of the plan in terms of an  additional tax cut?  And what about the pushback that we continue to see  deficits -- $800 billion deficit this year and trillion dollar deficits for  as long as you can look.  </p><p>PERRY:  Right.  Well, Maria -- I always think that letting people keep more  of what they earn is a good thing and that the government misuses the tax  dollars in some respects that are sent in.  So that's always a good thing.</p><p>And also, on the deficit side, I've been there on the deficit side, voting  against bloated deficits and bloated deficit spending.  But let's not  correlate the two so directly.  You don't fix your overspending problem by  taxing people more.  You fix that by spending less.</p><p>And so that's what we really need to focus on.  The President offered a  budget that spent less and we didn't take much or any of it up.  As a  matter of fact, the tax proposal that the House sent the Senate I think  saved about $400 billion but yet the Senate sent it back with a trillion  dollars additional spending.</p><p>And unfortunately to get something that allows the people to keep more of  what they earn has to make it through the Senate.  As long as that's full  of liberal folks that don't want to cut spending we're going to have this  problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>PERRY:  We want to fix that here in about seven days.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman -- real quick, tell me how the seven days is  looking to you in terms of the midterm elections?  Are you expecting to  keep the majority in the House or do you think that that goes to the Dems?  </p><p>PERRY:  No, I think that that's clearly doable.  I've been out on the  streets, knocking on doors.  It's been a really, really positive response.   So I think people are correlating more money kept in their pocket, more  money that they've earned at their disposal, as long as Republicans are in  charge.</p><p>They also know that if Nancy Pelosi is in charge that she's going to vote  for tax increases.  She's going to pull all that back.  They don't like  that unpredictability anymore than businesses don't like that  unpredictability.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Congressman -- we'll leave it there.  Good to see  you this morning Thanks very much.</p><p>PERRY:  Thank you.  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Scott Perry joining us.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA will begin an hour early at 5:00 a.m. Eastern on  November 7th, the day after the midterm elections.  We are bringing you the  results from the midterms.</p><p>We've got all hands on deck, so join us on November 7th for an early start.</p><p>First though, horror after takeoff -- the search for survivors this morning  after an Indonesian plan crashes into the sea.  We've got the details,  next.</p><p>And then the pipe bomb suspect is headed to court.  Details on his expected  appearance later today.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All passengers and crew on board a Lion Air passenger jet  feared dead this morning.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details.  Cheryl -- what a terrible story.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  It really is -- Maria.</p><p>We're getting some new details right now on this.  Rescue officials in  Indonesia have found some human remains as one of those officials is  predicting there will be no survivors.  The Lion Air Boeing 737 had 189  passengers and crew on board.  It went down off the Indonesian coast  shortly after taking off this morning from Jakarta for an island off  Sumatra. </p><p>In addition to the human remains that were found, search and rescue crews  have found ID cards, personal belongings and aircraft debris.  The accident  is the first reported incident involving a new version of Boeing's very  popular 737.</p><p>Well, the English football world is mourning the loss of Leicester City's  team owner and four others who were killed in a fiery helicopter crash on  Saturday.  The helicopter carrying the 60-year-old billionaire Vichai  Srivaddhanaprabha burst into flames shortly after taking off from the team  stadium.</p><p>Vichai made his fortune with the duty-free retail giant King Power.  He  bankrolled Leicester's improbably league title triumph back in 2016.  An  investigation into the cause of that crash is continuing this morning.</p><p>Well, the Florida man accused of sending at least 14 pipe bombs to  prominent Democrats is set to make his first court appearance in Miami  today.  Fifty-six-year-old Cesar Sayoc faces five federal charges of up to  48 years in prison.</p><p>He was arrested on Friday, four days after the first package was found in  New York.  A single finger print led the FBI to his arrest.  U.S. Marshals  are expected to transfer Sayoc to New York City where the Justice  Department wants to try him in the U.S. Attorney's southern district.</p><p>A lot of busy headlines over the weekend -- Maria.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.  Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up, a new strategy for Sam's Club -- details on the retailer's plans  to open its own version of Amazon Go stores.  That's coming up.</p><p>Then an incredible win for the Boston Red Sox, the highlights from the  World Series coming up right here later this hour.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Fed fallout -- the Federal Reserve raising interest rates; it is taking a  toll on the housing market.  Growth in existing home sales is slowing.  As  a result my next guest says rental demand is soaring.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of that is Marcos and Millichap  CEO Hessam Nadji.  Hessam -- good to see you this morning, thanks so much  for joining us.</p><p>HESSAM NADJI, CEO, MARCOS AND MILLICHAP:  Good morning -- Maria.  Great to  be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, we know that when interest rates move it has all  sorts of effect.  We've got this volatility in the stock market as now some  investors are looking at real opportunities in fixed income on the short  end certainly with the two-year now all the way up to 3 percent.  Tell us  about the impact on housing.  </p><p>NADJI:  Well, as you mentioned, the effect of interest rates is direct on a  number of sectors in real estate, especially residential housing prices are  affected.  Sales have slowed.  And that's not really a surprise.</p><p>But we have to remember, even before interest rates began to really  increase, we saw consumers prefer to rent.  The demographics have changed.   The financial crisis was a very hard hit to the consumer on the housing  front.</p><p>So we've seen the apartment rental market show incredible strength.  And it  continues to show strength because of the fact that now you have this  compounding effect of higher interest rates and price appreciation on the  housing side pushing more people into the rental market.</p><p>But Maria -- I have to say that if you look at commercial real estate  broadly, we're still seeing very little over-building.  We still see the  absence of bad loans about to create a problem on the leverage side of the  equation.  So the industry looks very good.</p><p>But again, rising interest rates pressure prices.  and the fact that the  tax reform was so favorable toward commercial real estate, it still hasn't  had time to work its way through.</p><p>So investors are mostly concerned about rising interest rates and frankly,  trade wars is another concern.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Hessam -- Mitch Roschelle, good morning.</p><p>One that you talked about, demand for apartments which is great.  You also  mentioned commercial real estate and the strong fundamentals.  What I don't  really understand is why the REITs aren't behaving the way the underlying  fundamentals of real estate are behaving.  So maybe you can explain a  little bit why the REITS seem to be oversold right now.</p><p>NADJI:  Well, Mitch -- we've seen many instances of interest rates rising  and creating an overhang on the REIT side and over-punishing REIT just  because interest rates are rising despite the fundamentals.  I think the  sector is really caught up again in that phenomenon.</p><p>But as you said the fundamentals are extremely strong and REITs are very  good operators and create all kinds of benefits in terms of economies of  scale and the way they manage property and keep occupancies high.</p><p>But I think the other concern is that given the fact that the Fed  inevitably has to raise interest rates to normalize rates along with a  very, very strong economy, the investment community is telling us that  they're hoping there is a little bit of a pause because it takes six to  nine months for the effect of the higher interest rates to work its way  through the economy. </p><p>And we're really hearing from a lot of investors, they're concerned about  the Fed going too far, too fast and maybe creating too much of an adverse  effect whether it's on REITs or the housing market, you know, both.  </p><p>CARTER:  You know, I think it's interesting too, that the housing market --  you're talking a lot about interest rates but also tax reform took away the  ability for people to write off local taxes, property taxes, as much as  they did before on their mortgage.  I think that could have some impact on  purchase behavior as well.</p><p>So you're talking about the trends but what do you think is going to happen  long-term if this is the way things are looking?  And also, it's going to  have an impact on individual wealth, if people aren't going to buy homes.  </p><p>NADJI:  You're totally right in that the tax reform was much more favorable  toward investing in commercial real estate.  There is a number of  provisions that were preserved and a number of provision that were added  that makes commercial real estate investing very favorable.</p><p>It takes time for that to come through the marketplace.  And we're just  seeing investors complete their 2017 taxes and so we need a cycle or two to  see the benefits.</p><p>But you're right.  On the housing front clearly, the tax reform does reduce  demand both at the lower end of the market and, of course, the higher end  of the market and it just compounds this long-term trend we've seen of more  and more consumers wanting the flexibility of renting, wanting the  flexibility of, you know, moving around to chase jobs, especially among the  younger adults, the 30-somethings that are capturing a lot of the  professional service jobs that are being created in urban areas.  That  segment in particular prefers to rent right now.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll leave it there.  Hessam -- thanks very much  for the info.  We so appreciate it.  Good to see you.  </p><p>NADJI:  Great to be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hessam Nadji there.</p><p>Coming up, iPhone versus Android, which one?  Why a shocking study claims  those who use apple products are happier -- later this hour.</p><p>Then Halloween at the White House -- more of the incredible decorations on  the south lawn to show you.  Check this out</p><p>Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 29th.  Your  top stories right now 7:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>A market turnaround this morning.  We are expecting a big rally at the  start of trading.  Right here, this is the high of the morning.  Dow  Industrials are up 170 points, two thirds of one percent.  S&amp;P 500 up 29  points, that's better than one percent, and the NASDAQ is up 93 points  right now, that's 1-1/3 percent higher on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>Very strong start is expected this morning after the major indices finished  lower on Friday after a volatile week.  The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 now back in  negative territory for the year after that selloff on Friday as you can  see.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, we've got a bit of a bounce as well.  As you can  see, this is the high of the morning in Europe as well, FT-100 up 128  points, that's almost two percent higher right now in London.  The CAC  Quarante in Paris up better than one percent and the DAX Index in Germany  up better than two percent right now, 237 points higher in Germany.  </p><p>Asian markets meanwhile, mostly lower overnight.  The Shanghai Composite  down better than two percent on the session.  </p><p>The way of the Futures, Sam Club -- Sam's Club is going head to head with  Amazon, details of the retailer's new high tech store coming up.  </p><p>And then, the proof is in the phone, not all smartphones are the same and  the users are just as different as the gadgets, apparently.  What your  phone says about you, coming up.  </p><p>Then, taking the series, the Boston Red Sox beating the L.A. Dodgers to win  the World Series yesterday.  We've got all the highlights.  </p><p>And Halloween at the White House, the president and the first lady greeting  trick or treaters.  More of the White House decorations coming up.  Wow,  that looks good.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning.  But first, our top story,  counting down to the midterms.  We are now eight days away.  President  Trump is on a campaign rally blitz with just eight days until voters head  to the polls.  Fox News correspondent Kevin Corke at the White House this  morning with the very latest.  Kevin, good morning to you.  </p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  Blitz is the perfect  word.  Now, it's a relatively quiet start to the week for the president.   He does have an Intel briefing later this morning.  But as you point out,  he has certainly been a rogue warrior for the GOP ahead of the midterms,  another rally in Illinois over the weekend.  And there are more rallies in  the (INAUDIBLE) as we head down the stretch, which is eight days ago before  the midterms.  </p><p>In fact on the schedule, the president now has stops set up in the Sunshine  and show me states, Florida with those huge races for the Senate and  governor, that are getting plenty of national attention.  </p><p>Meanwhile, over in Missora, as we like to say, I can say it, I'm from  Missouri.  Democrat Senator Claire McCaskill trailing her Republican  challenger Josh Hawley.  He's the attorney general in the state.  Latest  polls showing Hawley up 49-45.  </p><p>Also this morning here at the White House, we expect to hear what  administration officials have to say about German chancellor Angela  Merkel's decision to not seek re-election as chancellor.  Though she has  stated this morning that she'd like to remain in her post until 2021.  </p><p>One more thing that we're certainly keeping a very close eye on in addition  to the markets, we're watching what may happen in terms of border security  later this week, Maria.  The president sort of tipped his hand last week,  said that we should expect something big.  We'll keep an eye on it for you,  but for now, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, great reporting.  Kevin, as always, thank you.   Kevin Corke at the White House.  </p><p>Let's talk about this, eight days away from the November elections, Lee  Carter, you've been doing dials -- give us a sense of what you see going  into the election on Tuesday night.  </p><p>CARTER:  So, I see more tribalism than we've ever had before.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>CARTER:  I didn't think it was possible.  But it was in 2016.  But there's  no doubt, that right now, if you support the president, you support him no  matter what.  If you hate the president, you hate him no matter what.  An  independence are completely disenfranchised.  </p><p>They were for a while, tracking with Republicans.  Sometimes they've  tracked with Democrats.  What they're doing right now is they are neutral,  and they are tuned out -- tuned off, and saying we want something  different.  </p><p>So, a lot of polling that you'll see is saying that we want a different  kind of leadership, we want something different to happen in Washington,  D.C.  And that's not necessarily just directed at the president.  That's  politics in general.  </p><p>They looked at what happened with Kavanaugh and they said, you know what, I  do not like the way the Senate handled this on either side.  And I am  disillusion.  </p><p>So, what's going to happen is you have to look at this very locally.   Because individual races are being run very, very different than what  you're seeing nationwide.  </p><p>Nationwide, we're seeing a party of the Democrats running on resist,  resist, resist, we hate Trump at all costs.  Locally, if you look at  advertising what people are talking about is health care.  And health care  is the number one issue that's important to the American voter right now.   So, you see a very different thing playing out when you get close to voters  than you do seeing what's happening nationwide.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But some of these Democrats are running on something that is  essentially made up when it comes to health care.  They're running on --  their messaging is Republicans want to take away your coverage for pre- existing conditions.  </p><p>CARTER:  That's right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's what Republicans want to do.  And that's just not true.   Pre-existing conditions are still covered.  Despite the rollback of some  elements of Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act, despite the opening up  and allowing people to maybe buy plans in some states that don't have all  the benefits, that would be cheaper for individuals.  </p><p>So again, it's just astonishing to me that health care's number one but the  Democrats are messaging something that isn't true.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And don't forget that the economy is right there.  I mean,  you're talking 58 percent to 54 percent.  So, the economy is just almost as  equal as -- in terms of importance.  </p><p>CARTER:  That's right.  And I think that it's really, really important that  we understand that.  As we're looking at jobs numbers coming out this  Friday, as we're looking at people's income, wages, those kind of things  are going to be changing I think for the better right now.  That's  something that matters a lot to the American voter.  </p><p>And they're -- I think the other thing that a lot of people are talking  about right now is confidence right now in the economic future and you see  that, you're seeing a big change and a big shift.  And that plays out for  the Republicans as well.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  To that -- to that point, The Wall Street Journal poll that they  did last week, Republicans had a 15 percentage point advantage on the  economy.  50 percentage points, I think that that is the highest percentage  in this advantage in the cycle so far.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it is a very clear difference in terms of what they're  doing.  The Republicans want to lower taxes and roll back regulations.  And  the Democrats want to do the opposite.  They want to -- they didn't vote  for the tax cut plan.  They want to raise taxes as has been said by Nancy  Pelosi.  And they don't like the rollback in regulations.  These are the  two key things that have moved the needle on economic growth.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The thing I worry about with all the market volatility that  we've have in the month October is there's the basic voter and these  independents who are very undecided.  Can they decouple what's going on in  the stock market from what's fundamentally going on in the economy?  What's  going on -- going on in the economy is good.  What's going on in the stock  market right now is uncertain.  And I hope they can understand the  difference.  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes, I think that it is going to be a big question.  Because we  have people who do check their 401-k balances all the time, like I was  talking about earlier.  And then there's people who don't, who are looking  at the bigger -- there are people employed, are -- you know, how does it  feel out there.  So, we're going to see something different depending on  how people -- you know, behave and that's something that's going to be a  case by case basis.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know what we aren't hearing that's different is you still  hear from the left, from some Democrats that basket of deplorables  narrative.</p><p>CARTER:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That if you support, you might -- that if you support President  Trump, then you are essentially evil and it goes back to -- and this is  quoting from The Wall Street Journal editorial on the massacre at the Tree  of Life Synagogue called the oldest hatred.  The Wall Street Journal wrote,  Americans would do well to ignore this toxic habit.  A political blame for  murderous acts by the racist anti-Semitic or mentally disturb.  But this is  not the narrative that you hear from some people on the left, some people  in the media even.  And I wonder if that doesn't basically push people  closer to President Trump and even have them dig in over their support for  him.  </p><p>CARTER:  It absolutely -- it absolutely does.  I think outside of the  polling the thing that you really need to look at is the rhetoric.  And the  voter enthusiasm on the Republican side was waning, no question about it.   Kavanaugh hearings came out and you said if you stand with Kavanaugh, you  stand against women and what happened, Republicans came out said, don't  tell me what to do, don't tell me how to behave.  And right now, you're  saying if you stand with Republicans you stand with the president, you're  anti-Semitic, that you're racist, that you're fascist.  That you're all of  these things.  And what ends up happening, people say no, I'm not.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>CARTER:  And that is not -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, this is the new charge now, you know, that you're hearing  a lot about.  Let's not forget the success that people are expecting from  the Republicans in the Senate.  Congressman John Ratcliffe detailed his  predictions for the midterms yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\".  He was  optimistic, watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JOHN RATCLIFFE (R-TX), HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE MEMBER:  I will tell  you, Maria, I feel really good a week out from the midterms.  I think a lot  of what Senator Graham was just saying will come to fruition.  </p><p>There is no blue wave in the Senate.  We are going to keep the Senate and  in fact we're going to pick up seats in the Senate, at least one, hopefully  two or three.  </p><p>The House is going to be -- it's going to be tight.  History is against us,  Maria, but there are things that are working for us.  One of those is the  president who is out on a daily basis working his tail off to help  Republicans in tough races.  The other thing that's working for us, Maria,  is I think it's being crystalized in these last few weeks, the choice that  Americans have between Republicans and Democrats.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it's important to recognize what's about to happen in  the Senate.  Because if they gain seats in the Senate, the president will  have an easier time getting his appointees through.</p><p>CARTER:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  His nominations.  And you know he's about to change attorney  generals.  So, he will probably get his A.G. through the Senate easily and  that changes a lot for this president.  </p><p>CARTER:  That changes a lot for this president.  And I think that you can  almost take it for granted that at this point the Republicans are going to  keep the Senate and gain seats.  And you know, the difference -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a big victory for the president.  </p><p>CARTER:  That's a really, really big victory for the president.  I think  it's also fascinating, the last time you saw a split like this where the  Senate went one way and the House went another play was in the early '80s.   So, we have a real fracture here.  And the House has to really look at  itself and try to figure out why they're having such an issue.  Because,  you know, there's 99 seats right now at play in the House.  </p><p>The last time in 2016 there were only 39 seats at play.  In 2014, there  were only 44 seats at play.  This is a lot of seats at play.  And I think  the House has to take a look at itself and figure out why is it that they  are really being disrupted right now, why is it that things are so  different for them and everywhere else.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the Democrats only have to flip what, 23 seats or so to  actually get a majority.  But let's not forget, Mitch, they also have to  defend their current seats.  It's not just the 23 seats.  They've got to  defend what they already have.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  And think about how many congress men and women decided not to  run again which is -- which is --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, there's more than 40 resignations on the Republicans.   43.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Right.  Which is contributing to why perhaps we have 99 right  now.</p><p>CARTER:  Yes.  I also think the thing that's going to make this so hard to  predict is voter volatility and how they're going to vote, it's something  that we haven't seen in a long time.  Even though we have tribalism, based  on events that happen, whether you're talking about Kavanaugh, whether  you're talking about the events that happened last week, people's  indignation and their desire to go out and vote and their -- you know, and  their enthusiasm has really changed.  </p><p>Now we're looking at a neck in neck race where you've got 68 percent of  Republicans enthusiastic likely to vote, 72 percent of Democrats.  That's  really a virtual tie.  </p><p>The last time, and the closest that we've ever had, this kind of voter  enthusiasm is about 20 years ago.  So, this is -- this is really a  significant time.  And people need to get out there and vote.  This is --  this is unlike -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  If the -- if the Dems win the House by only a couple of seats,  there's really not a mandate.  </p><p>CARTER:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you know, it's so tight, it is so tight in the House.  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes.  I mean, we are -- we are a country divided.  But you know,  the Republicans are hanging in there and it's -- you know, if you were to  just read the newspapers, if you were just to -- you know, look at the  mainstream media right now, you would think that the Republicans are  persona non gratas.  That's not the case.  They've got the White House --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're getting the wrong story for the mainstream media.</p><p>CARTER:  Well, I just want to be clear.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know that.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, if anybody was flipping channels around the weekend, they  would have seen some people in the most highly offensive way trying to take  exploit the massacre at the tree of life Synagogue --</p><p>CARTER:  Absolutely.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- for their own political gain.  That was some of what was  going on.  It is shaming of people who consider themselves to be  conservatives.  So, I'm curious.  That changes.</p><p>CARTER:  Well, they say -- and they say this election is going to be won by  suburban women.  And when you're voting -- you know, when you're running an  election, when you're saying that if you -- if you stand with Republicans,  that you are racist, you are anti-feminist, you're anti women, you are  anti-Semitic and all these things.  You're asking these women and say that  my children, my husband, my brother, my father, I agree with you.  They're  all those people and they're not going to do that.  Nobody likes to be told  -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Above and beyond women like and want financial security.  And  we're going to find out this Friday potentially that wages average hourly  earnings are growing more than three percent first time in 9-1/2 years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That would be a huge thing if we see that on Friday on the jobs  report.  </p><p>Stay with Fox Business for a special midterm election coverage beginning in  November 6 at 7:00 p.m. Eastern.

Now, I'm embarrassed (INAUDIBLE) I think  my Android phone.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now I'm confused.  </p><p>KNUTSSON:  I now have a complex, right?  What about these figures?   Incredible.  A thousand of people were asked on the Android side.  And then  they asked a thousand iPhone owners all sorts of things, not just the happy  quotient.  </p><p>And by the way, are you happy with your job?  33 percent of those with an  iPhone said yes, I am.  And only was it 20-22 -- 20 percent with an Android  should say they're actually happy with their job.  </p><p>Spending pretty incredible, in terms of like Maria I'm assuming have an  iPhone, just because you look dynamite all the time.  Spending on clothing  $117 versus really just $62.00 for Android users.  The same in the makeup  and beauty category and also when it comes to tech, pretty incredible  spending differences here.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Wow.</p><p>KNUTSSON:  So clearly, if you own an Android you may not be the life of the  party but you're going to be the smart, frugal one for the long haul.  OK?   That's what I'm hearing out of this whole story.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think about this, Mitch?  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Well, I'm trying to get -- Kurt, so what influences the  decision to buy one versus the other?  How much of it is personal choice?   How much of it is what companies will reimburse for?  What's really  influencing this?  I'm trying to get behind these numbers and figure out  whether or not there's cause and effect.  </p><p>KNUTSSON:  That would be our next study, right?  That's what we have to do  with that one.  The fact is though, people that buy an iPhone clearly are a  different kind of person in someone who's buying an Android device at this  point.</p><p>And this study right here all be it 2,000 people being sample still as  pretty telling about you know, symbolically what these phones mean in our  lives.  </p><p>The amount of time we're spending on them also, people with an iPhone  apparently spending five hours a day plus, a little bit more than an  Android.  And then, there's figure on that, 58 tweets on average from  iPhone users versus just down into the 20s for someone on an Android.  </p><p>And so people with an iPhone, also 12 selfies a day is the average, only  five selfies a day if you've got an Android.  </p><p>CARTER:  So, you're happy you can take more selfies?</p><p>KNUTSSON:  Are they less narcissistic?  That's the next question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wait, does that have to do with the camera or the selfie?  I  mean, the picture that you're taking?  </p><p>KNUTSSON:  Right or your skill set and being able to take the picture.  I  don't know.  I think it's interesting to take a look at it's fun  information.  And yet again, Apple's selling phones like crazy with their  three introduced phones this quarter.  </p><p>CARTER:  But, I mean, it's a really fun study.  With 2,000 is a significant  sample.  I mean, that would be -- that would be a really good poll.  So, I  -- is there anything in there about voter preference?  Are we more likely  to be Republican or Democrat?  </p><p>KNUTSSON:  Not in this particular study.  But that'd be interesting.   That's one you can do.  </p><p>CARTER:  I know right?  I'm fascinated by brand identity and politics.   Seems to be getting more and more, you know, you double down on those kinds  of things.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, Kurt, Apple's hosting another event in Brooklyn  after the unveiling of its new iPhones last month.  They're reportedly  expected to reveal what's next for the iPad.  What do you think about what  we'll hear?  </p><p>KNUTSSON:  Yes, you're right.  I think, you know, very interesting, so away  from Cupertino an hour on the East Coast.  We're at the creation kind of  location.  The Brooklyn Academy of Music, and it's all about using words  about the making.  So, I think what we're going to see is on the hardware  side, we're going to see two refreshes of the iPad Pro, edge to edge  screens, maybe a new MacBook Air and then something big coming that Reed  Hastings at Netflix may want to keep his eye on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, we'll watch that.  That makes me happy.  Kurt, thank you.   Kurt Knutsson joining us there.  </p><p>Still ahead, IBM's largest acquisition ever, details on the company's $33  billion deal for Red Hat.

Good Monday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Monday to you.  I'm Maria Bartiromo  and it is Monday, October 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on  the button.  It is looking like a pretty good start to trading this  morning.  Investors expected to start the new week on a strong note with  Dow industrials up 126 points right now.  That's a half of a percent  higher.</p><p>The S&amp;P is up almost one percent and the NASDAQ right now 71-point move  higher is up better than one percent.  This after the major indices capped  off a volatility week last week with sharp declines on Friday.  The Dow and  the S&amp;P 500 were down better than one percent on Friday.  The NASDAQ down  better than two percent on the heels of disappointing earnings from Amazon  and Alphabet.</p><p>Global markets this morning have a firmer tone, European indices higher  across the board, FT-100 up almost two percent, 125 points higher.  CAC  quarante in Paris is up almost one percent and the DAX Index in Germany up  almost two percent, 198 points higher in Germany.  In Asia overnight,  markets finished mostly lower as you see there with the exception, Hong  Kong.  Shanghai Composite down sharply down better than two percent  overnight.</p><p>Meanwhile, earnings certainly settling the tone from Wall Street this  morning, several Dow components including Apple will be reporting their  quarterly numbers this week.  Investors are watching also G.E., the Wall  Street Journal is reporting this morning that the company may be forced to  cut its dividend again.  One of the top stories in the Journal.  Bit of a  merger Monday on Wall Street to tell you about.</p><p>IBM is acquiring Red Hat for $33 billion.  This is IBM's largest  acquisition ever.  Red Hat shares are up 52 percent on the news.  IBM  shares off of the lows down 3-1/4 percent.  Coming up.  How the deal will  drive growth at the struggling technology companies coming up.  </p><p>Breaking news overnight.  A plane crashes shortly after in Indonesia.   Nearly 200 were onboard.  We have the very latest on the search effort  happening right now. </p><p>And then honoring the victims of the Tree Of Life Synagogue shooting.   Thousands of people filling the streets last night in Pittsburgh after  President Trump condemned the attack on Saturday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: This evil anti-semitic attack is  an assault on all of us, it's an assault on humanity.  It will require all  of us working together to extract the hateful poison of anti-semitism from  our world.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest coming up as the alleged shooter is set  to appear in court today.  All those stories coming up this Monday morning  and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  PwC Partner Mitch Roschelle and the president of Maslansky and Partners,  Lee Carter.  Good to see you.  Great show so far guys.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.   Interesting times for sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Sure is.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Yes.  We've got -- we've got a lot of news  and we've got an election in days.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Exactly. Well, and that could change a lot in terms of  the agenda whether or not we see the economic agenda like another tax cut  plan in place, Dagen, the rollback in regulations could be reversed.  I  don't know.  I know the victory in the Senate side is going to be a big win  for this president but certainly the House could do investigation after  investigation of President Trump and his taxes and all that stuff.</p><p>That's what Jerry Nadler said as his priority if in fact he becomes the  chairman of Oversight.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  A lot -- you will see  a lot of investigation that are for show and nothing else if the Democrats  win the House, but there is still some races in the Senate that are  extremely, extremely close.  Watching Nevada for example, Dean Heller in  Nevada, the seat is up for grabs in State of Arizona between Martha McSally  and Kyrsten Sinema, that's really important to watch.</p><p>So there are look -- they - it looks like there are some real Republican  wins afoot in the Senate but it's still going to be a nail-biter of what?   Eight days from now.  </p><p>CARTER:  No question because you've seen the polling flip, you know, we  were certain things are going one way and then the next week you see that  they're, you know, that same candidate is seven points ahead of somebody  that they were behind.  So, they were going to really have to watch this  case-by-case, moment-by-moment.  And as things are happening, the way that  the candidates, the way that the parties are reacting to these big events,  like the events that happened this weekend.</p><p>The sad, tragic event at the Synagogue this weekend.  The way that people  react to this is going to dictate how people behave.  It really is.  And we  want to heal right and we want to see healers.  We don't want to see finger  pointing.  And so I think that real leadership is tested this week.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  People are shutting down the hate, they don't want it anymore.  </p><p>CARTER:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All of that coming up this hour.  We got a big hour coming up.   But first, this top story this hour and that is earning season is rolling  on.  Largely, we are in the second busiest week of the quarter in terms of  earnings, Apple, Starbucks, General Electric, Facebook and ExxonMobil all  reporting this week.  That will set the tone for markets for sure.  And  we've got the October jobs' report coming out this Friday.</p><p>Expectations call for 190,000 jobs added to economy last month with the  unemployment rate remaining steady at 3.7 percent.  This would be for the  month of October.  Of course, November begins this week.  Joining us now to  talk all economics is JMP Securities President Mark Lehmann.  And Mark, it  is good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>MARK LEHMANN, PRESIDENT, JMP SECURITIES:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on the backdrop for investing right now.   Earnings and this upcoming jobs' report.  What do you expect?</p><p>LEHMANN:  Well, the market has been dominated by news not by earnings as of  -- as October has progressed and obviously last week was not a great week  for the markets and October has been awful month.  I think we're seeing the  futures point a little higher, I think, you know, the VIX trading as high  as it has.  I think -- I think we've seen the highs of the year and the  lows of the year so far.</p><p>And I think we're going to recover a little bit here going into the  election and going into the fourth quarter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So more volatility is what you're -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>LEHMANN:  I think volatility is going to reign supreme.  I think we have a  headline-driven market to date.  I think investors for the first time in a  while are not reacting to some good numbers.  And that tells me something.   We're seeing IPO pricing denigrate, go down a little bit here.  We've seen  some deals that have been cut in half in size and the deals are not really  popping anymore.  We've seen some deals break price.</p><p>SurveyMonkey which is high profile IPO in the third quarter broke price and  sees trading below their IPO price.  Those are warnings science that will  tell you, we'll see a little bit of a tampering of the market but I'm not  worried about the market going in '19, I think better days are still ahead.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The market shook off so much news all year.  Every day there  was something in the news cycle and the news cycle in the month of October  if you look at it versus rest of the year isn't that much different but why  is it that anything going on right now, the markets almost gone hyperbolic  in terms of how they react to it.  </p><p>LEHMANN:  I think you said it well.  I think we shook off a lot of bad  news, and I think we shook off a lot of fear, let's use the China tensions  that we've seen through the year and that continues to be in our backdrop  and I think nobody expects that to end quickly and I think the specter of  more tariffs and more back-and-forth is in front of us.  I think there is  also a question about the tax cuts and results on earnings.</p><p>What that means for comparisons going into '19, we have great comparisons  18 over 17, one of the comparisons looking at '19.  And I just think more  of more of that has grown into the market specter and that specter now is a  little bit more cautious.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You have a major overreaction by investors to a little sliver of  bad news.  We've been talking about sales missing expectations for a  revenue missing expectations for weeks now, but if you look at Amazon and  the Wall Street Journal points this out today, that on Thursday evening, it  posted a record -- a firm with a record third-quarter profit, right?  It  was 11 times more the profit was than the period a year earlier.</p><p>But it sales came up a little bit shorter of expectations.  There were  concerns about the forecast for the holiday season.  But shares fell almost  eight percent on Friday and that S&amp;P was only down 1.7 percent.  Amazon  stock is down 18 percent so far in the month October.  That seems like an  overreaction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But is it enough big since?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is but -- and their concern is evaluation is what happens to  stocks that people deem earlier over value.  But that seems like a bit  much, doesn't it?  </p><p>LEHMANN:  (INAUDIBLE) Saturday night is of exact same thing.  So, what I'll  -- what I'll tell you is --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he is a farmer. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEHMANN:  No, listen.  You're correct.  And I think that's what happens  when markets are tense and we have a very, very tense market.  Stocks down  20 percent or $200 billion from its peak which is kind of an inspiring  number.  But you're right.  People are a little bit nervous.  I think the  guidance that they give and they don't give long range guidance, they give  very short guidance.  Amazon is not one who guides two or three years in  advance.</p><p>And I think they would loathe to go out on a limb here and say things are  perfect.  I don't think that make sense to them.  I also think my money is  on that company and another big tech company is who I really defining  what's going on in this marketplace.  Look at how much Red Hat just got  acquired for because if they want to compete with Amazon web services, does  that Amazon web services is worth 30 percent more than it was worth two  days ago?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is exactly.  And when you start zeroing in where the  growth is, part of the growth story in this economy is cloud computing.   And that's what you've got going on this morning.  IBM acquiring software  and services company Red Hat for $33 billion.  Huge premium, stock is up 50  percent.  It's part of this efforts to boost the could computing services  which Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison told us about last week.</p><p>He emphasized the importance of cloud technology in the future.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  I think computing, I think computing --  cloud computing is going to -- you know, all these data centers that people  have been building are going to gradually wither away and we're going to  have a small number of these huge cloud networks.  And because every other  network looks like that, you know, people don't generate their own  electricity.</p><p>People don't have wells for their own water.  OK.  In a few cases they do,  but in the most case, we use the networks to buy electricity, the network  to buy water, we're going to use network to buy computing and business  applications and information.  This is going to be on handful of clouds and  most of the data is going to be in the Oracle database.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Mark, we know this cloud computing is one of the growth  spots.  You just said something interesting about IPOs, a lot of these  companies that wanted to go public are the pulling back, lowering the  pricing, one broke price.  Does that tell you anything about where growth  is or isn't right now?  What's behind this IPO issue?  </p><p>LEHMANN:  Yes.  I don't think it tells me there is any big fear that the  best and biggest can't go public, what it tells me is the ability for -- I  won't say any company but the companies we've seen to price at this kind of  extraordinary premiums and trade it up as much as they have has been  tempered.  And that's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they stopped because market conditions?  </p><p>LEHMANN:  Market conditions and just because paying the kind of premiums  and paying hand multiples I think -- and that had worked, like you said  that had worked for a very long time.  We saw every single cloud computing  software company up that we took public, it was up 50, 70, 90 percent.   That's going to slow down.  That's fine.  We don't -- we need a little bit  of that tempering.</p><p>I think the greatest -- and we've seen headlines like Lyft and Uber all of  those that may test 2019 IPO market, that's not going to slow that down.   It's going to make other companies think about what's the proper valuation.   You know, my banks recede a little bit on that (INAUDIBLE) and I think  that's OK.  </p><p>CARTER:  So, I think it's something you said that you think that we've seen  the highs and the lows this year.  What makes you think that we've seen  lows?  And what should people be doing with the money right now?  Where  would you like to put it to work?</p><p>LEHMANN:  Well, we've had a couple corrections like this back in the  spring.  If you look at your charts from February and couple months later,  we had this kind of pullbacks that found a level and I think we're getting  close to that.  We've tested the lows of this cycle.  Hopefully, going into  election.  I think people are going to look at what they've owned year-to- date, and surmise the last few weeks they've been selling.</p><p>I still think the growth of the market is in tech and you're seeing the  kind of premium that IBM paid to acquire Red Hat.  You know, the  shareholders of that company who obviously are going to garner huge premium  today making big investments to tech and I think you're going to reanalyze  some of these companies were down 20, 30, 40.  The number of tech companies  in tech correction land are very, very high.</p><p>And I think people are going to take stock that look -- there is lots of  capital on the sidelines.  There's tons of money out for the M&amp;A market.   And now you have a 20 to 50 percent off some of a lot of tech companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the tax cut plan 2.0, the second tax cut plan, will that  resonate with investors?  This weekend, House Ways and Means Committee  Chairman Kevin Brady told me he is, in fact, working on a second tax cut  plan.  Here is what he said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  The  President wants to go even farther.  He's really focused on the middle  class.  He disbelieves they're the ones who get squeezed the most.  He's  asked us and we worked with him on developing another 10 percent.  Middle- class tax cuts for workers and families.  And so we'll be ready to move  with that as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what -- so what you're saying -- I mean, the President sort  of suggested that we were going to hear about this before the midterm  elections.  Obviously, there's nine days left then you're out of session,  you're not going to be voting on this in the next nine days but are you  saying that you're working on an additional 10 percent tax cut perhaps to  be announced and to bring to a vote after midterm elections sometime fourth  quarter?  </p><p>BRADY:  Perhaps but what the President was referring to and I wish some of  his critics would have just simply asked, what he was talking about was  when best do we introduce the bill or nonbinding resolution laying out, our  commitment as Republicans to doing that which we talked about doing  sometime in the next month or so.  But in truth, the lame-duck is so  unpredictable.</p><p>That period between the election in the end of the Congress, it really  common sense tells you this is something that as Republicans retain the  House and Senate that we'll advance in the new Congress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will this resonate with investors get the markets to move  higher or do you think worries about deficits and debt are going to be the  driver for markets?  </p><p>LEHMANN:  It feels the latter to me.  You know, this obviously surprised a  lot of people when the announcement came when the President said it.  I  think the tax cuts as far as I can tell and as far as the pundits that I  read, that hasn't been a winner issue right now for middle class of this  country, saying the second historic tax cut is the middle-class tax cut  tells me that the first tax cut wasn't the tax cuts for the middle class.</p><p>And I think that doesn't resonate I think with investors right now.  That's  what it tells me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I don't think investors are reacting to it at all because  I don't think that it's going to get done quite frankly.  And people are  treating this second tax cut and the new tax cut for the middle class as it  just political talk and not reality.  And if anything, if they really try  to put it -- push it through, it will ignite even more worries about the  debt and the deficit quite frankly.</p><p>President Trump talked about cutting discretionary spending on five  percent, that's ex-defense less than one percent of the Federal budget.  It  doesn't make -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, you know, the problem is spending.  Mark, it's good to see  you.</p><p>LEHMANN:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Mark Lehmann.  Stay with us.  Our jobs in  America coverage Friday morning, 8:00 a.m. Eastern as we identify where the  jobs are.  That's coming up Friday morning.  But first, the nation is in  mourning this morning.  The latest details on the Pittsburgh Synagogue  attack as the suspect is due in court today.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The president just tweeted this.  Here it is,  \"There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate, and even  fraudulent reporting of the news.  The fake news media, the true enemy of  the people must stop the open and obvious hostility and report the news  accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and  outrage.  And we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and  harmony.  Fake news must end.\"  Writes the president.</p><p>Meanwhile, there is this tragedy at the Tree of Life synagogue, and the  mourning continues.  Thousands attending a vigil honoring the victims of  the massacre.  11 people were killed, six others were injured.  The suspect  is set to appear in court today.  Fox News' David Lee Miller is live in  Pittsburgh this morning with more.  David, good morning to you.</p><p>DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  The U.S.  Attorney here in Pittsburgh has now started the process to seek the death  penalty for 46-year-old Robert Bowers.  Ultimately, that's a decision that  is going to rest with the Attorney General Jeff Sessions.</p><p>Now, among other things, Bowers is charged with a hate crime, obstructing  exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death.  He also faces 11 state  counts of homicide.  And as you mentioned, at 1:30 this afternoon, he is  going to make his initial court appearance here in Pittsburgh.  It will be  before a federal magistrate.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pittsburgh continues to grieve and recover from the tragedy.   Last night, thousands turned out for an interfaith prayer vigil.  And now,  for the first time, survivors of the massacre are speaking out.</p><p>Barry Werber, who was only feet away from the shooter inside the synagogue  miraculously went unnoticed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARRY WERBER, SURVIVOR, SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING:  He didn't see us.  Thank God.   The only thing I had in my hand was the cell phone and it's a dumb phone,  so it doesn't light up when I'm talking on it.</p><p>I could see that he looked around only because there was a shaft of light  as he opened the door.  He stepped over Mel's body, didn't pay any  attention, step back and walked out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MILLER:  On Sunday, authorities released the names of all 11 people who  died.  Among them we are told, there were at eight men and three women.   They range in age from 54 to 97 years old.  There were two brothers, as  well as a married couple.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very sad to look at and to re-talk about the statement.  Thank  you, David Lee Miller, in Pittsburgh this morning.</p><p>Coming up, taking on technology, Google and Facebook may face billions of  dollars in new taxes.  We got the details there, coming up.  And Elon Musk  versus the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Why the CEO of Tesla now  says, $20 million fine against his company, it was all worth it.  Later  this hour, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  All 189 passengers and crew on board a Lion Air  passenger jet are feared dead this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the  details.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Maria, rescue officials  in Indonesia finding some human remains.  As one of those officials  predicts there will be no survivors from this.  The brand-new Lion Air  Boeing 737 crashed into the Java Sea of the Indonesian coast.</p><p>The plane went down just minutes after taking off from Jakarta for an  island off of Sumatra.  The Transportation Ministry, says the pilot had  asked for permission to return to the Jakarta Airport before the plane was  lost on radar.</p><p>In addition to the human remains that were found, search and rescue crews  have also found I.D. cards, personal belongings, and aircraft debris.  This  is the first known crash of the newer version of the 737.</p><p>While the Florida man accused of sending at least 14 pipe bombs to  prominent Democrats is said to make his first court appearance in Miami  today.  56-year-old Cesar Sayoc is facing five federal charges and up to 48  years in prison.</p><p>He was arrested Friday, four days after the first package was found in New  York.  Single fingerprint led to the FBI -- led the FBI to his arrest.   U.S. marshals are expected to transfer Sayoc to New York City, where the  Justice Department wants to trial him in the U.S. Attorney's Southern  District.</p><p>Well, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will not be seeking re-election as  party chairwoman.  She has been Germany's leader since 2005.  She told  leaders of her Christian Democratic Union Party that she wants to remain  Chancellor only until 2021 when the next federal election is due.  And this  comes after her party lost significant ground in yesterday's regional  elections in Germany.</p><p>Well, Google and Facebook could soon be hit with major tax hikes.  The Wall  Street Journal reports dozens of countries are stepping up efforts to levy  new taxes on technology giants.  They're hoping to capture revenue as  economic activity increasingly shifts to online.</p><p>South Korea, India and, at least, seven other Asia-Pacific countries are  exploring these new taxes as our Mexico, Chile, and other Latin American  countries.  Take a look at shares of Facebook and Google, they're higher in  the pre-market, Maria.</p><p>But you know, the IMF warned about the economies of emerging markets having  problems.  I guess this is their fix.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, right.  Now, go where the money is, right.  Cheryl, thank  you.  Coming up, countdown to the midterm elections.  We break down how the  economy may impact decisions for voters, coming up.</p><p>And then, an incredible win for the Boston Red Sox yesterday, the  highlights from the World Series all here, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 29th, your  top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Personal income and  spending reports just hitting the tape.  Personal income, coming out now,  not a major market reaction but we are just getting the numbers right here,  and we are awaiting these numbers.  It has not typically been a market  mover.  Markets are up 151 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as  you can see.  Personal income up was two-tenths of a percent versus an  estimate of up three-tenths of a percent.</p><p>Meanwhile, personal spending, is up four-tenths of a percent versus an  expected increase of four-tenths, so it is right in line with the  estimates.  Futures, as you can see, trading higher this morning.  Dow  Industrials up 164 points, that's two-thirds of one percent.  S&amp;P500 is up  better than one percent, and the NASDAQ up 1-1/4 percent on the morning  this morning.  Futures indicating a pretty good opening for the Broader  Averages after a tough week last week.  </p><p>European indices also higher this morning.  Take a look at European indices  with the FTSE100 higher by 141 points, that's better than two percent --  this is the high of the morning right here.  Things have been improving all  morning.  CAC Quarante in Paris is up 1-1/4 percent and the Dax, in  Germany, up better than two percent right now.  As we said, personal income  up two-tenths of a percent versus three-tenths of a percent; and personal  spending right in line with the estimates, up four-tenths of one percent.   Asian markets overnight -- and futures, as you can see, are higher.  Asian  markets overnight, were mostly lower.  As you can see, with the exception  of Hong Kong up a fraction; Shanghai Composite down better than two percent  overnight.  </p><p>Voting to the right.  Brazil electing a conservative candidate, who some  have compared to President Trump.  Of course, the alternative was the  socialist candidate.  We're breaking it all down for you this morning.  </p><p>The $20 million tweet.  Why Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the tweet that cost  him all that money was actually worth it.  </p><p>Plus, Boston's big win.  The Red Sox beating the L.A. Dodgers to the take  the World Series yesterday.  We have all the highlights in sports.  </p><p>And then, place your bets.  Details on the latest sports team to strike a  sport gambling deal, coming up this morning as well.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this morning, as we continue.  President Trump  just tweeting on Brazil's election, meanwhile, here is what he said, the  president: \"Had a very good conversation with newly elected president of  Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, who won his race by a substantial margin.  We  agreed Brazil and the United States will work closely together on trade,  military, and everything else.  Excellent call.  Wished him  congratulations,\" says the president.  All that coming up, on Brazil.  </p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour: 8 days to go until the midterm  elections.  President Trump, has been hitting the campaign trail every day  to rally before the midterms.  The recent economic swings put at forefront  for voters.  Joining us now, is Douglas Holtz-Eaken, he is former CBO  Director from a McCain Economic Advisory and American Action Forum  President.  Douglas, good to see you.  Thanks for joining us this morning.  </p><p>DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKEN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM:  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your outlook for the midterms, Doug?  </p><p>EAKEN:  Well, I think I don't know much more than the experts.  And they  suggest that the Republicans are going to lose control of the House, the  Democrats will control the House.  Republicans could pick up a seat in the  Senate and that will leave us with a Congress that probably won't have the  ability to get a whole lot of legislation done over the next few years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean if you were to see, the Democrats take the House  which is largely expected, does the agenda that the president has been  putting out, come to a halt?  </p><p>EAKEN:  It looks that way to me.  It's very unlikely that they're going to  pass anything to make the tax cuts permanent for example, which is going to  be a very good idea.  I don't see any real hope for further legislation  other than, you know, getting the spending bills done, and that's keeping  the government running, and that could run into something difficult.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I want to talk about this spending and these tax cuts  because I know that you've been a deficit hawk and we want to talk about  where we are in terms the debt and deficits, but we are looking at a  potential tax break for middle class which is in the works.  Pennsylvania  Congressman Scott Perry joined us earlier, he said he's in favor of more  tax cuts, congress needs to focus on less spending first, listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. SCOTT PERRY (R), PENNSYLVANIA:  You don't fix your overspending  problem by taxing people more, you fix that by spending less, and so that's  what we really need to focus on.  The president, offered a budget that  spent less and we didn't take much or any of it up being.  As a matter of  fact, the tax proposal that House sent, the Senate, I think, saved $400  billion, but yet the Senate sent it back with a trillion dollars additional  spending.  And unfortunately, to get something that allows the people to  keep more what they earned has to make it through Senate as so long as  that's full of liberal folks that don't want to cut spending, we're going  to have this problem.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, Doug, can they stop spending?  Or cut down on  spending?  </p><p>EAKEN:  There's no evidence to that so far.  No evidence so far.  I mean,  you and I had this conversation before.  They're concentrating on the  annual spending which is a third of the budget.  No one is even talking  about the two-thirds of the budget that's growing at -- you know, growth  rates for the next 10 years of six percent for Social Security, 5.8 for  Medicare, 5.2 for Medicaid.  </p><p>Those are enormous growth rates, they have to come down, that's where the  money is and there's no conversation about that.  So, I'm sympathetic to  the idea that we need a tax code that's permanent, this idea with of  temporary tax cuts from the middle class makes no sense.  They could do  some things that are built on the success last December, but they really do  have to get serious on the spending side, and they haven't.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, so, where are the opportunities to spend less?  Let's talk  about that, because you know, Maya MacGuineas form the Committee for  Responsible Budget is saying that the budget is in an unsustainable long- term trajectory.  She writes, the federal debt already high and rising.   The country's fiscal outlook in medium and long terms are both extremely  troubling.  And they're looking at long term outlook, where is the  opportunity to cut spending, Doug?  </p><p>EAKEN:  Well, for the record, Maya is a crazy optimist -- it's a little  worse than that, in my view.  So, look, it's not complicated.  The Social  Security program, for example, is promising to cut benefits across the  board by 25 percent, for people in retirement, in 12 years when it runs out  of money.  That's a terrible way to run a pension program.  So, we should  fix Social Security, we should fix Social Security right now.  </p><p>There have been six or seven bipartisan commissions that put together  proposals to get that done.  That should be the number one objection for  anybody.  Why would we want to have something that retirees can't count on?   Then you move over to the next big ones: Medicare and Medicaid.  Those are  programs that don't serve the beneficiaries very well at all.  I mean, we  know that our seniors don't get the health outcomes that other country  seniors do, yet we spend so much money, indeed it has an unrestricted draw  in the U.S. Treasury.  </p><p>So, the first thing to do is put those programs on budget, make them live  within a finite amount of money and serve the beneficiaries.  And then, we  can just move across the board, go to the farm programs, go to annual  spending.  There's lots of waste in there.  And really, get serious about  running these programs effectively.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you need courage to be able to come out during an election  year, and say, we're cutting back on your Social Security checks and your  pension.  But, clearly, you've got to go where money is.  And then, there  is this global market worrying over trade and tariffs, Senator Ron Johnson  told me on Sunday that the president should keep the pressure on China  since they pose more than just an economic threat, but is tariffs the  answer?  Here's what he said, Doug, listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SEN. RON JOHNSON (R), WISCONSIN:  Let's face it, China has been stealing  hundreds of billions of dollars-worth of our industrial secrets, as well as  our military secrets, and that is really, I think, the biggest threat that  we face in terms of our relationship with China.  </p><p>I think the good news is because of public awareness, the gap between those  on offense and those of us on defense, is quite honestly narrowing.  And  hopefully, if we have a unified rest of the world when it comes to trade  and our dealings with China, we'll discipline them to begin -- you know,  really, adhering to norms of the rest of the world trading system.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your take, Doug, is China going to adhere to the norms -- the  rules of the world on the global basis or not?  </p><p>EAKEN:  Not without a lot of pressure.  I think China really does not  understand how far it is out of line with acceptable behavior.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  </p><p>EAKEN:  I think the important phrase there with Senator Johnson was a  \"unified world,\" I don't think we have that.  The administration has  correctly identified China as problem, has been very aggressive in a  bilateral fashion and trying to get China to change this behavior, that's  been utterly unsuccessful.  I think it will be unsuccessful but acting  alone.  The key is to get a multilateral approach where all of our key  allies in Europe, and in Japan, and in other parts of the world agree to  enforce better discipline on China.  That's not happening right now, that's  the missing piece in this strategy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I wonder if as he continues to do trade deals and confirms  these deals with others, like a deal with E.U., you know, like when the new  president in Mexico gets into place where you as actually see the commerce  back-and-forth from the new USMCA deal, will that bring these countries  together in a unified front against China?  </p><p>EAKEN:  It may, but it's a big if.  They are the -- negotiated USMCA has a  provision that says: \"Anyone who signs this cannot negotiate a free trade  agreement with nonmarket economy,\" aimed directly at China.  So, that makes  sense.  If you can get to those deals in place, and I'll point out, Canada  and Mexico haven't signed that deal yet, there's been a lot of talk about  it, but there's no signature, and it still -- we have to go through  Congress as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>EAKEN:  Going -- getting a deal with Europe takes time.  So, all of these  things are very time-consuming, and quite frankly, China has a much greater  capacity, just wait us out.  President Xi is a president for life, their  capacity to directly intervene in the economy is enormous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>EAKEN:  And so, I worry about the time tables here, and I worry about  whether there's enough pressure from enough countries to get things moving  quickly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll be watching that.  Doug, it's always a pleasure to  see you, thanks so much.  </p><p>EAKEN:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Douglas Holtz-Eaken joining us there.  Stay with Fox Business  for a special midterm election coverage, it begins on November 6, at 7:00  p.m. Eastern, we are all hands-on deck.  And then the next morning,  MORNINGS WITH MARIA will start an hour early at 5:00 a.m. Eastern, that's  on November 7th.  So, join us, as we bring you all the results from  midterms.</p><p>First, though, Elon Musk is firing back.  Why the Tesla CEO says 20- million-dollar fine against this his company was, well, it was worth,  straight ahead.  Then Brazil's next president; Stuart Varney weighs in on  the country's elections back in a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Check out Tesla shares up this morning as CEO  Elon Musk brushes off worries about an investigation into the infamous  funding secure tweet.  Susan Li is on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange with details there.  Good morning, Susan.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria.  That is  right, the Tesla's CEO, well, still CEO, Elon Musk, says it was worth it,  the $20 million in fines that he had to pay and Tesla had to pay for those  tweets back in August, when he said funding was secured, he was taking the  company private and that was at $420.  </p><p>Well, don't forget, the SEC, of course, a part of that settlement says that  Elon Musk, if he's going to tweet about Tesla, he has to go through the  company's communications channels, so not sure if he's adhering to those  procedures but he did say late on Friday after that tweet, less than an  hour later, he says he's going to take a few days off the Twittersphere.</p><p>OK.  Let's also talk about Wal-Mart.  And I guess in this case, what Amazon  can do, Wal-Mart will try to do better if they can, so they are launching  their own cashier-less stores.  They're testing something called Sam's Club  Now, that will open in Dallas next week.  They told us about this back in  June, and it's pretty much similar to what Amazon Go is doing.  So, they're  employing mobile checkout, camera-like systems for inventory management,  and I guess, they're still playing catchup to Amazon at this point.  Back  to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Susan, thank you.  We are watching markets today.   We'll be watching you with a big rally expected at the opening of trading.   Meanwhile, Brazil's next president, big story, conservative candidate Jair  Bolsonaro is claiming victory this morning in his country's election.   Joining us now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  Good  morning to you, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Look, I  don't think that the election of Jair Bolsonaro is going to have that much  effect on our daily lives in America or our economy or our market, but it  really is another marker on an extraordinarily populist trend.  I think it  started with Brexit, it continued with the election of Donald Trump in  November 2016, then it's the five-star movement in Italy, a populist  movement, which runs Italy, and which may well break up the European Union.   And now, Brazil, it's the largest country in Latin America, 210 million  Brazilians, the largest economy in Latin America, and it's going to be run  by a conservative.  This is quite something.  So, it's in with the new,  which seems to be populism, and out with the old.  I'm sure you've reported  it, Maria, but Angela Merkel, she's stepping down as the leader of her  party, and will try to finish out her term as Chancellor of Germany.  But  whether she makes that or not is another story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  She is out, and the populists in Brazil, Italy, America, elsewhere  are in.  What a trend.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- I think it's also important to note that look what  the alternative was, Stu, if you didn't vote in Brazil for Bolsonaro, you  were voting for a socialist.  So, once again, socialism was tested here.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're looking at socialism sort of testing the waters across  the world.  People are not having it.</p><p>VARNEY:  I wonder if it has an implication for our elections in eight days  here.  After all, the Democrats could be characterized as moving rapidly  towards socialism, and President Trump, you could characterize him as a  populist, if you like.  That's the contest that we face in eight days'  time.  I just wonder if these worldwide trends will play out here, all over  again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It really seems like it is taking a hold across the  world.  In people -- in places you didn't expect like Italy, as you  mentioned.  </p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stu, I know you're going to have a lot more in 10 minutes.  We  will see you then.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour  9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Do not miss Stuart after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  </p><p>But first, there's this, hockey's new bet, details on the partnership  between the New Jersey Devils and sports book operator William Hill.  Back  in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  So, the New Jersey Devils getting into the legal  gambling business.  The NHL team making a multi-year deal with William  Hill, to provide legalized gambling inside the Prudential Center, where  they play.  Joining us now is the CEO of William Hill U.S., Joe Asher.   Joe, great to see you this morning, thanks so much for being here.</p><p>JOE ASHER, CEO, WILLIAM HILL U.S.:  Hey, good morning.  Nice to be with  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, congratulations.!  This has been a long-term investment for  William Hill, right?</p><p>ASHER:  Well, it is.  You know, we've been working towards the day when  sports betting would become legal outside Nevada, and of course, that day  came about five months ago when the Supreme Court overturned the federal  law that had prevented that.  And we are going to New Jersey pretty shortly  thereafter, and recently announced the deal with the Devils and we're  excited about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much -- what kind of revenue are you talking about?  What  are you expecting in terms of the revenue that this will bring in?</p><p>ASHER:  Well, across the country, I mean, you're looking at a market that  the estimates are somewhere between 150 to $400 billion in the amount  waged; figured about five or six percent that comes into revenue.  So, it's  a substantial market across the country, but of course, that's going to  develop over a period of years, as states begin to legalize sports betting  at the state level.  You know, the Supreme Court basically turned the issue  back to the states.  States like Delaware, NEW Jersey, Mississippi, West  Virginia got going quickly, and others are in the process, and it will  develop over the next few years.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Joe, Mitch Roschelle, good morning.  Is the plan to expand  across multiple states or is the plan in New Jersey to expand in the State  of New Jersey?</p><p>ASHER:  Well, our plan, of course, is to do both, Mitch.  We've opened  already at about a dozen locations in Mississippi, one in West Virginia.   We're gearing up to get going in the not too distant future in Pennsylvania  and in Rhode Island.  And in New Jersey, we've just opened up our third  retail location, but also in New Jersey, you can bet online by just  downloading the app in the App Store, and you can bet from anywhere within  the state, but you do have to be present within the State of New Jersey in  that case to place your bets.  You know, out here in Nevada, you've been  able to bet on sports for decades, and you go into a casino, you sign up  for your mobile account here in the State of Nevada and then you can bet  anywhere within the state.  Right now, we do about two-thirds of our  business on mobile.</p><p>CARTER:  So, you're just betting on the -- you know, you're at -- you're at  a Devils game, you're just betting on that game or can you bet on all  sports?  Can you tell me a little bit about what it's like for them?</p><p>ASHER:  Sure, you can bet -- you can bet on all sports within the -- within  the State of New Jersey.  Just like, you know, like I was at the Golden  Knights game here in Las Vegas last night, really, really exciting game and  they do a great job there, but not only were people betting on the Golden  Knights game, they're betting on other hockey games that are going on.  And  now, of course, this is a busy time in the sporting calendar, last night,  you had the last game of the World Series, basketball is getting going,  we're in the middle of football season.  So, there's a lot of -- there's a  lot going on in the sporting calendar, which makes it a busy time of the  year for us.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joe, it's Dagen McDowell, name a sport that people might be  surprised that people bet on so much.  Like -- go ahead.</p><p>ASHER:  No, I was going to say one of -- one of the big -- so, right now,  we do about -- here in Nevada, we do about 37 percent of our business on  what we call \"in-play sports,\" or betting after the game has started.  The  number one sport for in-play by far is Major League Baseball, because the  pace of the game is so conducive to it.  But also, tennis is a -- is a big  game that -- or a big sport for in-play wagering.</p><p>LEE:  I would not expect tennis.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But people -- but again, it's -- because it's only two  players, and/or in singles as two players, you can see if somebody looks  fatigued.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Has gotten inside of their own head.  And so, that's when you  place in in-play bet maybe.</p><p>ASHER:  Oh, you know, it's got --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) from experience.</p><p>ASHER:  Yes, you know, look, it allows you to take a bigger game then chop  it down into a much shorter interval.  So, for instance, in baseball,  people like to bet will there be run scored in the next inning, yes or no.   There's an actual break period in between innings, and we'll have people  bet substantial sums of moment just on the next inning.  You're taking a  three-hour game, you're chopping it down to a 20-minute game.  Tennis, same  sort of thing, people will bet set by set or game by game, and you're  taking a longer event and chopping it down into a much shorter event so  people can make their bet, know whether they won or loss in a short period  of time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very cool.  Joe, great to have you, thanks so much.  We'll be  watching.</p><p>ASHER:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joe Asher, joining us there.  Coming up, final thoughts from  this all-star panel.  Stay with us.  Back in moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Lee  Carter.</p><p>CARTER:  I am looking forward to seeing how this week plays out in polling  coming out to the midterms.  I think that this week could surprise us all,  and I think it's going to be a week that's going to lean Republican.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really?  All right.</p><p>CARTER:  They do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Eight days away from the Midterms.  Mitch?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The Fed's preferred inflation measure, PCE, just came out, it's  still flat at two percent which is the Fed's target.  So, let's see if the  Fed holds off and doesn't continue to raise rates.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do we need a rate hike in December, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Exactly. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jon Hilsenrath has co-wrote an article in the Wall Street  Journal that starts at \"What If That Was as Good as It Gets In Terms of the  Economy?\"  Well, we're looking at 3.1 percent wage growth coming up this  Friday for last month, that would be the best in 9-1/2 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is good stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Have a great day, everybody.  Go seize the day!   Dagen McDowell, Mitch Roschelle, Lee Carter, great to see you.  Let's get  right to Stuart.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it  away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

It's Monday, August 12th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">U.S.-China trade turmoil, Goldman Sachs warning the risk of recession rising due to ongoing trade battle and that a deal is not expected before the 2020 election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures are showing a lower open of 157 point loss on the Dow futures. this after the Dow, Nasdaq and S&amp;P closed lower for the second week in a row. You see the losses across the board, much turmoil in the markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Europe you have selling as well in England, France and Germany.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets mixed there. In China the yuan was once again set weaker than 7 yuan per U.S. dollar for the third day in a row. The Hang Seng down as protests continue in Hong Kong. The Nikkei closed for a holiday.</p><p>From friend to foe -- major tech companies calling California home but now that very same state's lawmakers are going after these giants.</p><p>Oil in focus, Saudi-state owned oil giant reporting a decline in profits due to falling oil prices but looking to diversify as it prepares for an IPO.</p><p>Plus housing in America -- a look at the markets that are red hot. The locations might surprise you.</p><p>Here to break it all down this morning: radio, host New Leader senior fellow, Fox News contributor Richard Fowler; pollster and Maslansky &amp; Partners president Lee Carter; and PWC Partner Mitch Roschelle.</p><p>Welcome one and all.</p><p>Mitch -- what are you watching for this week. we do have some news here in the U.S. Consumer prices, we get that I think on Tuesday; retail sales, Walmart earnings are on Thursday. Will anything change the mood in the markets which is one of grave concern I should say about the global economy?</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: If those numbers come out, inflations low and retail sales are strong I think it's going to reinforce the notion that our consumer-dependent economy is still strong. However, every day that goes by where there's lack of clarity as to what is going to happen with the China deal and we continue to get bad news about other countries around the world, I think that's going to continue to put pressure on our markets.</p><p>GDP in the U.K. was negative, they came out a couple of days ago last week. So I think their markets are going to be continuing to be very defensive worrying about what's going on around the world.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And $15 trillion in government debt that has a negative yield on it.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And there's actually -- could be as much as $5 trillion more of non-government debt that's indexed to the government debt.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. Banks hard hit last week and you saw the bank stocks fall and money just flood out of exchange-traded funds.</p><p>Lee, what are you watching in terms of the consumer and how people are feeling? Because you do -- you have this unusual convergence of the rhetoric from the campaign trail and from the President and then the negative news that's showing up in the markets. And I just wonder if that ultimately has an impact on sentiment.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: Yes. I think that when you're looking at consumer confidence right now, it's an all-time high. When you look at the Democrat candidates and they're trying to tell the American people how bad the economy is right now. So Elizabeth Warren over the weekend was really tweeting about this kind of thing. When we have evidence right now that people can look to to support the Democrats' assertions.</p><p>So you could day is the economy as strong? Are we going into recession. Look at weakness in the markets. The Democrats are going to have some points now that they can drive home and I think it's going to resonate with voters.</p><p>so I think that it's a really dangerous place for Republicans to be in. I think they have to take it very seriously and look at how this is going to play out meantime (ph).</p><p>RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think Lee is absolutely right. I think what you have to look at is the overall marketplaces. As for consumers, yes, the economy is doing well. They know it's doing well. We saw the wages uptick a little bit but the problem with that is that everything around wages, everything you your wages to pay for has gone up, whether it be housing, whether it be prescription drug costs, whether it be any early childhood education.</p><p>All these costs have gone up for working families. So when now the economy's pointing to these indicators, I think these indicators are already there, and the American worker has already experienced --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But overall inflation -- that's actually the problem, that overall inflation is rock bottom. So you, from a political perspective, pick out things that people get upset about like prescription drugs. But again, over all, consumer prices --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: But (INAUDIBLE) are down. You know the cost of the television is down.</p><p>And (INAUDIBLE) stays down gasoline --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Gas is one thing that is still very -- the gasoline price is very much in check and that's kind of one thing that is a point -- a sore spot for people when gas starts going up.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: You know, when you're talking about CPI, they often ship out food and energy. But right now food and energy are down.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. We will have more coming up. But right now China trade in focus. Negotiations between the world's two largest economies at a standstill as President Trump suggests the next round of talks with China maybe called off.</p><p>Goldman Sachs now worrying that the trade fight could trigger a recession and says it does not expect a deal with China before the 2020 election.</p><p>USMCA also on pause, that's the Canada-Mexico-U.S. trade deal as Democrats delay the vote.</p><p>Maria spoke exclusively with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" asking him about the sticking points for a trade truce with China and the likelihood of adopting USMCA.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Can the President do a deal with China without the promise that these things will be reversed?</p><p>STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: They have really been taking American innovation for free for 10 or 15 years. Trump is stopping that. And that's you see the so-called elites on Wall Street in corporate America keep saying the sky is falling, the sky is falling.</p><p>I think President Trump has got them. He's got all the face cards right now. He holds all the cards. I think he's being very consistent.</p><p>Look, this is an economic war the Chinese have been at the United States. It's got a technology part. It's got a currency part. It's got a trade part.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BANNON: President Trump has done I think a very solid job.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's your take on whether or not Nancy Pelosi brings USMCA to the floor and will the President be successful in these other trade deals with European nations?</p><p>BANNON: President Trump I think has cut good deal here. He's accommodated both of these nations particularly got this content situation in Mexico. So China can't game the system and send their products through Mexico. It's a deal that works for people, works for the farmers.</p><p>I don't know how Nancy Pelosi holds this back, anything but partisan politics.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joining me now Ohio Congressman House Financial Services Committee, member of the Republican Study, Committee and Second Amendment Caucus Warren Davidson. Congressman -- good to see you.</p><p>What are your expectations for getting the passage of USMCA, but also this U.S.-China trade deal -- which the markets are saying you better get it done and get it done fast.</p><p>REP. WARREN DAVIDSON (R-OH): Hey -- Dagen. Thank you for the questions. Thanks for covering the issue. I mean trade is vitally important to Ohio and to the nation.</p><p>So, you know, prior to coming to Congress, I was in manufacturing 15 years on the receiving end of bad trade policy. And when President Trump talked about getting after fixing our trade agreements, enthusiasm. I mean just a tremendous amount of support from the country from this sector. And we're still expecting great things.</p><p>And with USMCA you can see we have a great agreement. We just need to get it across the finish line. I expect it'll have to be voted on in September, maybe early mid-October at the latest.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But business investment has weakened in the most recent quarter, actually turning negative. You have factory activity has slowed for several months in a row. Manufacturing was, you know, the great manufacturing renaissance last year, but that being hit by these trade negotiations. How long can the manufacturing companies and the very employees withstand these negotiations?</p><p>DAVIDSON: Well, I think with the investment -- that's the biggest reason we need some kind of certainty. So when I spoke with the President we were talking about how to move USMCA agreement across the finish line, we were talking about look at steel stocks, for example. They're more profitable than they've been but yet their share prices, the public-traded companies are down.</p><p>And that's not because of the cash flow or normal economic models. It's just people know that this could change maybe with one tweet. So we really need to get a law on the books, some kind of certainty that would say markets can know where they are heading., whether that's a 20 percent tariff, a 200 percent tariff or zero percent tariff. That certainly will help market settle.</p><p>And when I talk to the biggest companies, they say look, you know, we go into annual planning here in the fall and we all, we're looking at, you know, regulatory reform, tax reform, invest, grow, put the capital to work here in America but the uncertainty on trade is causing them to pause and say, I don't know, where do we put it to work. And so I think it's a real factor that does need addressed.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's turn to gun regulation in the aftermath of the shootings in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio. Former vice president and 2020 hopeful Joe Biden writing an op-ed in the \"New York Times\" calling for a renewal of the ban on so-called assault weapons. It's titled \"Banning Assault Weapons Works\".</p><p>\"That's why as president I will push to ban them again.\" It reads in part, \"I fought hard to expand the assault weapons and high capacity magazines banned in 2004. The Republicans who allowed these laws to expire asserted that they were ineffective. But almost 15 years after the bans expired with the unfortunate benefit of hindsight, we now know that they did make a difference. The 1194 assault weapons and high-capacity magazines bans worked. If I'm elected president, we're going to pass them again and this time we will make them even stronger.\"</p><p>Congressman -- your reaction to that, because this -- Vice President Biden is saying this, but is this really on deck something for Congress to tackle?</p><p>DAVIDSON: Well, I'm speaking to you from Dayton, Ohio, so really the whole region still reeling from the, you know, horrible events here. And really thankful for the tremendous amount of support we've received from all over the country.</p><p>And when you look at the solving problems, you want to make sure that you do cause and effect, right. So people structure these logical fallacies and say this is what caused it, that's what caused it.</p><p>Well, the shooter is what caused it, we need to focus on what is the root cause that's changing in shooters. The assault rifle ban, if you looked at murders in the U.S., the long-term mean is about 13,000. Murders are actually trending down over the long term. But mass shootings are going up.</p><p>On average it's about 300 murdered by rifles per year. So truly if you we wanted to reduce murders by firearm in a year, you would -- you would look at handguns which are about two-thirds of the problem.</p><p>So when you look at trying to solve this, you know, the data just doesn't show that this is what's the issue. But yes, people say these things have a great capacity to inflict more -- more harm, more casualties faster, but it really isn't being done.</p><p>Thankfully with all the assault rifles as they're defined all over the country, they're mostly sitting in gun safes causing no harms to anyone and then used actively by enthusiasts.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well Congressman -- would you get behind, I will say strengthened (ph) background checks because, again, unlicensed firearm sellers say at gun shows and online there aren't backgrounds in some cases performed with those sales, would you get behind basically requiring background checks for any sale of weapon in the U.S. say for like an exchange between relatives?</p><p>DAVIDSON: I don't think -- you talk about hypotheticals, but I don't think I've seen language that I can support on that.</p><p>I mean, so one, let's be clear, background checks are already required including for online sales. So while you can buy from an online vender the firearm has to be shipped to a Federal Firearm's License holder and that FFL holder has to do a background check to transfer the firearm.</p><p>So when you look at what this would really get after would be private sales where there would be a (INAUDIBLE) to saying if you want to sell your car, well, you can't sell it, you have to go to a dealer to a dealer to sell it.</p><p>And I get there are different things, but it really is a tremendous change in the scope of the law. And most people agree that the only way to truly make that effective is to have a firearms registration protocol. Some people support that, most -- most Second Amendment supporters do not.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman -- good to see you. Thank you so much -- Congressman Warren Davidson. Take care.</p><p>Coming up, the world's biggest money manager Blackrock adds \"Sports Illustrated\" to its portfolio. Details on the multimillion dollar deal.</p><p>Plus the housing market, red hot in some parts of the U.S., the surprising places that are seeing a boom straight ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A marine killed in combat in Iraq identified overnight.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has the details -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Well, Dagen -- gunnery Sergeant Scott Koppenhafer died from enemy fire on Saturday. He was advising Iraqi security forces there. The 35-year-old from Colorado joined the Marine Corps in 2005, earned several honors including bronze stars and the title of Marine Special Operator of the Year. Koppenhafer leaves behind a wife and two children. He's the first American service member to die in combat in Iraq so far this year.</p><p>Well, Blackrock is adding \"Sports Illustrated\" to its portfolio -- the world's biggest money manager taking and $875 million stake in Authentic Brands. This makes it the company's largest shareholder.</p><p>Authentic Brands, you may not know this, they own \"Sports Illustrated\", Nine West shoes, Aeropostale and similar brands. This values Authentic at more than $4 billion. That includes debt, we should add. There is Blackrock's year to date for you.</p><p>Finally you can never have enough news about mac and cheese. Chick-Fil-A is now serving it nationwide as of today. This is the first time the restaurants offered a new permanent side dish since 2016. Chick-Fil-A mac and cheese really nice gooey blend of cheddar, parmesan, Romano. The chain also offering its frosted caramel coffee today. That's coffee, vanilla ice cream desert with some caramel syrup in there.</p><p>I just thought I would talk about mac and cheese and a lot of sweet things at 7:18 in the morning, New York time.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know what? Thank you -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're talking about it because again, people making disparaging remarks about Senator Cory Booker because he's a vegan, right. And so we did a little research online to find out what Senator Booker was eating at the Iowa state fair and apparently it was a fried peanut butter and jelly sandwich and some fried pickles.</p><p>CARTER: Sounds like a smart choice, right.</p><p>FOWLER: I would eat both of those things.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Who did the best job, you think at the Iowa State Fair. I know you were watching over the weekend. Do want to call out somebody in terms of really being able to connect with the people?</p><p>FOWLER: That's a good question. I mean I think the soap box thing is always if you have to do it, it's the next. And I thought Joe Biden did very well with the crowd outside the gaffe. And I also think that Senator Booker did really well as well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What were you going to say -- Lee.</p><p>CARTER: I'm all about Andrew Yang -- because I think there's somebody who is grabbing headlines that nobody's expecting too. Everybody is looking at Biden, I don't think it changed anybody's minds. I think Andrew Yang is gaining so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And he got an endorsement on Twitter inadvertently from Elon Musk over the weekend.</p><p>CARTER: Right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So there you go. But I don't like when -- you know what? You can disagree with Senator Booker's politics and his policies. But don't shame him because he chooses not to eat animals. Again friends not food.</p><p>CARTER: But I also love that --</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>CARTER: -- in the article that he ordered another one. He had one bite and he's like said this is good, let me order another one.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Exactly.</p><p>CARTER: Love not.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So he's not in the health camp. He's just in the I don't eat animals camp. I think Tulsi Gabbard is either a vegetarian or a vegan too. Just saying.</p><p>Coming up, oil in focus. Saudi state-owned oil giant reporting a decline in profit but is looking to diversify as it prepares to go public.</p><p>Plus big tech in focus. Lawmakers in California considering a bill that forces Google to answer some tough questions. We take a look later this hour.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back.</p><p>Oil under pressure. Down again morning below $54 a barrel. Prices moving lower in the midst of a trade dispute -- our trade dispute with China not only the U.S. but really worldwide. The International Energy Agency last week lowering its forecast for global oil demand for the third time in four months.</p><p>Joining us now, OPIS, that's the Oil Price Information Service energy analysis global head -- I got it all -- Tom Kloza. Tom -- good to see you.</p><p>TOM KLOZA, ENERGY ANALYSIS GLOBAL HEAD, OIL PRICE INFORMATION SERVICE: Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What is going on with oil right now? Demand versus supply and what about the direction of this?</p><p>KLOZA: Well, demand versus supply is a little bit of a head fake. We are definitely seeing global demand exceed global supply and will probably see that for the next few months or so. The problem is that trading community recognizes that in 2020 that gets reversed. And we have more supply than we have demand.</p><p>And you throw in the downdrafts, almost like wind sheer from trade war and so forth. And you do have these revisions in downward demand growth for mostly emerging countries. So we thought that prices were going to be close to $70 right now, we are about $12 short of that and it doesn't look as though the investment community which really accounts for most of the movement in crude oil. It does not look as though they will be seduced into buying something they think might go to $70 but then go to $60.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Tom, what does that mean for the domestic production that we have because you say that it's stalled, is that temporary or permanent because I'm thinking about our own economy which is dependent upon those jobs that are created in domestic production?</p><p>KLOZA: I think it's temporary. We are going to see U.S. production probably surpass 13 million barrels a day next year. It was probably about 5, 5.5 back during 2011, 2012, the first day of spring.</p><p>So we can fall a little bit more and companies can make money if they don't have a lot of debt. If you're Chevron and or you're Exxon in the Permian Basin you're ok. If you're somebody that's mortgaged an awful lot to drill you're probably not ok.</p><p>So we are right there at the line where if we dip another $5 or $6 a barrel it will definitely slowdown.</p><p>FOWLEWR: What impact does this have on all of the -- I mean I know you have various pipelines that are being put online to sort of increase United States oil production with this sort of downward pressure on oil prices. What impact does it have on all those explorations?</p><p>KLOZA: Well, they are building the pipelines. And those pipelines are going to come online. They're going to come online the last hundred days of the year and they're going to bring that crude oil from New Mexico and WestTexas to Houston and to Corpus Christi for exports.</p><p>Now the problem is who is your major export customer? China -- and if China cuts a deal with Iran, you know, I don't think the United States is going to be looking to sort of intercept vessels leaving from Iran to China. So it's going to be quite an Italian (ph) offer to drive here.</p><p>I mean the President has proved that he has an itchy Twitter finger when it comes to oil and oil prices. He tweets if prices dropping lower. Doesn't appear as though he has an itchy trigger finger to really start something apocalyptic in the gulf.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Speaking of that region, Saudi Aramco is buying 20 percent stake in India Reliant Energy business, one of the company's largest overseas acquisitions ahead of planned IPO. Tom -- your take on this?</p><p>KLOZA: I think they're going to be buying a lot of assets internationally. I think they probably would have pulled the trigger on U.S. asset, a U.S. refinery if not for the MBS tragedy and all the bad publicity, bad publicity that they got for the royal family there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: For the murder of the journalist.</p><p>KLOZA: Yes. They definitely want to buy more downstream. They want to have a customer for all that crude because the Saudis have another 2 million, 3 million-barrels a day in their pocket. Stuff to think its start up in an instant beyond what they can start up if they start using some of the new technology and really pumping more oil. And if world demand were to rise.</p><p>So they want to buy more U.S. refineries, more foreign refineries, that refinery that you mentioned in (INAUDIBLE) it's like Gunggadin (ph) -- they have thousands and thousands of people working on it and it is the biggest refinery in the world.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So real quick -- gasoline prices, U.S., where do you see them in a couple of months in the summer?</p><p>KLOZA: Trending lower, I think not going much higher unless we have a hurricane, that can always screw things up but probably really low. If I were gaming sort of presidential politics for the next 18 months or so I would say the gas prices will not be an issue in the 2020 campaign. If anything it might be oil prices are a little bit too low, gas prices very, very modest. But it's probably not going to be a point of contention.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Makes it harder to sell that green new deal where they get rid of fossil fuels in a decade doesn't it now. We've cheap and plentiful fuel to drive us around this fine nation?</p><p>KLOZA: It does. But there will be a battle between the Obama era CAFE standards and what they call SAFE where you can basically drive big SUV wherever you want and not worry about it. That battle looms in September and that may set the stage for the next five or six years.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Between essentially California and the rest of the nation.</p><p>KLOZA: California, 23 states and the rest of the country where you actually do drive like in the commercial and pick up, you know, deliver a calf or in New Jersey you drive a big SUV and you pick up a pound of veal.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Drop kids off at soccer.</p><p>KLOZA: That's it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Go Giants.</p><p>KLOZA: Go giants. And go downhill Cowboys.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you. Tom Kloza -- great to see you as always, sir.</p><p>KLOZA: Thanks.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up we are watching markets this morning. Futures extending their losses -- 208 point loss on the Dow futures right now. We take a closer look ahead.</p><p>Plus Peter Thiel targeting Google, why the billionaire investor thinks the FBI should take a closer look at the tech giant next.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, everybody, I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo, it's Monday, August 12th, your top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern. U.S.-China trade turmoil, Goldman Sachs warning the risk of a recession is rising due to the ongoing trade battle and then a deal is not expected before the 2020 election.</p><p>Futures are pointing to a lower open on Wall Street, this following a week where the Dow, NASDAQ and S&amp;P all finished to the downside.</p><p>Protest escalates in Hong Kong, all flights cancelled, after demonstrators staged another sit in at the airport. Questions about Google and U.S. National Security, Peter Thiel, calling for Google to be investigated by the U.S. government, the PayPal co-founder wants to know if the tech giant has been infiltrated by China. MORNINGS WITH MARIA starts right now.</p><p>We have a big show this morning, joining the conversation, New Leaders senior fellow, FOX News contributor, Richard Fowler. Good morning, Richard, so good to see you.</p><p>RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Pollster and Maslansky &amp; Partners president, Lee Carter, and PWC partner, Mitch Roschelle, I love all three of these people, individually, in different ways. Again, you all --</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: And collectively.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, but you all bring, like, such intelligence and such insight and work ethic and rigorous honesty to the conversation. You can't beat that.</p><p>Also on deck this morning, tech billionaire investor, Facebook board member and PayPal co-founder, Peter Thiel, who spoke with Maria on Google investigations in the future of Artificial Intelligence, radio host A.M. 970 and Saturday Night Live alum, Joe Piscopo, on the cancelling of the movie, The Hunt, and the Opis Energy analyst global head, Tom Kloza, on oil, senior FOX News Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano and pro golfer Rory McIlroy on the big business of golf, you don't want to miss any of these guests coming up.</p><p>But right here, right now, U.S.-China trade, Goldman Sachs economists saying that fears of a U.S.-China trade war, leading to a recession are increasing, and that Goldman no longer expects a trade deal before the 2020 election.</p><p>President Trump, threatening to impose a 10 percent tariff on $300 billion of U.S. imports from China on September the 1st that would mean that every dollar of imports into this country has a tariff on it.</p><p>Meantime, protests in Hong Kong, still ongoing with over 100 flights cancelled at the airport today, amid a sit in. And if you take a look at the Futures coming off last week, this is a rough start. But Mitch, what do you make of this Goldman Sachs call?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: It's interesting. I do all of my research on the golf course on the weekends and I was talking to a bunch of traders who had an observation that China-U.S. trade war isn't impacting just our economy, but it's impacting all global economies because the uncertainty regarding investment in a global economic environment is really weighing on all economies.</p><p>So, it's not just us who want to resolve this for the sake of our GDP growth, it's other countries as well, and I think that's where Goldman Sachs is coming out, which is there's so much pressure on the world, with potential slowing economy. It has a lot to do with this trade spat between --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I said this last week that be careful what you wish for, because us \"winning\" this trade war, if we send China into recession, that basically could be our downfall.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And we are already seeing the -- it was really the currency moves last week and us designating China currency manipulator, which by the way, probably won't go anywhere because the IMF and G-7 really aren't on board with that.</p><p>But it's that where you basically -- you have foreign currencies collapsing while higher dollar denominated desk going to get paid back.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And when --</p><p>MCDOWELL: From the borrowers in this nation.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And when other currencies collapse, they have inflation, and inflation is going to slow down their economic growths, so --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lee, in terms of how people are feeling in this country, because again, we always point to the consumer, and consumer confidence still incredibly high, but do you have any sense, and I know you think about this all the time, what will be the tipping point, because there's so much --</p><p>Again, just with the presidential tweet storm every weekend, and it's one thing after another, but again, people seem numb to that.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: I think so. And at this point, we've been talking about this -- the impacts on people for so long. This is going to happen, it's not going to happen, is Trump going to make a deal, is there going to be no deal?</p><p>And I think until people actually feel it, so there's going to be something symbolic that suddenly is going to be felt in the pocket of the consumer and it's going to become real. Because until that happens, right now, it's just going to be one more thing that it's, you know, Trump's going to blow this up, we're going to have a recession, things --</p><p>There's a lot of boy who cried wolf here. I think -- and people are tired of that. So they don' know what it means for them. So, once there's a symbolic, you know, it feels -- it feels in my pocketbook that things are different now. I don't think that people are really going to feel differently.</p><p>I think people are incredibly optimistic, right now, the markets seem to be, you know, equalizing for them and for the most part, consumer confidence is at an all-time high. And I don't think we'll see that shift until, like I said, there's something that really we all feel.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Richard, what do you make of this China trade fight and the escalation of it, and certainly the market reaction to that and other things going on in the global economy?</p><p>FOWLER: Oh, I think Lee has a good point, right? Because I think what China has in its favor, China has the political will to carry this on for as long as they would like, right? They're a state-run government, they can, sort of, do what they want. They'll pump --they'll pump money to back their industries.</p><p>What we have in the United States is we have the economic will to, sort of, last for as long as we would like until something hits the American pockets when you go and to buy a microwave and the microwave (INAUDIBLE) something 70 bucks to $200. And you're like, OK, we have a real problem on our hands.</p><p>But with that being said, that doesn't seem to be very far away as we continue to escalate one tit-for-that, tit-for-tat, tit-for-tat, and the president's most recent move to put the last level of tariffs that'll be on consumer goods which will affect everybody at home.</p><p>Then, I think you'll see this thing might come -- might come to some sort of an end. But, it is indeed problematic, right? That we've been going on in this trade war for, I don' know, almost two years and we haven't seen any real resolution or any benefit to American businesses or consumers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And correct me if I'm wrong, the Dow is lower than it was in January of 2018, when this trade war really first started.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Correct. So, it's starting to weigh in. Listen, you're hearing more and more guidance in the second quarter earnings from companies saying if the trade war continues, then we're going to adjust down.</p><p>MCDOWELL: All right. I want to move on to the 2020 candidates if we can. Democratic vision, the hopefuls making a stop at the Iowa State Fair, Mayor Bill de Blasio, well, there were protesters out for him. A group handed out thousands of dollar bills, fake bills, with de Blasio's face on them. The dollars said things like, in Bill, we trusted and zero percent in the presidential polls.</p><p>Richard, what do you make of this? Again, I have some photos I took over the weekend. I was going to do a side by side of de Blasio in Iowa, and the garbage all over the streets in my neighborhood. I didn't post them because again, who needs reminding of that.</p><p>What do you make of Bill de Blasio's reception? Is he done in the race, you think, and also, in the showing for the candidates in Iowa over the weekend?</p><p>FOWLER: But the interview, I think, this weekend, he said that, you know, this is still the pregame and we have to wait to see what happens, but all the polls were pretty -- the polls indicate that not only him, but there's a number of candidates in this race that have not registered on the polls.</p><p>And it's probably time for them to, sort of, bow out gracefully, so let those who have (INAUDIBLE) have a real conversation about what directions they want to move the country, and we'll have to wait to see what happens.</p><p>But I think in the next debate, because the threshold is a little bit higher in September, you'll definitely see this field get a little bit smaller and you will be -- we'll be able to have a real conversation about where the Democratic Party wants to move the country.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I can't -- the only moderate is Joe Biden, and Joe Biden had some additional -- the former vice president had some additional gaffes over the weekend. I'm going to ask you about that later, but --</p><p>FOWLER: I'll be ready.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do people pay attention to the gaffes? Do they -- because again, if you come to the table with the expectation that you're going to say some things that are kind of -- or just -- you fumble, as I sit here fumbling. That if the expectation is, oh, that's just V.P. Joe, that's just Uncle Joe.</p><p>CARTER: So, I think the gaffes matter to critics, and they matter to fence sitters. So, people who aren't sure what to think about Joe Biden, it matters a lot. For people who are already supporting him, they're like, oh, that's Joe, love him, you know, we get it, and they'll make excuses for him, much like, by the way, the gaffes our president makes. It's the same kind of thing.</p><p>If you're a critic and you're not sure what to make of him, it's a problem. If you support him, you're going to make excuses for him, and I think that Joe Biden is in the same boat right now.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Many of the critics are just going to be standing next to him on stage. You could weaponize those gaffes, potentially.</p><p>CARTER: I mean, the Democrats have to be careful about how they deal with each other right now. I mean, this is -- it's a very similar thing the Democrats are going through right now, that the Republicans went through in 2015, and how they manage each other and attack each other and go through this, is really going to --- going to be doing a lot of Trump's work for him.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think Kamala Harris learned that, you know, oppo research -- an oppo research base attack can come back to bite you if you're not prepared --</p><p>CARTER: Oh, for sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- in the second debate. But I want to turn to Jeffrey Epstein, so Attorney General Bill Barr says that he is appalled by Epstein's death at the Metropolitan Correctional Center over the weekend. Barr, ordering an investigation saying serious questions must be answered.</p><p>As reports say that corrections officers did not check on Epstein for hours. The protocol with the detainee like this would be to check on him every half hour. That he should've had a roommate or a cellmate, rather, and there was no cellmate there. And this is a jump ball, who wants to get in, because, again, the Wall Street Journal has written an editorial about it today.</p><p>Rich, I'll go to you first. The death by apparent suicide of the politically connected financier could not have been scripted better to undermine trust and law enforcement and the prison and legal systems. And this is already coming in when the trust in our legal system and law enforcement is faltering.</p><p>FOWLER: Oh, I think it's an interesting -- that's an interesting, sort of, sight by the Wall Street Journal. Over the weekend, I was watching the new documentary on Amazon, Free Meek Mill, where it talks about the rapper Meek Mill and his, sort of, struggle with the justice system being that, you know, he committed a crime in 2007, that was on probation, for 10 years, but it constantly got extended.</p><p>And, sort of, shines a light on the fact that in our prison industrial complex, will be creating United States the real issues, and the issues are about equity, the issues are about fairness, and the issues are about making sure you have well trained folks doing the right job. And we saw here that this was a gaffe that should not have happened.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it's about the justice for the victims, that's the biggest issue, and we'll get into the legal angles of this, but Lee?</p><p>CARTER: I mean, that is the -- that is the biggest issue. The thing that I think is really interesting, you're talking to people out there, a lot of people aren't surprised, and people don't blame the guards that much, either for letting it happen or for looking the other way, or for, you know, and then there's a more nefarious, you know, accusations and who knows what really happened.</p><p>But I don't think that this is going to be one of those issues that's really going to put a whole crisis in the judicial system. What I think is really important that people do understand, what does this mean, though, for all of the victims? What does this mean? Are they going to get prosecution?</p><p>Are they going to continue to investigate these crimes? The rest of the people that are involved with all of this, I think there's a lot of questions out there about that.</p><p>FOWLER: I think Lee brings up a good point about the, sort of, crisis in the justice system. To be honest, I think the crisis already exists. I think it's better off -- and that what we've -- what we've realized over the past couple of years, I think it's -- to some, but every -- I think people will figure this out. It's better to be rich and guilty, than to be poor and innocent in our justice system.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, but also, the crisis that we're talking about is the Russia collusion hoax. That there was, you know, clearly Russian interference in the election, but you had an investigation by a Special Counsel and basically an investigation going on into the Trump campaign that use some questionable tactics in terms of abuse of the FISA courts.</p><p>So there's -- this is actually something that goes on both sides that people feel like the law enforcement is -- people in law enforcement are using the system for their own benefit or for the gain of others, for the rich and powerful, Richard.</p><p>And by the way, I do want to point out, well, we can digress, but your general reaction when -- just general reaction when you read that Jeffrey Epstein was dead in -- dead in his prison cell?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I saw it on a news channel. And for the second it happened, I said, wasn't shocked at all.</p><p>CARTER: Right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Like, it was no surprise. I was like, not news. I knew it was going to happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But again --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And that's sad.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We'll talk about the conspiracy theories, but again, this leads to conspiracy theories for the rest of our lifetimes, quite frankly, because nobody -- even if you have a public rapport about what happened, will anybody believe it? Will anybody believe it? I ask that as a question, not as a statement.</p><p>Coming up, pushing back against Putin, protesters in Russia this weekend, marking the first major challenge to the Kremlin's political dominance in more than a decade, plus, Google under the microscope, billionaire investor Peter Thiel's new questions about Google and whether the tech giant should have to answer tough questions about privacy and China.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Russian President Vladimir Putin, facing a major challenge from protesters, Cheryl Casone has the details. Good morning, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Dagen. Well, 50,000 protesters gathered over the weekend, just a mile from the Kremlin, to show their anger over Russia's political system, lack of economic growth and not enough political choices.</p><p>Protesters also demonstrated against the use of violence in the courts and corruption in the system in general. Putin's approval rating dropped to its lowest level earlier this year, but it has since rebounded.</p><p>Well, Ford reportedly get ready to pay up in a class action lawsuit over its MyFord Touch and MyLincoln Touch, those are the multimedia systems in the cars.

I'll go to see it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He is -- I've never met the guy, probably never will in my lifetime, but if you follow him on Instagram, he comes across as the most genuine, authentic, nice guy who works his --</p><p>CASONE: You know what off --</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- giant arms off and his giant thighs off.</p><p>CASONE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And appreciates every fan, appreciates every dollar that he's ever earned, and you can't just top that.

See, now I'm dating myself.</p><p>FOWLER: Watch out for that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. Anyway, thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, taking a knee, an American gold medal fencer, kneeling during the award ceremony at the Pan Am Games, grabbing international attention. Plus, bond yield uncertainty, a steep slide in U.S. bonds, in the yield on bonds.</p><p>Actually, bonds have been gaining in value, leaving investors worried about rates turning negative. We explain to you why this is something that we really never seen before in this country and why it could be devastating, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Taking a look at markets, a steep slide last week in the U.S., in U.S. bond yields, in particular, leaving some investors worried about whether interest rates could turn negative following other countries around the world.</p><p>Joining us now, Carson Group founder and CEO, Ron Carson, $15 trillion in government debt around the world has a negative yield on it now, will it happen in the U.S. and explain the real world implications of lending an economy if this happens.</p><p>RON CARSON, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, CARSON GROUP: Just imagine a world where you're guaranteed a loss on investment. Just think what kind of feeling you have to have about the other asset classes to know I'm guaranteed I'm going to get less return back. And, I think, you know, sentiment here, is clearly worsened, especially here in the U.S. than the actual economy.</p><p>But there's, you know, if there's any good news in this, first of all, the bad news is, for savers, they continue to make next to nothing, they're making even less. This is encouraging additional risk taking, if you look at the 9.6 trillion, we have in corporate debt.</p><p>The average credit on that is triple B, so the average, you know, average investors having to take on additional risk to get, in some cases, even less return. So, I think it's unhealthy. I know a lot of people argue that point.</p><p>You know, if interest rates were to stay low, by economic conditions were to stay stable and not deter, I think it's a great -- it's great news. But that's not what the market is telling us right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mitch, the question is, what could revive yields here in the United States when we were talking in the break, but 1.3 percent is the record low yield on the 10-year treasury, so we're not quite there yet. But what's going to turn this around? And what is -- what is -- I've said this all-year, what is the bond market telling us about the direction, not just our economy, but the world economy?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes, some of it is sending a signal, and some of it is just this slight equality, because when you do have $15 trillion in negative yields, you're going to buy where you can get yield. But I go back to what I said earlier.</p><p>I do think that some resolution of the trade war with China and some sign that the Chinese economy is recovering, is what's necessary to reverse these yields from the slide that their on. And Ron, I'm curious about your reaction to that.</p><p>CARSON: No, I think you're right. I mean, clearly, I mean, I just got through spending the last several days with some large, you know, CEOs of large companies and they're just really nervous about what could happen with China. And it seems like, you know, we're making a little progress and then we don't.</p><p>I think if we have resolution to that, we can have some confidence. I think the bond market would actually, you know, probably yields would go back up. That would be a good thing. Because, right now, we are in a terrible position with the Fed -- going to be --</p><p>They're going to be forced to lower interest rates just because of the spread differential. Otherwise, we're going to have a dollar, U.S. dollar skyrocketing, versus other currencies. And that's not good either.</p><p>So, I think you're right. Resolution of the trade dispute with China would provide some confidence, stability, and we could start to work our way higher.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ron, good to see you. Thank you for being here. More time, next time. Ron Carson --</p><p>CARSON: All right, thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, focusing on Google, billionaire investor Peter Thiel's new questions about whether the tech giant should have to answer tough questions about privacy and China.

Maria sitting down with the PayPal co-founder and Facebook board member for his take on why the FBI should be investigating the tech giant.</p><p>Silicon Valley politics and China's use of artificial intelligence.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: You wrote this op-ed in The New York Times recently. And the title was, Good for Google, Bad for America. You talked about how Google has walked away from the Pentagon contract, and now is working with China. In fact, working with the Chinese military. Tell us the crux of the op-ed.</p><p>PETER THIEL, CO-FOUNDER OF PAYPAL: Well, the crux of the argument is that the crown jewel of crown jewels of Google's R&amp;D effort are the A.I., artificial intelligence technology. And this A.I. means a lot of different things that can be used in a lot of different ways, but it clearly has a lot of military applications for you.</p><p>Processing satellite images, helping create processed data. You know, automating drone warfare, cyber warfare, they're all these ways that A.I. is a dual-use thing. Like nuclear technology has both military and civilian uses. There is a Project Maven contract that Google was a part of.</p><p>Where they was supplying this A.I. technology to the U.S. military, it pulled out from that as a result of -- you know, employee protests inside Google. At the same time, Google has its -- you know, a major A.I. research lab in China. Where even though it's not working directly with the Chinese military, in effect to all the technology gets handed on to the Chinese military.</p><p>And this is -- this is not a controversial crazy conspiracy theory. This is in black and white in the constitution of the Chinese Communist Party. As of 2017, it got amended to distress that there needs to be civil- military fusion in China, where all things need to be integrated and anything that has civilian uses must also be handed over to the People's Liberation Army, the PLA.</p><p>BARTIROMO: More about civil-military fusion, I want to hear. In other words, any technology that comes into China has to be reviewed and used or looked as if it could be helpful to the military.</p><p>THIEL: Sure. It's a -- it's a communist one-party state. And so, things are so diffused. It's not like the U.S. where you have different companies and different people. And you have the -- you know, you have a government sector and a private sector. And these things don't always coordinate or work together in China. These things are still tightly coordinated across the board.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's A.I. and then there's AGI artificial general intelligence. Give me the difference between the two, and how is A.I. enabling the Chinese military?</p><p>THIEL: Well, they're both sort of catch-all phrases. Artificial general intelligence is sort of like superhuman. It's or what you might have in a science-fiction movie. And this is often the way people talk about A.I. is that -- it's this abstract thing that's going to be very different that may or may not happen decades, centuries from now.</p><p>What's actually happening is machine learning, artificial intelligence, and that is it's much more mundane, much more prosaic, and it's things like -- you know, helping process satellite images, helping with -- you know, cyber warfare -- things like that. And that's -- you know, it's the social credit scoring system in China where you have use computers to track people and control the society more, so there's of a police state version, there's a military version, there are all sorts of different applications of this. And in that sense, A.I. is just -- you should think of this, just the cutting edge of the computer revolution today. It's sort of the most advanced computer R&amp;D that we're doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But right now, computers can't reason the way humans can, they can't necessarily show emotion. But AGI, they will be able to.</p><p>THIEL: They will be able to. But this is -- this is not about AGI, it's about what's actually happening today, which is -- which is A.I. where they can't -- they can't reason but they could maybe see that -- you know, you're Maria Bartiromo, and we can track your movements or something like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, tell me how this came about where Google decided to walk away from the U.S. government and work with China.</p><p>THIEL: Well, you can always speculate on what -- what's actually going on inside Google? I think Google's self-image would be that it's globalist, it's, you know, post-national somehow, cosmopolitan. I think the reality is more that it's incredibly insular. It's you know, people are inside this campus and have, you know, shocking lack of curiosity about the outside world.</p><p>And so, the kinds of things you've said about Western China and probably not conversations people have a great deal inside Google. And you can think of it as you know, almost like Asperger's or autism where people are just oblivious to all this stuff.</p><p>So, that's I think -- that's the most innocent version -- you know, less innocent versions are where it's hyper ideological and left-wing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, secretary Pompeo has been on this program, and he has made the point many times that this is a national security risk. You know, that China represents a national security risk because of this very reason. They may be ahead of us in A.I. These are some of the areas that America wants to be number one in. So, let me ask you about that in terms of where we are versus China in terms of A.I.?</p><p>THIEL: Well, I think we are -- we are ahead. I think -- you know, I think Google is probably still the on the leading -- the leading place for A.I. research in not just in the U.S. but worldwide.</p><p>We're not ahead by that much, and it doesn't matter that much if it gets -- if all our discoveries get transferred to China in very short order. And so, so I -- you know, I don't think it's -- yes, it's sort of like the -- that we were ahead with the nuclear program, and then, at some point, we weren't.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's quite significant that China's intelligence agencies have been seeding people into American companies. I want to ask you about what's going on in Silicon Valley in terms of espionage, in terms of what's happening with Chinese nationals working within our companies? There are Confucius Institutes in Silicon Valley, right by Stanford University. What's your take on all of that?</p><p>THIEL: Well, this is -- this gets very speculative. It certainly would be odd if there wasn't something like this going on. And again, to use to zero in on the Google example where the A.I. deep mind effort was described by its own founder as a Manhattan Project for A.I.</p><p>And so, even though this was meant as probably -- you know, marketing hyperbole in a way, I think that -- you know, people outside the U.S. might very well take that literally. And so, if you -- if you go around saying, here's the Manhattan Project for A.I., pay attention world.</p><p>I think that would attract the attention of foreign governments, foreign intelligence agencies. And I think, it's, in particular, the question about Chinese interest. And this is one that needs to be looked at much more carefully and that's why, why, I've argued that -- you know, the FBI or the CIA should be -- should be looking at this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you get pressure because you've supported President Trump?</p><p>THIEL: Well, well, yes, there's a lot of questions. There let's -- so, I think there's always an inside and an outside questions. The outside questions where these companies doing with China, you know, are they -- are they censoring speech? And the Twitter-McConnell thing you know, there's - - you can say it's an innocent accident or is it an intentional act of political sabotage, which of the two is it?</p><p>And I think one of the reasons the Republicans are so skeptical of the -- of the excuses big tech has for these repeated accidents is that the inside story is not good. Because on the inside, Twitter is not a company where you have lots of people writing checks to Senator McConnell.</p><p>You know, if you had a lot of campaign donations from Senator McConnell, we might say, well -- to Senator McConnell, well, we might say this is sort of an innocent mistake, and we won't complain about it too much. That's not what -- what's actually -- what's actually going on.</p><p>And it has -- it has sort of this the feel of a -- of a very unhealthy one- party state in a way that's not good for Silicon Valley or for the politics this country generally.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, the president can't even have a fundraiser without -- you know, the people getting bullied about that fundraiser. It's gone. I mean, it's actually -- it's crazy. It's real, Trump derangement syndrome happening.</p><p>THIEL: Right. Right. And it is -- it is always -- you know, I'm sort of -- the main outspoken supporter of President Trump inside Silicon Valley. There are many other people in Silicon Valley who support the president, but they're not going to say it.</p><p>And so, that's always the problem. Unanimity doesn't mean that everybody agrees. It normally just means that everybody is too scared to speak up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's also breaches in privacy from big tech. You're worried about Google, and you make a really important case. This is what I wanted our viewers to hear you say it, in terms of civil-military fusion, what Google is doing in terms of working with the Chinese military.</p><p>What about this FBI surveillance proposal setting up this clash with Facebook? You know, people are worried about being watched and listen to. And here we have FBI surveillance proposing surveillance of Facebook. What's your reaction to that?</p><p>THIEL: Well, that's I think a very different kind of a debate. You have to -- there's debate around encryption, and should -- you know, should messages generally be encrypted. I do believe we should be support of an encryption, may make it harder for law enforcement in certain ways. But on the other hand, it also can mean that you have less privacy to things -- to things get you broken into, and all sorts of other context.</p><p>And so, I -- yes, if you -- if you, de-encrypt everything, maybe stuff goes back to our rivals in China and things like that. So, I think -- I think the -- I think the dogmatic backdoor to encryption that the FBI pushes is something I would -- I would disagree with.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what are the practical risks that we need to understand that exist with China having access to this Google A.I. lab, to the Google technology?</p><p>THIEL: Well, I think, it's always helpful to -- at least, understand the Chinese perspective, or the perspective of the Chinese communist party. So, they believe that A.I. is a dual use technology. It has civilian uses, it also has military uses. They see the rivalry with the U.S. as pretty existential, and it's going to be very important for the next few decades.</p><p>And that's why it's going to be quite a challenge to get to even some kind of the talk with China in the years ahead. So, I think, you know, I think, how we navigate China is quite a tricky question. But the question about Google strike me as a very different one. That's a -- that's straightforward, that's a relatively easy question. They shouldn't be doing this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is this treason?</p><p>THIEL: I wouldn't go quite that far, but it's --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: But you want an investigation into seeing if it is?</p><p>THIEL: Well, I -- well, I want investigation to see if, you know if there is a foreign infiltration at a place like Google. But I don't think it's intentionally treasonous, but it is a -- it is autistically oblivious.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Our special thanks to Peter Thiel.

An American gold medal fencer kneeling during the award ceremony at the Pan-Am Games. The fallout next in sports.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Athletes kneeling, this time it happened on the world stage. Jared Max is here with the story. Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS REPORTER: Dagen, good morning. You know when an NFL player kneels to protest the national anthem, he does not face discipline. But when an athlete who represents the United States in international competition does it, it's a different story. The Pan American Games in Lima, Peru, Friday. American fencers win gold in team (INAUDIBLE), but then, American Fencer, Race Imboden, kneels during the national anthem as teammates stood. He tweeted that: \"We must call for change with racism, gun control,\" he says, \"mistreatment of immigrants.\" Well, the United States and Olympic Paralympic Committees points out in a statement: \"Every athlete competing at the 2019 Pan Am Games commits to terms of eligibility, included to refrain from demonstrations that are political in nature. In this case, Race didn't adhere to commitment made to the organizer committee and the USOPC.\" Another athlete also raised a fist during the anthem.</p><p>Do you remember the dive, The Triply Lindy? Rodney Dangerfield pulled it off in that movie. Well, it's time to go \"Back to School\" in amazement with U.S. Olympics superstar gymnast, Simone Biles. It's not the Triple Indy, it's the Triple-Double at the U.S. National Championships and nobody had ever done it until now. Simone Biles wins her sixth national title, the Triple Double: three twists, two flips. Triple Double, Simone, the first to do this. She won the floor exercise, the balance beam, and also the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>Check this out. After Kevin Harvick wins at Michigan International for the second year in a row, he finished more a second ahead of Denny Hamlin. Well, check him out with his young son, Keelan, in the car. They're doing burnouts. Dagen, is this normal? I mean, we don't get to see something like this in any other sport, where a kid is basically on the field. Well, even you know, you'd (INAUDIBLE) score the winning touchdown. Next thing you know, you pick up your kid and Drew Brees is there and his kids got those (INAUDIBLE) headphones on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is normal for Keelan and Kevin Harvick, I'll say that. And there -- the truck race was at El Duro, which is a dirt track. So, this is a couple of weeks ago. And Stewart Friesen won and there was, I think, his son was standing on the hood of the truck like doing a butt shake and dancing, and it was the most hilarious video. But can we talk about Simone Biles? There's Kevin Harvick. Can we show that Simone Biles video really quickly? Yes! That's what I did. I jumped -- when I saw that, I jumped off my sofa, hands in the air. She's incredible and I think that we need to give her as much camera time as anybody else.</p><p>MAX: And how about the (INAUDIBLE) on that stage? The biggest point, right?</p><p>CARTER: Goosebumps!</p><p>MAX: I mean, the biggest stage you're saying, you know, I'm going to go for it, I'm going to do it. And she nailed it! She tried also on Friday but she didn't like the way that she landed with her hand and she absolutely stuck it with this.</p><p>CARTER: Unbelievable.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely impressive.</p><p>MAX: The 2020 games will be here soon enough and we'll be seeing her again.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Where are they?</p><p>MAX: Tokyo.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Get down! I'm so excited. Jared Max, thank you. Jared's sports reports on Fox News Headlines 24/7, SiriusXM 155. See, things that make you smile, that's what we're here about. So, coming up, \"The Hunt\" is over. Universal's controversial movie cancels shortly after President Trump tweets about it. Joe Piscopo weighs in next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Every year, a bunch of elites.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Kidnapped.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Normal folks like us.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where'd they get you from?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wow!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mississippi.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Orlando.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And hunt us for sport.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: \"The Hunt\" is over. Universal says it will not release the controversial film due to massive backlash. The movie features rich elite hunting so-called deplorables. The studio now says, now is not the right time to debut the movie. Joining me now is AM-970 Host, Joe Piscopo. Joe, what do you make of this, it seems to be the timing after horrific shootings in Dayton and in El Paso, but also just the whole notion that you have elites hunting, well, looks like Trump voters at least in the --</p><p>JOE PISCOPO, RADIO HOST: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- trailer.</p><p>PISCOPO: You know, Dagen, good morning to you. It's incredible that someone actually pitched this idea. That's what I kept thinking about. Somebody said: hey, we'll go out and we'll hunt deplorables and this got to where we got. I got to applaud Universal, I got to applaud Hollywood, they got the message. They're not doing this film. And my gosh, almighty, I'm telling you. It was so -- this is I believe in this, Dagen, that the video games, what the president said and all the violence in the films, I think that does instigates some of these whackos on the fringe. So, this is a good thing that they're not doing this movie.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the fact they got green lit and it has this all-star cast, like they spent an incredible amount of money on it.</p><p>PISCOPO: Yes, I can't figure it out. Someone went into a pitch meeting, Dagen. And they said, here it is, we're going to go after all these Trump supporters and we're going to attack them. Who says great idea? Let's do this. Only in Hollywood. Only in Hollywood. And thank god they came to common sense.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. So, President Trump raised $12 million at two Hamptons fundraisers on Friday. Adding to his I guess who you're voting for, Joe. His 2020 reelection campaign, you attended one of them at Joe Ferrel's Bridgehampton Estate, how was it?</p><p>PISCOPO: Well, I said, where did I put my wallet? I can't seem to find my wallet. It's like they were dropping like 35-grand, a quarter of a million dollars. I went, oh geez, I'll wire the money later. I was so -- I'm so not a Hampton's guy and I'm at Joe Ferrel's house and I'm over there as political observer. And I have to tell you, so I went in there and I was - - I wasn't on the inside, but I'm not dropping names, I'm just telling you as a reporter, Dagen, my friend, who was there. You saw -- Steve Mnuchin was there, Lindsey Graham showed up by the way, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Don, Jr. did a speech before the president came on.</p><p>And Geraldo was there, our buddy Geraldo was there, and Bill O'Reilly and Rudy Giuliani. Me, I was with the masses way in the back of the room, you know, and I just liked it like that. But to tell you like that, I watched the president objectively, and again, please don't -- this objective observation, he is a rock star. When he steps out and these folks saw the president step up, Dagen, they go crazy: USA, USA, USA! They love him and he was so funny and he said, he goes like, this president opens like this, President Trump goes -- he goes I don't care if you like me, I don't care if you don't like me, you have no choice but to vote for me. The place went crazy. And you know what, the man is right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good to see you, Joe Piscopo. Manhattan probably not the same reception.

Good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, August 7th, your top stories, right now, 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast on the button.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">China trade turmoil continuing, China Central Bank setting its Yuan rate above that symbolic seven level but it is still at a low, not seen since 2008. This morning, new numbers show that the U.S. has collected $63 billion in Chinese tariffs through the month of June, that's from the treasury.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets this morning are higher, trying to add on to yesterday's gains, but look what's just happened in the last 30 minutes, the Dow Futures have now turned negative, down 13, 17 points, S&amp;P down a quarter point, and the NASDAQ is higher, holding on to a gain of six points.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Market was higher pretty much all morning this morning, and has reversed course. Yesterday, the market was able to gain back some of the losses, suffered during Monday's broad sell-off with the Dow Industrials yesterday, up 311 points, S&amp;P was up 37, and the NASDAQ was up 107.</p><p>More signs of a slowdown in Europe, take a look at global markets this morning. European indices are higher across the board, despite the fact that Germany reported industrial production was down, more than expected in the month of June, it was down 1-1/2 percent, month-over-month. Germany's DAX Index right now is up 121 points, almost -- well, just over one percent higher.</p><p>In Asia overnight, the markets slight losses except for Hong Kong, as you can see, there, fractional moves, three Central Banks in Asia cut interest rates, more than expected. The one people are talking about this morning is Thailand, down a half point, 50 basis points. We also had a cut in India, as well.</p><p>Disney reports record revenue this morning, but profit did take a hit, the theme park attendance declined. The stock is sliding, ready to shave above 40 points off the Dow Industrials at the open, more on that, coming up, that stock down better than four percent.</p><p>How Disney plans to make new profits off of old Fox titles, then Tesla's safety claims under fire, a government agency accusing the automaker of lying, more on the controversy, coming up, all those stories coming up this Wednesday morning.</p><p>And joining me to break it all down, FOX Business Network's Dagen McDowell, former U.S. Army Special Operations and strategic adviser at WhiteFox Defense, Brett Velicovich is here and CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell, great show, so far, guys.</p><p>BRETT VELICOVICH, STRATEGIC ADVISER, WHITEFOX DEFENSE: Yes, good to see you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA RESEARCH: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, we've got a lot happening.</p><p>BELL: Yes, I'm not surprised to see the markets turning down a little bit here, especially after what we've seen over the last couple of days between the U.S. and China and trade and currency wars, and everything else.</p><p>And the industrial production number that came out of Germany, I know those markets are up today, but that goes to show how the trade spat between the U.S. and China and the slowdown in China, in particular, really is impacting the rest of the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good point. And then, the fact that we're seeing all these interest rate cuts coming down, happening across the world. The three-rate cut is, sort of, setting the tone. I'm wondering if the market turned because Disney worsened. It is representing 40 points on the Dow.</p><p>BELL: You're absolutely right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But it was up three percent even before and the market was up, so things are really worsening now, down 58 points on the Dow Industrials.</p><p>BELL: Right. And Central Banks, to your point, they're all -- many of them are easing, I think, more than 20 Central Banks around the world are easing monetary policy, I think they're looking to the Fed to continue to ease policy.</p><p>We have some ammo with regards to monetary policy, but I don't think it's necessarily going to spur spending, capital spending, business spending, which, Dagen, I know you were talking about earlier today. That's what we really need to pick up and drive the global economy going forward.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: President Trump wants the Federal Reserve to fix the problems that he's created with this trade fight, right or wrong, if that's been the drag on manufacturing activity this year, it's been the drag on business investment, I don't know if another quarter point cut's going to turn that around.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true. All right, we will take a -- we will keep talking about that. Joining the conversation this morning, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is here, don't miss that, she's coming up this morning, right here, live, to talk about the 2020 race.</p><p>Also, our top story this hour, President Trump is headed to Dayton and El Paso today, days after those mass shootings in those cities. Many 2020 Democratic hopefuls are making their feelings known about this trip. Blake Burman is live at the White House with the very latest, Blake, good morning to you.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Maria, good morning to you as well. President Trump and the First Lady will leave the White House next hour to visit those communities, impacted by the most recent mass shootings in this country.</p><p>First, the president and the First Lady will head to Dayton, Ohio, where 9 people were killed and 27 injured after a gunman opened fire, late at night in a busy entertainment district, then, El Paso, Texas, where 22 people were killed and 24 injured when a gunman opened fire in the morning, at a Wal-mart store. The White House says part of the president's trip is meant to bring about unity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY,: Go to these communities and grieve with them, pray with them, offer condolences, and quite frankly, offer thank you and appreciation to those who -- the first responders who put their lives on the line were able to take out the shooter so quickly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: However, in the lead up to this trip, the president took to Twitter to criticize the Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke, who says the president should stay away from El Paso, O'Rourke used to represent that district in Congress.</p><p>The president tweeting \"Beto, phony name to indicate Hispanic heritage, O'Rourke, who is embarrassed by my last visit to the great state of Texas, where I trounced him, and is now even more embarrassed by polling at one percent in the Democratic Primary, should respect victims and law enforcement, and be quiet.</p><p>O'Rourke responded by writing on Twitter \"22 people in my hometown are dead after an act of terror inspired by your racism. El Paso will not be quiet and neither will I.</p><p>Maria, the White House has not released the exact details of where the president and the First Lady will head, once they get to Dayton and El Paso. They normally do not do that, due to security reasons.</p><p>When the president does visit those communities today, Maria, it will be the sixth time in the Trump presidency that he will leave the White House to go to a community, impacted by a mass shooting. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, Blake, you're right. And Jack Brewer texted me earlier and said look, we're talking about these shootings, just want to point out that there were 51 shootings in Chicago and Baltimore. On the year, eight people shot, a day, in Chicago, nearly four, a day, in Baltimore. Blake Burman, thank you very much for that.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about all of the above is former chief of staff under Bill Clinton and the chairman of McLarty Associates, Mack McLarty, Mack, it's good to see you always. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>MACK MCLARTY, CHAIRMAN, MCLARTY ASSOCIATES: Maria, good morning, good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Should the 2020 candidates be criticizing President Trump for going to try to show his condolences to the victims of these shootings?</p><p>MCLARTY: We have a long history of presidents engaging with people who have been affected by a national tragedy, dating back, obviously, Ronald Reagan, after the challenger incident Bill Clinton going to Oklahoma City, an important moment in his presidency.</p><p>Obviously, the most perhaps riveting was President George W. Bush going to New York, after 9/11 that was certainly an important moment in our history and his presidency, and President Obama going to Charleston after the tragedy there, so there's really a tradition here.</p><p>I think it's time to lower the rhetoric, I think Senator Klobuchar, among others, has hit about the right tone here. I think it's fine to express concern and find express views, but it's time to put away tweets. Let's concentrate on this tragedy, and show our sympathy and condolences. I would expect --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think that's what the president is trying to do.</p><p>MCLARTY: -- that's what the president will try to do today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what the president is trying to do.</p><p>MCLARTY: Well, I think that's what he -- that's what he will try to do. I think he would have some difficulty on that day. Let's see how he handles it. But I think there is a tradition, I think he's doing the right things, and I would say lower the rhetoric, let's concentrate on the tragedy and condolences and then talk about solutions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: For sure.</p><p>VELICOVICH: Mack, Brett Velicovich here. Look, it's just so disheartening to hear basically guys like Beto O'Rourke, who are the problem in this case, to say that the president of the United States is not welcome in that city, I mean he needs to show some leadership here, and the president coming down to city helps, you know, a little bit, to ease some of these people's concerns.</p><p>That time and time again, the president has repeatedly and forcefully denounced all forms of hate. He's called on the nation to come together in a bipartisan manner.</p><p>And it's interesting to me that news recently tried to pin both shooters as Trump supporters, but yet, we found out that in Ohio, within the last 24 hours, that the shooter was Elizabeth Warren fan, and not a right wing, white supremacists that some of these celebrities were talking.</p><p>So, I'm curious, you know, how do we put aside these issues and focus on bipartisan unison and put together strategies that can help stop these attacks in the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And just to be clear, in terms of the media's responsibility here, now they've stopped talking about it. So, first, they were talking about the shooter being, you know, a Trump supporter, and now that we learned that it's Elizabeth Warren's supporter, we don't see it in the news anymore.</p><p>VELICOVICH: Precisely.</p><p>MCLARTY: Well, that's a lot to unpack, let me -- let me respond to your questions. Number one, I think, a lot of people would not concur or not agree with the point of view that President Trump has not been a divisive figure in many ways.</p><p>So, that's -- there are strong feelings that clearly exist and we can't deny that. So, I think that's why will be more difficult for him than perhaps some other presidents have had, in terms of unity, but your point is a fair one, and I go back to my very -- my very basic point, this is a national tragedy.</p><p>We don't have all the answers. Right now, we need to express our grief and concern, and then we need to talk about the solutions, I think, whether the president can demonstrate that kind of empathy, that kind of trust. And leadership remains to be seen. You make a fair point about the country, at least, coming together, at least coming together, on some of these issues, even if we have other disagreements on other policy issues. But, I think, in our country, it is filled with good decent hardworking people. They deserve leadership from both sides of the aisle.</p><p>In terms of Congressman O'Rourke, this is very personal with him, he's expressing that, you made your points, and I take your point, but this is very personal, he feels very strongly about it, whether it's the right thing for him to do, I think that's -- that is individual opinion. People can make their own judgments.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just want to point out something really quick, Mack, as a point of fact that in Beto O'Rourke's tweet where he was referencing the murderer in El Paso and President Trump, that murderer, in his manifesto, said that his views predate President Trump, which Beto O'Rourke would even know if he read the New York Times.</p><p>They wrote that on Monday, so, again, facts matter, and their paltry few facts coming from a lot of people, about the details of what these two murderers did and their backgrounds.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and then at the same time, Mack, you've got details coming from Congressman Castro, he is facing some serious backlash this morning for his tweet, that it named dozens of Texas voters donating to President Trump's re-election campaign.</p><p>Castro, we know, is the twin brother of the 2020 hopeful, Julian Castro, and his campaign chairman. He is refusing to take the tweet down, and he's basically trying to out donors for supporting President Trump. So, I -- well, I mean, I assume he's looking for somebody to pick up ball here and start releasing addresses and phone numbers so that these people, hear from the left.</p><p>MCLARTY: Well, Maria, as you know, contributors are public record, and I think probably some information about them is also public record under our campaign laws. But, again, I think this is not the timing of the release of those donors, I don't think is particularly good.</p><p>This is not the time to get into politics, in my strong opinion. And I really think, I will leave it at that. And I think that's enough said in terms of how to approach this situation. Now, how others choose to do it, that's their decision, but from my stand -- from my stand point, I feel very, very strongly --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I could not agree more.</p><p>MCLARTY: This is a national tragedy loss and we've got to approach it in a very human caring way, and then talk about, then talk seriously about what can be done. I think Governor DeWine confronted that in Ohio, who's a good man, and I know Mike, I like him and respect him.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCLARTY: He confronted that in Ohio. People won't -- the Congress, the president, to come together --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCLARTY: -- and address this issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the president tried that as well, Dagen, right? I mean, he is talking about increased background checks, the bump stocks, as well, recently.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Bound bump stocks, with an Executive Order, improving through congressional action. The database that were used for background checks, I think that Congress --</p><p>And I think the president would sign off on this, will do something on red flag orders or domestic violence protection orders related to guns, that lets individuals get guns out of hands who are a danger to themselves or others, and it's actually based on some evidence, reduced suicide rates in states where they've been in place for years like Connecticut and Indiana.</p><p>And by the way, one in Indiana that was passed in 2005, that was the state that Mike Pence used to govern.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mack, it's good to have you this morning, thanks so much.</p><p>MCLARTY: Maria, thank you very much, nice to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And to you, Mack McLarty. Stay with us. I'll be sitting down with 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, later this hour. Stay with us. We'll talk about that, as well as her lawsuit against Google, back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, shares of CVS Health rallying the premarket this morning on an earnings beat. Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria, so the stocks up five percent, as you can see right now to the company second-quarter results blew out the street estimates. CVS Health closed an adjusted profit $1.89 a share. Revenue jumping 35 percent, more than 63 billion. The company also raises full profit outlook.</p><p>Now, different story for Disney, the stock is sharply lower right now. The results missed expectations following the purchase of entertainment assets from 21st Century Fox, the stock is down more than 4-1/2 percent right now. Going to be dragging down the Dow, we should add here.</p><p>But on a lighter note, Disney is planning a reboot of some of its classics. Yes, Disney's CEO Bob Iger said that \"Home Alone\" is going to be remade for through streaming service Disney Plus which is expected to launch this November. Disney also planning to redo \"Night at the Museum\" and \"Cheaper by the Dozen\".</p><p>Well, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is pumping the brakes on Tesla over claims that the automaker made about the safety of the Model 3. Now, cease-and-desist letter from the NHTSA was sent to Tesla CEO Elon Musk back in October, calling for the company to say that the Model 3 had the lowest probability of injury of all cars the safety agency has ever tested, they're disputing that. Bloomberg reporting agency is going to ask the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether the statements were actually misleading. Tesla lower in the premarket more than a quarter percent.</p><p>And there is Apple, they're adding restrictions to apps that can make voice calls over the internet. Think of Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, even when you're not using them, they were still saying they're open. It's meant to speed up connections but the technology can also be used to allow the companies to collect data. Apple reportedly is going to cut the feature off starting with its iOS 13 update. That's going to be coming out this fall, Maria. And of course, it's all about privacy right now when it comes to our phones and our computers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it sure is. We're going to talk with Tulsi Gabbard about that as well, coming up. Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>Coming up, the road to 2020 Democratic candidate Tulsi Gabbard soaring to the top of Google search results following the second round of debates. Now, new numbers show her struggling to gain support ahead of the debate stage in September. She will join me live on set later this hour.</p><p>Then we are watching markets this morning, Futures near the lowest of the morning. Take a look what has occurred in the last 30 minutes. Treasurer yields are sliding, the 10-year at 1.6 percent. We've got the CEO of KBW Tom Michaud coming in -- weighing in with his outlook, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, we have breaking news, the markets have taken a turn for the worse Futures now, down about a hundred points, take a look. Dow Futures down 96, S&amp;P down eight and the NASDAQ down 13. This coming as the yield on the 10-year treasury is tumbling. It is now, take a look, at 1.64 percent.</p><p>Joining us right now is the CEO of KBW, A Stifel Company, Tom Michaud. And Tom it is great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>TOM MICHAUD, CEO, KBW: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your firm obviously, the expert firm in terms of financial mergers and acquisitions. You have done seven out of 10 bank -- large bank mergers this year.</p><p>MICHAUD: Correct. That's correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congratulations.</p><p>MICHAUD: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to get to that in a second but first, your reaction to where the yield is and its impact on banks.</p><p>MICHAUD: Well, it's -- it will be a negative on bank earnings growth going forward if it stays here. So I think its two things for the banks. Number one is, it will have negative implications for net interest income and for earnings growth. And then number two is, what is the signal sending about the future and the economy.</p><p>In the second quarter, the earnings showed no signs really of distress in the economy. They're actually pretty good, they're slower growth but they were still pretty good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what did we learn from the second quarter on banks?</p><p>MICHAUD: What we learn is that banks are still very profitable, they've got the most capital they've had in 80 years and there are really no signs from an industry of any credit problems. So if you were to take a snapshot of the banking industry in the second quarter, you'd say all is OK. And so all the talk around the yield curve is about what might happen but not what has been happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And go ahead, Lindsey.</p><p>BELL: I'm just going to jump in and say, speaking about what might happen with the yield curve, the inversion between the 10 year and three month is now 40 basis points, which is I think the widest it's been in a long time. What is that saying about what the Fed's going to do, the remainder of this year? I mean, BMO Capital is out earlier today saying they could see -- we could see as much as a hundred basis point cut for the Fed to catch up with the markets are.</p><p>MICHAUD: It's really interesting, because I personally believe that a lot of the market has adopted a more bearish view of the economy and has been looking for a more accommodative Fed that we may actually get. If you were just to ask me for my personal opinion, I think a lot of the stocks are baked in for 25 basis point cuts? If we don't get that, that could actually be the surprise.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But what does the Fed know that we don't know with these four rate cuts? I mean, here we are talking about an economy that is growing, an unemployment at a 50-year low.</p><p>MICHAUD: You know, I read -- I read one of the Fed governor speeches this week, and I thought it was very interesting. They said, the conversation was around, have we bought -- has the Fed bought enough insurance for the 25 basis point cut. I think that the comments maybe some of the criticism was that, the Fed moved too quickly on increases. I wonder if that will cause them to move a little more slowly on the decreases just to be a little bit more data based in terms of their direction.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But one of the problems, is that the yield curve between the three month and the 10 year is inverted at the widest margins since the financial -- right before the financial crisis in 2007, right? So just based on that, it makes it not impossible very difficult for banks to make money.</p><p>Because, again, you make loans on the long end, you borrow on the short end and when that's inverted, that alone would be enough for the Federal Reserve to act again on short term interest rates, right?</p><p>And I want to just point out, it seems like you see real panic buying going on in the treasury market. The -- you see the 1.64 on the 10-year. Long bonds are at 2.16 percent on the yield, the record low for the 30 year is 2.1. So if you watch that, that's a sign of -- well quite frankly, fright in these markets. You can take a look at that. We're only -- very short ways away from the all-time low yield on the 30 year.</p><p>MICHAUD: So, there's no question, lower rates flatter yield curve, inverted yield curve, make bank earnings growth harder and over time, it will be grind -- a grind on their -- on their profitability. I personally don't think its overnight trauma for the banking industry. Because I think the banking industry is very liquid, it will adapt, it's got plenty of capital. Will the banks be a little less profitable if that happens? It will. The question is, how long does that condition continue?</p><p>So I think the banking industry is extraordinarily sound, and maybe they'll earn a little less money. But the stocks, seeing how they've been trading, I think are pricing in something worse.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, what about U.S. versus Europe? Because overnight we had three central banks cut interest rates, India, Thailand. You're looking at this race to the bottom and now there's a conversation happening that the ECB wants Christine Lagarde comes in is going to start buying equities.</p><p>What can they do with these rock-bottom levels? They don't have a lot of wiggle room. Talk to us about Europe versus the U.S. and what the ECB should do.</p><p>MICHAUD: Well, the first thing is that, to get to the conversation we were just happening, Europe's had a negative interest rate condition for a while. And I understand just even the last week, maybe even a trillion dollars of more government debt has gone into the direction of negative interest rates.</p><p>We've been seeing European banks report earnings as recently as today. And the negative interest rate environment is very hostile to banks. And I think my opinion is as you need a strong banking system for economic growth to really continue on a sustained basis. And we're not really a hundred percent there yet with the turn that we've take recently because we thought we were coming out of that period. Now it looks like we've made a turn and go back into something that will be a harsher condition for the banks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, I just wonder if you're going to start buying equities which is what Rick Rieder thinks at Black Rock. He was with us a couple of weeks ago, real quick before you go. You've done seven of the law -- the 10 large bank mergers this year, more consolidation in the banking sector. And obviously, it's not going to be probably the larger ones because there at the deposit cap, right?</p><p>MICHAUD: Correct, so two things, one is scale is working in the banking industry, the bigger banks are becoming more profitable than the smaller banks which hasn't happened in a really long time. So there are benefits to scale right now, number one.</p><p>Number two, is the Crapo Bill that passed last year. Removed a $50 billion cap for more intense regulation. That is really a game changer and we think it's going to allow those banks in that asset size to stand up, create regional champions to try to compete with the bigger banks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Tom, it's great to have you on the show.</p><p>MICHAUD: Maria, great to be here, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much.</p><p>MICHAUD: Yes, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tom Michaud today from KBW.</p><p>Coming up, 2020 vision, Democratic hopeful Tulsi Gabbard dominating Google as the most searched candidate after the last round of debates in Detroit. Now new numbers show her struggling to gain support ahead of the next debate. She will weigh in, plus her hard-hitting comments against Kamala Harris right after this break. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Futures have reversed direction this morning, they are headed lower. We are looking at the market down now in the triple digits, the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 125 points, S&amp;P down 12, and the NASDAQ down 25. This is the 10-year treasury, slides to 1.65 percent.</p><p>Moments ago, the yield briefly touched 1.62 percent. That was the lowest level since October 2016. Yields across the world are crashing, and that is unnerving stocks this morning. Our top story this half an hour, big tech crackdown, President Trump slamming Google and its CEO amid allegations of anticonservative bias. The president says the administration is watching Google very closely.</p><p>Back in June, I spoke with the president about legislating big technology like Google and Twitter. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (via telephone): Twitter is just terrible, what they do. They don't let you get the word. I've had so many people come to me, \"Sir, I can't join you on Twitter.\" I see what's happening. A hundred percent. It will --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So do you -- would you rather see competition or do you want to see legislation coming down to actually --</p><p>TRUMP: Well, you may need legislation in order to create competition.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Hawaii Congresswoman, 2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate, Tulsi Gabbard.</p><p>Congresswoman, it is good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>REP. TULSI GABBARD (D-HI), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's great to be here. Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congratulations to you on all of your success. You are suing Google right now for $50 million.</p><p>GABBARD: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell me what happened.</p><p>GABBARD: During the first debate, and the hours that came after it, we were prepared with all of our Google ads. We were the most searched candidate and campaign of the night, when all of a sudden our Google ad account was shut down without any clear kind of explanation or how to get it back up. And it was later reinstated after that critical window had closed, again without any real explanation.</p><p>So we're suing Google really because of the power that these big tech monopolies have over influencing our public discourse, our freedom of speech, and really, ultimately, our fair elections, because if they can do this to me as a sitting member of Congress, running for the highest office of the land, this means they can do it to anyone running for office at any level in this country or any person if they don't like what you're saying.</p><p>And this is -- this is really not about me, it's really about the American people and about standing up for and protecting our freedom of speech. Whether we agree or disagree with that speech, this goes to the core and founding principles of our country. And they shouldn't have the power to be able to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what's the answer here? Because this is an issue I think that brings together both sides.</p><p>GABBARD: It should.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've got people like Elizabeth Warren and Ted Cruz wanting a breakup of some of these companies.</p><p>GABBARD: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you see the president, obviously, he's also saying that he's watching Google closely.</p><p>GABBARD: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: These companies have more power today than they ever had. What do you want to see?</p><p>GABBARD: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How is this going to change?</p><p>GABBARD: Eighty-eight percent of all Internet searches in the United States take place in Google.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>GABBARD: Ninety-two percent in the world. So when you look at -- at a monopoly like Google, having total control of what pops up when you -- when you search for something, this is what we're talking about. So I think there's two approaches that we need to take. One is to break up these big tech monopolies because that's exactly what they are, and also look legislatively at what kind of transparency oversight and accountability is put in place to make sure that there is not an infringement on our freedom of speech and to make sure things are fair and transparent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's also a movement -- an upset about Google not working with the Pentagon because of the immigration policies and instead choosing to work with China and inadvertently helping the Chinese military. This is what Peter Thiel has been saying as well. Your thoughts on that, because it's more than just censoring people's opinions on things, it's also privatization breaches and this China situation.</p><p>GABBARD: Yes. Yes, look, I think it's important for us, from our government and from our regulatory standpoint is to look at what's in the best interests of the American people, making sure that we're protecting those freedoms and our civil liberties that are enshrined in our Constitution and looking and making sure that our decisions are being made with our national security in the forefront.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Would you like to see legislation around this?</p><p>GABBARD: I would.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. A new Quinnipiac poll is out, it shows Joe Biden leading nationally among 2020 Democrats. You've got Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders following. You're polling at 1 percent, with Julian Castro and Amy Klobuchar. Ten percent of voters are still undecided.</p><p>What are you going to do about this? How are you going to continue to resonate? You met your fundraising goals, right? I mean in order to get on that stage the next time --</p><p>GABBARD: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where are you?</p><p>GABBARD: Well, we can see how -- how impactful these debates can be. And this is why it's important and we're continuing to build our support. We've gone way past the donor requirement, which is 130,000 individual donors to qualify for the next round of debates. And we're looking forward to the next round of polls that we hope to be able to meet that polling threshold as well.</p><p>But really what this comes down to is the work we are doing every day to reach out to voters, directly to voters across this country, let them know who I am, why I'm running for president, and why I'm the best qualified to serve them as president and commander in chief.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And why are you?</p><p>GABBARD: Because of the experience that I bring. You know, as a soldier, I've served now for over 16 years in the Army National Guard. I've deployed twice to the Middle East. And for nearly seven years in Congress have been very focused on national security. In serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Armed Services Committee, and Homeland Security Committees, understanding the cost of war, the toll that it takes on our service members and their families, and the toll that it takes on every single American in this country when we look at the over $6 trillion, taxpayer dollars, that we've spent on these wasteful regime change wars since 9/11 alone, dollars that should have been and should be used in meeting the needs of the American people here at home.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you want to take the troops, obviously, back from Afghanistan?</p><p>GABBARD: I want to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. It should have happened long ago. Right now, in Afghanistan, we are spending $4 billion every month. Four billion dollars. And when you look at folks in communities across the country who don't even have clean water to drink, when you look at the infrastructure needs in our country, when you look at the lack of affordable housing, there are so many things that we need to address. We've got to get our priorities straight and make sure that we are using our military for the function that they intend, which is to keep the American people safe, and investing our limited resources into empowering and serving the needs of our people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You talk about all of the things that Americans need and yet when the Dems, including yourself, were on that stage and asked a question, \"Are you willing to give health care to illegals?,\" you raised your hand?</p><p>GABBARD: I did not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You do not --</p><p>GABBARD: I did not. I think it's important that we make -- that we fix our immigration system. I do support making sure that we've got quality health care for everyone who needs it, regardless of whether they're rich or whether they're poor. We should also make sure that we have a private insurance option for those who choose to pursue that.</p><p>But rather than putting a band aid on all of these different immigration challenges we are facing, we need to fix our immigration system, past comprehensive immigration reform so that we don't have 10 -- over 10 million undocumented people who are living in the shadows in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: These are the kinds of things that differentiate you from others on that stage, the fact that you understand that Americans should come first in terms of health care, as opposed to illegals. What do you want to do about immigration --</p><p>GABBARD: I -- I think that we should --</p><p>BARTIROMO: These are the issues you think that are going to get you to that 2 percent threshold.</p><p>GABBARD: I think the -- I think it's a matter of looking at what's in the best interests of the people in this country. And reforming the broken laws that we have, including immigration laws, that are a disservice across the board, it's a disservice to people who are trying to seek asylum in this country, and it's a disservice to the American people and those who are trying to come into our country legally.</p><p>It's impacting our economy. There's a huge impact on our borders with inhumane conditions there. So we have to make sure that we are living up to the values that we represent, which is having a safe and secure border while having humane immigration policies that best serve our country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So why is it that you and your colleagues in Congress have been unable to fix the loopholes? I mean this is the issue that is bringing all of these people from Central America --</p><p>GABBARD: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: To the border, which shows (ph) the border --</p><p>GABBARD: It's partisanship.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It was incredible, the -- the children that I witnessed coming over the border alone, couldn't find their mother. So many stories, I can go on. What do you want to do about those loopholes, the Flores agreement, the asylum standards? How come Congress has not been able to change these?</p><p>GABBARD: It comes down to partisanship. That's the bottom line. People who are putting their own political interests ahead of the interests of the people and ahead of the interests of really bringing about solutions to these challenges that we've faced for a long time and that are only getting worse because of that inaction.</p><p>I've worked in a bipartisan way on many different issues in Congress. There's great opportunity there. We need strong leaderships willing to put people ahead of party so we can get the job done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: For a long time, Nancy Pelosi and many of your colleagues on the left were saying it's not a crisis. It was a manufactured crisis. Now they're, obviously, seeing that that's a different story. In fact I think after our border trip and what we witnessed, while we were live on air, there was a pivot. I think the -- I think that the tone changed because it was so obvious. But why -- I mean you see it as a crisis, correct?</p><p>GABBARD: I do. I have. Again, I think this is important for us to move past the partisan politics and for us to come together as a country to say, we need to solve this problem, both for what's happening at the border, but also, what is driving these people to walk thousands of miles --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>GABBARD: -- to leave their homes, put their lives and their children's lives at risk and reform our entire immigration system.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You've got a great grip on the issues at hand and what's important to the American people, but you've got to be here. You are hosting a town hall in New Hampshire today.</p><p>GABBARD: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Then you're set to take two weeks off to serve in the National Guard. Are you worried that you're going to be out of the loop? You've got to be in the faces and, you know, in people's faces to resonate, to make sure they understand where you stand on these issues.</p><p>GABBARD: I'm grateful to have the privilege of being able to serve our country. So I'm not putting anything aside to be able to go and serve my country. I will continue that service as I am on this campaign. This time it's going to be in uniform for a couple of weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, thank you for your service to our country.</p><p>GABBARD: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We all appreciate it, I know in this building and our viewers as well. You tweeted about Kamala Harris yesterday. I want to ask you about that, you know, takedown, if you will, on the debate stage. \"Kamala's entire campaign is based on a lie,\" you wrote, \"that as the AG of California, she was a fighter for the oppressed and for criminal justice reform, but her criminal justice record shows that her policies exemplified the worst aspects of our criminal justice system.\"</p><p>The two of you had that heated back-and-forth during the last debate. Tell me what you want people to understand about Kamala Harris.</p><p>GABBARD: This comes down to leadership. You know, what kind of leadership is -- would she bring and what kind of leader was she as attorney general in California. And it's pointing to the truth and the facts. She claims to be very proud of the record that she had, as the attorney general in California.</p><p>I pointed out some of the huge problems with the kind of leadership that she brought where she claims to be a champion for the people, but instead made decisions that caused more harm, hardship and suffering for people in California. And I gave some of those examples in the debate.</p><p>She needs to answer to the American people on these facts.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Congresswoman, it's great to have you this morning.</p><p>GABBARD: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much. Tulsi Gabbard joining us there. We'll be watching you, Congresswoman. Thank you. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Futures are plummeting this morning reversing course entirely from earlier, as we told you. The yield on the 10-year is at 1.64 percent. Earlier, it hit that, now it's at 1.66 percent. Jackie DeAngelis is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange looking at all of these moves this morning. Jackie, good morning to you.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. And the equity market is looking at the bond market and seeing that yield drop, a little bit of a flight-to-safety in the 10-year, and that's why you futures reverse course. There is one bright spot out there, though, that I want to tell you about, it's Weight Watchers stock, it's at more than 20 percent premarket, a beat on earnings, a little bit light on the revenue, but strong subscriber growth this year or this quarter, and it also raised its full-year forecast, so the market likes that.</p><p>Meantime, we're watching shares of Walgreens as well. The company's saying it's going to close 200 stores here in the United States after it already told investors it was going to close 200 in Europe. The company says this is part of a cost-cutting initiative. It wants to be leaner and more efficient and that's the new strategy going forward. It shouldn't be disruptive to users who get their prescriptions filled there.</p><p>And finally, Snapchat spending a billion dollars to do more. They're going to give you more dog ears, and vomiting rainbows as the users like to say. Those funny pictures that people love to use. Snap is raising a billion dollars in short-term debt to give you more of that augmented reality, and Snap, of course, has had a nice little run there, Maria. Back over to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Jackie. Thanks so much. Markets are at the lows of the morning right now, down almost 200 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as you just saw.</p><p>President Trump just tweeted, he just said this, \"'Three more central banks cut rates.' Our problem is not China. We are stronger than ever. Money is pouring into the U.S. while China is losing companies by the thousands to other countries. And their currency is under siege, our problem is a Federal Reserve that is too proud to admit their mistake of acting too fast and tightening too much and that I was right, they must cut rates bigger and faster and stop their ridiculous quantitative tightening now. Yield curve is at too wide a margin and no inflation. Incompetence is terrible thing to watch, especially when things could be taken care of so easily,\" writes the president.</p><p>\"We will win any away,\" he says, \"but it would be much easier if the Fed understood, which they don't, that we are competing against other countries, all of whom want to do well at our expense.\" The president tweeting about rates right now. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. As you know, we're watching markets this morning. We've watched a complete reversal of fortune during the three- hour program today. Now, we're looking at a decline of 230 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Things are plummeting and they're plummeting fast as interest rates plummet as well. The yield on the 10-year note is now at 1.65 percent. Earlier it had hit 1.62 percent. That was earlier this hour.</p><p>The president is weighing in. He just tweeted on the interest rate cuts we've been telling you about all morning. He said this about the trio of central banks surprising markets with rate cuts overnight. We told you he's complaining about the Fed and mentioning that we had rate cuts from Thailand which cut rates 50 basis points, we had India and New Zealand. Oh, New Zealand cut by 50 basis points, pardon me. Pardon me. It was New Zealand with the 50 basis point cut.</p><p>Lindsey Bell, your reaction.</p><p>BELL: Yes. Thailand was 25 basis points. But it just goes to show the slowdown, the global slowdown that we've been talking about, global PMIs, many of them in contractionary mode, are impacting countries around the globe. And New Zealand's a big deal because they haven't cut by 50 basis points since the great financial crisis. So, this is a big deal for them to move in this election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the more we see cuts coming across the world, Dagen, the more the U.S. is going to be wanting lowered rates because of the impact on currency.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And we are getting lower rates right here, getting lower long- term rates which they started falling last fall. The Fed did to the president, who was tweeting the Federal Reserve has stopped its quantitative tightening, has stopped the reduction of its balance sheet, number one.</p><p>And number two, that the president, you can't say the economy is strong and jawbone about cut rates, cut rates, cut rates, cut rates. What is it? The Federal Reserve cannot fix the problems built on trade policy and the fight with china. That's just a fact.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Business investment falling in the most recent quarter, factory activity down four months in a row. So, again, more predictability in this trade fight with China, less mercurial moves like out of the blue 10 percent tariff on $300 billion of imports and also designating China a currency manipulator at possibly the worst moment, that's what's creating some of the panic. And the Fed can't fix it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Quick break and then final thoughts from this all-star panel. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we're back with our all-star panel. Your final thoughts. Lindsey.</p><p>BELL: Just get ready, investors, for a tumultuous August and September.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Brett.</p><p>VELICOVICH: On China trade war, I think the president is right to dig in here. To me. it's larger than trade, it's larger than the economy. It's about national security. The Chinese are not going to -- they are going to continue to steal our intellectual property. At least we can change the calculus.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Good point. All right. We will leave it there. Great day, everybody. Thank you. \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins right now. Stuart, take it away.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019080703cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS0-SSX1-JB20-G1X6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7684\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 7, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

China hit back on May 13 by imposing levies of up to 25% on $60 billion of U.S. imports beginning in June.</p><p>Adding a new wrinkle to the trade saga, the U.S. on May 15 blacklisted Chinese telecommunication equipment provider Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., citing perceived threats to U.S. national security or foreign policy interest.</p><p>Huawei has long been on the radar of U.S. officials, who have cautioned companies against using telecommunications equipment from certain Chinese companies. Chinese leadership condemned the move, warning Washington that it could further worsen the already strained ties between the two countries.</p><p>Apple especially felt the pressure this week, with some analysts saying growing hostilities between the U.S. and China could force the company to pass along the burden to consumers in the form of higher prices.</p><p>J.P. Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee in a May 14 research note estimated that Apple would need to raise iPhone prices by 14% to offset the higher cost of components if the U.S. ever expands the scope of its tariffs to include all imports from China.</p><p>The analyst used the iPhone XS model, which retails for $999, as an example of what the device cost without tariffs versus what it would cost if a 25% tariff was applied to all China-made components. The latter would raise the iPhone's retail price up to $1,142, the firm calculated.</p><p>Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note this week that the trade situation could raise the cost for Apple to manufacture iPhones by 2% or 3%, with the potential to increase by as much as 10% over time, in a worst-case scenario.</p><p>Ives also questioned how the Huawei ban could impact the 5G technology efforts of major tech players such as Apple and Intel.</p><p>\"The Trump administration's ban on Huawei products in the U.S. is just the latest Fort Sumter moment with 5G at the center of this divisive issue on the technology front between the two countries with now worries that more retaliatory tactics can be deployed by China,\" Ives wrote.</p><p>Intel in April revealed its intention to exit the 5G smartphone modem business, mere hours after Apple   which had used Intel as a modem supplier for its most recent iPhones   said it had settled a long-running licensing dispute with chipmaker QUALCOMM Inc.Intel's departure from the 5G smartphone modem business leaves Qualcomm as the sole U.S.-based supplier of 5G modem chips.</p><p>Also this week, reports circulated that Intel is facing a new class of chip vulnerabilities termed \"ZombieLoad,\" reminiscent of the Meltdown and Spectre security flaws that plagued the company last year.</p><p>Apple stock lost 4.15% in value this week, trading at $188.99 around midday May 17. Intel shares were trading at $45.24 midday May 17, down 2.07% for the week.</p><p>Turning to communications, Sprint and T-Mobile shares rose slightly amid reports that the two companies are considering making concessions to gain regulatory approval for their pending merger.</p><p>T-Mobile and Sprint are considering a separation and potential sale of their prepaid businesses, Bloomberg News reported this week. Analysts largely saw the move as a positive step forward, with New Street Research Policy Advisor Blair Levin writing in a May 17 report that he believes prospects for approval of the deal are now \"improving.\" Beyond the Bloomberg report, he pointed to meetings between the companies and officials at the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. Both the FCC and U.S. Department of Justice must approve the deal for it to close.</p><p>Around midday May 17, Sprint shares were trading at $6.20 apiece, up 0.16% for the week; T-Mobile stock was trading up slightly at 0.66% midday May 17, at $75.73.</p><p>In other M&amp;A news, shares in Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. spiked on May 17 after The Information cited sources familiar with the situation as saying CBS Corp. made an informal acquisition offer for Starz/Starz Encore (US). CBS, which already owns the premium networks Showtime/TMC/Flix (US), reportedly offered approximately $5 billion for the channel. Lions Gate acquired Starz for approximately $4.4 billion in cash and stock in 2016.</p><p>Shares in Lions Gate were trading at $15.21 as of 2:10 p.m. ET on May 17, up 11.84% for the day.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-51898653</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5G-TT11-F19Y-C11B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"770\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

These are critical days for the future of Hong Kong, with everyone scrabbling to understand the implications of the new national security law imposed by China. Our scoop this week (The Big Story) looks at the squeeze upon big US tech companies that run cloud services in the territory. The take-home message seems to be: agree to surrender client data to authorities or move cloud services offshore. </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Elsewhere, it has been a big week for Huawei in the UK \u2014 and not in a good way (Mercedes\u2019 Top 10). Meanwhile, India\u2019s ban on 59 Chinese mobile apps has driven a surge of traffic towards domestic alternatives (Best of Comment). For a counterintuitive read, check out the positive impact of Covid-19 on some tech share prices (Smart Data). And for a treat, try John Thornhill\u2019s piece on why digital nomads are migrating to Estonia (Mercedes\u2019 Top 10). Take care, as ever; until next week.</emphasis></p><p>The Big Story \u2014 Exclusive</p><p>Big US tech companies are at loggerheads with Hong Kong\u2019s financial regulator. Google, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are refusing to agree to a proposal that would involve handing over customers\u2019 banking records, a stance that may force them to move data centres out of the territory.</p><p>This <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77702487-0cec-4d88-990e-ffbcc69bf9df\"> exclusive report</url> in the Financial Times says Beijing\u2019s imposition of the new national security law for Hong Kong has hardened opposition among the US tech giants to the handing over of personal data to the Securities and Futures Commission.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key implications: </emphasis>The SFC\u2019s demands for access to banking data stored by tech companies\u2019 cloud servers have been in place since last year. But the new law has made acceding to the SFC\u2019s dictates \u201cpolitically impossible\u201d, one insider said.</p><p>Under the new law, tech company executives could face fines and even jail terms if they do not comply with orders to co-operate. If big tech companies cannot live with this \u2014 because of client privacy concerns \u2014 they may have to leave Hong Kong. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Upshot: </emphasis>The issue has broad implications. Many companies from several industries store customer data in Hong Kong-based servers. The new law jeopardises the privacy of all that data, potentially causing a mass relocation of data storage out of Hong Kong.</p><p>Mercedes\u2019 top 10</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Huawei has learnt its fate in the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UK</emphasis>, with the government announcing\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/abadf6d9-361f-40d4-a7f2-fdd734e8fdf7\"> it would be banned</url>\u00a0from supplying new equipment for 5G networks after December 31 and its existing equipment stripped from the next-generation mobile infrastructure by 2027.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Two months after Masayoshi Son suggested that he was misunderstood like\u00a0Jesus Christ, the founder of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Japan\u2019s</emphasis>SoftBank has performed at least one miracle: resurrecting its share price.

The House Financial Services Committee has drafted a Libra killer bill that bans big tech companies from launching cryptos. It's called the 'Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act.' </p><p>A draft copy of the discussion bill found its way into the hands of Ryan Todd at The Block. The anti-Libra bill bans 'large platform utilities from being a financial institution or being affiliated with a person that is a financial institution.' It does so by stipulating: 'A large platform utility may not establish, maintain, or operate a digital asset that is intended to be widely used as medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, or any other similar function, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.'The bill defines a large platform utility as any company with annual global revenues above $25 billion. Facebook revenue was $16.9 billion for Q4 2019 alone. So the Keep Big Tech out of Finance Act says Mark Zuckerberg's too big to crypto.While the bill does have teeth, it might not bite hard enough to deter Facebook. It plans to enforce the crypto prohibition on big tech with a fine of $1 million a day. Facebook might be able to make far more than that with Libra. It can just write this off as a cost of doing business. After the recent record-breaking $5 billion FTC fine for privacy violations, Facebook's market cap surged $10 billion. That made its privacy violations worth at least $5 billion.The specter of regulation looms over corporate cryptos. Even if the Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act never makes it to Trump's desk. Legislation and regulation will undoubtedly round off the edges of any corporate crypto by the time it sees the light of day. As events in this new industry play out, they continue to validate the macro-thesis underlying bitcoin and its most vociferous supporters.<br/>US Congress Drafts Libra Killer to Squash Silicon Valley Crypto Dream, CCN, Jul 17Source:FxPro<br/>MENAFN1707201901560000ID1098769876</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1098769876</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKH-2NV1-JCNX-34GV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"343\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Four of the world's most powerful people have highlighted in their opening speeches the benefits they bring to the country and argued that their need to grow steadily is precisely because of the competition they face.</p><p><br/>\"To deliver on our promises to consumers in this country, we need American workers to bring products to American consumers,\" said Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive, on his first appearance before Congress. \"China is building its own version of the Internet focused on very different ideas, and they are exporting that vision to other countries,\" said Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg at his fourth appearance.<br/>Alongside them are Also Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple, who has also argued that his is \"an American-only company whose success is only possible in this country.\" The four entrepreneurs, who testify via videoconference from their offices, star in an audience that marks a milestone in the long investigation, which accumulates dozens of interviews and hundreds of thousands of documents, conducted by the US legislature on the market position and practices of companies whose size and power has multiplied in recent years.<br/>Democrat David Cicilline, chairman of the House antitrust subcommittee, where the hearing holds, has also appealed to American essences, but if necessary to defend the need to put limits on the power of big technology. \"Our founding fathers did not bow to a king,\" he recalled in his initial speech, more than an hour late about the scheduled time. \"Nor should we bow to the emperors of the digital economy.\"<br/>Their market dominance, congressmen accuse, slows down innovation and reduces competition. The goal of committee members is to determine whether the tremendous growth of the four companies has placed them in illegal monopoly positions, eliminating competition in fields such as Internet searches (Google), online sales (Amazon), mobile app marketing (Apple) or information distribution (Facebook). \"Put simply: they have too much power,\" said Cicilline, who has advanced that his four guests on Wednesday will not like the conclusions of the investigation, which they plan to make public in the autumn.<br/>Trump's message<br/>The need to put limits on tech giants is also shared by President Trump, who has not squandered the opportunity to lash out at companies that are a regular target of his fury. In particular, social media companies, with which they wage a battle that has escalated in recent months, after Twitter and Facebook took action against their messages for violating their rules. In response, Trump issued an executive order calling for reconsidering regulation that protects Internet companies from the content they post. \"If Congress doesn't bring justice to the big tech, something they should have done years ago, I'll do it myself with executive orders.In Washington, it's been all talk and no action for years, and the people of our country are fed up with it,\" Trump has tweeted shortly before the hearing began.<br/>The president's tweet stresses that, on Wednesday, it is not only executives who undergo a review, but also Congress itself, which has been muming down for years to act against tech companies but has failed to pull any legislation into this regard.<br/>Executives argue that, despite the ubiquity image of their brands, they also face stiff competition. \"For example, people have more ways to search for information than they've ever had, and this increasingly happens outside the context of a search engine,\" said Google's Pichai.<br/>\"Companies aren't bad just because they're big,\" said Zuckerberg, who recalls that Facebook achieved its success \"in the American way, starting with nothing.\" The same idea also wanted to highlight Bezos. \"I love garage entrepreneurs, I was one of them,\" he said. \"But just as the world needs small companies, it also needs big ones.\"<br/>Possible monopolistic practices, which are at the heart of this research in Congress, are not the only aspect of the companies that have brought up the members of the subcommittee. Republican lawmakers have been quick to make their recurring complaint that tech giants systematically suppress conservative opinions. Congressman Jim Jordan, in his initial speech, has accused companies of \"trying to impact the election\" and \"censoring conservatives,\"<br/>The historic audience will serve to shape future monopolistic legislation. But no major regulatory changes are expected imminently. Therefore, its most immediate value will be to provide the public with an overview of the functioning of companies that, in addition to the scrutiny in Congress, face investigations by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-13535567</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-D161-DY1R-B0WH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"850\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Next Wednesday, the directors of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google will be questioned at a hearing on the House antitrust subcommittee.<br/>This is perhaps the most important and high-profile monopoly conversation since Microsoft's case in the 1990s. If Democrats succeed in the November election, it can also be a multi-decade turning point in US antitrust policy. Not only do they want to push more regulation of large technology groups, but a set of industries with dominant participants, such as finance and pharmaceuticals.</p><p><br/>If that happens, we'll thank Washington and the officials who challenged corporate power in their backyards for years. As a report by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) points out, they have been on \"the first line of problems that cause excessive concentration\" in the US, including food insecurity, power outages and poor broadband coverage.\"<br/>Nationally, Democrats focus on corporate concentration as a campaign issue. They go against 40 years of neoliberal thinking that measures economic success in terms of low consumer prices rather than high incomes and job security. However, long before going against monopolies became fashionable, local communities fought successfully against corporate giants for practical than ideological reasons. Those battles laid the groundwork for what can come on a federal scale.<br/>There are many examples of communities successfully waged these David-type battles against Goliath. Not only did they use state antitrust legislation, but also rules on land use, tax policy and the application of labour legislation; they often end up economically better.<br/>Some believe that policymakers should embrace creative destruction in a kind of Schumpeterian sacrifice (a concept attributed to economist Joseph Schumpeter where companies adapt to new dynamics and business models), of what will be tens of thousands of small businesses in less productive sectors such as restaurants, services and personal care.<br/>They argue that this will encourage workers to retrain and deploy to the digital economy. However, that is met with the problem that every generation of big tech companies seems to be able to do more with fewer people.<br/>Allowing certain types of small and medium-sized enterprises to break away not because they are not successful, but because they are not high-growth digital enterprises, it will be a mistake. Economists obsessed with the theory of \"efficiency\" have done so for years. They only look at a few data points in a spreadsheet and ignore how SMEs support communities in ways that large companies don't or can't.<br/>Regions with a higher proportion of SMEs have less income inequality and faster household income growth, according to research collected by ILSR. Small businesses are often integrated into a network of local and regional economic relations with other companies. This creates resilience and innovation.<br/>Research shows that industries with a mix of business sizes produce new inventions and processes at a faster pace, an argument that many executives of big tech will expose about Silicon Valley. It's that same ecosystem that helped launch generations of successful startups.<br/>It's hard to fight big groups of any kind.

Amazon boss Jeff Bezos said the world \u201cneeds large\u201d firms, while the heads of Facebook, Apple and Google argued their companies had spurred innovation.    The appearance comes as lawmakers consider tougher regulation and competition probes are underway.    Some critics want the firms broken up.    Congressman David Cicilline, a Democrat leading the congressional committee holding the hearing, said a year-long investigation by lawmakers had revealed patterns of abuse by the online platforms.    \u201cThe dominant platforms have wielded their power in destructive, harmful ways in order to expand,\u201d he said.    Critics have said the tech companies abuse their power to benefit their own products, and undercut or acquire rivals, depressing competition \u2013 and ultimately hurting the wider economy.    They say regulators charged with enforcing competition rules \u2013 known as anti-trust law in the US \u2013 have been too lax.    At the hearing, many Republicans signalled they may not be prepared to split up the firms, with one committee member saying \u201cbig is not inherently bad\u201d.    But they said they were concerned on other grounds, accusing the firms of suppressing conservative views.    \u201cI\u2019ll just cut to the chase \u2013 big tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d said Congressman Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio.    At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, much of the attention focused on Google, which lawmakers accused of having stolen content created by smaller firms, like Yelp, in order to keep users on their own website.    Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram, Amazon\u2019s treatment of sellers on its site and Apple\u2019s App store also drew attention.    Appearing by remote video, the executives defended their companies, saying their products helped smaller businesses and rejecting the idea that their size allowed them to rest on their laurels.    \u201cScrutiny is reasonable and appropriate,\u201d Apple boss Tim Cook said in prepared remarks. \u201cBut we make no concession on the facts.\u201d    \u201cIt\u2019s so competitive I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business,\u201d he later said.    In his prepared remarks, Mr Bezos said his firm faced significant competition from firms such as Walmart.    \u201cI love garage entrepreneurs \u2013 I was one. But, just like the world needs small companies, it also needs large ones. There are things small companies simply can\u2019t do,\u201d he said.    US President Donald Trump is a long-time critic of Amazon and threatened his own action on Twitter, writing: \u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders.\u201d    He also told reporters that White House officials would be watching the hearing closely.    \u201cThere\u2019s no question that what the big tech companies are doing is very bad,\u201d he said.

Facebook\u2019s acquisition of Instagram, Amazon\u2019s treatment of sellers on its site and Apple\u2019s App store also drew attention.    Appearing by remote video, the executives defended their companies, saying their products helped smaller businesses and rejecting the idea that their size allowed them to rest on their laurels.    \u201cScrutiny is reasonable and appropriate,\u201d Apple boss Tim Cook said in prepared remarks. \u201cBut we make no concession on the facts.\u201d    \u201cIt\u2019s so competitive I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business,\u201d he later said.    In his prepared remarks, Mr Bezos said his firm faced significant competition from firms such as Walmart.    \u201cI love garage entrepreneurs \u2013 I was one. But, just like the world needs small companies, it also needs large ones. There are things small companies simply can\u2019t do,\u201d he said.    US President Donald Trump is a long-time critic of Amazon and threatened his own action on Twitter, writing: \u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders.\u201d    He also told reporters that White House officials would be watching the hearing closely.    \u201cThere\u2019s no question that what the big tech companies are doing is very bad,\u201d he said.

For the last year, that panel has probed the business practices of the Silicon Valley giants with an eye to determining if they need to be regulated more heavily, or even broken up.</p><p>In nearly five hours, there were few startling revelations or striking confrontations. While the executives faced hostile questioning and frequent interruptions from lawmakers of both parties, little seemed to land more than glancing blows.</p><p>The CEOs testified via video to lawmakers, at times appearing together on the committee room display as tiny individual figures in a mostly empty array of squares. Most committee members were seated, masks on, in the hearing room in Washington.</p><p>The execs provided lots of data purporting to show how much competition they face and just how valuable their innovation and essential services are to consumers.

The...</p><p>Fending off accusations of stifling competition, four Big Tech CEOs \u2013 Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple \u2013 faced a grilling by the US House Judiciary Committee\u2019s anti-trust panel on Wednesday.    The powerful CEOs, whose companies together represent about $5 trillion of market value, parried a range of accusations from lawmakers via videoconference at a hearing that marked the first time the four appeared together before lawmakers.    It was also the first-ever appearance of Bezos before Congress.    The executives provided bursts of data showing how competitive their markets are, and the value of their innovation and essential services to consumers. But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on US democracy and their role in China.    US Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat and chair of the anti-trust subcommittee, began by accusing Google of theft.    \u201cWhy does Google steal content from honest businesses?\u201d he asked.    Cicilline accused Google of stealing reviews from the company Yelp Inc and said that Google threatened to delist the company from search results if it objected.    Pichai responded mildly that he would want to know the specifics of the accusation. \u201cWe conduct ourselves to the highest standards,\u201d he added, disagreeing with the characterisation that Google steals content from other businesses to populate its search engine and keep users on its own services.    Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.    Bezos said in his first testimony to Congress that he couldn\u2019t guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.    Regulators in the US and Europe have scrutinised Amazon\u2019s relationship with the businesses that sell on its site and whether the online shopping giant has been using data from the sellers to create its own private-label products.    \u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d Bezos said in a response to a question from US Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \u201cBut I can\u2019t guarantee to you that that policy hasn\u2019t been violated.\u201d    Pichai\u2019s opening remarks touted Google\u2019s value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island and Pewaukee, Wisconsin.    As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances that the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioned their business activities in China. \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.    In a tweet before the hearing, President Donald Trump challenged Congress to crack down on the companies, which he has accused, without evidence, of bias against him and conservatives in general.    \u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders,\u201d Trump tweeted.    Executive orders are more limited in scope than laws passed by Congress, though they too have the force of law. But presidents can\u2019t use executive orders to alter federal statutes. That takes congressional action.    Trump\u2019s Justice Department has urged Congress to roll back long-held legal protections for online platforms such as Facebook, Google and Twitter. The proposed changes would strip some of the bedrock protections that have generally shielded the companies from legal responsibility for what people post on their platforms.    The four tech CEOs command corporations with gold-plated brands, millions or even billions of customers, and a combined value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world\u2019s richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.    Critics have questioned whether the companies stifle competition and innovation, raise prices for consumers and pose a danger to society.    In its bipartisan investigation, the Judiciary subcommittee collected testimony from mid-level executives of the four firms, competitors and legal experts, and pored over more than a million internal documents from the companies. A key question: whether existing competition policies and century-old anti-trust laws are adequate for overseeing the tech giants, or if new legislation and enforcement funding are needed.    Cicilline has called the four companies monopolies, although he says breaking them up should be a last resort. While forced breakups may appear unlikely, the wide scrutiny of Big Tech points toward possible new restrictions on its power.    Cicilline also said that in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic \u201cthese giants stand to profit\u201d and become even more powerful as millions shift more of their work and commerce online.    The companies face legal and political offensives on multiplying fronts, from Congress, the Trump administration, federal and state regulators and European watchdogs. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have been investigating the four companies\u2019 practices. \u2013 AP.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42718151340</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-45N1-F07F-81TW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"933\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>CitizenNG.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC000CY6C</classCode><className>YELP!

Sporting a suit and tie, Zuckerberg also fended off aggressive questions on election interference, free speech, hate groups, and fake news from members of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. Representative Maxine Waters[2], the panel's fiery Democratic chair, quizzed Zuckerberg on Facebook's steps to combat misinformation and voter suppression ahead of the November 2020 U.S. presidential election[3]. She also suggested policymakers should consider breaking up Facebook. </p><p>Waters had previously called for halting the Libra project before its planned 2020 launch, and has drafted legislation that would bar tech companies from entering financial services. 'It would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the Libra project,' Waters told Zuckerberg two days after Facebook disclosed it had removed a network of Russian accounts targeting U.S. voters on its Instagram platform.Bipartisan criticismRepublican and Democratic lawmakers alike blasted Facebook for failing to crack down on online child exploitation and political misinformation, and for data privacy lapses. Several said they did not trust Facebook to help provide financial services to its 2.4 billion users given the past scandals[4]. 'Facebook's internal model was for a long time was 'Move fast and break things.' Mr. Zuckerberg, we do not want to break the international monetary system,' said Representative Nydia Velazquez, a Democrat. Zuckerberg said Facebook would insist on U.S. regulatory approval before launching Libra, which is being established by a Switzerland-based consortium including venture capital firms and nonprofits. He said Facebook would even leave the Libra Association[5] if other companies sought to launch the currency without that sign-off. Libra has faltered in recent weeks amid sustained criticism from lawmakers and regulators globally over fears it may aid money laundering and upend the global financial system. Several financial partners including Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, and eBay have abandoned the project[6].  Representative Ann Wagner, a Republican, pressed Zuckerberg on why so many companies abandoned the Libra effort. 'You've lost these stable partners and I find it highly concerning,' she said. 'Why do a number of these founding members have concerns of whether you're up to the task of meeting our money laundering and regulatory standards?' The 35-year old Facebook CEO conceded that those companies dropped out because Libra is a 'risky project' and that he was not sure it would even work. During his testimony, the price of bitcoin versus the U.S. dollar tumbled to a five-month low.Facebook has 'work to do'Calm and composed, Zuckerberg navigated the hostile room without major slip-ups and was even afforded a gentle rib by Democratic Representative Katie Porter, who complimented him on his short haircut. The CEO last appeared before Congress in April 2018 when he fielded 10 hours of questions over two days from House and Senate panels on political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica's misuse of Facebook customer data[7] to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. On Wednesday, he acknowledged Facebook's mistakes, saying he understood the social media giant was not the 'ideal messenger' for the Libra project and that the company has 'work to do to build trust.' But he said past missteps should not stand in the way of Libra, based in Switzerland. 'The vision here is to make it so that people can send money to each other as easily and cheaply as it is sending a text message.' Zuckerberg was unable though to make material commitments on behalf of Libra because Facebook no longer controls the project, sometimes to the frustration of lawmakers. On October 14, the Libra Association comprising 21 members agreed articles of association laying out how the organization will be governed[8], as required by Swiss law. Most decisions will require a majority vote of the group's governing council, meaning Facebook will not call the shots. Lawmakers also touched on other hot button issues, including diversity, inclusion, and charges brought by the housing regulator in March, still pending, alleging Facebook violated fair lending laws. Representative Joyce Beatty, a Democrat, hammered Zuckerberg, saying she viewed Facebook's efforts to address civil rights abuses as insufficient, calling them 'appalling and disgusting.' Some Republicans did offer support for Zuckerberg and the Libra project, arguing the government should not stop the private sector from innovating. 'I have my own qualms about Facebook and Libra and the shortcomings of Big Tech,' said Representative Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the panel. 'But if history has taught us anything, it's better to be on the side of American innovation' [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/18/facebook-announces-libra-cryptocurrency-and-calibra-digital-wallet/\">https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/18/facebook-announces-libra-cryptocurrency-and-calibra-digital-wallet/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/18/facebooks-libra-cryptocurrency-faces-privacy-concerns-and-political-backlash/\">https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/18/facebooks-libra-cryptocurrency-faces-privacy-concerns-and-political-backlash/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/tag/2020-elections/\">https://venturebeat.com/tag/2020-elections/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/24/facebook-beats-q1-2019-profit-estimates-sets-aside-3-billion-for-privacy-penalty/\">https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/24/facebook-beats-q1-2019-profit-estimates-sets-aside-3-billion-for-privacy-penalty/</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/27/libra-association-launches-bug-bounty-program/\">https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/27/libra-association-launches-bug-bounty-program/</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/11/ebay-stripe-mastercard-and-visa-leave-facebooks-libra-association/\">https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/11/ebay-stripe-mastercard-and-visa-leave-facebooks-libra-association/</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/2018/04/04/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-needs-to-take-full-responsibility-for-how-people-are-using-our-tools/\">https://venturebeat.com/2018/04/04/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-needs-to-take-full-responsibility-for-how-people-are-using-our-tools/</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/14/facebooks-libra-shrugs-off-defections-as-it-announces-5-member-board/\">https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/14/facebooks-libra-shrugs-off-defections-as-it-announces-5-member-board/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-VNTR1079881571887548985258765300196</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VNTR-6695</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBR-47H1-JCMN-Y0GF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1029\"/><timeReceived>3:25 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>VentureBeat</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 24, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>US HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The United States Congressional lawmakers grilled the CEOs of Big Tech over their dominance and allegations of monopolistic practices that stifle competition. Legislators questioned Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple at a hearing of the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.   For the last year, that panel has probed the business practices of the Silicon Valley giants with an eye to determining if they need to be regulated more heavily, or even broken up.   In nearly five hours of testimony and questioning, however, there were few startling revelations or striking confrontations. The CEOs testified via video to lawmakers, at times appearing together on the committee room display as tiny individual figures in a mostly empty array of squares. Most committee members were seated, masks on, in the hearing room in Washington.   The execs provided lots of data purporting to show how much competition they face and just how valuable their innovation and essential services are to consumers. But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China.   The panel's chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, said each platform controlled by Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple \u201cis a bottleneck for a key channel of distribution.\u201d \u201cWhether they control access to information or to a marketplace, these platforms have the incentive and ability to exploit this power,\u201d he said.   \u201cThey can charge exorbitant fees, impose oppressive contracts, and extract valuable data from the people and businesses that rely on them.\u201d \u201cSimply put: They have too much power.\u201d   The four CEOs command corporations whose products are woven into the fabric of everyday life, with millions or even billions of customers, and a combined market value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world's richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.   Also read:  Big Tech antitrust hearing | CEOs of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon to testify today: All you need to know   And they had a few rough moments. Pichai and Zuckerberg, for instance, appeared discomfited when pressed about unsavoury aspects of their companies' businesses but got respites when their inquisitors ran out of time. Bezos also acknowledged that alleged misdeeds at Amazon \u2014 such as reports that the company has used data generated by independent sellers on its platform to compete against them \u2014 would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d if proven to be true.   Outside observers were able to draw radically different conclusions from the event. Richard Hamilton Jr., a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer, said that everyone on the committee seemed to be in agreement on the need for tougher regulation of all four companies \u2014 an \u201cominous\u201d sign, he said. But Stephen Beck, CEO of the management consulting firm cg42, said the tech companies and their brands emerged relatively unscathed.   In particular, he said, Cook was particularly polished and well prepared, enabling the Apple CEO to put on what Beck called \"a master class in terms of how to handle these situations.\u201d Cook drew less attention from lawmakers than did the other CEOs after arguing that Apple isn't dominant in any of its markets.   Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.   Bezos, who was appearing before Congress for the first time, said he couldn't guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.   \u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d Bezos said in a response to a question from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \u201cBut I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.\u201d   Pichai deployed an old Washington trick \u2014 appealing to the specific interests of legislators. In his opening remarks, he touted Google's value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island, and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, which just happen to be located in the home districts of Cicilline and Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the panel's senior Republican.   But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.   Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline's attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft's Bing.  As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances, claiming the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioning their business activities in China. \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d insisted Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42718848811</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-FV31-F07F-80C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"953\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Moneycontrol.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The United States Congressional lawmakers grilled the CEOs of Big Tech over their dominance and allegations of monopolistic practices that stifle competition. Legislators questioned Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple at a hearing of the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust.   For the last year, that panel has probed the business practices of the Silicon Valley giants with an eye to determining if they need to be regulated more heavily, or even broken up.   In nearly five hours of testimony and questioning, however, there were few startling revelations or striking confrontations. The CEOs testified via video to lawmakers, at times appearing together on the committee room display as tiny individual figures in a mostly empty array of squares. Most committee members were seated, masks on, in the hearing room in Washington.   The execs provided lots of data purporting to show how much competition they face and just how valuable their innovation and essential services are to consumers. But they sometimes struggled to answer pointed questions about their business practices. They also confronted a range of other concerns about alleged political bias, their effect on U.S. democracy and their role in China.   The panel's chairman, Rep. David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, said each platform controlled by Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple \u201cis a bottleneck for a key channel of distribution.\u201d \u201cWhether they control access to information or to a marketplace, these platforms have the incentive and ability to exploit this power,\u201d he said.   \u201cThey can charge exorbitant fees, impose oppressive contracts, and extract valuable data from the people and businesses that rely on them.\u201d \u201cSimply put: They have too much power.\u201d   The four CEOs command corporations whose products are woven into the fabric of everyday life, with millions or even billions of customers, and a combined market value greater than the entire German economy. One of them, Bezos, is the world's richest individual; Zuckerberg is the fourth-ranked billionaire.

Pichai and Zuckerberg, for instance, appeared discomfited when pressed about unsavoury aspects of their companies' businesses but got respites when their inquisitors ran out of time. Bezos also acknowledged that alleged misdeeds at Amazon \u2014 such as reports that the company has used data generated by independent sellers on its platform to compete against them \u2014 would be \u201cunacceptable\u201d if proven to be true.   Outside observers were able to draw radically different conclusions from the event. Richard Hamilton Jr., a former Justice Department antitrust lawyer, said that everyone on the committee seemed to be in agreement on the need for tougher regulation of all four companies \u2014 an \u201cominous\u201d sign, he said. But Stephen Beck, CEO of the management consulting firm cg42, said the tech companies and their brands emerged relatively unscathed.   In particular, he said, Cook was particularly polished and well prepared, enabling the Apple CEO to put on what Beck called \"a master class in terms of how to handle these situations.\u201d Cook drew less attention from lawmakers than did the other CEOs after arguing that Apple isn't dominant in any of its markets.   Among the toughest questions for Google and Amazon involved accusations that they used their dominant platforms to scoop up data about competitors in a way that gave them an unfair advantage.   Bezos, who was appearing before Congress for the first time, said he couldn't guarantee that the company had not accessed seller data to make competing products, an allegation that the company and its executives have previously denied.   \u201cWe have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private label business,\u201d Bezos said in a response to a question from Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat. \u201cBut I can't guarantee to you that that policy hasn't been violated.\u201d   Pichai deployed an old Washington trick \u2014 appealing to the specific interests of legislators. In his opening remarks, he touted Google's value to mom-and-pop businesses in Bristol, Rhode Island, and Pewaukee, Wisconsin, which just happen to be located in the home districts of Cicilline and Rep. James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, the panel's senior Republican.   But the Google executive struggled as Cicilline accused the company of leveraging its dominant search engine to steal ideas and information from other websites and manipulating its results to drive people to its own digital services to boost its profits.   Pichai repeatedly deflected Cicilline's attacks by asserting that Google tries to provide the most helpful and relevant information to the hundreds of millions of people who use its search engine each day in an effort to keep them coming back instead of defecting to a rival service, such as Microsoft's Bing.  As Democrats largely focused on market competition, several Republicans aired longstanding grievances, claiming the tech companies are censoring conservative voices and questioning their business activities in China. \u201cBig Tech is out to get conservatives,\u201d insisted Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42718366423</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-4671-JCSC-J24M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"953\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Moneycontrol.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I want a government that's here to work for the people.\"<br/>Amazon abruptly scrapped plans in February to build a major outpost in the neighbourhood that could have created 25,000 jobs, blaming opposition from local leaders.<br/> In an event held not far from the proposed Amazon site, Warren said that big tech companies come into towns, cities and states and \"bully everyone into doing what they want\" and \"roll right over\" small businesses and startups that are a threat.<br/> \"Giants are not allowed to buy out the competition. The competition needs the opportunity to thrive and grow,\" she said.<br/> Some of those in attendance said they didn't know enough about Warren's proposal to back it fully but they trusted her policy expertise.<br/> \"What I like is that she's proposing big ideas. I think that's important,\" said lawyer Kate Aufses, 32, who said she was undecided about which Democratic candidate she would support.<br/> Earlier in the day, Warren said in a post on Medium that she would nominate regulators to unwind acquisitions such as Facebook's deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's deals for Whole Foods and Zappos, and Google's purchases of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.<br/> Shares of Facebook closed up 0.3 percent on Friday, while Alphabet's Google fell 0.08 percent and Amazon.com lost 0.3 percent.<br/> Warren also proposed legislation that would require tech companies like Google and Amazon that offer an online marketplace or exchange to refrain from competing on their own platform. This would, for example, forbid Amazon from selling on its Amazon Marketplace platform.<br/>Amazon and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Facebook declined to comment.<br/> It is rare for the government to seek to undo a consummated deal. The most famous case in recent memory is the government's effort to break up Microsoft. The Justice Department won a preliminary victory in 2000 but was reversed on appeal. The case settled with Microsoft intact.<br/> An Archaic Idea<br/> US Congress held a series of hearings last year looking at the dominance of major tech companies and their role in displacing or swallowing up existing businesses, among other things.<br/>Amazon's business model has displaced brick-and-mortar stores and the company has been criticized for poorly paying its warehouse workers.<br/>Facebook has angered lawmakers for losing track of users' data and for not doing more to stop foreign meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.<br/>Google has clashed with smaller companies, like Yelp, over search placements and has raised concerns it would comply with China's internet censorship and surveillance policies if it re-enters the Asian nation's search engine market.<br/> NetChoice, an e-commerce trade group whose members include Facebook and Google, said Warren's plan would lead to higher prices.<br/> \"Senator Warren is wrong in her assertion that tech markets lack competition. Never before have consumers and workers had more access to goods, services and opportunities online,\" said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel for NetChoice.<br/> In Washington, the president of the US Chamber of Commerce, Tom Donohue, said breaking up the big tech companies would \"take us back to the Stone Age.\"<br/> \"This is not a vision for the future, but an archaic idea that should be dumped in your computer trash can,\" he said.<br/> Public Knowledge, a tech policy group, called Warren's plan a step toward protecting the next generation of businesses but stopped short of full-throated support for breaking up the tech giants.<br/> Tim Wu, a professor of law, science and technology at Columbia Law School who coined the term \"net neutrality\" and has warned against an economy dominated by a few giant firms, said in a tweet that it was \"heartening\" to see the idea of breaking up the tech giants gaining some traction.<br/> Tech companies are some of the biggest political donors. Google spent $21 million to lobby in 2018 while Amazon spent $14.2 million and Facebook spent $12.62 million, according to their filings to US Congress.<br/> Angering a deep-pocketed industry could hurt Democrats, but that is not likely to be a big concern for Warren, who made her political mark and plenty of enemies by going after big banks after the 2007-09 financial crisis. In the Senate, Warren continues to be an outspoken critic of Wall Street and is a leader of her party's progressive wing.<br/> Other Democratic candidates have also weighed in on the issue.<br/> Senator Amy Klobuchar used her campaign launch speech to vow action on digital issues like privacy, saying \"big tech companies\" misuse personal data.<br/> Senator Bernie Sanders in 2018 even named a bill after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the Stop BEZOS Act, which would tax big companies if their employees receive public benefits.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10933927</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VS6-NF11-JBYT-H3SW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"891\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 28, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

'The anti-conservative bias, the pattern we see from big tech is concerning,' said Senator Ted Cruz, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution. Technology companies are 'a black box that simply says trust us,' he said. </p><p> Cruz floated using anti-trust regulation against the largest technology companies, while noting that such a process would be complicated.   Mazie Hirono, the top Democrat on the committee, shot back denouncing the 'baseless allegations' and saying that the real concerns were about false information spreading online, such as anti-vaccination videos and hate speech.   Carlos Monje, the director of public policy at Twitter, told lawmakers that the platform does not engage in any policies that target conservatives. He noted that nearly all politicians in the Congress use Twitter.  He said allegations of bias stem from misunderstandings about how Twitter's algorithms operate, while noting that mistakes are made.   'Twitter wouldn't be Twitter if everyone had the same viewpoint,' Monje said.   'Facebook does not favour one political viewpoint over another,' said Neil Potts, the public policy chief at the social media giant.   He said political content was reviewed in a 'neutral' manner, while trying to ensure the safety of users and allowing a 'diversity of viewpoints.'   More than one billion posts are made daily to Facebook, Potts noted, while Monje said Twitter sees about 500 million.   Google, which owns YouTube, was asked to attend the hearing, but, according to Cruz, the company refused.
